            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was just send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the
last sheets of
the ensuing
plain discourse to the
Press, when the news
<pb facs="tcp:109534:3"/>
came of your being made
Bishop of this Diocess:
I was exceedingly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with the tidings
of so great a blessing
befaln <hi>this</hi> part of the
Church, and could not
restrain my joy from
running out into this
Application &amp; Address,
which I intend not so
much to <hi>congratulate</hi>
your new <hi>Dignity,</hi> as
the <hi>happiness</hi> of <hi>Us,</hi>
your <hi>Clergy,</hi> and this
<pb facs="tcp:109534:3"/>
whole People, in the
relation we now have to
so excellent a person.
Your Lordships <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
justice, piety,</hi>
and <hi>diligence</hi> have
made themselves so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
in the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
happy, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
Government of
one of the most famous
Vniversities of the
world, that we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
promise our
selves great felicities
<pb facs="tcp:109534:4"/>
from the <hi>Paternal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi>
of such an <hi>experienced
Governour;</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
man, who is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the advantages
of good order, but bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>
for so <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable</hi>
an <hi>Election.</hi>
This, My Lord, I
might speak upon the
<hi>publick</hi> Fame of your
known merits, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb facs="tcp:109534:4"/>
               <hi>that</hi> I have had
<hi>particular</hi> experience of
your <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi>
which gives me
a greater passion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the veneration I
have for you; and I wish
I could do it in a way
sutable to your great
worth, and mine own
resentments of it; but
instead of a <hi>proper</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
I must beg your
Lordship to accept of a
<hi>sincere</hi> one; and <hi>such</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109534:5"/>
I here make you in this
small offering, the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>First-fruits</hi> of your
Diocess.</p>
            <p>The Discourse I first
design'd only for the use
of my own people, but I
knew not how to get
<hi>transcribed</hi> Copies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for them; and I
consider'd too many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
needed some such
exhortation, as well as
those of my <hi>particular
Charge,</hi> and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:109534:5"/>
thought that this little
Essay might not be
wholly <hi>useless</hi> to the
Publick. I have writ it
in a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
style, because I judg
<hi>such</hi> most fit for <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
matters, especially
in applications to the
<hi>populace;</hi> and take it
for an <hi>establisht, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rule</hi> for such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
whether by
<hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>writing,</hi>
that they should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:109534:6"/>
in the way that
is most <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi>
and nothing ought
to be <hi>studied</hi> in the
<hi>language</hi> for <hi>such</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but how to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
the matter most
<hi>sutably</hi> and <hi>plainly.</hi>
But I need not have
made this Apologie to
your Lordship, who
know, That <hi>good sense</hi>
in an <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>proper</hi>
phrase is for ever the
<hi>truest</hi> and <hi>best elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109534:6"/>
There is more
cause I should crave
your pardon for prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Lordships name
before a discourse of so
many <hi>other</hi> imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>This,</hi> my Lord, I
do, and have this to
plead for the obtaining
it, that I was <hi>transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
by the <hi>occasion</hi> and
the desire I have to
make known how happy
I esteem <hi>this Diocess</hi>
in so <hi>venerable</hi> a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109534:7"/>

               <p>ALthough <hi>We</hi> of the publick
Ministry cannot expect to
do <hi>much</hi> by our perswasions,
and indeavours, in such an Age
as <hi>this;</hi> Yet we ought to persevere
in our work with Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and not suffer our selves
to be overborn by any difficulties,
or discouragements what soever:
For Duty belongs to us, but events
unto God, who will reward the
Labourers whatever be the success
of their Labours. And as every
Minister of Religion ought to be
active, and resolved in the <hi>work</hi>
and <hi>patience</hi> of the Gospel; So he
shall then best acquit himself in it
when he studies the <hi>proper needs</hi> of
the Age, and place wherein he lives,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109534:8"/>
and accordingly directs his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to provide for them. Now
there is nothing, that I know,
that is wanted more in our Days,
than a due sense of the necessity,
and advantages of the Holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
neglect, not to say contempt
of which, hath, I am persuaded,
been a great and sad occasion of
the debauchery, and divisions that
are amongst us; And I verily think,
that there could not be a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
means to reduce us to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi>
and <hi>Vnion,</hi> then a frequent,
and reverend use of that divine
Iustitution. From this persuasion
I have earnestly, and often (as you
can bear me witness) press'd this
great duty upon your consciences,
and affectionately recommended it
to your practice. I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
its <hi>Nature</hi> with all possible
<hi>plainness,</hi> and urged its <hi>Necessity</hi> with
a <hi>vigour</hi> in some measure suitable
to so great an occasion; I have
told you the <hi>danger</hi> of wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109534:8"/>
on the one hand; and the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
of due performance, on the
other; But notwithstanding all,
there are too many of you, that seem
yet insensible, and unconcerned. I
have publickly desired those that
are either <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>dissatisfied,</hi> to
accept of my private help, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and have offer'd them the
utmost of my assistance for their
better information, and direction.
And after all this, I know not
what I can do more to serve you
in this great interest of yours, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I put something into your
hands that may be ever with you,
and that you may consider on all
occasions. <hi>Publick Teachings</hi> by
word of mouth, are too much
looked upon as <hi>customary exercises,</hi>
and on that account, they loose
their force with <hi>some;</hi> and the
greatest part even of the better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
cannot keep their minds so
close, and intent, to a Discourse
<hi>spoken,</hi> as to receive it in its full
evidence, and power; or though
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109534:9"/>
the hearers are never so diligent,
and careful, our words are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
quickly, and the affections that
they raise, vanish without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
effect upon their wills.
For which Reasons, I have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this Course, to cast some
of the plain things I have preach'd
concerning the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
writing; That those who are
unfit for that great duty by reason
of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> may have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest
means of Instruction that I
can provide for them, always in
their power, and when they please,
before their eyes: And that those
that <hi>deprive</hi> themselves of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of this most excellent Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
by reason of the <hi>Mistakes</hi>
of their erring understandings:
may also have the most suitable
help I can give, towards the setting
their minds right, and the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
them to their Priviledge, and
Duty.</p>
               <p>For these purposes, I shall (as
my manner is) represent what I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109534:9"/>
have to say in the most <hi>distinct,</hi>
and <hi>easie</hi> way I can contrive, avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all things that are <hi>hard,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>notion</hi> or <hi>expression;</hi> And
strive, as near as is possible, to speak
all along to the most ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
For I look upon
<hi>plainness</hi> as the best dress for Truth;
and my great care, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
constantly is, to be <hi>understood</hi>
by <hi>all,</hi> as far as the subject will
bear.</p>
               <p>In the pursuit of what I intend
I mean, by Gods help, to proceed
in this order. (1) I shall discourse
with all convenient brevity, and
plainness, the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of
the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> and</p>
               <p>(2) Give the General <hi>Reasons</hi>
to inforce the Duty; under which
head, I shall apply my self to two
sorts of Refusers, <hi>viz.</hi> Those that
neglect (1) on the account of pure
<hi>carelesness,</hi> and <hi>stupidity,</hi> and (2)
Those that stand off upon the score
of <hi>mistakes</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi> In treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the former, I shall shew
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109534:10"/>
that their obstinate refusal takes off
all pretence they can have to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and puts them into the
state of Infidels, and Heathens, yea
into a <hi>worse</hi> condition, than <hi>that
of meer unbelievers.</hi> As to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>dissatisfied</hi> in
<hi>Conscience,</hi> I shall consider their
<hi>Reasons against Communicating</hi> with
us according to the way of our
Church, and shew that they are
no <hi>justifiable grounds,</hi> why they
should refuse to join with us in
that solemn part of Christian
worship.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109534:10"/>
                  <hi>Wars,</hi> with a vast heap of mischiefs,
and calamities to the Christian
world: I shall not therefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with any thing of needless
controversie, or notion, on this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
but state it so far only, as
it relates to <hi>practice;</hi> And I shall
take all I have to say about it from
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the best Rule to
guid us in the Enquiry. And if
<hi>disputing</hi> men would have been
content with <hi>its</hi> declarations in
this matter, all the trouble, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
had been avoided. But this
hath been the misery; some go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their thoughts of this Holy
Institution by corrupt, and <hi>novel
Traditions,</hi> and others by meer
vain and <hi>arbitrary phancies;</hi> Yea,
Those who have been right in the
main, have yet so mingled the plain
truth with <hi>allusions,</hi> and spoken of
it in such a <hi>phantastical,</hi> and <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
way, that ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
have been confounded,
and those that are for down-right
sence, without the mixtures of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109534:11"/>
imagination, have not been able to
tell what to make of <hi>that,</hi> which
they heard described in such a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and various fashion. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
hath been my own case;
I had heard men preach so humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely,
and so diversly about the
<hi>Sacrament;</hi> So <hi>much</hi> out of
their <hi>own</hi> heads, and so <hi>little</hi> out
of the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> That I was
quite bewildred, and lost, and
come at last to that pass, that I
<hi>knew nothing</hi> at all of it; which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
and confusion of thoughts
was the natural effect of such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
For when men once ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the way of <hi>phrases, metaphors,</hi>
and <hi>conceits,</hi> as they loose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so they perfectly dazzle, and
amaze those others, whom they
should instruct. I therefore betook
my self to the <hi>plain expressions</hi> of
<hi>Scripture</hi> concerning this matter;
In <hi>them</hi> I found an easie account in
the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of this divine
<hi>Ordinance.</hi> And whither shall we
go to enquire after it but to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109534:11"/>
words of <hi>Institution</hi> themselves?
<hi>These</hi> I shall consider <hi>first;</hi> and then
gather together those other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Scripture, which tend to
the further explication of it.</p>
               <p>1. The words of Institution are
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. [<hi>Take, Eat, This is my
Body.</hi> v. 26. <hi>and Drink ye all of it.
For this is my bloud of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
v. 27. 28.] To which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke</hi> [Do
this in Remembrance of me.] <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 19. These words I shall seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
explain, and then infer from
them what is the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>design</hi>
of the holy appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take, Eat, This is my
Body</hi>—and, <hi>This is my
Bloud</hi>—Here I take notice,
That <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> do
not relate to the <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>wine;</hi>
But to the <hi>actions, Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi>
as appears plainly in the<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>this wine,</hi> are my <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi>
but <hi>this Sacramental eating and
drinking</hi> of it; In <hi>this</hi> Christs <hi>body</hi>
and <hi>bloud,</hi> viz His <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
and <hi>sufferings</hi> are represented to
us. And yet by a Figure, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Elements may be call'd his
<hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> also; so the <hi>Form</hi>
at the eating the <hi>paschal Supper</hi>
was, <hi>This is the bread of affliction
which our Fathers did eat in Egypt;</hi>
Not the very same, but a <hi>Memorial</hi>
of it, and the State of bondage
from which they were deliver'd.
Thus 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 3, 4. <hi>Manna</hi> is
called <hi>spiritual bread,</hi> and the <hi>Rock,
spiritual drink,</hi> and that <hi>Rock,
Christ:</hi> Not that they could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be so in the Letter, but they
<hi>signified that spiritual</hi> food, and
were tokens of Christs Prefence.
And thus the <hi>Sacramental Bread,</hi>
and <hi>Wine</hi> may be call'd his <hi>Body</hi>
and <hi>Bloud,</hi> that is, <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations</hi>
of them: and that, not
<hi>barely</hi> of his <hi>sufferings,</hi> but (as the<note n="*" place="bottom">Basil.</note> Father notes) of all the Misteries
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109534:12"/>
of the Incarnation, which are <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,</hi>

the Elements were call'd, <hi>Figures,
Symbols, Images, sensible things</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>spiritual,</hi> and we know 'tis
in common use to call the <hi>Picture</hi>
by the name of that it represents,
as <hi>this is a man,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> an <hi>Angel.</hi>
So that there is no ground for the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> in
these words, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
pretends. But I wave disputes,
and come to the next expression to
be consider'd.</p>

That <hi>The Sacrament
of the Lords Supper
is a</hi> Memorial Feast
<hi>appointed for a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Remembrance
of Christ our Lord;
and a</hi> Seal <hi>of the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<hi>that God
hath made with us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109534:14"/>
in him.</hi> Two things then
it is principally designed for, (1)
To <hi>Remember</hi> us of our Lord, and
Saviour, and (2) to be a <hi>Seal</hi> of
the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; of each
briefly.</p>
               <p>(1) 'Tis for a Remembrance, not
<hi>only</hi> of his Person, or <hi>only</hi> of his
<hi>Sufferings,</hi> or any other particular
part of his Ministry; But we are
by it required <hi>thankfully,</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately</hi>
to call to mind, <hi>All</hi> that
he hath <hi>done,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that he hath
<hi>suffer'd;</hi> His <hi>Life, Doctrine,</hi> and
<hi>Laws;</hi> His <hi>Passion, Resurrection,</hi>
and <hi>Ascension;</hi> His <hi>Victory</hi> over <hi>Sin,
Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> and the <hi>gracious
Covenant</hi> that God hath made with
us through him: <hi>These</hi> are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> (as
I intimated before) of which the
Holy Sacrament is a <hi>Sign,</hi> and
<hi>Memorial:</hi> And the remembrance
of <hi>these,</hi> which we are call'd to by
the <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> is not <hi>only</hi>
some <hi>slight,</hi> and <hi>passing</hi> thoughts,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109534:14"/>
but a <hi>solemn</hi> and most <hi>serious</hi> fixing
of them upon our minds, in order
to the inflaming our affections
with love, and our wills with reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
that we may live answerably
to that excellent Religion of the
Holy Jesus which we profess.</p>
               <p>(2) 'Tis the <hi>Seal</hi> of a <hi>Covenant</hi>
[<hi>The new Testament in my bloud</hi>]
The <hi>Covenant</hi> is, That God will
give <hi>pardon</hi> of Sin, and eternal
<hi>Life,</hi> upon the conditions of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance.</hi> This <hi>He seals</hi> to
us in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and assures
us, that he, for <hi>his</hi> part, will make
good <hi>his Promises,</hi> and we on <hi>ours,
seal,</hi> that we will endeavour to
perform the <hi>conditions.</hi> So that
the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is a <hi>Sacrament</hi>
by which we <hi>confirm</hi> those ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we are entred into at <hi>Baptism.
Then</hi> our <hi>Sureties</hi> undertook for us,
that we should be faithful in the
Convenant, and in <hi>this</hi> holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
we take all those obligations
upon <hi>our selves,</hi> and in our <hi>own</hi>
persons promise to act according to
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:109534:15"/>
This plainly, and in short, is the
<hi>nature</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi>
concerning which, there
are some other expressions in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which I shall consider briefly,
in order to the further explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the sacred Mystery. The
chief are <hi>these.</hi> 'Tis called (1) The
<hi>Cup of blessing. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 16. 2)
The <hi>communion of the Body, and
Bloud of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16 and

<hi>viz.</hi> (1) <hi>Declare</hi> unto <hi>men,</hi> with

passages fall under the Account I
have before given of the Ordinance,
and shew <hi>how</hi> we are to <hi>Remember</hi>
our Lord in it, and <hi>what</hi> we may
expect in so doing.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly of the <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>design</hi> of the Sacrament, I might
have run the matter into a large
Discourse, but I resolve all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
brevity. In what I have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109534:16"/>
said, you will find all things that
are <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;</hi>
For the <hi>niceties</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes</hi>
that are about it, you need
not trouble your selves with them;
But so <hi>much</hi> of it as I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
(I mean in the substance of
the particulars) 'tis fit you should
know: And therefore I intreat
you, especially those of the more
ordinary understandings, to return
back, and fix your thoughts a while
upon those periods, and read them
over and again, till you have <hi>a
clear,</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> apprehension of
the Subject they explain. I know
the thoughts of most are very <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,</hi>
and much in the <hi>dark</hi> about
it, and while they are <hi>so,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
demean themselves as they
ought in the performance of the
Duty, nor receive those benefits
that otherwise they might from it.
I beseech you therefore not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your selves with a <hi>single,</hi> and
<hi>running</hi> reading; Many Divine
Truths will not enter into our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109534:17"/>
minds at <hi>first</hi> sight; or, if they do,
they are gone, as soon as they are
received: Though they are never
so <hi>plainly</hi> exprest, yet they many
times <hi>seem dark,</hi> till we look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
Or though they strike our
minds fully, yet they pass out of
Memory, except we reflect, and
think them over; I hope therefore
you will do your selves this right;
And I thus urge you to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of my accounts, not as if
I fancied I had made any <hi>discoveries</hi>
in them, which were not made
before (No, <hi>These</hi> are known things
among the Intelligent sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
But I do it, because I speak
to the <hi>meaner,</hi> and <hi>less improved</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
And perhaps from
the Representation of the affair
which I have given, the <hi>others</hi> also
may receive the advantage of a
clearer order, and method to their
thoughts, and be deliver'd from
many <hi>unnecessary</hi> and <hi>uncertain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that they have imagined to
be of great consequence to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109534:17"/>

they are not <hi>true,</hi> or not <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>

things that commonly oblige men

And there are <hi>both</hi> here, in the

so many of such services
from us, as would have taken
up <hi>all</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> and imployed <hi>all</hi>
our <hi>strength,</hi> and wearied <hi>all</hi> our
<hi>powers;</hi> Yet these we ought to have
observed without <hi>repining,</hi> and
thought all but <hi>small</hi> homage to his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109534:18"/>
Greatness, and small acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Love. <hi>All these</hi> had
been <hi>nothing</hi> in compare with what
he hath done for us <hi>freely</hi> without
merit, or obligation; <hi>Nothing,</hi> to
his leaving the bosome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the glories of the upper
world, and the Hallelujahs of the
blessed; <hi>Nothing,</hi> to his descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a world of Infamy, and woe;
<hi>Nothing</hi> to his suffering the scorns
and contradictions of Sinners, the
Death of the Cross, and the wrath
of God: So that we had been
wretchedly ungrateful should we
have stuck at any of <hi>these,</hi> or as
much as <hi>murmured</hi> at them: But
our Lord hath not given us any
such tryal of our Love, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
He hath deliver'd the
world from the Yoke of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
bondage, And (besides <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>)
hath appointed but <hi>this one
Rite</hi> for us to observe; A <hi>Rite,</hi> that
is neither <hi>troublesome,</hi> nor <hi>costly, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi>
nor <hi>laborious.</hi> And what
Prodigies of baseness shall we make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109534:19"/>
our selves, if we refuse to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this his <hi>gracious</hi> Institution?
With what face can we look up
and call our selves by his name?
How shamefully are we upbraided
by the practice of <hi>those</hi> we count
<hi>barbarous?</hi> Let us look abroad into
the world and consider the most
<hi>brutish Idolaters; They</hi> will <hi>cut</hi>
their beloved <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> their
dearest children, and sometimes,
suffer themselves to be <hi>crush'd to
death</hi> by the Carriages that bear
their <hi>Idols,</hi> because their <hi>Infernal</hi>
Gods require, and are pleased
with such testimonies of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
Hath the <hi>Devil</hi> such <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious</hi>
servants? Are those <hi>Cruel
Rites,</hi> whch he appoints, observed
with so much duty; Will those
poor wretches do, and suffer any
thing rather than displease their
<hi>ugly Deities?</hi> And are <hi>we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
Professing</hi> Servants of the <hi>Son</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
and do we neglect <hi>this</hi> his
<hi>main, just,</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> appointment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109534:19"/>
Is <hi>this</hi> too much to do for him? and
do we owe him so much <hi>less</hi> than
<hi>Cannibals</hi> do their <hi>Idols?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those men of the <hi>Desart,</hi> those
<hi>wild Savages</hi> of the Woods shall rise
up in <hi>judgement</hi> with such a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of pretending Christians, and
shall condemn it. Methinks <hi>their</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and exactness in those hard
and painful services, should cover us
with blushing and confusion at our
carelesness and neglect of the easie
duty our Lord requires from us:
And we shall see great reason to be
ashamed of our omissions, if we
consider, that our blessed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
had lived a Life of <hi>poverty</hi> and
<hi>dishonour</hi> for our sakes; He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
us in the way of Happiness
by his excellent <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;</hi>
and had gone before us in
an incomparable <hi>example;</hi> and now
he was just about to <hi>compleat</hi> his
Love, by <hi>offering</hi> himself unto <hi>death</hi>
to deliver us from <hi>it,</hi> and thereby
to give an instance of the most ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
goodness that ever was; At
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109534:20"/>
                  <hi>this</hi> time, he injoines his Disciples
to <hi>do</hi> something in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of
Him. And <hi>Lord! What</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to be done in <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>such</hi>
Love? Had he required the <hi>dearest</hi>
of our bloud, and the <hi>choicest</hi> of
our substance to be offer'd to him
in acknowledgment, should we
have thought <hi>such</hi> demands <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable?</hi>
Would ordinary ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have scrupled to make those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for such kindness? But he
calls not for <hi>these.</hi> He looks for no
<hi>First</hi>-born of our <hi>bodies,</hi> nor <hi>chief</hi>
of our <hi>Flocks;</hi> No, He appoints on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>feast</hi> of <hi>Memorials,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to <hi>remember</hi> his Love in
<hi>that:</hi> And shall we not observe
him in so small a matter? Hath he
not <hi>deserv'd</hi> to be <hi>remembred</hi> by us?
or do we know any <hi>better</hi> way, to
signifie our remembrance of him,
then <hi>that</hi> which himself hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed?
Should we not do as much
as <hi>this,</hi> at the request of an <hi>ordinary</hi>
dying Friend? And is not the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,</hi>
and the <hi>best</hi> that ever creatures
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109534:20"/>
had, worthy of such a testimony
of affection from us? I am sure
there is no one can be so brutish as
to deny the <hi>justness</hi> of the <hi>Duty,</hi>
and methinks none should be so
unworthy as to refuse complyance
with it. I beseech you therefore,
if the <hi>Considerations</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi> can do
any thing with you; If there be
any <hi>obligation</hi> in the highest <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
if there be any <hi>allurement</hi> in
the sweetest <hi>love,</hi> If your <hi>profession</hi>
of subjection to Christ be not only a
<hi>Complement,</hi> and if he have any real
interest in your Souls; give this
proof then, of your <hi>being</hi> in <hi>earnest,
that,</hi> which you would be <hi>thought,</hi>
Refuse no more of his Invitations;
Neglect no more of his calls; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>expresness</hi> of his command,
and that <hi>this</hi> Law is <hi>peculiarly his;
His</hi> in such a sence as (<hi>Baptism</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<hi>no other Law is.</hi> For his
<hi>other</hi> injunctions are but <hi>enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the Laws that God had
written in the old Scriptures, and
in our hearts, But this is his own
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109534:21"/>
proper commandment; by obeying
him in <hi>this,</hi> we particularly own
him as our <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
we <hi>renounce</hi> him.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>considerations</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi>
should not prove so powerful with
you; there are <hi>others</hi> which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
use to be of more force, namely
<hi>those</hi> taken from our <hi>interest.</hi> And
here</p>
               <p>(II) I desire you to consider the
great <hi>benefits</hi> that a worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
receives from the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
<hi>This</hi> is not a meer barren
Ceremony, or unprofitable Rite,
but an instrument and means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and to convey unspeakable
blessings to us. Here we receive</p>
               <p>(1) <hi>Confirmation</hi> of our <hi>Faith:</hi>
All habits are increas'd by being
exercised, and this Ordinance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
great <hi>exercises</hi> of the grace
of Faith: For here we make a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
declaration of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bind it stronger upon our souls.
And to the exercise of this Divine
Grace, and the sincere and publick
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109534:21"/>
profession of it, there is no doubt
but God will superadd his special
aid and blessing, that out of <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it may be made strong.</hi> So
that if your Faith be <hi>weake</hi> and
<hi>trembling,</hi> if you are perplext with
vexatious doubts, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to unbelief, apply your selves
to this holy Ordinance as to the
proper remedy. <hi>Declare</hi> your Faith,
and <hi>pray</hi> for more. If you <hi>believe,</hi>
God will help your <hi>unbelief,</hi> Mark
9. 24.</p>
               <p>(2) Our <hi>Repentance</hi> will be height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our Due Communicating at
the Lords Table, and that in respect
of all its great Acts, <hi>viz. 1. Sence</hi> and
<hi>Sorrow</hi> for Sin; 2. <hi>Confession</hi> of its
and 3. <hi>Aversation</hi> from it. For the
First,</p>
               <p>(1.) The <hi>evil</hi> of Sin is never so
well discerned as in its <hi>effects.</hi> It is
<hi>sweet</hi> in the <hi>mouth,</hi> but <hi>bitter</hi> in the
<hi>belly;</hi> And there is no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of its vileness and malignity,
then <hi>that</hi> we have in the sufferings
of our Lord, which are set before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109534:22"/>
us in the Holy Sacrament. And
certainly sin must needs be an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed</hi>
thing (saith the considering
Communicant) That the blessed
Jesus must thus be made a <hi>Curse</hi> for
it; That is doubtless a mighty evil,
that cannot be expiated but by the
bloud of God; And Sin, without
question, hath unspeakable malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in it, since it laid such a load
of wrath upon the shoulders of
Omnipotence, as made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
and sweat, and groan, and
die. The good man hath never
such a sence of the evil of sin, as
when he is awakened by the <hi>signs</hi>
and <hi>images</hi> of Christs <hi>Sufferings,</hi>
and when he sees it writ in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
of <hi>Bloud.</hi> Besides, the <hi>base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>ingratitude</hi> of Sin is made
evident in all the representations of
the Divine Love, which we have at
the Lords Table; We see <hi>there,</hi>
that it is an abuse of the greatest,
and most tender Goodness; and
there is nothing that more affects
ingenuous Souls, than the sence of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109534:22"/>
such unworthiness, and this will
beget the <hi>liveliest,</hi> and most <hi>kindly</hi>
sorrow. <hi>They shall look on me whom
they have pierced, and they shall
mourn. Zech.</hi> 12. 10. The <hi>tenderest</hi>
grief ariseth from the apprehension
of <hi>abused Goodness;</hi> And the more
ingenuous Spirits are sooner
brought to be troubled for their
sins, by a sence of <hi>Mercy,</hi> than of
Terrors. Now there is nothing
that gives a truer, or greater repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of Divine Grace and
Kindness than the Holy Sacrament,
and therefore <hi>this</hi> is a very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
means to beget and increase a
<hi>penitential sence,</hi> and sorrow for
sin. And upon this</p>
               <p>(2) Follows <hi>Confession,</hi> which
is one expression of <hi>these.</hi> The
apprehension of an Angry Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
drives a sinner to desperation,
and prevents his Confession. When
the Lord ask'd the man in the
Gospel with some severity, <hi>How
camest thou hither, not having a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
garment,</hi> he was <hi>speechless.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:109534:23"/>
Terrors beget stupifying fear, which
stops the mouth, and damns up
all the passages to and from the
soul; whereas the discoveries of
goodness and mercy open the heart,
and melt the seal upon the lips;
They invite Supplications, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
Confessions; and therefore the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is a <hi>memorial</hi> of
the greatest, sweetest, and freest mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
tends in the nature of it to the
producing humble confessions and
acknowledgements; and it doth it
likewise.</p>
               <p>(3) As to the <hi>Aversation</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
by the same way. The top
and perfection of Repentance, is,
to <hi>turn</hi> from our <hi>evil wayes.</hi> God
invites his People to <hi>this,</hi> by the
Argument that is most powerfully
press'd upon us in the Sacrament,
namely, <hi>That</hi> of his <hi>pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and kindness. <hi>Return thou back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding
Israel—and I will not
cause mine anger to fall upon you,
Ier.</hi> 3. 12. His readiness to pardon
is the great motive to return, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109534:23"/>
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the <hi>Seal</hi> of the
<hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Pardon.</hi> Despair of
Mercy keeps men on in a sinful
course. <hi>Thou sayest there is no hope,</hi>
say they in the Prophet <hi>Ierem.</hi>
2. 25. They thought their case
desperate, and it follows, <hi>I
have loved strangers, and after them
will I go.</hi> The Devils persist irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimably
in their hatred of God
and Goodness, because the unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sentence is past upon them;
And if men come once to quit their
hopes of Happiness, they will also
in a short time quit the thoughts
of God and Virtue, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to the swinge of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
and Inclinations. Whereas
on the other side, <hi>Hope</hi> is the great
Encouragement and Spring of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
and where <hi>this</hi> is enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>quick</hi> sence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Goodness, that Soul will
feel a <hi>mighty Motive</hi> to reform and
turn from sin. Now the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is the <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>that Covenant</hi>
which assures us of Grace, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109534:24"/>
pardon, and the firmest ground of
our best hopes, and most glorious
expectations. Thus the Grace of
<hi>Repentance</hi> receives increase in <hi>all</hi>
its <hi>exercises,</hi> from this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
and so doth</p>
               <p>(3) That other most excellent
Grace, <hi>Love,</hi> both as it relates 1.
to God, and 2. to our Neighbour.
(1) In the Holy Sacrament the
Mysteries of Divine Love are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
in all their circumstances
of wonder. There we see <hi>pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
redeeming, bleeding, dying,</hi> Love.
Love, suffering for all our sakes;
and Love, procuring all things
for our interests. Love descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Grave, and Hell; and
Love triumphing over both; Love
leading <hi>Captivity captive,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>gifts for men,</hi> Light, Life,
and a glorious Immortality. <hi>Such</hi>
Love, and Love <hi>beyond</hi> what we
can say and <hi>beyond</hi> what we can
think, is represented at the <hi>Holy
Sacrament;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> must needs
fire every soul, that is not as cold
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109534:24"/>
as the earth, and as dead as the
Grave. Love begets Love, and
one flame kindles another. And
if we think of this Love, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it as we ought when we come
to the entertainment of Love, this
would excite our affections, and
turn our Souls into holy flames,
and so our <hi>dead</hi> Powers will <hi>live,</hi>
and our <hi>dull</hi> sleepy affections will
<hi>awake</hi> into new spirit, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.
We shall live by Love, and
act by Love, till we are received
into the nearest embraces of Love,
and swallowed up in that immense
ocean of Love. Now <hi>Love</hi> is the
<hi>best,</hi> and most pleasing of all our
<hi>passions?</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> is the
<hi>best,</hi> and most pleasant of all <hi>Loves;</hi>
A <hi>Love</hi> free from those tortures, and
disquiets, that shame, and those
griefs, that are produced by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and uncertainties, loss and
guilt, when <hi>this passion</hi> is placed
upon other objects. This Love is
the Fountain of Delight, and the
spring of Action; that swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109534:25"/>
our troubles, and stirs up
our endeavours, that makes duty
agreeable, and difficulties easie,
that is a <hi>present</hi> Heaven, and the
foretast of a <hi>greater.</hi> This also
(2) Tends to the encreasing our
Love one to another. It is a <hi>Feast</hi>
of <hi>Love</hi> to our <hi>Fathers House,</hi> and
our <hi>Lords Table;</hi> The <hi>Guests</hi> are
<hi>Brethren,</hi> and professing <hi>Children</hi>
of <hi>Love.</hi> Here are all the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to love set before us; The
<hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and his express
Commandment <hi>job.</hi> 13. 34. The
<hi>Relations</hi> we stand in to God, and
to one another. We cannot well
choose but <hi>pity</hi> our Brothers <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
and <hi>pardon</hi> each others
<hi>faults,</hi> when we see how much God
hath pityed our <hi>miseries,</hi> and how
graciously he hath <hi>pardoned</hi> our <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</hi>
Our animosities will be
abated, and our thoughts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and revenge will die. Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differences
will be kindness, and
our kindness Love; when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the inexpressible Love of our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109534:25"/>
common Lord, and the blessed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of that Love; <hi>Reconciliation</hi>
made, <hi>Happiness</hi> procur'd, and <hi>Sin,</hi>
and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> conquer'd: A
sence of <hi>these,</hi> will swallow up all
our little picques, and displeasures,
and so fill us with the thoughts
of Gratitude, and Love; That we
shall forget our enmities, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
our enemies, and shed abroad
our kindness upon all about us, yea
and extend it to all the world in
<hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>good wishes.</hi> And
now, This <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> is a
most <hi>divine temper,</hi> and a great
happiness: 'Tis a <hi>sweet, serene,</hi> and
<hi>pleasant</hi> thing, a reward to it self,
if there were no other: Whereas
<hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of them, are an hell and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Soul, they are great sins
and their own punishment; And a
right use of the holy Sacrament will
abate, and remove <hi>these,</hi> and therein
also administer blessed and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantages to us.</p>
               <p>(4) Our <hi>Hopes</hi> are nobly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109534:26"/>
and strengthened by this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.
When the good man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
the <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>perfection</hi> of his <hi>Law;</hi>
and then takes a view of his own
<hi>sinfulness,</hi> and innumerable <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi>
His Spirits fail, and his
hope is giving up the Ghost; he
sinks into trouble, and <hi>almost</hi> into
the regions of despair: Now all
the relief that a man can have in
such a state, is to be drawn from
Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> to <hi>pardon sin,</hi> and
to accept of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi>
instead of <hi>perfection.</hi> This is the
Tenour of the Gospel, and the
foundation of our hopes; and <hi>this
Covenant</hi> is <hi>sealed</hi> and assured to us
at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> so that <hi>thence</hi>
the <hi>fainting</hi> Soul may derive life,
and quickning. And when the
drooping Christian comes from
seeing God putting his <hi>Seal</hi> to his
<hi>pardon,</hi> and to the <hi>promises</hi> made
him of eternal Life; His hopes
recover, and his spirits return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; His Soul leaps for joy,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109534:26"/>
and all his powers are full of
content, and pleasure: And over
and above <hi>this,</hi> God is pleased at
<hi>such</hi> times <hi>especially,</hi> to vouchsafe
more abundant <hi>manifestations</hi> of
<hi>himself</hi> to the Soul, <hi>sealing</hi> his love
upon it, and giving it so much assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as may deliver it from its
unreasonable doubts and suspicions,
and make it in part partaker of our
Masters joy. But this will be a
particular by it self. Therefore</p>
               <p>(5) The <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> is an
excellent means to heighten a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Comfort.</hi> For <hi>there</hi>
we are in a <hi>special</hi> exercise of our
<hi>Graces,</hi> and by <hi>them</hi> are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi>
for <hi>Divine peace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
That <hi>peace of God which
passeth all understanding, Phil.</hi> 4. 7.
and <hi>this</hi> is something <hi>more</hi> than <hi>that</hi>
content that naturally ariseth upon,
and results from the Actions of
holiness and vertue; and is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
by the nearer applications of
the Spirit of God to the Soul;
This pleasure and satisfaction God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109534:27"/>
is always willing to bestow upon
us, but we by our sins indispose
our selves for it, and it is not to
be given but to <hi>prepared Souls;</hi>
And now according to the <hi>greater,</hi>
or <hi>less degrees</hi> of our <hi>preparations,</hi>
and exercise of our graces, we
shall have <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>less</hi> of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
joy, and satisfaction in our
Communions. But besides the joy
which is <hi>special,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi>
The Ordinance in its own nature
tends to <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> We
had raised storms, and tempests
by our sins, and provoked him
whom we can neither resist, nor
avoid; His Countenance was full
of dread and terrours, and Death
and Hell stood ready for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to seize upon us: And must
it not needs fill those with joy and
transport, that were just now in
this dreadful state, when they shall
see the Heavens cleared, and the
storms gone; to behold smiles and
love in the face of the offended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
to be assured that he is <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:109534:27"/>
and his Arms are open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us; That <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are
<hi>destroyed,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi>
procured for us? All these are set
before us in the holy Sacrament,
and did we use it as we ought, our
souls would be transported with
joy, and we should have a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
foretaste of the happiness and
triumphs of the Blessed; and all our
Lives would be <hi>Anthems</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi>
and acclamation to the adorable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and procurer of our Blessings,
And this</p>
               <p>(6) Is another happy advantage
we derive, or may do, from the
holy Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> That it height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
and spirits our <hi>Gratitude</hi> and
<hi>Praises.</hi> Praise and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Divine favours, are all
the return we can make for them;
and we are to offer up these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for our selves, and all the
other creatures: But the <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of our mercies takes away the
<hi>sense</hi> of them; and we pass them
over with <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>customary</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109534:28"/>
This ordinarily
is our course, and 'tis a very disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and ungrateful carriage to
the bountiful Author of our beings,
and blessings: But now at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, <hi>Divine favours</hi> are
<hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>solemnly</hi> represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
our remembrance awakened,
and our affections excited; and
the devout Soul pours it self forth
into holy Eucharist, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
The <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>full,</hi> and the
<hi>mouth flows:</hi> All the powers rejoyce,
and rejoycing breaks forth into
Songs of Praise: And so <hi>begin</hi> that
blessed imployment, which shall be
the work and happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Thus we shall receive increase
to our <hi>Graces,</hi> and our <hi>Comforts,</hi>
from the frequent, and due use of
the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and all <hi>other
spiritual</hi> advantages are containd
under <hi>these.</hi> And as <hi>by</hi> these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
we may <hi>incourage</hi> our selves
to our duty, so <hi>in</hi> them likewise
we may see how we are to <hi>demean</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:109534:28"/>
our selves in the discharge of it:
<hi>what acts</hi> we are to exercise, and
by <hi>what considerations</hi> we may stir
up our <hi>graces,</hi> inflame our <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and strengthen our <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Benefits</hi> that I have
represented to incourage and invite
you to the <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern the <hi>thorough,</hi> and <hi>grown
Christian,</hi> but even <hi>all</hi> that own the
profession of Christs Religion, and
have not renounc'd their <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
ingagements</hi> by <hi>leudness,</hi>
and <hi>impiety;</hi> For such have <hi>some
degrees</hi> of <hi>Faith, Love, Repentance,</hi>
and other vertues; But the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is, that <hi>these,</hi> in the most,
are very low, imperfect and in a
degree that will not secure their
condition: <hi>These graces</hi> must be
advanced to <hi>nobler measures,</hi> and to
<hi>such degrees,</hi> as may <hi>prevail</hi> over
the <hi>contrary habits,</hi> and <hi>dispositions;</hi>
Till the matter comes to <hi>this,</hi> we
are under the <hi>Law</hi> and a <hi>spirit</hi> of
<hi>bondage;</hi> in a condition of <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:109534:29"/>
and <hi>weakness,</hi> and not arrived
to the <hi>glorious Liberty</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of
the <hi>Sons of God: This,</hi> all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Christian Faith and Hopes,
ought to aim at, and indeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the most
<hi>proper</hi> and <hi>likely means</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
of our imperfect Graces to
that noble height. So that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christians are concerned in
the duty, and capable of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
And to all those that have <hi>such</hi>
thoughts, and <hi>such</hi> desires, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations</hi>
I have presented will be
of moment. But for the rest that
are <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>unconcerned, dead</hi> to
such <hi>spiritual</hi> Motives, and <hi>stupidly
careless</hi> of the <hi>duty,</hi> and the <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
that attend it; They are <hi>not
Christians,</hi> but do as much as in
them lies, to renounce their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to put themselves into
the condition of Heathens and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Infidels. This is that I come
next to discourse.</p>
               <p>After all my perswasions, and
most earnest endeavours, I have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109534:29"/>
too much cause to think that some
among you neglect the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
not for any <hi>reason</hi> that they
have, or can as much as <hi>pretend;</hi>
but from meer <hi>brutish stupidity</hi> and
<hi>unconcernment.</hi> They <hi>care not for
these things.</hi> The <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and another world can do <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
with them; <hi>such considerations</hi>
are not <hi>felt,</hi> but past over their
Souls without making any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
on them. And now, as for
<hi>such,</hi> I come to shew, That they
<hi>disclaim Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi>
and are by no means to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the number of <hi>Christians.</hi>
This I prove by the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>First, They renounce a main
Article of the <hi>Creed, viz.</hi> The
<hi>Communion</hi> of Saints, their
<hi>Communion</hi> with (1) <hi>Christ,</hi> and
their Communion with (2) <hi>one
another.</hi> (1) Christ invites us to
his Table, and prepares a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
entertainment for us; and in
<hi>that</hi> there is a <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>special
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109534:30"/>
intercourse</hi> between <hi>him,</hi> and his
<hi>Church;</hi> which on <hi>our part</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the <hi>exercise</hi> of our <hi>Graces;</hi>
and on <hi>his,</hi> in the <hi>benefits,</hi> and
<hi>blessings</hi> he bestows. He invites
us to come and to meet him <hi>there</hi>
to injoy spiritual correspondence,
and communion with him: And
now, <hi>wilfully</hi> to refuse the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
is to signifie our <hi>contempt</hi> of
the holy Jesus, and so declare that
we care not for any nearness of
correspondence with him. And
such neglectors in effect say, that
they love the converse and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their vain, and vitious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
That they can spend their
time <hi>pleasantly</hi> in <hi>their</hi> conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon an Ale bench, or place
of idleness, or debauches: But for
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> they <hi>like</hi> not <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
and care not for any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of acquaintance with him.
This is the direct language of such
practices, and neglects, and what
kind of <hi>Christians</hi> are <hi>such</hi> as <hi>these?</hi>
(2) They renounce the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:109534:30"/>
of <hi>Saints one among another.</hi> The
holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and <hi>Christian Love,</hi> and <hi>there</hi>
our affections are united to God,
and to our brethren. <hi>There</hi> we
profess to be of <hi>one Body, one
Society,</hi> and to be all <hi>members one
of another.</hi> So that those who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and refuse this holy <hi>Symbol</hi>
of Love; break off from the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
of <hi>Christians,</hi> and declare
they will have nothing to do
with them, as far as they are
concerned in that name, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That they will not be of the
flock, and number that Christ calls
<hi>his;</hi> but would rather have their
lot with the world, and herd of
mankind, who are strangers to
the <hi>Covenant of Promise, without
hope, and without God in the world.
Eph.</hi> 2. 12. That they value not
<hi>their priviledges,</hi> nor care for their
<hi>hopes.</hi> This is the meaning of their
neglect, and <hi>such</hi> Christians are
the wilful refusers.</p>
               <p>(2) They renounce their <hi>Baptism.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109534:31"/>
This</hi> is the Sacrament of <hi>entrance</hi>
into <hi>Christianity,</hi> and <hi>here ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are laid upon us <hi>without</hi>
our knowledge or consent. At
the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
we <hi>solemnly engage,</hi> and <hi>take</hi>
those <hi>obligations</hi> upon <hi>our selves.</hi> If
we refuse to do <hi>this,</hi> we <hi>withdraw</hi>
our <hi>consent</hi> from what was done in
our stead; we make our <hi>Baptisme</hi>
void, and put our selves into the
state of Infidels and Heathens. The
<hi>Indians</hi> were by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Baptism in droves, like Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
to the water, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it meant, or what they
did in it: were <hi>these</hi> Christians by
virtue of such a Baptism? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
is there any reason to think
<hi>those</hi> of them such, who as soon as
they were free, made open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
against it. And are <hi>those</hi>
among us <hi>Christians,</hi> who were
<hi>signed</hi> with that <hi>Religion</hi> when they
could not <hi>help</hi> it? and <hi>profess</hi> against
it by their actions and neglects,
as soon as they are in <hi>capacity</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:109534:31"/>
to do it? who <hi>disown</hi> it, when they
are <hi>solemnly</hi> called to put their <hi>seal,</hi>
and to declare their allowance and
approbation? Their <hi>sureties</hi> inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for them that they should <hi>believe</hi>
the Christian <hi>Faith; keep</hi> God's
<hi>Commandments,</hi> and <hi>renounce</hi> the
<hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi>
But say <hi>these</hi> by their practise, what
had <hi>they</hi> to do to undertake such
things for us; we will stand to no
such ingagements: we are call'd
on to make this good our selves in
person at the other Sacrament, or
by our neglects to declare it void:
but we will not tie our selves, or
own any such ingagements on us;
we will leave our selves at large to
believe what we please, and to
practise what we phancy, and to
gratifie and worship, as long as we
think fit, the World, the Devil, and
the Flesh, our friends, and dearest
correspondents. All this likewise
is plainly signified in the neglect
of the holy Sacrament; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
certainly such are no better
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109534:32"/>
Christians than the wild men of
<hi>America:</hi> which will further appear
if we consider.</p>
               <p>(3.) That by it they <hi>deny</hi> the
very <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi>
They will not as much as <hi>claim,</hi>
nor <hi>pretend</hi> to him, in any <hi>solemn,
significant</hi> way. To <hi>say</hi> that we are
<hi>Christians,</hi> and now and then to
<hi>hear a Sermon, these</hi> are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<hi>enough:</hi> They are but <hi>cold</hi>
declarations of our <hi>opinion;</hi> no
good significations of our <hi>Faith.</hi>
The <hi>right profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is
made, by our presenting our selves
at the Lords Table, and owning
our <hi>Faith there;</hi> that is a <hi>solemn</hi> and
<hi>publique</hi> confession and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.
To <hi>hear Sermons</hi> is too
often but <hi>curiosity</hi> or <hi>custom;</hi> to <hi>say</hi>
we are of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> is
but a declaring in what way we
have been brought up; and meer
<hi>education-Faith</hi> is but a <hi>faint, unsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying</hi>
thing; It is but <hi>opinion</hi> and
a <hi>low degree</hi> of assent. 'Tis true,
a man may be a <hi>Formalist</hi> and an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109534:32"/>
                  <hi>Hypocrite</hi> when he comes to the
Lords Table, as well as in other
lower significations of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But however, he makes a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
and <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>proper</hi> and
<hi>solemn:</hi> whereas the <hi>wilfully negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
refuse to make any due confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ and his Religion.
They openly <hi>deny him before men,
and such he will deny before his Father
which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 10. 33. To
<hi>withdraw</hi> from the <hi>profession</hi> of
<hi>Christianity</hi> in times of <hi>difficulty</hi>
and <hi>persecution</hi> is a great sin; but
'tis <hi>such</hi> a one as admits of some
<hi>extenuation</hi> from the <hi>frailty</hi> of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature,</hi> and the <hi>temptations</hi> of
<hi>fear</hi> and <hi>self love;</hi> But to <hi>deny</hi> the
<hi>profession</hi> of Christ in times of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
and <hi>incouragement,</hi> this is an
<hi>affront</hi> to the <hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> for which
there is no <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>excuse,</hi> and
must arise from <hi>contempt,</hi> and a
confest <hi>neglect</hi> of him. <hi>Such</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
publish to the world, that they
own <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> but count
it a disparagement to be thought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109534:33"/>
any way concern'd for it. And so
are by no means to be accounted
Christians. Further,</p>
               <p>(4.) Their refusal and neglect is
a quitting and renouncing the <hi>whole
Covenant</hi> that God hath made with
sinners in his Son. The <hi>Covenant</hi>
on <hi>Gods part</hi> offers <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi>
and on <hi>ours,</hi> it binds to <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>sincere obedience.</hi> We are called to
the Sacrament to see God <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
what he hath promised, and
assuring us to make good what
concerns <hi>him:</hi> On the otherside,
we are to present our selves <hi>there,</hi>
to profess our readiness and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to perform <hi>our part,</hi> to keep
the terms to which we are ingaged,
and upon which we expect the
promised blessings. Now if we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
refuse this <hi>Confirmation,</hi> we
withdraw our selves from the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
and declare that Grace and
Glory are things that we neither
<hi>care for</hi> nor <hi>expect;</hi> and that we
will not tie our selves to any <hi>faith</hi>
or <hi>homage;</hi> but would be as free as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109534:33"/>
we can, to follow the <hi>Devil</hi> and our
<hi>Lusts:</hi> and so are far off from being.

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>I Have thus briefly shewn you
what is <hi>signified</hi> and <hi>implyed</hi>
in the <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Many of you that are guilty
of <hi>this</hi> sin, would I supposed be loath
<hi>openly,</hi> and in <hi>words,</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi>
Christ and his Religion, and yet
while you continue in this obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
dangerous neglect, you <hi>do it,</hi>
as <hi>fully</hi> as if your tongues declared
against that name and profession.
And I think when any such as <hi>these</hi>
turn <hi>Papists, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Iews,</hi> they
do but change to <hi>some</hi> shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
from <hi>none</hi> at all. So that it is
no <hi>real</hi> disparagement, or loss to
our Church, when those Infidels
declare in <hi>words,</hi> what before they
sufficiently signified by their <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109534:34"/>
They go out from us, because
they were never of us, 1 Iohn</hi> 2. 19.
They do not <hi>change</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi>
for they had never <hi>any</hi> before
which they might exchange.</p>
               <p>This, Sirs, in serious truth, is the
condition of <hi>those</hi> that <hi>wilfully</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
and neglect the Duty of <hi>Holy
Communion:</hi> And me thinks it
should make <hi>such</hi> tremble to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they live in a <hi>profest</hi> and
<hi>impudent</hi> contempt of God. You
pity <hi>Heathens,</hi> and ignorant <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans;</hi>
but there is work enough
for your pity at home, and <hi>their</hi>
condition certainly is not worse,
than the condition of those careless
negligent sinners among our selves.
Yea, the Apostle tells us, That 'tis
<hi>better never to have known the way
of truth, than after we have known
it to turn away from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 21. and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
saith, <hi>It shall be more tolerable
for the dark Tyre and Sidon,</hi> at judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than for the <hi>inlightned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum</hi>
and <hi>Bethsaida, Matt.</hi> 11. 22.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109534:34"/>
We think <hi>their</hi> condition dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that say, <hi>there is no God,</hi> and no
doubt it is <hi>so:</hi> And certainly <hi>their</hi>
state is not <hi>less</hi> deplorable, That
acknowledge <hi>there is a God,</hi> but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
him, and carry the matter <hi>so,</hi> as
if in good <hi>earnest</hi> there were <hi>no
such being.</hi> To live at large without
the ferious profession of <hi>some Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
is <hi>brutish,</hi> and <hi>unnatural;</hi> And
those <hi>Savages</hi> that do <hi>so,</hi> deserve
not to continue in the societies of
<hi>men,</hi> but are fitter to range among
the wild beasts of the woods. And
<hi>such</hi> are those among us, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make any solemn profession of
<hi>any Religion,</hi> by <hi>any act</hi> of their
<hi>own.</hi> They have <hi>no</hi> Religion, but
<hi>that</hi> of their <hi>Climate,</hi> which they
neither understand, nor mind;
they are <hi>Christians</hi> by the <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of <hi>others (viz.</hi> the <hi>general profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of their <hi>Country</hi>) or they are
<hi>none</hi> at all; and if they live and die
in <hi>this</hi> condition, <hi>wild men</hi> and
<hi>Cannibals</hi> will at the last be in a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
state than <hi>they.</hi>

And now, Sirs, <hi>Reason</hi> for this
<hi>carelesness</hi> and <hi>dangerous neglect,</hi> I
am sure you have none; Nor do
the sort I am now dealing with,
pretend <hi>Scruples</hi> of <hi>Conscience;</hi> But
yet some <hi>Excuses</hi> there are, which
you <hi>know</hi> are but <hi>vain,</hi> that you
use upon occasion to take off the
edge of reproof, and to seem to
justifie your selves by them in the
sight of men.</p>
               <p>Thus they that were invited to
the <hi>Supper</hi> in the <hi>Parable, Like</hi> 14.
18. made <hi>excuses,</hi> One had <hi>bought
ground,</hi> and he must <hi>see</hi> it; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
had <hi>bought Oxen,</hi> and he must
<hi>try them;</hi> and a third, had <hi>married
a Wife,</hi> and <hi>could not come. None</hi>
of these <hi>pretences</hi> had any good
reason in them; they were <hi>some
thing to say,</hi> and had a little <hi>colour,</hi>
but they were not the <hi>causes</hi> of
their not coming to the <hi>Supper,</hi>
No, the <hi>true ground</hi> was their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
of the <hi>Master,</hi> and his <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi>
and therefore <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 3.
'tis said, They <hi>would not</hi> come;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109534:35"/>
Their <hi>excuses</hi> were looked on, as <hi>flat
denyals,</hi> and the reason is given
after: It was not their <hi>Ground,</hi>
nor their <hi>Oxen,</hi> nor their <hi>Marriage;</hi>
but their <hi>disesteem</hi> of the Lord, and
his Feast, <hi>They made light of it, v.</hi> 5.
But though these excuses were not
<hi>good,</hi> yet they had something <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
in them: 'Twas <hi>business,</hi> and
<hi>considerable</hi> occasions that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd:
and <hi>such</hi> affairs they <hi>really</hi>
had, for 'tis said in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
that <hi>they went their way, one to
his Farm,</hi> and <hi>another to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise;</hi>
so that there was <hi>something
true</hi> in their <hi>pleas,</hi> though the <hi>main
thing</hi> for which they were brought
was <hi>false.</hi> But now, if they had sent
word, that the <hi>Lord's house</hi> was so
<hi>far off,</hi> that they were not <hi>able</hi> to
go to it, though really it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
some few furlongs of their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
dwellings, and not further than
the <hi>Markets,</hi> which they constantly
frequented: There had been more
<hi>folly</hi> in <hi>this</hi> excuse. If they had
said, that there was not <hi>room</hi> for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109534:36"/>
them all in the <hi>Lord's House,</hi> when
they knew, that it was never <hi>full</hi>
on <hi>such</hi> occasions, and that a great
part of those that were invited,
would not come, so that they were
sure to find too many empty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
the excuse would have been
interpreted as a <hi>mockery,</hi> and a
<hi>scoff</hi> at the invitation. If they
had told the Messengers, that
they would not come, except
they had each of them a <hi>Chair</hi> and
<hi>Cushion</hi> provided for him, and
might sit in <hi>state</hi> and <hi>ease</hi> at the
Entertainment, this had been
<hi>greater</hi> arrogance than appears in
<hi>those</hi> Refusers. If they had sent the
Lord word, that they would not
feast with him, at <hi>such,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> of
his Houses, that were <hi>appointed,</hi>
and were most <hi>convenient</hi> for their
reception; but they would have it
<hi>here,</hi> or <hi>there;</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and <hi>next</hi>
door; in places much less fit: <hi>This</hi>
would have been a very <hi>humersome</hi>
and very <hi>rude</hi> answer to the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
If further they had said,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109534:36"/>
that the Feast began too <hi>soon,</hi> and
that they could not <hi>rise so early,</hi>
though the Sun was up many
hours before, and they were abroad
<hi>every day earlier</hi> about their <hi>other</hi>
business; This also had been an
<hi>affront</hi> to the <hi>Master,</hi> and a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
to his <hi>kindness.</hi> But if these
<hi>surly, unworthy</hi> people should have
been <hi>humour'd</hi> in <hi>all particulars,</hi>
and things should have been <hi>so</hi>
managed, as to have avoided all
<hi>these</hi> pretences: And yet if after
<hi>such</hi> condescention they should have
refused, they had <hi>confuted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
and given the <hi>lye</hi> to their
<hi>excuses:</hi> But, if notwithstanding
all <hi>this,</hi> they should have cried out
that they were <hi>perishing</hi> for <hi>want</hi> of
<hi>bread;</hi> and clamour'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
heavily that provision was
not made for them; what could
have been said to such an <hi>impudent,
brazen'd</hi> sort of <hi>Hypocrites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sirs, there are <hi>some</hi> among you
that understand what I mean: I
speak not thus out of <hi>ill will</hi> to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109534:37"/>
upbraid any of you, but I ought to
<hi>mind</hi> you, and to endeavour to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
you of your sins. What ever
<hi>colours</hi> the <hi>guilty</hi> may set upon their
neglects, and contempts of <hi>Holy</hi>
Ordinances, before <hi>men, God</hi> will
not be <hi>deceiv'd,</hi> or <hi>mock'd;</hi> there is
no putting <hi>tricks</hi> upon him. If you
<hi>will</hi> not be <hi>perswaded</hi> to your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>reason,</hi> and 'tis in
<hi>vain</hi> to make <hi>false flourishes,</hi> and
<hi>excuses.</hi> Yea, some mens <hi>pretences</hi>
are so <hi>openly untrue,</hi> and <hi>gross,</hi> that
they cannot as much as hope to
<hi>deceive men</hi> by them. Every one
<hi>sees</hi> the <hi>falsehood,</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> of their
allegations; all their <hi>actions</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
that they do not themselves
<hi>belive,</hi> or <hi>mean</hi> any thing that they
<hi>say;</hi> and yet they have the <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
impudence</hi> to <hi>lye</hi> on in the
face of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> and
<hi>men.</hi> So <hi>seared,</hi> and <hi>hardned</hi> are
some in their <hi>perversness</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi>
and act at <hi>that rate,</hi> as if it
were a <hi>play-game,</hi> and <hi>sport</hi> of wit
to show how <hi>many wayes</hi> they had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109534:37"/>
to evade their duty, with some
<hi>shew</hi> of reason. Sirs, when this <hi>vile
sort</hi> of evil men have the forehead
to <hi>pretend Religion,</hi> they become the
most <hi>mischievous miscreants</hi> upon
earth; and the <hi>fittest</hi> Instruments
that Sathan can desire or use for
the affairs of his Kingdom. But
no more of them now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> I am exceeding trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to see how <hi>undutifull</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>
and how <hi>unkind</hi> to <hi>themselves,</hi> how
<hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> many men
are, when they seek for <hi>little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
to pretend, as <hi>reasons</hi> against
the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>important</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
when <hi>that</hi> which would <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
nothing else,</hi> shall <hi>excuse</hi> them
unto <hi>God</hi> for a <hi>neglect</hi> of his <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
in the <hi>greatest</hi> Instances of it:
An <hi>aking finger,</hi> a few Drops of
<hi>rain,</hi> the <hi>cold Air,</hi> a Fit of <hi>Drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
an impertinent <hi>visit,</hi> or <hi>such</hi>
like trifles, are enough to be pleaded
for <hi>absence</hi> from the House of God,
and Holy Communion with him.
My wife was not at home, or she
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109534:38"/>
was busie, my Childs head aked,
or I had friends to dine with me,
therefore I <hi>could not</hi> be at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
Therefore I <hi>could not!</hi>
For shame false man! offer <hi>such</hi>
excuses to thy <hi>Master,</hi> or thy <hi>Prince,</hi>
when he commands, and expects
thine attendance, see how he will
take them from thee: yea offer <hi>such</hi>
but to thine <hi>equal,</hi> that waits for
thee on affairs of moment, and try
how kindly he will receive the
disappointment on such grounds.
Dost thou use to say, I <hi>could not</hi>
go out to <hi>market</hi> to buy necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
because 'twas <hi>cold weather;</hi>
I <hi>could</hi> not go to <hi>Dinner</hi> to my
kind Neighbour next door, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me, because I had a <hi>corn</hi> upon
my great Toe? Are such pretences
too <hi>trifling</hi> to be used on such <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
occasions, and are they
<hi>enough</hi> for the <hi>greatest?</hi> will they
serve to excuse thy neglect of
<hi>feeding</hi> thy soul with the <hi>bread</hi> of
life, and thy making provision for
eternity? Will they answer for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109534:38"/>
thy not waiting on thy Lord, the
Lord of Life and Glory, when he
invited thee to the Feast of Love,
at the House of Banquets? What
thoughts hast thou of the <hi>prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
the <hi>joyes</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the
<hi>foretasts</hi> of <hi>Glory;</hi> what, I say, dost
thou think of <hi>these,</hi> if they have
not <hi>so much power</hi> with thee as the
most <hi>acknowledged</hi> trifles? With
how much <hi>less</hi> respect and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dost thou <hi>serve God,</hi> than
wicked men do the <hi>Devil</hi> and their
<hi>Lusts?</hi> When <hi>they</hi> invite to <hi>jolly
meetings</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> in <hi>debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery</hi>
and <hi>beastial madness,</hi> do the
<hi>Blades</hi> use to make <hi>such</hi> excuses?
Are they diverted and kept off from
their <hi>brutish</hi> satisfactions by <hi>such
Nothings?</hi> certainly they could not
<hi>so</hi> excuse themselves to their <hi>lusts</hi>
and <hi>vile Companions.</hi> And do you
pretend to be <hi>worshippers</hi> of the
<hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and worshippers of
the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> sort, to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:109534:39"/>
and expectants of <hi>eternal
glories</hi> as <hi>rewards</hi> of your services;
and do you <hi>thus</hi> serve your Maker;
<hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> when the humour
takes you, when the <hi>Devil</hi> hath <hi>no
business</hi> for you, and you have <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else</hi> to do? Are you not
ashamed to confess that <hi>Religion</hi>
hath so <hi>little</hi> power with you, and
that every thing can <hi>do more</hi> with
you, than your <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and
the interest of your souls? Do
you <hi>thus work out your salvation?</hi>
Do you <hi>thus seek a Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi>
Is <hi>this</hi> the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>patience</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Is <hi>this running,</hi>
and <hi>striving,</hi> and <hi>fighting,</hi> and <hi>giving
diligence?</hi> Is <hi>this cutting off right
hands,</hi> and <hi>plucking out right eyes?</hi>
Is <hi>this forsaking all</hi> and <hi>following
Christ?</hi> If there be any <hi>reason,</hi> if
there be any <hi>shame,</hi> if there be any
<hi>Conscience,</hi> if there be any <hi>sense</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in you, let not
<hi>small</hi> matters keep you from <hi>this</hi>
your greatest duty and concern;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109534:39"/>
Make no more <hi>such vain</hi> and <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning
Apologies.</hi> I know not
whether it were not better for you
once for all, to say you are <hi>no
Christians;</hi> than to insist on such
<hi>shameless</hi> pretensions for your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
of <hi>Christ</hi> and his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I add no more on this
head now; I pray God you may
lay to heart what I have said.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>I Pass now to discourse with the
<hi>other</hi> sort of <hi>Refusers,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>Those</hi> that stand off upon the
score of <hi>mistakes</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi> In
applying my self to <hi>them,</hi> I shall
consider the most weighty <hi>objections</hi>
that carry any <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi>
with them. And though I know
many pretend <hi>scruples</hi> of <hi>this sort,</hi>
when in <hi>earnest they</hi> are <hi>not</hi> the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of their neglects; yet because
they <hi>are so</hi> to <hi>some,</hi> I shall take them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109534:40"/>
to account. They are of two
sorts,</p>
               <p>(1) Such as hinder men only
<hi>sometimes,</hi> and in <hi>part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) Such as <hi>wholly</hi> obstruct
their <hi>Communion,</hi> and are pretended
as grounds, why they cannot partake
with us at <hi>any</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>first</hi> kind are <hi>these</hi> that
follow; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) We hear sometimes, [I
<hi>would not have neglected the</hi> holy
Sacrament, <hi>but I was not</hi> in <hi>charity;</hi>
such, or such a person hath abused
me, and I was at odds with him;
so that I durst not come.]</p>
               <p>To this I say, That in <hi>such</hi> an
occasion, thou art <hi>seriously,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially</hi>
to consider, whether thy
displeasure were <hi>just,</hi> or <hi>unjust;</hi>
upon the determining of <hi>this</hi> will
depend the state of the case If</p>
               <p>(1) Thy displeasure were <hi>just,</hi>
and thy Neighbour hath done thee
<hi>wrong,</hi> and <hi>persists</hi> in it without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
or <hi>reparation;</hi> 'tis no <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness</hi>
to be <hi>out</hi> with him,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109534:40"/>
or think amiss of him. In <hi>such</hi> a
case, thy <hi>anger</hi> is no <hi>sin;</hi> so long as
it keeps it self within <hi>just bounds.
Be angry, and sin not,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Eph. 4. 26. they may be parted</hi>
And what is <hi>no sin</hi> cannot <hi>unfit</hi> us
for the <hi>holy Communion.</hi> For <hi>that</hi>
Ordinance doth not oblige us to be
<hi>reconsiled</hi> in our thoughts to <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and <hi>injurious</hi> men, while they
<hi>impenitently</hi> continue <hi>such:</hi> It will
indeed require us not to <hi>revenge</hi>
our selves on them, to do them
<hi>wrong,</hi> or to desire their <hi>ruine,</hi> or
as much as <hi>hurt;</hi> but <hi>not</hi> to have
<hi>kind</hi> and good thoughts of them
while they <hi>continue obstinate</hi> in their
<hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>injustice: otherwise</hi> it were
in the <hi>power</hi> of every wicked person
to <hi>hinder</hi> the good man from the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> when he pleased. On
such an occasion (I say) we may be
<hi>innocently angry,</hi> and not <hi>only pity</hi>
the <hi>injurious</hi> man, which many
times is but a <hi>proud,</hi> though more
<hi>plausible</hi> word to disguise anger by.
And the man that is but <hi>thus justly</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:109534:41"/>
pleased with an offender against
God, and himself, is not <hi>indisposed</hi>
for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> thereby. If this
be your case at any time, you ought
not to permit the injury of another
to do you <hi>so much more,</hi> as to keep
you from your attendance on Christ
at his <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (2) If upon <hi>examination</hi> you
have found, that your <hi>anger,</hi> and
displeasure was <hi>unjust;</hi> then the
<hi>sin,</hi> and the <hi>wrong</hi> was on your
part, and you ought to <hi>repent</hi> of it,
and <hi>resolve</hi> against it, as a <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for the holy Sacrament. And
if you <hi>do so,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> will be
a <hi>proper means</hi> to your end? <hi>There</hi>
you will find <hi>considerations,</hi> and
<hi>helps</hi> for the <hi>cooling</hi> of the <hi>heats</hi> of
your <hi>passion;</hi> and for the allaying
the <hi>boylings</hi> of your <hi>rage,</hi> and <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity:</hi>
I say, if you are convinced
in your conscience, that your <hi>wratb</hi>
is <hi>undeserved,</hi> you ought to <hi>repent,</hi>
and if you <hi>do so,</hi> you ought to use
the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> for the <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of your <hi>repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:109534:41"/>
So that the scruple of <hi>not</hi> being
in <hi>charity</hi> cannot justly keep any
from the Sacrament, but <hi>those</hi> that
know they hate their brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cause, and are resolv'd to
persist in that hatred; <hi>such</hi> as will
not be reconciled to one that
hath done them wrong, though he
<hi>repents,</hi> and endeavours reparation:
And <hi>such,</hi> in effect, <hi>renounce</hi> Christ,
and declare that they expect no
benefit from his <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>mediation</hi>
for the obtaining <hi>pardon</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
If this be your condition,
you may well be <hi>afraid</hi> to come
to the Holy Sacrament; and you
may as well tremble to pray, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespass againstr us.</hi> For
this is directly <hi>praying</hi> against your
selves. I hope it is not <hi>thus</hi> with
any of you that make this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But your neighbour you think
is an <hi>evil</hi> man, hath done you <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and not <hi>askt</hi> your <hi>pardon,</hi> or
sought your <hi>amends;</hi> you are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109534:42"/>
displeased with him, and feel
much anger in your mind against
him; but yet are very <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give</hi>
him upon his <hi>acknowledgements</hi>
and <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>forgiveness.</hi> If it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>this</hi> manner with you, you
ought not to <hi>abstain</hi> from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
for <hi>this</hi> reason; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to address your selves to it,
to <hi>provide</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> that your <hi>just</hi>
anger may not grow into <hi>malice</hi>
and rage; that you may not be
provoked to repay your enemy one
injury for another, but that by the
due use of those holy mysteries you
may be <hi>more inclined</hi> to <hi>forgiveness,</hi>
when he shall be <hi>fit</hi> for it. This I
think is sufficient for <hi>that</hi> doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(II) Some plead;</hi> [I have so
much business faln upon me, that I
have not time to prepare my self, and
therefore I cannot come]</p>
               <p>In <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>this,</hi> I shall say
<hi>something</hi> that concerns <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                  <hi>Business,</hi>
and something <hi rend="sub">2</hi> that concerns
<hi>Preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) As to <hi>Business.</hi> Doth your
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109534:42"/>
                  <hi>Business</hi> afford you time to <hi>eat,</hi> and
<hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> to fit your
souls for <hi>spiritual entertainments,</hi>
and <hi>converse</hi> with <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) Have you any <hi>greater,</hi> have
you any <hi>better</hi> business, than to
prepare your selves to <hi>remember</hi> the
<hi>Love</hi> of your <hi>dear Lord,</hi> to <hi>meet</hi>
with him, to <hi>renew</hi> your <hi>Covenant</hi>
with <hi>God,</hi> and to receive pledges
of his <hi>pardon,</hi> and his <hi>love?</hi> Do
you not reckon, that <hi>this</hi> is <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and the most <hi>important</hi> and
<hi>necessary</hi> business; and shall the
<hi>greater</hi> matters give place to the
<hi>less?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3) Is not <hi>much</hi> of the <hi>business</hi>
that <hi>hinders, needless?</hi> have you
not <hi>voluntarily</hi> involv'd your self
in <hi>more</hi> affairs than it was <hi>necessary</hi>
you <hi>should,</hi> or than your state or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world requir'd? might
not <hi>some</hi> of it have been <hi>put off</hi> to
some <hi>other</hi> time; or might not the
<hi>time</hi> that you spend in <hi>impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
be imployed in <hi>some</hi> of that
business?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:109534:43"/>
Ask your Consciences these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
and know, that what ever
business you take upon you <hi>more</hi>
than is consistent with your duty to
God, and to your souls, <hi>that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is <hi>your sin.</hi> But if your business
were not <hi>voluntary,</hi> but thrown on
you by <hi>Providence;</hi> the <hi>doing</hi> such
<hi>necessary</hi> business is <hi>Gods work;</hi> and
while you do it in his <hi>fear,</hi> and with
an eye to his <hi>glory,</hi> you are doing
somewhat that is a <hi>preparation</hi> for
the Holy Sacrament, or at least <hi>that</hi>
which doth not by any means <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose</hi>
you for it. And hence I
pass to the Answers that concern</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Preparation.</hi> As to this take
these two things.</p>
               <p>(1) There are <hi>Preparations</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> as
well as to the <hi>Sacrament; Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is the Preparation for <hi>Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Prayer</hi> the Preparation for
<hi>Hearing;</hi> and I hope that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
your business you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<hi>these</hi> duties: If <hi>not,</hi> you are
to <hi>repent</hi> speedily of your neglect,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109534:43"/>
and to take the <hi>first</hi> opportunity of
the Sacrament, <hi>there</hi> to <hi>confess</hi> your
<hi>sin,</hi> to declare your <hi>repentance</hi> and
<hi>resolutions</hi> of <hi>amendment;</hi> to beg <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
for what you have <hi>omitted,</hi> and
<hi>grace</hi> to <hi>assist</hi> you in what you <hi>resolve.</hi>
But if you <hi>have perform'd those holy
services,</hi> then I say,</p>
               <p>(2) That <hi>those performances</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> are
<hi>preparations</hi> for the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
For when we <hi>hear,</hi> and
when we <hi>pray,</hi> we do the <hi>same</hi>
thing that we do at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
though <hi>not</hi> with <hi>that solemnity;</hi> we
<hi>remember</hi> Christ when we <hi>hear,</hi> and
we do the same, and renew our
<hi>Covenant</hi> with God when we <hi>pray,</hi>
(in which two I have told you the
nature of the Ordinance consists;)
so that these acts are <hi>dispositions</hi>
and <hi>preparations</hi> for <hi>that</hi> which is
the more <hi>solemn</hi> performance. A
<hi>good life</hi> in the discharge of our
duties towards God and man, is an
<hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>constant preparation</hi> for
the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and a <hi>true Christian</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:109534:44"/>
is alwayes <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Christ,</hi> and to <hi>confirm</hi> the
<hi>Covenant</hi> whereby he is a Christian.
It is indeed very fit, that we should
take some time before we approach
the Lords Table, to call together
into our thoughts the several great
instances of the love of our dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
which we are to <hi>remember
there;</hi> what <hi>particular sins</hi> we have
to <hi>confess,</hi> and to <hi>resolve</hi> and <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
against; what <hi>graces</hi> we <hi>want,</hi>
and are more especially to <hi>implore.</hi>
These things we should do, but
they are not works that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
much labour or time, if we
have been constant in the other <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory</hi>
duties of <hi>Meditation, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and <hi>Hearing;</hi> for they do <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
such</hi> thoughts and resolutions
to the souls of good men. But if
thy case be <hi>such,</hi> that thou hast been
an <hi>evil</hi> man, and <hi>negligent</hi> of all
spiritual duty; but art now <hi>sensible</hi>
of thy sin, and <hi>desirous</hi> to <hi>reform;
that sense</hi> and <hi>those desires</hi> of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(if they are <hi>sincere,</hi> and if thou
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109534:44"/>
understandest the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
and Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> that
is sealed by it) are thy <hi>preparations.</hi>
The <hi>more time</hi> thou takest, and the
<hi>more prayers</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployest
with other means, to make
the <hi>sense</hi> of sin <hi>deep,</hi> and the <hi>desires</hi>
of reformation <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>great;</hi>
the <hi>more</hi> thou art <hi>prepared,</hi> and the
better things are like to succeed
with thee: But if thy <hi>preparations</hi>
are of a <hi>lower,</hi> and more imperfect
degree, (if of the <hi>true</hi> kind) thou
oughtest <hi>not therefore to abstain;</hi>
God will <hi>pardon</hi> thy <hi>infirmities,</hi> and
<hi>accept</hi> of thy <hi>sincerity,</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi>
thee <hi>so,</hi> that thou shalt be <hi>better
prepared</hi> against <hi>another opportunity,</hi>
if thou art not wanting to thy self.
But as to <hi>this,</hi> I may have occasion
to speak more under the next Head,
to which I now come:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> (II) To consider the <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Conscience,</hi> that keep some <hi>off
wholly</hi> from <hi>publick Communions.</hi>
They are either of <hi>such</hi> as refrain,
because (1) they think <hi>themselves
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109534:45"/>
unworthy,</hi> or (2) of those that do it
because they think <hi>others unworthy,</hi>
or (3) of such as refuse on the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>administration</hi>
is <hi>unworthy.</hi> Most of the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and usual doubts will fall under
one or other of <hi>these.</hi> I begin with
those of the <hi>first</hi> sort.</p>
               <p>(1) We would come to the Holy
Communion, but alas we are not
<hi>worthy</hi> of so great an honour and
priviledge; and we are afraid to
come, because we hear that <hi>he that
eats and drinks unworthily, eats and
drinks his own damnation.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>this,</hi> proposed thus in the
general, I answer (1) we are also
<hi>unworthy</hi> of <hi>common</hi> mercies, of
<hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> and <hi>raiment;</hi> and of
the more usual <hi>spiritual</hi> mercies,
that God should <hi>speak</hi> unto us, or
that <hi>we</hi> should be permitted to
<hi>speak</hi> unto <hi>him;</hi> shall we therefore
<hi>starve</hi> our selves, and go <hi>naked?</hi>
shall we therefore refuse to <hi>hear,</hi>
and <hi>pray?</hi> In the <hi>Sacrament</hi> there
is <hi>something</hi> of <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>something</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:109534:45"/>
of <hi>priviledge;</hi> when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to do a duty <hi>reasonable</hi> and
<hi>just,</hi> shall we refuse because we are
<hi>unworthy?</hi> when we are invited
unto a benefit <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> and
<hi>necessary,</hi> shall we resist it because we
are not <hi>worthy?</hi> To do thus is to
render our selves <hi>more undeserving.</hi>
When God offers favors, we <hi>may</hi>
and <hi>ought</hi> to accept, though we are
unworthy of them.</p>
               <p>(2) All men are unworthy in the
sense of the Law. <hi>Every man in his
best estate is altogether vanity,</hi> Psalm
39. 5. <hi>We are all an unclean thing,
and our righteonsuess is as filthy rags,</hi>
Isa. 64. 6. The meaning is, all men
are <hi>sinners,</hi> and their <hi>best services</hi> are
<hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>polluted.</hi> There is none
<hi>righteous,</hi> no not one, according to
the strictness and severity of the
Law, which require unsinning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<hi>This unworthiness</hi> then is
<hi>not</hi> a <hi>reason</hi> why thou shouldst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain;
yea</p>
               <p>(3) If thou art <hi>sensible</hi> of this
thine <hi>unworthiness,</hi> and desirous to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109534:46"/>
be made <hi>more worthy,</hi> thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
for <hi>that reason</hi> to come. 'Tis
<hi>such</hi> that Christ invites: <hi>Come unto
me all ye that are weary and heavy
laden, and I will give you rest,</hi> Matth.
11. 28. <hi>He came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but sinners to repentance,</hi> Matth.
9. 13. <hi>Ho every man that thirsteth,
come—</hi> Isa. 55. 1. <hi>The Spirit and
the Bride say come, and let him that
is athirst come,—</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Sense</hi>
of <hi>spiritual wants,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
supplies,</hi> is part of <hi>Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness;</hi>
and <hi>that</hi> which gives a
<hi>right</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Thy being
an <hi>unworthy</hi> sinner, is not a reason
why thou shouldst refrain, except
thou art <hi>obstinately resolv'd</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so.</hi> The <hi>Beggar</hi> is never the
more <hi>unworthy</hi> of an <hi>alms,</hi> because
he is in <hi>rags,</hi> and great <hi>misery;</hi> nor
the <hi>sick man</hi> the <hi>more unworthy</hi> of
the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> of a <hi>Physician,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his disease is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>violent</hi>
upon him. If indeed the Beggar
<hi>loves</hi> and <hi>chooseth want,</hi> and scorns
<hi>charity;</hi> if the <hi>Patient hates</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:109534:46"/>
the <hi>Physician</hi> and his <hi>applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
in such a case the one is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of <hi>relief,</hi> and the other of
the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>health.</hi> If this be thy
case in <hi>spirituals,</hi> thou art <hi>unworthy;</hi>
and till thou art of another temper,
I would not perswade thy coming.
But if on the other hand, thou art
<hi>sensible</hi> of thy <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>desirous</hi> of
<hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> to reform, thou
hast the <hi>qualification</hi> that renders
thee one that <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>come:</hi>
and thou art <hi>worthy,</hi> as a <hi>Beggar</hi> is
of an <hi>alms,</hi> or the <hi>Sick</hi> of <hi>physick;</hi>
that is, thou <hi>wantest</hi> it, and Christ
invites thee to come, to receive
<hi>supplies</hi> sutable to thy <hi>wants.</hi> So
that if it be <hi>thus</hi> with thee, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Apostle pronounced on
him that <hi>eats</hi> and <hi>drinks unworthily</hi>
will not concern thee.</p>
               <p>But the doubter presseth the
matter more <hi>particularly; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are
<hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>this worthiness:</hi> But I
have <hi>no knowledge;</hi> I <hi>cannot believe,</hi>
I <hi>cannot repent;</hi> and therefore <hi>am
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109534:47"/>
not worthy.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall speak to these <hi>distinctly,</hi>
and apart.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns (1) <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
I propose <hi>these</hi> things.</p>
               <p>(1) Perhaps thou art mistaken
in the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> that are
necessary. It is <hi>not necessary</hi> that
thou shouldst have knowledge in
<hi>deep</hi> and <hi>controversal</hi> points, no,
nor yet in many <hi>doctrinal opinions</hi>
about <hi>Religion,</hi> that are <hi>less specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and <hi>nice:</hi> It is not necessary
that thou shouldest be acquainted
with the <hi>disputed</hi> matters about the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> or be able to discourse
largely upon the subject. No,
<hi>Necessary knowledge is in few things,</hi>
and <hi>those practical.</hi> If therefore
thou art instructed in the main
<hi>plain</hi> points of <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine,
and in the <hi>great rules</hi> of <hi>Christian</hi>
Life; if thou understandest the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> to be a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of
Christ, and a <hi>confirming</hi> our <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with <hi>God;</hi> and knowest those
<hi>easie</hi> things I have before set down
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109534:47"/>
about it: There is no reason then
why thou shouldst plead <hi>ignorance</hi>
in barr to thy <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>priviledge.</hi>
But</p>
               <p>(2) If thou art <hi>really ignorant</hi>
in those <hi>plain</hi> things, thy <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
is <hi>inexcusable;</hi> 'tis a great <hi>sin,</hi>
and an argument of <hi>prodigious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness</hi>
and <hi>neglect.</hi> For no one can
<hi>want capacity</hi> to know things so
<hi>easie,</hi> and no one can want <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>
to know things so <hi>common,</hi>
and no one can plead <hi>excuse</hi> for not
endeavoring to know things so
<hi>necessary.</hi> If <hi>this</hi> then be thy case,
repent of thy stupidity and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
that occasioned thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and apply thy self presently
to thy <hi>spiritual Guide,</hi> or some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
knowing Neighbor to instruct
thee in those great and necessary
matters. Be afraid and ashamed to
live a day longer in such dangerous
darkness amidst so much clear light:
And till thou hast got out of this
state of wilful blindness, meddle
not with holy mysteries. But <hi>this,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:109534:48"/>
I hope, is the condition but of very
few of you: Those that make the
objection are mostly such as do it
upon the <hi>former</hi> mistake, which I
have endeavored to rectifie.</p>
               <p>(II) Want of <hi>Faith</hi> is pleaded.
And to this scruple I say,</p>
               <p>(I) Perhaps thou art <hi>out,</hi> and
hast been <hi>mis-taught</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Faith.</hi> It may be thou
takest <hi>Faith</hi> to be an <hi>assurance</hi> of
salvation; or supposest that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
thy assent to <hi>many</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and <hi>such</hi> as are <hi>unreasonable,</hi>
or <hi>doubtful;</hi> or perhaps thy mind
hath been <hi>confounded</hi> by <hi>phrases,</hi>
and <hi>various, metaphorical;</hi> and <hi>dark</hi>
representations of Faith; so that
thou dost not as much as know
<hi>what it is,</hi> or <hi>wherein it consists.</hi>
These all have been, and often are
the cases of many well-disposed
Christians. The good man is not
absolutely <hi>assured</hi> of his salvation;
or he <hi>doubts</hi> sometimes of many
<hi>doctrines</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> that he hath
been taught to believe as <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:109534:48"/>
or his understanding is
<hi>confused</hi> by variety of <hi>odd</hi> notions;
and therefore he thinks he hath <hi>not
Faith,</hi> and dares not approach the
<hi>Holy Table.</hi> If any of these be thy
condition, rectifie thy thoughts;
and thou wilt be rid of thy vain
fears: Consider the matter <hi>freely;</hi>
look on it in the light of <hi>Scripture</hi>
and <hi>Reason,</hi> and thou wilt finde,
that <hi>those conceits</hi> about <hi>Faith</hi> were
<hi>groundless.</hi> Lay this down for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that <hi>the plainest and most obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
account of it is truest;</hi> For God
would not make <hi>that</hi> the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Gospel, which is <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi>
to understand.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>plain, scriptural, rational</hi>
Notion is <hi>this, Faith</hi> in the <hi>general</hi>
is the <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>Proposition affirmed;
Divine Faith,</hi> the belief of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon a <hi>Divine Testimony; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-saving
Faith</hi> is <hi>such</hi> a <hi>belief</hi> of
<hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> as hath influence
upon the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> and
conforms them unto it. If now
we believe <hi>other Testimonies,</hi> but not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109534:49"/>
                  <hi>that</hi> which God hath given us <hi>by,</hi>
and <hi>of</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>humane,</hi> and we have nothing
to do with the <hi>holy</hi> Sacrament. If
we <hi>believe</hi> the Revelations of God
in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but <hi>that belief</hi> hath
not yet had <hi>such power</hi> upon our
<hi>affections</hi> and <hi>conversations</hi> as it
ought, and as we desire: In <hi>this</hi>
case we <hi>may,</hi> and 'tis our <hi>duty,</hi> to
come to the Lords Table, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<hi>that degree</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> which we
<hi>have,</hi> and to <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>more;</hi> that it
may be made <hi>so strong</hi> and <hi>lively,</hi>
as to <hi>transform</hi> our hearts, and all
our powers into the <hi>likeness</hi> of it,
and into <hi>his likeness</hi> who is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
and <hi>finisher of our Faith.</hi> And
finally, if our <hi>faith</hi> hath <hi>already</hi> had
<hi>this effect</hi> upon us, we are to come
to the Sacrament for <hi>further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>
of it. This is the short
and plain account of the matter;
and if I should run it out into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discourse, this part would be
disproportioned to the rest. If my
brevity leave any of you unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109534:49"/>
in <hi>this,</hi> or any other thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to my subject, I am at hand,
willing and ready to give you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
satisfaction. But</p>
               <p>(2) It may be the <hi>weakness</hi> and
<hi>imperfection</hi> of thy Faith makes thee
think thou hast <hi>none.</hi> In this case
ask thy self the question. Do I
think that Christ <hi>Iesus</hi> was an
<hi>Impostor,</hi> and that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a
<hi>Fable?</hi> Thou <hi>startlest</hi> and <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
these</hi> thoughts: Hence thou
mayst be assured that thou hast
<hi>some degree</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> But <hi>that</hi> (it
may be) is very <hi>small</hi> and <hi>low:</hi>
Be <hi>that</hi> the case; Ask thy self then
again, whether thou hast any <hi>desire</hi>
that thy <hi>weak</hi> Faith should be
<hi>strengthened,</hi> and thy <hi>imperfect</hi> Faith
should be <hi>improved</hi> to greater and
nobler measures? If thou art a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
fit to be dealt with under this
Head of <hi>Conscience,</hi> it is <hi>thus</hi> with
thee; thou art <hi>sorry</hi> for <hi>this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
and <hi>desirous</hi> of <hi>growth</hi> and
<hi>improvement:</hi> And if <hi>so,</hi> apply thy
self to the Holy Sacrament, as to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109534:50"/>
the <hi>proper means</hi> of <hi>growth,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>
of thy <hi>imperfections. Here</hi> thy
Faith will be <hi>exercised,</hi> and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
it will be felt; so that thy
doubts, whether thou hast any or
no, will be cleared off, experience
will assure thee. And how thy Faith
will by the use of this Ordinance
be quickened and advanced, I have
shewn already. Thus to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the supposed want of
Faith. But</p>
               <p>(III) The good man thinks that
he wants <hi>Repentance</hi> too: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>repent</hi> he saith, and therefore is
not <hi>worthy.</hi> In answer, I take notice
that</p>
               <p>In Repentance two things are
considerable, <hi>viz. 1. Sorrow</hi> for sin,
and 2. <hi>Turning</hi> from it to a life of
Holiness and Virtue.</p>
               <p>(I) It may be thy <hi>sorrow</hi> is not
so <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>great</hi> as thou thinkst
is fit and sutable to such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Thou canst not weep and
grieve <hi>so much</hi> for thy sin as the
evils of it requires, and yet thou
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109534:50"/>
mayst not wholly want the grace of
Repentance. <hi>All</hi> indeed are <hi>sinners,</hi>
and <hi>all</hi> must <hi>repent:</hi> But men are
<hi>sinners</hi> in <hi>different</hi> measures, and
degrees of guilt; and their sorrow
and humiliations will likewise be
<hi>different. Deeper</hi> Convictions and
<hi>greater</hi> agonies and pangs of sorrow
may be expected from them whose
sins have been <hi>capital</hi> and <hi>notorious,</hi>
than from those others whose lives
have been more <hi>civil,</hi> and less
tainted with <hi>ranting</hi> enormities. It
may be then, thy Education hath
been sober, and thy inclinations
not bent towards the grosser vices;
thou hast not committed any <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi>
crimes, or <hi>such</hi> sins as look <hi>gastly</hi>
in the conscience; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thy Conversion hath not those
<hi>terrors,</hi> and that <hi>dread</hi> in it, those
melting sorrows, and violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of grief that thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servest
in some others. Though
it be <hi>thus,</hi> thou hast no reason to
be discouraged, if thy sorrow be <hi>so
much</hi> as to engage thee to <hi>humble</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:109534:51"/>
thy self before God, sincerely to
beg <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>forgiveness,</hi> and to
obtain from thee <hi>hatred</hi> of thy sins,
and resolutions against them; <hi>that
sorrow</hi> of thine is <hi>godly sorrow,</hi> and
part of true <hi>repentance,</hi> though it
have not the greatest <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence:
These</hi> may be wanting on
another account also in them that
are truly penitent; their <hi>tempers</hi>
may be more <hi>cold,</hi> and their <hi>passions
calmer,</hi> than others are; and on
this score their <hi>resentments</hi> less <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
and the <hi>expressions</hi> of them
less <hi>eager:</hi> So that <hi>violences</hi> in <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
are not alwayes <hi>arguments</hi> of
<hi>true repentance,</hi> nor the <hi>absence</hi> of
them a <hi>sign</hi> of <hi>impenitency</hi> and <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
If thou art <hi>so</hi> sensible of sin
as to <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>endeavor</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and forsake it, thou art a
<hi>penitent</hi> in part, and thou oughtest
to come to the Sacrament for the
<hi>strengthening</hi> of <hi>that sense,</hi> and to
gain <hi>more</hi> assistance, and <hi>more</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to subdue thy sin. And if
there be any real <hi>defect</hi> in thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109534:51"/>
repair thither, that it may be
awakened, and excited to degrees
more <hi>becoming</hi> and <hi>effective.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (2) The Objection presseth
as to the <hi>other</hi> part of <hi>Repentance.
I cannot leave my sin,</hi> and therefore
dare not approach the holy Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But dost thou <hi>desire</hi> it? dost
thou <hi>endeavor</hi> it? If <hi>so,</hi> though thy
desires are imperfect, and thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
weak, yet it is thy duty
to present thy self at the holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>There</hi> thou mayst expect to
have thy <hi>desires increast,</hi> and thy
<hi>endeavors heightned</hi> and <hi>encouraged.</hi>
And how both the former act of
repentance, which is <hi>sorrow,</hi> and
<hi>this</hi> of <hi>aversation,</hi> are promoted by
the Sacrament, I have particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewn in the former periods,
to which I refer you for fuller an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this and such like objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thus of the scruples that arise
from the first Head, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our <hi>own unworthiness.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:109534:52"/>
(II) Some abstain from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
because of the <hi>Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of <hi>Others; wicked</hi> men are
admitted, and they will not have
<hi>communion</hi> with <hi>such.</hi> Yea, they
are commanded to have no <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
with them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 11. and <hi>to
come out from among them,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.
17.</p>
               <p>For the answering this, I propose
these things to be considered.</p>
               <p>(1) Hast thou taken the <hi>Method</hi>
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 18. 15. with
the sinner, from whose communion
thou thinkest thou must withdraw?
Hast thou <hi>privately</hi> told him of his
faults? Hast thou admonisht him
before <hi>witnesses?</hi> Hast thou told the
<hi>Church?</hi> If <hi>so</hi> thou hast done, and
he persist still in his wickedness, he
will no doubt be <hi>legally</hi> excluded
from <hi>Christian Communion;</hi> and so
the foundation of thy doubt will be
taken off.</p>
               <p>(2) How art thou <hi>sure,</hi> when
thou seest those thou callest <hi>wicked</hi>
come to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109534:52"/>
do not <hi>repent</hi> of their wickedness,
and come to the holy Ordinance to
<hi>beg pardon</hi> for their sins, and <hi>strength</hi>
against them? How dost thou know
that they are not come to <hi>bind</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by deep resolutions, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
vows, to a <hi>spiritual warfare,</hi>
and a <hi>new obedience?</hi> Their coming
makes <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>such designs</hi> and
<hi>resolutions,</hi> and how dost thou <hi>know</hi>
that <hi>that</hi> profession is <hi>insincere?</hi>
Hast thou a way of prying into the
heart?</p>
               <p>But the man returns to his sins
as soon as he hath done, and <hi>hence</hi>
thou wilt say, thou knowest his <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</hi>
This indeed were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if it could be certainly <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen;</hi>
but how he will demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>after</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> thou canst
not <hi>foretel; This</hi> may have more
effect upon him than <hi>former</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have had: This, I say, may
be, and <hi>charity thinketh no evil,</hi> but
<hi>believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. or, if it now again prove
otherwise, it is no certain evidence
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109534:53"/>
that the man <hi>onely</hi> made <hi>pretence,</hi>
and shew; he might <hi>then mean</hi>
and <hi>design truly</hi> and well; but <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi>
and his <hi>lusts</hi> were <hi>too strong</hi>
for him, and carried him away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all his endeavors and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>(3) Thou performest <hi>other</hi> sacred
duties, in which thou <hi>remembrest</hi>
Christ, and hast <hi>communion</hi> with
<hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>company</hi> of <hi>evil men.</hi>
Thou joynest in <hi>hearing,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>prayers</hi> with <hi>such;</hi> and why
mayst thou not be <hi>present</hi> at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
with them?</p>
               <p>If it be pretended as a <hi>reason</hi> of
<hi>difference,</hi> That hearing the Word,
and Prayer, are <hi>converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
but the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is <hi>not so:</hi>
I ask thee then, whether thou mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
by <hi>[converting]</hi> a <hi>turning</hi> men
from <hi>open Infidelity</hi> to the <hi>Profession</hi>
of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and the
<hi>owning</hi> of Christian <hi>Virtues?</hi> or
<hi>onely</hi> the <hi>turning</hi> those that <hi>profest
this</hi> Faith and Religion <hi>before,</hi> to
the <hi>practise</hi> of them. If thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109534:53"/>
the <hi>former,</hi> the Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is <hi>no converting</hi> Ordinance;
nor are the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
used for <hi>such</hi> purposes among
us, where the Gospel is already
generally profest: And thou dost
not bear the company of the wicked
of which we speak in the places of
publick worship, upon any <hi>such</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>converting</hi> ordinance,
thou meanest (as is most likely) such
a one as God useth as a <hi>means</hi> to
cause men professing the name of
Christ to <hi>depart from iniquity,</hi> to
<hi>turn</hi> from <hi>sin</hi> to <hi>holiness,</hi> and from
the <hi>power of Satan unto God;</hi> I see
no reason why any should think, or
say that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is no <hi>convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be not, either 'tis because
the Sacrament is no <hi>proper means,</hi>
or because God <hi>will</hi> not <hi>concur</hi> by
his <hi>Grace</hi> with it. <hi>Neither</hi> of <hi>these
can</hi> be said with any shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
Not the <hi>former;</hi> for why
should not the <hi>solemn remembrance</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:109534:54"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>consideration</hi> of
what he hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> be a
<hi>means</hi> for the <hi>killing</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> which
he came to <hi>destroy,</hi> and the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>holiness,</hi> which he <hi>lived</hi> and
<hi>died</hi> to <hi>advance?</hi> yea, <hi>what</hi> can be
supposed more <hi>likely</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi>
for the promoting of <hi>that blessed</hi>
purpose? why should not the <hi>sign</hi>
and <hi>seal</hi> of Gods gracious <hi>Covenant</hi>
to give <hi>pardon</hi> and eternal <hi>Glory</hi> to
all that forsake their sins, and live
an holy life, be a fit instrument to
provoke those that understand it,
to <hi>renounce</hi> their <hi>sins,</hi> and to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote</hi>
themselves unto <hi>holiness?</hi> why
should not that <hi>solemn, sacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi>
that all that know what
they do lay on themselves at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
to <hi>endeavor</hi> to <hi>depart</hi> from
every <hi>known evil,</hi> and to <hi>practise</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>known duty,</hi> be a <hi>means</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to it? Certainly there is
nothing that in the <hi>nature of the
thing</hi> seems to be a more <hi>likely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi>
to convert men from a <hi>life</hi>
of <hi>sin</hi> to a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>holiness;</hi> than the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109534:54"/>
sacred <hi>remembrance</hi> of our Lord at
his Table. <hi>So that</hi> if this Ordinance
be not <hi>converting,</hi> it must be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God <hi>will</hi> not <hi>concur</hi> by <hi>his
grace</hi> in it: But whoever saith <hi>that,</hi>
speaks what he <hi>cannot know,</hi> and
<hi>cannot prove;</hi> he talks <hi>without book,</hi>
and <hi>against</hi> it; and is so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
in his assertion, that it would
be folly to attempt the confuting of
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> I have said on this occasion,
not to ingage in a <hi>Controversie,</hi> but
to clear a matter of <hi>Christian</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
And the very root of <hi>this</hi>
Objection lies in this conceit, That
the <hi>Sacrament is not a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;</hi>
For which, there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
but <hi>Phancy,</hi> and the <hi>bare say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of some <hi>mistaken</hi> men. But
now if, as I have proved, The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
may be, and is an <hi>Instrument</hi>
of <hi>Conversion;</hi> Then, why should
any refrain, because evil men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it?</p>
               <p>(4) If wicked men come to the
Sacrament that are not <hi>prepared</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:109534:55"/>
for it, their <hi>unpreparedness</hi> is <hi>their
sin,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> shall answer for it; But
<hi>we</hi> ought not <hi>therefore</hi> to neglect <hi>our
duty,</hi> because <hi>they</hi> have omitted
<hi>theirs.</hi> We may, and we ought to
advise, and admonish them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves for the Ordinance
before they come to it: If they will
not follow our brotherly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we cannot help it; we have
done what <hi>we</hi> can to render them
<hi>more worthy,</hi> and <hi>their</hi> sin shall not
be laid to our charge. To <hi>prepare
our selves</hi> for the <hi>holy Communion,</hi>
and to address our selves unto it,
is <hi>that</hi> which we are sure concerns
us; If we neglect, 'tis <hi>our sin,</hi> and
<hi>other</hi> mens sins will not excuse us.
<hi>Their sinning</hi> in <hi>one kind,</hi> should be
no reason why we should <hi>sin</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
There is no reason that we
should starve our selves, because
others take the bread that belongs
not to them.</p>
               <p>(5) If we are <hi>worthy</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants,
and others receive <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
They</hi> have <hi>no Communion</hi> with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109534:55"/>
                  <hi>us,</hi> nor <hi>we</hi> with <hi>them: They</hi> onely
<hi>eat bread,</hi> and <hi>drink wine;</hi> but <hi>we
partake</hi> of the <hi>mystical body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi>
of our <hi>Lord. Our Communion is with
the Father,</hi> and <hi>with his Son Iesus
Christ,</hi> and with the <hi>Faithful, worthy
Receivers;</hi> but the unworthy <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>
neither with <hi>us</hi> nor <hi>them.</hi> If
an <hi>Ape</hi> leap upon the Table, and
eat of the bread where Friends are
met at an entertainment, Is he
therefore a Guest? is he one of the
Company? If writings are to be
mutually sealed there among the
Friends, and that Creature catcheth
up the Seal, and doth as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
do, is he therefore a party?
He doth the <hi>same action,</hi> but not
with the same <hi>designes</hi> and <hi>ends;</hi>
and <hi>these</hi> make the <hi>communion.</hi> The
case is thus in reference to those
ungodly men that <hi>intrude</hi> to the
Sacrament; and the pious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants
have no reason to think
themselves concern'd in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Their <hi>bodies</hi> are <hi>together,</hi> but
their <hi>spirits</hi> act and move <hi>different</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:109534:56"/>
wayes. The <hi>Communion</hi> is <hi>spiritual;</hi>
and only those that receive as they
<hi>ought</hi> have <hi>fellowship</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> and
with <hi>one</hi> another. And this were
enough to answer <hi>that</hi> part of the
objection also, that is taken from
<hi>Scripture,</hi> where we are forbid to
have <hi>fellowship</hi> with wicked men.
But I add</p>
               <p>(6) When Christians are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
wicked <hi>Fellowship, Ephes.</hi> 5. 11.
It is evident that the prohibition
concerns <hi>heathen mysteries,</hi> which
are there call'd the <hi>unfruitful works
of darkness,</hi> because they were used
in <hi>close</hi> recesses; and <hi>v.</hi> 12. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith, <hi>It is a shame to speak of
those things that are done of them in
secret.</hi> Christians were not to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>
with the <hi>Heathens</hi> in their
<hi>abominable Mysteries:</hi> No, nor may
they partake with wicked men in
any <hi>action</hi> of <hi>vice,</hi> nor make them
their <hi>bosome</hi> friends, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with them in <hi>other</hi> matters
more th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n needs; especi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly if they
are <hi>openly</hi> prophane, and <hi>obstinately</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:109534:56"/>
ungodly. But it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow, that they must forsake
their Lords Table, and the most
solemn expressions of duty to him,
because evil men <hi>intrudingly</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves unto it.</p>
               <p>And whereas Christians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>come out from among
them,</hi> and to <hi>be separate, 2 Cor.</hi> 6.
17. 'Tis plain, that the persons
they are required to separate from
were <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Idolaters:</hi> For
they are called <hi>Vnbelievers, v</hi> 14.
<hi>Infidels, v.</hi> 15. And that they were
<hi>Idolaters,</hi> is intimated <hi>v. 16. What
agreement hath the Temple of God
with Idols?</hi> whence it follows,
<hi>wherefore come out from among them.</hi>
So that this place doth not concern
the present business; Christians
were to <hi>separate</hi> from the Worship
of <hi>Heathen Idolaters,</hi> but it doth by
no means follow hence that they
must forsake the <hi>true Christian</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
because <hi>evil</hi> men (who yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Christ) afford their presence at
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:109534:57"/>
And this may suffice for Answer
to the Objections taken from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness</hi>
of <hi>others</hi> that are admitted
in <hi>mixt</hi> Communions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>unworthiness</hi> of our
<hi>Way</hi> of <hi>administration</hi> is pretended
by some, as a reason why they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
communicate with us. As to
this Objection I shall not say much,
because the <hi>Toleration</hi> His Majesty
hath granted, hath given the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
the liberty of their own sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
better and fitter methods.
Therefore I shall only speak briefly
to two exceptions of this sort.</p>
               <p>(1) The <hi>Sacrament</hi> is administred
among us in the way of <hi>Forms</hi> of
<hi>Prayer,</hi> which they think to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>spiritual</hi> Worship. And (2)
<hi>kneeling</hi> at it is required, which they
suppose to be contrary to the first <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
and so an irregular posture
of receiving.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>first,</hi> I say these things,
(1) Worship and Prayer may be
<hi>spiritual,</hi> where <hi>Forms</hi> are used:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109534:57"/>
For the <hi>spirituality</hi> doth not consist
in the <hi>invention of words,</hi> but in the
<hi>due intention</hi> and <hi>ingagement</hi> of the
<hi>soul.</hi> If we pray in <hi>faith,</hi> with <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
self-resignation,</hi> and <hi>holy
desire</hi> of the good things we pray
for, we pray <hi>in the spirit,</hi> though
<hi>by a Form.</hi> And if, on the other
hand, we express our selves in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Prayers</hi> never so <hi>fluently</hi>
and <hi>earnestly,</hi> and have not <hi>those
dispositions</hi> of soul upon us when
we pray, our prayers are <hi>formal,</hi>
though without a <hi>form.</hi> Which of
these is <hi>fittest</hi> in <hi>it self,</hi> I shall not
dispute, but only say, that <hi>neither</hi>
is <hi>unlawful,</hi> but <hi>both</hi> have their
use: and add, that <hi>one sort</hi> may be
<hi>properest</hi> at <hi>one</hi> time, and the <hi>other</hi>
sort at <hi>another</hi> season, so that 'tis
silly <hi>superstition</hi> to be devoted to the
opinion of <hi>one</hi> of them, as absolutely
to condemn the <hi>other</hi> as <hi>unlawful.</hi>
In publick <hi>Worship, Forms</hi> have
the advantage in securing the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
and solemnity of it, and in <hi>this
too,</hi> that the Worshippers <hi>know</hi> what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109534:58"/>
it is they joyn in: But in <hi>secret</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
<hi>conceiv'd prayers</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>sute</hi> better with particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and may ingage the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<hi>more.</hi> So that either of these
may be used, as shall best accord
with the ends of pr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yer. And when
the publick <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church
requires the <hi>one,</hi> we may not <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
it, though we are more <hi>affected</hi>
with the <hi>other;</hi> especially, since we
may in <hi>private</hi> take the liberty to
use which of them we think fittest.
(2) <hi>Those</hi> that are most <hi>against
Forms,</hi> pray by <hi>them,</hi> when they
joyn with <hi>another</hi> that prayes,
though he do it never so much <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore:</hi>
For the Peoples mindes
are not concern'd in <hi>inventing</hi> the
<hi>words</hi> they pray by; the Minister
gives a <hi>Form</hi> to them. And if you
<hi>may</hi> pray in the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>private</hi>
person, dictated to you <hi>suddenly,</hi>
and without <hi>deliberation,</hi> and which
you do not know before, whether
it will agree with <hi>good sense,</hi> or
<hi>sound doctrine;</hi> why then may you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109534:58"/>
not do it in the <hi>Forms</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
compos'd by <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>reverend</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon <hi>mature consideration</hi> and
<hi>advice;</hi> especially when they are
<hi>such,</hi> as we <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> know <hi>before</hi>
to be <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>grave,</hi> sutable to
Christian <hi>necessities,</hi> and Christian
<hi>truths?</hi> There is no good reason
that I know to make a scruple of
the <hi>latter,</hi> if we admit the <hi>former.</hi>
But I shall say no more now of
this subject, which would require
a particular discourse. I come to
the <hi>second</hi> Branch of the <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(II) <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
is not agreeable to the <hi>first example;</hi>
our Saviour administer'd to his
Disciples <hi>sitting,</hi> and perhaps you
fear there is something of <hi>Popery</hi> in
the posture of <hi>Kneeling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer (I) we are not bound
to a nice and punctual observance
of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>circumstances</hi> that were in
the <hi>first example:</hi> The Sacrament
was first administred in the <hi>Evening,</hi>
in an <hi>upper room, onely</hi> to twelve
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109534:59"/>
                  <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>those Men,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks,</hi>
or at least such as were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined</hi>
to be <hi>so:</hi> But even the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
do not think we are obliged
to act in the Sacrament strictly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of <hi>these</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
and why should we suppose
our selves to be tyed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Posture, more</hi> than in those
<hi>other</hi> Circumstances, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be of no binding
nature. (2) The <hi>posture</hi> of those
times at Meals was not <hi>sitting,</hi> but
<hi>leaning,</hi> according to the <hi>then Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
of the Romans. So we read
<hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 20. That the beloved Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<hi>leaned on his Masters breast at
Supper.</hi> And though the <hi>English</hi>
Translation renders, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 14.
He <hi>sate down,</hi> and the Disciples with
him; it is in conformity to our
<hi>phrase</hi> and <hi>custom,</hi> which is <hi>sitting:</hi>
for the word in the Original
[<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] doth not imply <hi>that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
but is applicable to <hi>any</hi> other
that is used, as well as <hi>sitting.</hi> So
that if we are <hi>strictly</hi> tyed to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109534:59"/>
                  <hi>original posture,</hi> we must <hi>lean</hi> at
the Sacrament, and neither <hi>sit</hi> nor
<hi>kneel.</hi> But (3) the Institution hath
not bound us to either the one or
the other, but left the matter to be
determined by the <hi>general Rules</hi> of
<hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Reverence;</hi> And since
the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>kneeling,</hi> as the posture
most expressive of our <hi>humility</hi> and
<hi>reverence</hi> in receiving the pledges
of divine Love, I see no reason why
any should boggle at it; much
less why they should refuse their
Duty, and their Priviledge, abstain
from their spiritual food, and the
solemn remembrance of their dear
Lord, rather than do a thing so
<hi>innocent,</hi> so <hi>decent,</hi> and so <hi>reverend,</hi>
which the Authority of the Church
requires from them. He hath but
little appetite to his meat, that will
not eat it except he may do it in
such a fashion as is agreeable to his
own humor.</p>
               <p>I, but the Objector doubts, that
there is real danger, and something
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109534:60"/>
of <hi>Popery</hi> in the case; the <hi>Papists</hi> use
<hi>kneeling</hi> to signifie their <hi>adoration</hi> of
the <hi>Host,</hi> and the Scrupler fears
there may be some such thing in
<hi>our</hi> practise. But this fear is very
<hi>uncharitable</hi> and <hi>groundless,</hi> since
our <hi>Church</hi> doth so <hi>vehemently</hi> and
<hi>constantly</hi> declare against the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi>
of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and
the <hi>adoration</hi> of any creature; And
since we are always told, that <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is required for <hi>no other</hi> reason
than to <hi>signifie</hi> our <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence:</hi>
And though the <hi>Papists</hi> do
express <hi>more</hi> by that posture, yet
since our Church declares, that <hi>this</hi>
is <hi>all she</hi> intends in reference to the
<hi>consecrated</hi> Elements, there is no
ground why any should think <hi>more</hi>
is meant by it. <hi>Kneeling</hi> signifies
<hi>reverence</hi> as well as <hi>worship;</hi> and the
<hi>declaration</hi> of the person himself is
enough to shew <hi>which</hi> of them he
<hi>intends.</hi> But besides, though the
<hi>Papists</hi> adore the <hi>Bread</hi> as the <hi>real
Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore <hi>kneel</hi>
before it, yet <hi>that</hi> can be no reason
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109534:60"/>
why <hi>we</hi> should <hi>not</hi> in this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of our Lord <hi>adore Him Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
They</hi> kneel to him as present
<hi>corporally; we</hi> worship him as <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
and <hi>spiritually</hi> present.</p>
               <p>This I might urge further as a
positive Argument for the <hi>posture</hi>
of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> over and above the use
of it, as an Answer to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Thus all acknowledge, That
<hi>Christ</hi> is to be <hi>worship'd. Receiving</hi>
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the <hi>proper worship</hi>
of Christ; and <hi>kneeling</hi> is a <hi>proper</hi>
signification of <hi>adoration:</hi> It follows
that on <hi>this</hi> account <hi>kneeling</hi> is <hi>sit,</hi>
and <hi>fittest</hi> to be used in the action
of Communion. But I shall pursue
this matter no further; what I have
said may satisfie the <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable;</hi>
and people that are set
and resolv<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in their opinions, will
not be satisfied with never so much
more.</p>
               <p>I should now draw to an end,
but I am loath to leave you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some particular <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
These</hi> I shall lay down
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109534:61"/>
plainly and briefly in the ensuing
periods.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THe Persons that are to come to
the Sacrament may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Either
<hi>such</hi> as do <hi>repent</hi> and are <hi>sorry</hi> for
their <hi>Sins,</hi> but have not yet in <hi>any</hi>
good degree <hi>prevailed</hi> over them;
or, Those <hi>other</hi> more <hi>improved</hi> and
<hi>grown</hi> Christians, who in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
measure have mastered their
Sins, and are endowed with many
habits of Holiness and Virtue.
The <hi>first</hi> sort are yet under the
<hi>Law, viz.</hi> a state of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>
of Sin, but have not attained
to the glorious <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> or the state of power over
them. But the others have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <hi>that</hi> power in competent
measure, so that sin doth not reign
in their mortal bodies, because they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109534:61"/>
are not <hi>under the Law,</hi> but <hi>under
Grace.</hi> For distinction sake I call the
first sort, <hi>Bare Penitents;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the <hi>Faithful.</hi> Now the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations</hi>
that concern <hi>these</hi> are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as their states are.</p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>bare Penitents,</hi> and
<hi>sorrowers</hi> for Sin, I advise them to
<hi>prepare</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> following.</p>
               <p>(1) Endeavour to make your
selves as <hi>sensible</hi> as you can of the
<hi>evil</hi> of <hi>sin;</hi> Consider it as <hi>enmity</hi>
unto God, and to your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
as the <hi>basest ingratitude,</hi> and
the <hi>greatest deformity;</hi> as a thing to
be <hi>hated</hi> for <hi>it self,</hi> if there were
no consideration had to its <hi>effects.</hi>
Look upon it as the destroyer of
your <hi>present,</hi> as well as <hi>future</hi> peace
and felicity; as the enslaver of
your souls to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that
which debaseth them to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and condition of <hi>beasts.</hi> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
such considerations in your
thoughts by all the circumstances
that may render sin odious to you.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109534:62"/>
(2) Consider the <hi>gracious</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Covenant</hi> that God hath
made with us in his Son; That by
that Covenant he hath assured all
true <hi>Penitents</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> of their
Sins, and <hi>strength</hi> against them. So
that be our Sins never so <hi>many,</hi> or
so <hi>hainous,</hi> they will be <hi>forgiven,</hi> if
we <hi>repent</hi> and turn from them;
and be they never so <hi>strong</hi> and
<hi>violent</hi> upon us, they may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
if we accept, and use the
grace that the Covenant offers to
us. Represent these things duly,
and frequently to your thoughts,
and for the making the deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on them, collect those
places of Scripture that speak so
fully of the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> of
God, his <hi>readiness</hi> to <hi>pardon,</hi> and
<hi>desires</hi> of our <hi>happiness,</hi> the <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
and <hi>free offers</hi> of his kindness;
His <hi>invitations</hi> to Sinners to come
unto him, and his often <hi>bewailings</hi>
of their <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>hardness</hi> in
running from him: Consider that
he sent his Son into the World to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109534:62"/>
seek, and to save <hi>them that were lost,</hi>
to bring <hi>sinners to repentance,</hi> to <hi>take
away the sins of the World,</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi>
us from the <hi>wrath to come,</hi> and that
the <hi>World through him might be
saved;</hi> I say, draw together <hi>such</hi>
passages, <hi>dwell</hi> upon them in thy
Meditations, till thou hast <hi>fill'd</hi> thy
Soul with them. And then thou
wilt finde great incouragement to
seek for pardon, and wilt be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
against those faintings, and
despondencies, that the meer sense
of Sin, without a Saviour, might
occasion in thy Soul.</p>
               <p>(3) After this, summon up all
thy <hi>Resolutions</hi> against thy Sins:
Consider thy <hi>Baptismal</hi> ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> and
<hi>necessary</hi> they were; Resolve to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi>
them by <hi>new Vows.</hi> Content
not thy self with some <hi>cold</hi> and
<hi>indefinite</hi> intentions of leading a
new Life <hi>some</hi> time or <hi>other,</hi> but
indeavor to settle in a <hi>firm, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable</hi>
purpose of <hi>fighting</hi> against
<hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>living</hi> unto <hi>God.</hi> Do all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109534:63"/>
thou canst by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
by the <hi>Considerations</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi> and of
<hi>Interest,</hi> to fix thy soul <hi>here.</hi> And
then,</p>
               <p>(4) Be <hi>earnest</hi> with God <hi>in
Prayer,</hi> to give thee a fuller sight
of Sin, and <hi>clearer, surer</hi> thoughts
of <hi>pardoning</hi> Mercy: To present
thee with more arguments to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thy resolutions, and to make
thy soul <hi>more</hi> capable of being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them. I say, apply thy self
unto God by <hi>Prayer, publick, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi>
and <hi>secret</hi> prayer, confessing
thy own vileness, acknowledging
his Mercies, and resolving new
obedience. And being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</p>
               <p>(5) Look on the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as thy great <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
As <hi>that</hi> to which God calls
thee, and the state and necessities
of thy soul call thee; As that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
in which thou <hi>art</hi> to <hi>seek,</hi>
and <hi>mayst expect pardon</hi> and <hi>strength,
resolution,</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> Consider <hi>this,</hi>
and raise thine <hi>appetite</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109534:63"/>
for <hi>they that hunger
and thirst after righteousness shall be
filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now when thou hast exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
thy self <hi>in these</hi> acts, and the
time of the holy Communion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
Then</p>
               <p>(6) Imploy thy time in <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening</hi>
and <hi>affectionate</hi> thoughts of
Christ thy Lord. Consider the
<hi>greatness</hi> of his <hi>Condescension,</hi> the
<hi>kindness</hi> of his <hi>Vndertaking,</hi> the
<hi>boliness</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>purity</hi> of
his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>heaviness</hi> of his
<hi>Sufferings,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
and the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
Turn thy thoughts earnestly,
and often, upon <hi>these</hi> and <hi>such</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the History of the holy
Jesus, and by them dispose thy self
to a befitting remembrance of him
at his Table.</p>
               <p>And (Lastly) Gather up all thy
thoughts and resolutions together,
<hi>viz.</hi> thy <hi>apprehensions</hi> of the <hi>vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of <hi>sin,</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
and the <hi>merits</hi> of thy <hi>Lord;</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:109534:64"/>
Thy <hi>purposes</hi> of leaving every evil
way, and of renewing thy <hi>baptismal
Vows;</hi> and say to thy self, Now is
the time come that I must use <hi>these
thoughts</hi> and <hi>resolves,</hi> that I may
obtain pardon, and strength, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over sin, and assurance of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
My Lord invites me to the
great <hi>representation</hi> of the evil of
sin in his <hi>own sufferings;</hi> to see his
<hi>Body wounded,</hi> and his <hi>Soul made an
Offering for Sin,</hi> in the <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Bread
broken,</hi> and <hi>Wine poured out,</hi> To
remember his <hi>Conquest</hi> over <hi>Sin</hi> by
<hi>Death,</hi> and a glorious <hi>Resurrection;</hi>
To see the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and
pardon <hi>sealed:</hi> He invites me to
<hi>these</hi> Priviledges, and call upon
me to bind my self stronger in this
holy Covenant, and thereby to
make my self the subject of those
blessings it assures and conveys.
I say, imploy thy Soul in such
thoughts, and bring them with
thee to the Lords Table, spread
them before him <hi>there</hi> in humble
Confessions, Supplications, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109534:64"/>
and thou mayst
then expect to receive the benefit
thou art seeking after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These</hi> are <hi>Preparations</hi> for a <hi>bare
Penitent,</hi> that hath yet made but
little progress in subduing of his
Sins. And though the <hi>highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi>
of all these are not absolutely
necessary to the coming of <hi>such</hi> to
the Lords Table; yet the <hi>more</hi> they
have been exercised in them, so
much the <hi>better</hi> it is, by so much
they re <hi>more prepared,</hi> and so <hi>much
more</hi> they may expect of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
But if your minds, that have
not been used to <hi>spiritual</hi> things,
will not fix long on <hi>such</hi> thoughts
and meditations: Ingage them, as
<hi>far</hi> as you <hi>can;</hi> proceed in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
prescribed with that <hi>diligence</hi>
and <hi>care</hi> that becomes one that is
<hi>serious.</hi> And <hi>then,</hi> though your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
be <hi>imperfect now,</hi> they
may be <hi>more compleat</hi> against <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
season.</hi> If thou art sensible they
have been so <hi>defective,</hi> maintain and
keep up that sense, and resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109534:65"/>
it, to indeavor to fit thy self <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for <hi>another</hi> Sacrament, by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>same</hi> method, which will
be <hi>easier</hi> for thee in the <hi>progress</hi> than
it was in the <hi>beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other sort, <hi>viz.</hi> II. <hi>Those</hi>
that have <hi>advanced</hi> in the <hi>conquest</hi> of
their <hi>sins;</hi> They are to <hi>act over all
the former particulars,</hi> that I have
advised to the <hi>bare Penitents:</hi> For
being <hi>yet sinners,</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> they
have need to use <hi>that</hi> Method: And
there are these few <hi>other Directions</hi>
to be briefly added that do further
concern them.</p>
               <p>(1) Call your selves to a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
account concerning your <hi>sins,</hi>
examining <hi>what vices</hi> you are <hi>most
addicted</hi> to; and <hi>what</hi> are the <hi>sins</hi>
of your <hi>tempers,</hi> or of your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
and <hi>Calling:</hi> when you have
found <hi>those,</hi> exercise <hi>particular acts</hi>
of <hi>Repentance</hi> upon them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
your resolutions against them.
Consider, that allowance of them
is inconsistent with <hi>sincerity,</hi> and a
state of true <hi>regeneration;</hi> That 'tis
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109534:65"/>
necessary you should oppose and
subdue them; and that the holy
<hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be used as a <hi>means</hi>
for that blessed end.</p>
               <p>(2) Examine <hi>what ground</hi> you
have got <hi>upon your sins</hi> since the <hi>last
Sacrament,</hi> whether you are now
more <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>fearful</hi> of <hi>offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God</hi> than you were <hi>before;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your <hi>inclination</hi> to any evil
be <hi>more weakened</hi> and mortified?
If <hi>so,</hi> take encouragement hence <hi>to
go on</hi> with more Christian <hi>vigor</hi> and
<hi>resolution.</hi> If <hi>not, humble</hi> your
selves for your <hi>unfruitfulness;</hi> and
indeavor to dispose your souls to
make a <hi>better</hi> use of the <hi>next</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>(3) Inquire into the state of
your souls as to your <hi>Graces; what
Graces</hi> are wanting, and <hi>what</hi> are
<hi>weak? which</hi> are <hi>growing,</hi> and
<hi>which</hi> at a <hi>stand?</hi> and when you
have found the condition of your
souls as to <hi>these,</hi> then exercise your
<hi>meditations</hi> upon <hi>those particulars</hi>
in the <hi>Life, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:109534:66"/>
of your Lord, whom you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
at his Table, that may be
<hi>proper</hi> for <hi>your case;</hi> Apply your
thoughts, and cares, and resolutions
that way. <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the holy Sacrament for the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
of those <hi>wants,</hi> and to endeavor
to use it so, that the <hi>needed graces</hi>
may be <hi>obtain'd,</hi> and the <hi>weak</hi> ones
may be <hi>strengthened,</hi> that <hi>those</hi> that
are at a <hi>stay</hi> may be put into <hi>motion</hi>
forwards, and <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
may be <hi>further improved.</hi> If you
thus provide, and imploy your
selves in the method before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
you will then be meet
partakers of the <hi>holy Mysteries,</hi> and
may assure your selves of the <hi>bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and <hi>advantages</hi> which they
convey.</p>
               <p>THis Subject would have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
larger discourse, but my
<hi>present</hi> business was principally with
the <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>negligent,</hi> to whose
condition I have mostly applied my
self. For the <hi>others,</hi> that are solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109534:66"/>
for their souls, and desirous to
be further informed about this great
and important affair of <hi>Preparation,</hi>
I shall advise them to get, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to read and digest two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Books of the Sacrament:
The former called <hi>Mensa Mystica,</hi>
or a <hi>Discourse concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper;</hi> by Dr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Patrick;</hi> and the <hi>latter,</hi> named
the Christian Sacrifice, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most excellent <hi>Meditations</hi> and
<hi>Prayers,</hi> both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the
<hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>first design</hi> of this little
Discourse I intended to have added
some things of that sort for your
use. But while I was thinking of it,
my Pious, Learned, and Excellent
Friend the Author, sent me one of
those his last Books, the <hi>Devotion</hi>
and <hi>Piety</hi> of which is <hi>extraordinary;</hi>
and there is nothing, that I know,
fitter to <hi>prepare</hi> your <hi>affections,</hi> and
to excite them to the noblest
height of <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>love</hi> than those
<hi>heavenly Meditations:</hi> And you
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109534:67"/>
cannot use more <hi>proper, judicious,</hi> or
<hi>affectionate Prayers</hi> than those he
hath annext. So that I was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad when I saw this useful,
much needed Work so incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
well done, that there was no
occasion of my doing any more in
it, than earnestly to recommend
that book to your perusal. And I
intreat you to get it into your
Houses, and from time to time to
indeavor to warm your souls by it,
