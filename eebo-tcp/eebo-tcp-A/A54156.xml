            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is certainly very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that any ſhould be denied the liberty of Wording their own Belief, ſince there is nothing more Juſt than that Peoples Faith ſhould be taken at their <hi>own hands;</hi> for how elſe can it be theirs? And yet it is the Diſadvantage we lie under, that our Enemies will not let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we do believe, leſt they fail of their Ends, which is to make us in the Wrong, <hi>whether we are or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All other Perſwaſions have the Happineſs of being taken upon their
<pb facs="tcp:106223:3"/>
own Confeſſions; but we, alas, at our Adverſaries Perverſions: Tho' where Premiſes are not agreed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions can never be juſt. The firſt Queſtion between Us and our Oppoſers, is not about what is <hi>Sound,</hi> but what we <hi>Believe;</hi> and that it ſeems, muſt not be of our own giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of our Adverſaries ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The moſt Intolerable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that any one ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the Faith that is not theirs. Yet ſo it is where one Man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to go for another Man's Belief, which makes it plain to the Judicious Inquirer, ſome People will not allow that any Good can come out of our <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and are much more fearful we ſhould be in the <hi>Right</hi> than in the <hi>Wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106223:3"/>
And as they treat our Principles, ſo they do our Practices; for if we collect Money to relieve the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of our Poor, it ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Fund for Rebellion: And our Monthly, Quarterly and Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings, conſtituted for the Promotion of Peace, Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt be interpreted an <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in Imperio,</hi> a Deſign no leſs than to ſuperſede the Laws and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the Kingdom. One while we ought to be ſuppreſs'd, as a Confuſed and Immethodical Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; another time, becauſe we have Meetings of Church Order and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. In ſhort, rather than fail, our very Virtues muſt be made our Vices, by the ſame Figure that our bleſſed Saviour was ſaid by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb facs="tcp:106223:4"/>
Jews, to caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils.</p>
            <p>And indeed any Candid and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Perſon, who has read the Books lately publiſhed againſt us, muſt ſee ſo much of this Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as to think we might have ſaved our ſelves the pains of this, and our other Anſwers: But leſt our Silence ſhould be miſtaken for our Guilt, and <hi>F. Bug</hi>'s aſſurance, in his Addreſs, paſs for Truth; we have perſwaded our ſelves once more to beſtow an Anſwer upon him, which we recommend, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to thy Impartial Peruſal.</p>

            <head>A <hi>Juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE ſingle Conſideration that could induce us to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſo <hi>Scurrilous</hi> as well as injurious a <hi>Paper,</hi> as that which was preſented to the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us (the People called <hi>Quakers)</hi> by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> is, leſt the Confidence and Solemnity of the <hi>Addreſs,</hi> ſhould give it any Weight with thoſe that know neither him nor us; for to others this <hi>Defence</hi> would be wholly unneceſſary; this troubleſome Man being neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to his own Conſcience, nor juſt to Us and our Profeſſion, in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt us. To know this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily, it is only needful to conſider the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Merit</hi> of his <hi>Paper,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Confident</hi> and <hi>Abuſive,</hi> and then our <hi>Reader</hi> will be able to determine, if we are that pernicious People to Religion and Civil Society, he would repreſent us,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106223:5"/>
and He that <hi>Convert, Patriot</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> he vainly ſets up for, in his buſie <hi>Work</hi> againſt us. But we muſt premiſe, leſt we ſhould be miſunderſtood, that we would not be thought to <hi>Excuſe</hi> our ſelves from ill things, if guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He and his Abettors are <hi>Ill Men;</hi> for that will not <hi>Excuſe</hi> us, though it ought to rebate their <hi>Credit,</hi> where a Point depends upon their <hi>Veracity.</hi> For we will allow, that what an <hi>Ill Man</hi> alledges, when it is upon <hi>good Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is <hi>Valid,</hi> though he be not; yet where a Witneſs is found <hi>falſe,</hi> there is Reaſon to ſuſpect, if not <hi>disbelieve</hi> him in all the reſt. However, let every thing have its due Weight, and we will abide the Conſequence of ſo fair an Inquiry; Knowing that we are abuſed where we are made Criminal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then we ſay, that this Man acts not upon Principle, but <hi>Prejudice;</hi> not of Conſcience, but <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Intereſt:</hi> And if this appear, to be ſure it muſt weigh much againſt him with all <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Spirits.</hi> Now, that this is the Caſe, let it be conſidered, that after a long and ſober <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſame Judgment</hi> with us, he Revolted from us, as he confeſſeth, not for any Diſſatisfaction
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106223:5"/>
with us about our <hi>Principles,</hi> relating either to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip</hi> (the uſual reaſon for changing of Communions) on the contrary, he ſeem'd to Cool to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe we did not, in his opinion, adhere to them as ſtrictly as in former times; faulting us for quiting (as he alledg'd) in Practice our Characteriſtick Principle, of directing all Men to the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt in themſelves,</hi> as a ſufficient Guide in Religion, becauſe we, as an orderly People, recommended and preſs'd Good Order and Diſcipline as requiſite to the preſervation of Society. And becauſe we could not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him in all points upon a meer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Difference, with one of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that about a Money-matter too, He flings off his wonted Reſpect and Regards, grows <hi>Murmuring, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining</hi> and <hi>Troubleſome;</hi> finding Faults, his better Mind and Temper never let him ſee before, and takes part with thoſe that would not be under any Rules of Society, for Common Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Decency in that Relation, or in things that purely regard Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Juſtice, Peace, Charity,</hi> &amp;c. and a ſincere walking according to their Profeſſion. Here he intereſted himſelf as a buſie Advocate for thoſe, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106223:6"/>
our uſual Plea of <hi>every Man's being left to the Light of Chriſt in the Conſcience, as to Matters that concern Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> would weakly leave every Man in Society to his Freedom, about the External Rules and Orders of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whether he would act in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or Independently, or act at all: Which naturally diſſolves Society, and brings every Member to an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency one towards another.</p>
            <p>Having made this ſtep himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Diſ-Unity, he halts here a while, and ſets up for a ſtrict <hi>Walker, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Quakers firſt Doctrine,</hi> and a fervent Advocate for it; charging ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Elders with too much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency about it, if not Declenſion from their old Fundamental; as if they that had formerly preach'd others <hi>from Man,</hi> to an inward Principle, were now preaching them <hi>to Man</hi> again; and who had before decry'd <hi>Impoſition,</hi> were now become <hi>Impoſers</hi> themſeves. And what was all this for, but becauſe we diſtinguiſhed upon the Extent of our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, limiting it to things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Faith and Worſhip? But as to what related meerly to the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> or Society, the Concurrence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106223:6"/>
the <hi>Generality</hi> ſhould ſuffice; of which I have already ſpoken, to wit, <hi>Charity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> againſt which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience never can be warrantably plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Here he became an Advocate for them, (in the Name of <hi>Chriſtian-Liberty)</hi> that having ſince ſeen the Miſchief of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Plea</hi> in the wrong Place, would ſooner periſh than become One for him in his abuſive (and Self-condemning) Practices againſt us. He then had no Scruple concerning our Belief of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that it was not full or Expreſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor about our owning or diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Chriſt, nor the Vertue and Benefit of his <hi>Death</hi> and Sufferings to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> nor what we hold of the <hi>Reſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ection</hi> of the Dead, or about the Uſe of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi> nor <hi>laſtly</hi> of our Judgment about <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Worſhip:</hi> Not one word of theſe things, as the Pretence or <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his <hi>Diſlike</hi> of us, or <hi>Separation</hi> from us, did he ever object. And he knows very well, it is not one way to define theſe things in our <hi>Miniſtry</hi> or Writings, otherwiſe, than as they are left in the Scriptures of Truth, that ſo we may avoid the Dangerous Evil of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106223:7"/>
and Superſining upon the Text, which does not only ſet the Head at Work inſtead of the Heart unto Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration (the great Requiſite in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but hardly ever fails to occaſion Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie and Diviſion, if not Hatred at Laſt, even to <hi>Perſecution</hi> it ſelf; as all time witneſſeth againſt that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>Nor was our diſſatisfaction about theſe things (as he well knows) the <hi>Ground</hi> of our Separation from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or other Churches, but the Work of God's Grace and Spirit in our Hearts, which alone can make the Living and right Chriſtian and Chriſtian Churches. And ſuch as we are ſenſible, have their Eyes opened, and their Hearts touched and affected with this holy Spirit, we receive and have fellowſhip with; as we diſſent from thoſe, that make not the Work of God's Spirit the Ground of their Miniſtry, Worſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; according to that known and weighty ſaying of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Having a Form of Godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> (in Practice) <hi>the Power thereof, from ſuch turn away.</hi> So that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Buſtle he now makes againſt us, in reference to the aforementioned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106223:7"/>
               <hi>Doctrines,</hi> they were <hi>Unconcerned</hi> in the Reaſon of his Separation. For it is not Credible as well as Reaſonable, that he ſhould then palliate his Diſſatisfaction with us (if any he had) in reference to them, ſince he ſhews himſelf ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now to Create Occaſions againſt us. As it is very Probable, that had he been Conſcienciouſly doubtful about any point of Faith, he would often have earneſtly endeavoured our better <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> or his own, by Conſciencious Conferences with us to that Purpoſe; which we can boldly ſay, he never did. What a Sort of a <hi>Convert</hi> then muſt this Man be, and what a kind of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> has he <hi>Carried</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> he now embraces? However he <hi>carried Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> againſt us, and has found <hi>Indigency;</hi> and ſome of them have Imploy'd the one, and Supply'd the other; and Doubtleſs while they pay him well, they ſhall have him a ready and <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Tool</hi> againſt their <hi>Peaceable</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

have reaſon to believe is his <hi>Caſe;</hi> ſince his <hi>London-Factors</hi> have ſadly complained of the <hi>Dulneſs</hi> of the Market. For tho his <hi>Cargo</hi> was large, they could get but 50 <hi>Shillings</hi> for him. And to give them their Due, they deſired him to <hi>ſtop</hi> his hand, for they had more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, than they knew what to do with. This (doubtleſs) put his wits to work for a <hi>freſh ſupply;</hi> and we ſee, with the help of the <hi>Bp. of N's Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi> the effect of it: And yet when his new <hi>Cloths, Horſe</hi> and <hi>Pocket-Mony</hi> for the Expedition are diſcounted, with the many <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi> that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away at the <hi>Lobbies</hi> of both <hi>Houſes,</hi> his <hi>Harveſt</hi> muſt fall ſhort of his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;</hi> as (Thanks be to Almighty God) did the <hi>Deſign</hi> ſome had againſt us by thoſe endeavours.</p>
            <p>So that it may be truly ſaid of him, he hath ſold himſelf to do wickedly, if the moſt malicious and abuſive Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be called ſo. He is indeed in ſome Reſpects our Excerciſe; but it is our greateſt Trouble that in the End he will bring upon himſelf Deſtruction if he repent not.</p>

We are ſorry too, that ſome Men of note in the <hi>Church,</hi> (doubtleſs not altogether of their <hi>Own</hi> Inclination) ſhould turn <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> for the <hi>Books</hi> of ſo <hi>Unconſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> a <hi>Convert,</hi> in Order to ſupply him in his <hi>ill Practices</hi> againſt a Body of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber People, and that are by Law indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But that the B. of <hi>N.</hi> ſhould give himſelf the Trouble of miſ-leading Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with an <hi>Apocriphal</hi> Story, of this Man's having been Inſtrumental to turn ſeveral <hi>Quakers</hi> from their Errors, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Recommendatory <hi>Alms-Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the <hi>Clergy</hi> of his Dioceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Favour of this <hi>Deſerter,</hi> ſeems to us in no wiſe to become his Better Character. For beſides that the Fact is not True, it cannot be Charity, to ſupport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a Spirit of Envy and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that can reconcile <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Work with <hi>Charity,</hi> muſt read the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>Backwards,</hi> and turn <hi>Turk</hi> in order to be a Chriſtian. And this ſort of buſie and vexatious Work in ſuch Church-men, at this time a-day, but too plainly ſhews they are grown weary of <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> how much ſoever they boaſted themſelves to us of allowing it, at its being ſettled by Law, to leſſen the Kindneſs and Security of the <hi>Liberty</hi> we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106223:9"/>
enjoyed before. For they that are as troubleſome as the Law will permit them to be, want only more Power to be more troubleſome. And we hope we ſhall take the Aim by it, the thing gives us; ſince of ſome Men it may be ſaid, Can a <hi>Black-a-moor change his Skin, or a Leopard his Spots?</hi> There muſt be a Miracle in the Caſe, or it can never be done. But how any <hi>Perſon</hi> of that <hi>Coat</hi> can heartily be Friends to the Preſent <hi>Government,</hi> and Spit in the Face of the <hi>Liberty</hi> that is (as it were) an <hi>Article</hi> of its <hi>Original Contract,</hi> is another Dilemma, I will not ſay <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> that ſome of them have of late (at beſt unadviſedly) run themſelves into.</p>
            <p>We are very far from Concluding and Condemning all that wear it (as too many treat us) by their Unkindneſs and plain Violation of our Lawful Quiet, who too palpably encourage ſome <hi>Renegades</hi> to roar out their Anger at us, while we are <hi>quiet</hi> in the Land; and leaſt of all to ſuſpect the Inclinations of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that has with ſo much Humanity, as well as Regard to <hi>Natural Right, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Law to Liberty.</hi> But at the ſame time we would willingly believe, theſe active <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> that are thus flinging their <hi>Bombs</hi> among us (which is indeed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106223:9"/>
a plain Diſturbance of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and at leaſt the Seeds of <hi>Perſecution)</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many, nor out of the Obſervation of our <hi>Superiours:</hi> We would hope a much better Temper affects the Generality. Yet theſe Actions are but too lively an Inſtance of the <hi>Warm Work</hi> ſuch violent Spirits would renew in theſe poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, if their <hi>Power</hi> did but equal their <hi>Will,</hi> which (we pray) God prevent and defend us from; for that <hi>Day</hi> can never happen to <hi>England,</hi> and a ſevere <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>God</hi> not follow it. It were greatly to be wiſhed, that theſe Zealots would turn their Spleen againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> and make <hi>Practice</hi> more their buſineſs than <hi>Opinion</hi> in Religion, eſpecially where <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> does not hinder Practice. It is a Scandal to the very Profeſſion of it to obſerve, what fair Quarter all ſorts of <hi>Enormities</hi> meet with from ſome of them, where a Vertuous Diſſent can find little. And truly it is only want of a due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the People, that ſupports the <hi>Credit</hi> of ſuch angry Men ſo much above their <hi>Merit:</hi> For 'tis plain, and but too common too, that they are upheld by their <hi>Character,</hi> rather than their <hi>Virtue,</hi> and are much leſs lov'd, than fear'd.</p>

Laſtly, we pray our Candid <hi>Reader</hi> to obſerve, that this troubleſome Man, that has thus ſet his <hi>Conſcience</hi> to <hi>Hackney,</hi> hath not obliged the World with any thing new and material.

Next, the <hi>Paper:</hi> The Title is, <hi>An Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Parliament.</hi> Of which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Hawker</hi> only, it matters little; to be ſure it coſt a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution:</hi> For it cannot be unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they that do nothing without Money, ſhould have <hi>Money</hi> for what they do. We ſhall conſider it in the Method of its <hi>Paragraphs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. His <hi>firſt</hi> is a <hi>Plea of Priviledges,</hi> as an <hi>Engliſh-Man,</hi> to diſcover to the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> what may be <hi>Dangerous</hi> to Church or State; and this he ſays, he has done many Years. But while he was an honeſt <hi>Quaker,</hi> and followed his <hi>Family-Affairs</hi> (which ſeemed better fitted to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as well his <hi>Duty)</hi> both his <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Dealers</hi> had Reaſon to entertain a much better Opinion of him. Well, but what ſaid the publick to this mighty <hi>Zeal</hi> for their <hi>Safety?</hi> Why, nothing: A ſad Diſappointment certainly. From whence we muſt needs ſuppoſe the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Care-</hi>leſs of their <hi>Safety,</hi> or that his <hi>Work</hi> was not worth their <hi>Notice.</hi> However, it ſeems he has got <hi>Money</hi> from ſome or other for many Years, which was his buſineſs, or without doubt he would have <hi>Waved</hi> his Priviledge long ago. A
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106223:11"/>
notable <hi>Priviledge</hi> indeed! to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Government</hi> malicious <hi>Untruths,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>diſcovering dangerous Practices,</hi> and expoſing us to their ſevere Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whom a publick Good would oblige to protect. Certainly, no Man ever read a Word of ſuch Priviledges in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right;</hi> and to be ſure, not in the greateſt <hi>Charter</hi> of all, the <hi>Bible</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His <hi>ſecond Reaſon</hi> for thus treating us, is this; viz. <hi>Becauſe, as in the Quakers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Books, ſo in their late; they ſeem to allow of an Excommunication, ſaying, Blame not before Examination; firſt underſtand, and then rebuke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But this none can think we would have done, if we were as <hi>Tardy</hi> as he repreſents us. What can be fairer than this? Where is the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi> now? Is this hiding or diſguiſing our Principles from Peoples underſtandings? Or is it the <hi>Equivocating Art</hi> and <hi>Affected Obſcurities</hi> we are charged with, ſince it ſeems we challenge a <hi>fair Enquiry,</hi> by his own Confeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>third Reaſon</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe he does not find the three</hi> Norfolk<hi>-Miniſters intend our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106223:11"/>
Perſecution, or any Alteration of the Act of Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> A Tender-hearted Man! What! for no Perſecution, nor Alteration of the Indulgence? And yet pray to have our <hi>Principles and Practices ſuppreſſed?</hi> A new ſort of Moderation: For nothing leſs is the very Title and End of his <hi>Paper,</hi> and their <hi>Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But if he may be believed, he ſays, <hi>It's morally Impoſſible to know what the Quakers Principles are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If ſo, how can they be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, or rightly Cenſured? Is not that <hi>morally Impoſſible</hi> too? <hi>Parliaments</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have other Work to do than to hunt after <hi>Impoſſibilities:</hi> Yet that ſeems to be the <hi>Task</hi> he has impos'd upon them. But though his <hi>Wits</hi> have gone a Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering by his own Confeſſion, we hope other Men find better Imployment for theirs.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon he gives for this moral Impoſſibility of underſtanding our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is, <hi>Becauſe our Books carry two Faces, and are fitted for the compaſs of all Occaſions;</hi> which he proves thus, <hi>That ſome of our Books are directed only to our Friends; others more at large, both to Teachers and People of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106223:12"/>
other Perſuaſions: And that in one ſort we ſeem to own</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>to be the Son of God, and that in the other ſort we deny him to be ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But if it be as he ſays, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be morally Impoſſible to underſtand our Writings, while he cites ſuch plain Contradictions from them. And as we think it no Crime to entitule or direct our Papers according to the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them; ſo we cannot but think it a great Contradiction in him to make us to carry <hi>Two Faces,</hi> in reference to our Principles; ſince what he repreſents in the worſt Terms is out of Books, chiefly directed to thoſe that are not of our Communion, which is to be bare-fac'd and candid in the account of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as the very Paſſages he cites (tho' very Partially) evidently prove: So that the Inſincerity he would inſinuate againſt us flees in his Face; ſince, if we were blameable for what we have writ, we can never be blamed for concealing it, which yet is the drift of this 4th Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph; the particular Citations injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly made crouded by him together, are conſidered at large by <hi>G. W.</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to two Books lately delivered to the Parliment, by the three <hi>Norfolk-Clergy-Men</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106223:12"/>
and <hi>F. B.</hi> abhorred by us, as by them and him perverted and applied, yet owned by us, the true Scope of the Context, and Intention of the Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p n="5">V. His <hi>fith Reaſon</hi> for the Suppreſſion of our Principles and Practices, is, <hi>That</hi> W. Penn, <hi>in his</hi> Defence <hi>againſt the Biſhop of</hi> Cork, <hi>p.</hi> 38. and 79. <hi>means by theſe words, That where the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſeem to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer leaſt from the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>they differ moſt,</hi> viz. touching the <hi>Engliſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> thereby repreſenting us Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and conſequently expoſing us to it: Whereas it is very plain, that not only the Drift, but the very Words of <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſhew quite another thing; for as he had explained himſelf, as to what he meant, where he ſaid, <hi>As to what we are thought to differ moſt, we differ leaſt,</hi> viz. about the Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity. So when he ſays, <hi>Where we are thought to differ leaſt, we moſt of all differ.</hi> He plainly expreſſes his meaning in thoſe words, to wit, about the Nature and Quality of a true Goſpel Miniſtry and Worſhip. <hi>Civil Government of any ſort or kind, not ſo much as being expreſs'd or meant by him upon that Subject.</hi> An
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106223:13"/>
Abuſe not only groſs, but aggravated by his Impudence; and which is ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Man, that no Perſon with whom Honeſty or Charity have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, can Patronize his Work.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. His <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>laſt Reaſon</hi> he makes to be an Inconſiſtency in our Books about Government, that in one ſort of our Books we ſeem to own <hi>Love and Honour the King, yea, to pray for all Men, for Kings and all that are in Authority;</hi> but in other of our Books, that we tell People, <hi>That Kings and Emperors ſprang up in the Night, and among Apoſtate Chriſtians; and that we are againſt the Engliſh Government,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But he gives us here neither Book nor Author, and unleſs he can prove, it is our Principle to excite Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the Civil Government we live under, of what Form, or in what Country ſoever it be, he ſays nothing to the purpoſe; for that only can render us unfit for Protection, which makes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments unſafe from our Principles; and ſuch we have ever denied; but theſe things are fully anſwered by <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Truth and Innocency vindicated;</hi> and <hi>Joſ. Wyeth,</hi> in his <hi>Anguis Flagellatus:</hi> Or, <hi>A Switch for the Snake in the Graſs;</hi> and we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106223:13"/>
think, with ſubmiſſion to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it no way becomes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Profeſſion of this Man, and thoſe that countenance him, to reflect upon us, as Temporizing about Principles of Civil Government. Thus much as to his Reaſons for his procedure againſt us.</p>
            <p>The Title of the remaining part of his Sheet, propoſed to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for our Suppreſſion, is this, <hi>Touching the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Government within the Government, and oppoſite to it, as can be proved from Matters of Fact and Practice.</hi> And the truth of it is, were he as ready at proving, as at calling Names, he would not only deſerve the Conſideration, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Government; but his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance will prove very ſhort of the encouragement he gives; becauſe he founds it upon his Forgery juſt now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; his words are theſe, <hi>Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Key to open the Myſtery of</hi> W. P<hi>'s</hi> Myſterium Magnum; <hi>that where we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to differ leaſt, we moſt of all differ; I am of</hi> W. P<hi>'s mind, that where they are believed to differ leaſt, there they differ moſt of all;</hi> namely, touching <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> His Key muſt be very Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical, as is his Myſtery; for it is plain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106223:14"/>
there is none in the Pages he quotes of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s, and his abuſe of his Words can be no Myſtery, ſince the Perverſion is ſo plain. But he that has violated the Ties of Conſcience for Revenge, can make no ſcruple of leſſer points. Our Deſtruction is the Mark he aims at; and though our Practice for above <hi>Forty Years</hi> proves not only our Conſiſtency with, but Uſefulneſs to Civil Government: Yet as if he were in Earneſt, and Religious too, he breaks forth in this Expreſſion, <hi>If God be not Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to us, and Inſpire our Governours with a Godly Zeal, to ſtop the growth of the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>Government, it may prove like that of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>who ſtuck at nothing till he had over-run the Eaſtern Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yet he would be thought no Perſecutor; but 'tis well he is not to be believed: For in one place of his Paper, he urges our Suppreſſion, becauſe of the Inconſiſtency of our unſighting Principles, with the Preſervation of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and here, as well as in other Paragraphs, he preſſes it from a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>That we, like</hi> Mahomet, <hi>and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, ſhould overthrow the Government by force.</hi> So that 'tis plain to ſuch as will give themſelves the trouble of obſerving the Method this Man takes, to render us
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106223:14"/>
both odious and dangerous, that he dare give himſelf the latitude of ſaying any thing againſt us, tho it carry the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as well as moſt abſurd Contradiction to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For the Import of what he ſays is plainly this, Suppreſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> leſt they beat us and take the Government from us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppreſs them becauſe they will not Fight at all.</p>
            <p>We bleſs the Name of God, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thoſe to whom he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his Books and Papers, is on our ſide, and conſequently gives the Lie to his unworthy Inſinuations againſt us, and 'tis becauſe Time and our Converſation have worn out the froward and falſe Impreſſions, ſome angry and intereſted People have made upon them, and that we are leſs bug-bears to the Vulgar, and more acceptable with the better ſort that he and other Perſons are ſet at work by ſome private Incendiaries againſt us.</p>
            <p>As for his firſt proof, That we are a Government within the Government, and therefore againſt the Government, which is begging the Queſtion, it is not matter of Fact, but matter of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106223:15"/>
               <hi>viz. That God will overturn, overturn, King, Princes and States of this World, for Sin and Ungodlineſs, till Righteouſneſs take Place, and prevail with them by the Ruling of Jeſus Chriſt in their Hearts.</hi> This he applies to us in reſpect of our diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Engliſh Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it relates to no particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Form of Government, which in all Countries to be ſure aims at <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Virtue in the General, but intends the Evil adminiſtration of all ſorts of Governours and Magiſtrates every where. This is ſo far from being a fault, that it is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God, and the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of all good Men; and was writ by way of <hi>Caution</hi> to the then ruling Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>His Second, Third, Fourth, and ſo to the end of his Twelfth Inſtance, which he gives for proof of our being Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Government, are his <hi>Remarks</hi> upon our proceeding in our <hi>Yearly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which he performs with as ill a Mind, and juſt as much Truth, as he makes <hi>W. P.</hi> to mean Civil Government in p. 97. of his Defence againſt the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Cork,</hi> his <hi>Key</hi> by which he opens that great Myſtery of <hi>W. P</hi>'s in ſaying, <hi>Where we are thought to differ leaſt, there we moſt of all differ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106223:15"/>
He ſays <hi>we have a</hi> Yearly-Meeting, <hi>that this</hi> Yearly-Meeting <hi>is made up of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Meetings, as</hi> Monthly <hi>and</hi> Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>That the Authority of it is the</hi> Light within, <hi>which is the</hi> Higher Power, <hi>by which they make and conſtitute certain</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Canons <hi>Eccleſiaſtical, contrary to the King's Prerogative,</hi> Rights of Parliament, <hi>and</hi> Fundamental Laws of the Land; And that <hi>we virtually repeal ſuch parts and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Laws as do not quadrate with our</hi> Light within; <hi>and thereby</hi> Abſolve <hi>the King's Subjects from their active Obedience, cauſing them to adhere to a</hi> Superiour <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that of Kings, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is the Charge, but where to find the proof we cannot tell, for we think his Authority is too Apocryphal to paſs for ſuch.</p>
            <p>That we have a <hi>Yearly-Meeting</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and that it is made up of Perſons ſent from the <hi>Quarterly-Meetings</hi> in the reſpective Counties is alſo true; but this only relates to our own Society, and refers but to ſuch things as are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Duty, and fall under the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any Chriſtian Communion: Nor indeed has it more Authority, though it may have a greater Influence; the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

thereof being compriſed under theſe Four Heads, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That we are at <hi>Peace</hi> among our ſelves, both in reſpect to our ſelves, and in reſpect to our Perſuaſion and Commerce; a <hi>Juſtice</hi> not only due to every Society, but the <hi>Duty</hi> of It for its own Preſervation. <hi>2dly, Charity,</hi> that where there is the greateſt need and leaſt ability to anſwer it, Care be taken to proportion Relief: Thus the <hi>Poverty</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> after the War, the great <hi>Dearth</hi> now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Spoils</hi> made on our Friends in ſome parts of <hi>Germany</hi> for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake; as alſo the <hi>Supply and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of <hi>Captives,</hi> have and do oblige us to recommend Charity to our Friends, that none among us may ſuffer want. <hi>3dly, Compaſſion</hi> to our Friends in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe caſes are there conſidered in order to conſider of ſuitable Remedies, which perhaps cannot be ſo well done in the reſpective places where the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ariſes: But this alas extends no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an humble <hi>Application</hi> to our Superiours upon the Cognizance we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Fact, for a ſeaſonable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <hi>Redreſs:</hi> We pretend not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but intreat, not to make Laws as is ſuggeſted, but Supplicate Relief, be it in Relation to any hardſhip by Law,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106223:16"/>
or a partial Adminiſtration of it. <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That all be careful to walk up to their Profeſſion, as the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And this being the Buſineſs of our <hi>Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting,</hi> we take leave to hope, we ſhall not be miſ-interpreted by the King and Parliament, as if we were erecting an <hi>Imperium in Imperio;</hi> ſince theſe things ought to be ſo far from rendring us dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and odious to Government, that they muſt rather recommend us to it; for our Obligations being Voluntary to each other, founded on Love and Choice, where is the Scandal that we are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Magiſtrate that we are thus employ'd? Since by theſe Chriſtian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he will naturally find his care and work ſit the lighter upon his hands? Nor does this juſtle with the Laws of the Land, ſince by Law we are allowed our Liberty, as Proteſtant Diſſenters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we muſt be notwithſtanding eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies to Government uſing it; or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Charity enough to relieve our Friends from Want or Suffering, or maintain and encourage Peace and Piety. It ſeems our very Virtues are our Crimes with this ill Man, and our Chriſtian care muſt be matter of <hi>Danger</hi> to the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106223:17"/>
'Tis true indeed, ſo far as any Man diſſents from Law, be it upon the moſt religious ground that can be, he may be ſaid to contradict the Law; and according to this Man's way of reading it, his perſuading others to be of the ſame Sentiment, or be true to that he has, is <hi>ſeducing</hi> the King's Subjects, and ſo far, <hi>Contradicting</hi> or <hi>Repealing</hi> the Kings Laws: Which, as it is a moſt unworthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our practice to expoſe us to the diſpleaſure of Authority, ſo it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends every Conſciencious Perſon or Party of Men, in this or any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſequently all Societies of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> every where muſt be <hi>Rebels</hi> to the Government they live under.</p>
            <p>But he ſays, <hi>We keep our Doors lock'd, barr'd or bolted, or a Guard of Men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Inſpection, whereby we have forfeited the benefit of the Act of</hi> Toleration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we very well know is what he would be at, but as it happens theſe are not Meetings intended for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which are <hi>Open;</hi> nor are theſe <hi>barr'd, lock'd</hi> or <hi>bolted,</hi> or <hi>guarded,</hi> as he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to phraſe it, eſpecially out of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Undutifulneſs to Government, or Prejudice to any Perſon upon Earth. But as the ſubject matter of this Meeting, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106223:17"/>
concerns the help and Comfort of our particular Society, in things <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Laudable,</hi> ſo it often happens there are many more preſent than thoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned: And if our Numbers are leſs, and Meeting more private, than what is common, it is not for fear or ſhame, but to do and diſpatch ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as hath been already obſerved.</p>
            <p>Well! but he will have this a <hi>general Rendevouz from almoſt all parts of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where is the harm of it, if it were ſo? Tho 'tis very rare that any are preſent from other Countries, except In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and that of Choice; but they are always welcome when they come, for our Eſtabliſhment is not of <hi>Compulſion</hi> but <hi>Voluntary:</hi> Nor do we make Laws either for <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as he ſuggeſts in this his 6th Inſtance; though we are careful that the Churches every where ſhould walk correſpondent to their Profeſſion, to which commonly they receive from this Meeting a general Chriſtian Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: In all which we cannot ſee the leaſt <hi>diſreſpect</hi> or <hi>inſecurity</hi> to the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>His 7th Inſtance is, <hi>That we have a Fund, or Common Stock, which this Meeting orders to be raiſed without the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106223:18"/>
in order to ſupport our Government, and propagate our Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis eaſily ſeen what this fooliſh Man would be at, but it will not do. This Meeting orders no ſuch thing: But as it is informed of the State of the whole Society, ſo it recommends the <hi>Wants</hi> of it to the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution</hi> of the reſpective Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which perhaps in others would be a Mark of a <hi>True</hi> Church, though in us, of what pleaſes this <hi>Renegado,</hi> and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Imployers; we wiſh them <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion.</hi> However, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has, nor can tell us what other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we have, than that which hath been already expreſs'd and owned by us. And we are ſure he can never prove, that we uphold it by Money; ſince our Services are free, who are the Members of that Aſſembly, or any other amongſt us. We are not of thoſe who have made a <hi>Trade</hi> of Religion, nor that get by Church Government. He himſelf is better inſtructed: And but that he has thrown off all Conſideration of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Shame, he could inform the World much better of the Reaſon and Motive of our Proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106223:18"/>
But in his 8th Inſtance he would have it believed, <hi>That when the Nation was actually ingaged in a War with</hi> France, <hi>even then we took care that our Friends ſhould not be aſſiſtant; nay, not ſo much as to carry Guns in their Ships.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Inſinuation is plain, as if it were only then our Principle, to ſerve a Preſent Turn of Diſaffection, and not our former and conſtant Practice. But all that have known us from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, muſt vindicate us from his Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for this Story of <hi>Pennſilvania,</hi> as if our Friends there were of another Mind or Practice, 'tis an effect of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, as hath been already made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>In his 9th and 10th Heads he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, <hi>Intelligence Foreign and Domeſtick, to be one part of the buſineſs of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He might as well except againſt the <hi>Martyrs</hi> upon the <hi>Reformation,</hi> who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with the Proteſtants of <hi>France, Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and no doubt of it but he would have done it then, as well as Doctor <hi>Story,</hi> and for the ſame Motives. Our Correſpondence is of <hi>Church,</hi> and not of State Matters; and though foreign ſometimes, yet not <hi>Foreign
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106223:19"/>
from our Obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> intermeddling with nothing, relating to temporal buſineſs. We are glad to hear of our Friends Wellfare, and uſually do at theſe Meetings: But unleſs it be <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> we know no Occaſion of Correſpondence that is not within this Kingdom and the Dominions thereunto belonging. We would conclude theſe Inſtances here but for this extraordinary paſſage of his, which we will barely repeat, becauſe it doth ſo exactly ſhew the Man, both in his <hi>Temper, Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> viz. <q>I ſay, when this united <hi>Confederacy (viz.</hi> out of <hi>Maryland, Virginia, Barbadoes, Jamaica, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſie, Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, New-England, North-Carolina, Road-Iſland, Long-Iſland, Antegoa, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Port-Royal, Dantzick, Hamburgh, Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Saxony, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.) I ſay, <hi>ſays he,</hi> when this <hi>united Confederacy</hi> are moved, either by their <hi>Light within,</hi> or by a motion of their <hi>inſpired Prophets</hi> to call to their Aſſiſtance <hi>Two or Three Regiments</hi> from each of thoſe places, what will become of poor <hi>England?</hi> Then, tho too late, we may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Truth of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s words, <hi>viz.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106223:19"/>
Where we believed the Quakers differed from us leaſt, there they moſt of all differed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This, Reader, is ſuch a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Author, that there ſeems left no room for us to ſay any thing upon it.</p>
            <p>He concludes by way of Apology for his Undertaking, <hi>That tho the Quakers have the Confidence to dictate, in the Name of God, to Kings and Parliaments what they are to do, he hopes he ſhall not follow their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but when he has diſcharged his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as an Engliſh-man and a Chriſtian, he ſhall ſubmit all to the Wiſdom of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, not doubting but to make proof of what he has ſaid, either out of our Books, or by his own Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are glad to hear he will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any thing, but eſpecially to the Wiſdom of his Superiours, and thence hope he will be quiet, provided he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members what he ſays; for their Great Wiſdom having neglected to take any notice of his Attempts, he is obliged to acquieſce in their Silence. All things do not deſerve an expreſs Sentence, and to ſuch ſilence is ever one: And if he has any reſpect for that Example, he would do well to follow it. However, we can have no Apprehenſion of the Conſequence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106223:20"/>
of what Evidence he can produce from our Writings, that have ſo much to ſhew of his abuſing of them. But for his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> he muſt excuſe us, if we except againſt it, ſince ours has taught us that he is a corrupt one, by clipping our Writings, and Coining other Senſe, a Forgery as Obvious as Groſs, and moſt reprovable with Men of Truth.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>accepting of</hi> G. Whitehead<hi>'s Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to meet him with Six, Ten or Twelve competent Witneſſes, to prove that he hath groſly and wickedly abuſed and perverted our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and wronged us in Charge, Citation and Obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We doubt not, if it proceed to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, our Friend <hi>G. W.</hi> who hath ſo often detected him of groſs Perverſions, both by Writing, and Conference in the preſence of ſeveral Eminent Perſons, will not be wanting to make good his Charge, but not for the ſake of this virulent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, but thoſe who are or may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on by him.</p>
            <p>We are come now to his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which begins with a great deal of <hi>Rant,</hi> at a Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let againſt him and his Partners, written by a <hi>Member of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>while he hath reaſon to believe</hi> (he ſays) <hi>the Author was a</hi> Real Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106223:20"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, 'twas more than we knew, as it is, that <hi>F. B.</hi> had any reaſon to think ſo; for he hath taken care to give us none, and perhaps it is becauſe he had none to give, unleſs it ſhould be this, <hi>That no Member of the Church of</hi> England <hi>would ſhew ſo much diſlike to any of the ſame Communion for challenging and expoſing the Quakers, be it with never ſo much Heat or Injuſtice.</hi> Tho we hope, and upon very good grounds too, that the generality of the Sober and Diſcreat of them have better thoughts of us, and that upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience too.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>Our Teachers are Men of deſign, and have Ends to ſerve, being, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, Men of no Fortunes, as Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men Carpenters, Taylors, Shoemakers, Combers, Weavers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We would think that ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of all others, ſhould be the moſt likely to be free from <hi>Deſign,</hi> or having <hi>Ends to ſerve.</hi> But if that be a good Reaſon which he alledges, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> muſt have been much in the right, in objecting <hi>Meanneſs</hi> againſt Chriſt and his Followers; as alſo the <hi>Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> who threw <hi>Textores</hi> and <hi>Sutores</hi> in the face of many of the firſt Reformers; who were juſt ſuch <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> as thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106223:21"/>
he intitles us to for our Miniſtry. And he knows in his Conſcience that ſuch Poor Men amongſt us, whom God hath qualified by his Spirit, to ſpeak and preſs their Knowledge and Experience for the Conviction and Edification of others, are <hi>conſcienciouſly</hi> concerned in the Exerciſe of thoſe Gifts, and that they <hi>labour hard</hi> to maintain themſelves and Families, after the Example of Primitive Teachers, that they might not be <hi>burthenſome</hi> to the Church. Nothing ſhort of the worſt of minds one would think, can make this our fault, and it muſt be one of the weakeſt that can reconcile the <hi>Talents and Education</hi> of theſe <hi>Mechanicks</hi> with the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical</hi> Crafts and Ends he ſuppoſes againſt them.</p>
            <p>But he ſays this Pamphlet <hi>ſuggeſts that</hi> F. Bugg <hi>is</hi> Judas, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>the</hi> Jews, <hi>and conſequently that the Quakers are</hi> Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will not believe him, for thoſe that abuſe Mens words, may very eaſily abuſe their meanings. However, there is no neceſſity that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould be underſtood to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> may joyn againſt them, for that they did formerly againſt his <hi>Followers</hi> as well as himſelf, if by <hi>Judas</hi> we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106223:21"/>
may underſtand <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches. But what if that Book ſuppoſes <hi>F. B.</hi> to be a <hi>Judas?</hi> Has he not been ſo to the Profeſſion he did once, Conſcienciouſly and Zealouſly adhere to, and that with the greateſt Aggravations? Let his Actions ſpeak, and he knows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well it is a word uſually borrowed to character any Perſon that has been falſe to the People or Profeſſion he once was of, and as ſuch, he may not perhaps much miſtake the Author of the Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, in applying that <hi>Epithet</hi> to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But this he will needs have for a Proof, <hi>that the Author is a Real Quaker;</hi> to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which, he obſerves to us a Story that he lately heard, of a project propoſed and carried on to acquit <hi>W. P.</hi> of the then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuſpicion of being a J—te, tho' he thinks it rather increaſed it; <hi>for,</hi> ſays he, W. P. <hi>and</hi> P. E. <hi>both juggled together, and</hi> P. E. <hi>was to be the</hi> Gentleman, <hi>and as ſuch, to write a Letter thus ſuperſcribed,</hi> To the Honourable <hi>William Penn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor and Governour of <hi>Penſilvania, and</hi> W. P. <hi>to anſwer it. Well! an anſwer to it was written, and both Printed</hi> 1688. <hi>No matter whether each wrote their part, or one wrote both, they were then both</hi> Quakers, <hi>and it was for a Deſign; and to ſerve a Turn
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106223:22"/>
they can turn their Dialect into any Shape. In like manner I take this ſubſcription of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure pretended Member of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>(by his ſcandalous Reflections) to be a Real Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But why ſo? Suppoſe his Story were true, is it impoſſible for a Church of <hi>England</hi> Man to <hi>diſlike</hi> a <hi>Renegado, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abhor</hi> his Treachery and Malice, and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance</hi> thoſe that encourage him, tho' they were of his own Communion? Say no, and We believe there are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of that Communion of that ſame Mind. For at this rate the Author of <hi>The Contempt of the Clergy</hi> muſt be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and every one that writes againſt any Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man of her Communion. But the <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> of the Story he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to about <hi>W. P.</hi> doth very much highten his reckoning. His inſinuation is, that the Letter to him, <hi>is fictitious, and that</hi> W. P. <hi>writ both, or if he did not, they were both Quakers, and therefore the ſame thing.</hi> His conſequence is, <hi>the Quakers will turn their Dialect into any Shape, to ſerve a Turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Story be falſe, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt fall to the Ground; and that it is ſo, not only <hi>W. P.</hi> denies that he is the Author of the Letter, but, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106223:22"/>
Perſon that writ it, hath owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Author of it to divers Perſons, and is well known to have never been of our Profeſſion, but for ſeveral Years hath been, and ſtill is, in a publick and eminent Employment under the preſent Government. And if this ill Man will not believe us, any Man between us ſhall have that Satisfaction, if what we ſay be ſcrupled.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as this Paper doth in two or three places of it, maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect upon our Friend <hi>W. P.</hi> as if he were <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, though we are ſatisfied that <hi>F. B.</hi> believes in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience quite other things of him; our Reader is deſired to peruſe thoſe very Letters that paſſed at that time of day (88) and he will not think his time loſt, or the worſe of <hi>W. P.</hi> We may add that in 86, and in the ſame Reign, no leſs Man than the <hi>Arch-Biſhop Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> did beg our Friend's pardon for ſo much as giving Occaſion to any to doubt of his being a Proteſtant, from ſome cold words dropt upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which Letter is extant, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his <hi>own hand,</hi> with a ſingular Reſpect as well as Vindication of him from ſuch Reflections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106223:23"/>
Upon this ſubject we ſhall only add, That he that takes <hi>pains</hi> to miſtake and abuſe People, and that at any rate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>deſerve</hi> the Countenance of honeſt Men, whatever he may of their <hi>Frowns.</hi> And we ſhould think it Labour very ill beſtowed to attempt their Conviction, that can credit him in his Endeavours againſt us, ſince they are attended with ſuch horrid Inſtances of Corruption and Prejudice. It is a common Proverb, that <hi>One Renegado is worſe than three Turks,</hi> which is true in this Man's caſe, not for his Abilities, but his <hi>Abuſes.</hi> He is the very Reverſe of Chriſtianity, for inſtead of doing good in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, he ſeems <hi>inceſſantly miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> the worſt part of which is this, that though others may be as eager, they are not ſo culpable in their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for what may be called Zeal in them, is a <hi>Self-condemning Preſumption</hi> in him: And we believe though God is pleaſed to ſuffer him to go on for a time, He will either render his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ineffectual, or make him in the Concluſion his own Condemnation and Burden; as hath fared with others leſs guilty than he hath appeared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106223:23"/>
We ſhall ſay little of his fooliſh Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations and Abuſe of a Zealons Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in a Book of <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s, who obſerving and blaming the great <hi>Pride, Luxury</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> of God, among a People of high Profeſſion in their <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe</hi> of their Plenty; This Man would have him ſay, 'tis Sin to enjoy ſuch Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſtead of a Sin to <hi>abuſe</hi> it, leſt he ſhould want an Occaſion to cenſure us in the careful Enjoyment of what God hath given us. But we cannot be ſilent under the Injury he commits againſt the Dead, in robbing that godly Young Man of the <hi>Innocency</hi> of his Death, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of his Martyrdom, by making him to have <hi>ſtarved</hi> himſelf: For his Death was occaſioned by the barbarity of the <hi>Goaler</hi> and thoſe that committed him; as the Leaves <hi>F. B.</hi> quotes out of the <hi>Serious Apology</hi> written by <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and ſome yet alive in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> can witneſs: Whoſe laſt words were, <hi>Here I dye Innocently,</hi> which he could never have done, had he been <hi>Acceſſary</hi> to his own Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſome may ſtill object, that they hear nothing againſt the</hi> Quakers <hi>from the</hi> Presbyterians, Independents <hi>and</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, <hi>ſave only from the</hi> Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106223:24"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which he anſwers on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half <hi>of the Diſſenters, that they are one with the Church in this caſe, and are ſorrowfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that they are joyned with them in the Act of</hi> Toleration; <hi>and not only ſo, but that he has a</hi> Teſtimony well Atteſted <hi>of their abhorrence of our blaſphemous Tenents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot think the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever made this Man her Advocate, or that She and the Diſſenters have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in his Enterprize, we would ſhew a greater Reſpect to both, and have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of their Moderation. 'Tis plain he wants the credit of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, having ſo little of his own. And we are very well ſatisfied he prevaricates with his Reader, when he boaſts of a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſo well Atteſted,</hi> that it is no other than what he has <hi>Collected out of ſome of our old Adverſaries Books of thoſe Perſuaſions,</hi> which proves no <hi>Concurrence</hi> with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or either of them with him in his Addreſs to the Parliament, to have our Faith and Practice cenſur'd and ſuppreſſ'd, but rather a proof of Forgery, to give his Collection the force of a Commiſſion. His enumeration of our Tenents is the Epitome of his <hi>Perverſions:</hi> For as we cannot quit any point of our own; ſo we abhor every one of them as given by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106223:24"/>
To Conclude, that he may ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>all of a piece,</hi> he ſays to the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in the Parliament aſſembled, <hi>Here you have the Unanimous Conſent of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, both</hi> Conformiſts <hi>and</hi> Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, <hi>for the</hi> Examination <hi>or</hi> Cenſuring <hi>and</hi> Suppreſſing <hi>the Errors of the Quakers: And as this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would tend to the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the</hi> Gangreen <hi>of Quakeriſm. So 'tis hoped, and</hi> earneſtly prayed, <hi>that the ſame may be taken into your Serious Conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have made Enquiry of the ſeveral Claſſes of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and they purge themſelves from giving him any ſuch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials; and leaſt of all that they ever ſaid, as he expreſſes it in the tail of his former Paragraph, <hi>viz. That they are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully affected, that they are joyned with the Quakers in the Act of Toleration:</hi> On the contrary they are ſorry many of them, to ſee a Man pretending to Reform, fill'd with ſo much Prejudice as ſeems to them to animate him againſt us; as indeed we are that <hi>Envy</hi> as well as <hi>Untruth</hi> ſhould ſo much predominate. For under all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to mean no ſuch thing as Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all he ſays, he concludes with a freſh breath of ſeverity againſt us, in an earneſt prayer that <hi>we may be cenſured and ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Principles and Practice,</hi> that is, in our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106223:25"/>
               <hi>Religion.</hi> But thanks be to God, This Man is none of our Judge, and hath ſufficiently <hi>forfeited</hi> the Reputation of a Witneſs. We appeal to our Books in impartial Mens hands, and our conſtant Converſe among our Neighbours, if they have heard any ſuch Doctrine from our Mouths, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any ſuch Actions in our Lives, as makes up the heap of this Mans Clamour and Calumny againſt us.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Sober Reader</hi> and <hi>Inquirer,</hi> that thou may'ſt better acquaint thy ſelf with our real Principles, be pleaſed to examine them, as laid down by our ſelves (a Juſtice never to be denied to any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) which thou wilt find in two little Treatiſes, one entituled, <hi>Truths Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> by <hi>John Crook,</hi> firſt printed in 62, and divers times ſince, the other called a <hi>Key,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> now in the 10th Edition, and for a larger Account, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay</hi>'s <hi>Apology,</hi> all Sold by <hi>Tacy Sowle</hi> in <hi>White-Hart-Court</hi> in <hi>Gracious-Street;</hi> which we hope will be Satisfactory, atleaſt ſo far as to deliver us from the <hi>Frightful</hi> and <hi>Black</hi> Inſinuations of our Buſie and Angry Adverſaries, to whom we wiſh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to them that unwittingly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, a better underſtanding of us, and our ſo much miſrepreſented Principles.</p>

            <p>As for the Government of <hi>Penſilvania</hi> being guilty of <hi>Perſecution</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> as he ſuggeſts, 'tis juſt as true as all the reſt: For 'tis not only a Fundamental Law of their Government, that every Perſon ſhould enjoy a Liberty of Conſcience, but it is ſo fully practiſed, that even all other Proteſtant Perſuaſions ſhare equally with our ſelves in the Adminiſtration of the Government: The preſent Lieutenant Governour to <hi>W. P.</hi> being a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and many of the Council and Aſſembly, the Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices being of that and other diſſenting Proteſtant Communions.</p>
            <p>But as we are for Liberty of Conſcience every where, ſo we are no where for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Government affronted and abuſed, in the name of Conſcience, by Groſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Behaviour.</p>
            <p>And for our Friends there, they have been ſo far from a Spirit of Perſecution, that it is but too plain they have long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under it, from ſuch Inſolent and Abuſive Pens as this Man has treated us with.</p>
