            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere came forth about <hi>two years since,</hi> a <hi>Couple</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Pamphlets</hi> in <hi>quarto;</hi> The <hi>one,</hi> just upon the heel of the <hi>other:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> was entitled, <hi>An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. which was followed by <hi>A Seasonable Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade all the Grand Juries in England,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>latter</hi> being only an <hi>abstract</hi> and <hi>explication</hi> of the <hi>designe</hi> of <hi>the other.</hi> This <hi>Parallel</hi> was in the <hi>same Year</hi> Printed and Published by way of reflection upon the aforesaid <hi>Libles,</hi> with references to the <hi>Pages</hi> of that <hi>Edition;</hi> and the <hi>Controversy</hi> should have rested there, if the <hi>Authour</hi> had not found himself honestly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to reprint the <hi>Reply;</hi> the <hi>other side</hi> having reviv'd the occasion of it, since the death of <hi>Andrew Marvell,</hi> by a <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous Impression,</hi> with his name at length to it.</p>
            <p>There was at that time no mention or thought of the <hi>PLOT;</hi> and a man may see with half an eye that his <hi>buzzing</hi> so much about the matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> was only to make the <hi>sedition</hi> go down the better. For the main <hi>drift</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> is only <hi>the paring of the Kings nails, clipping the wings of his Prerogative,</hi> advancing a <hi>pretended Soveraignty</hi> in the <hi>people,</hi> and cutting his Majesty off from the most essential <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi> of all <hi>Government,</hi> defaming his <hi>Administration,</hi> and furnishing the world with <hi>Cases</hi> and <hi>Expedients</hi> how a <hi>Subject</hi> may kill his <hi>Prince</hi> with a <hi>good Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a body should speculate upon the <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>Re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing</hi> Mr. <hi>Marvells Pamphlet</hi> at <hi>this time,</hi> it would make the <hi>Preface</hi> longer then the <hi>Book,</hi> to recount them. First, there is <hi>money</hi> to be got by it, and that's five and fifty reasons in one. Secondly, the <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Publishing</hi> of a <hi>Libell,</hi> is lookt upon by some to be the high-way to preferment, as a <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear'd Anabaptist</hi> said t' other day, about the <hi>Appeal from the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43627:3"/>
               <hi>Country to the City; 'Tis a Nationall quarel</hi> (says he) <hi>and the Nation will stand by me in't.</hi> Thirdly, as the <hi>designe</hi> gets ground, so it gathers <hi>confidence;</hi> and that which in 77. would have been worth two or three hundred pound to the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer,</hi> may be worth twice as much now in 79. to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher</hi> and <hi>Printer.</hi> There may be a fourth end in it, to <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Mr. Marvell</hi> (now in his grave) if not for a <hi>Saint,</hi> yet for a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in shewing how pat the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> falls out to his conjecture; and that he sees further into a millstone then another man: and why may not the <hi>Replicant</hi> as well be taken for a <hi>Prophet,</hi> that foretold the <hi>Growth of Fanaticism,</hi> as well as he did the <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> and upon as good grounds too? Dr. <hi>Don</hi> in his <hi>Ignatius's Conclave,</hi> makes <hi>Ignatius</hi> to be so indu'd with the devil, that he was able to possess the very devil himself. Now whether the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> bring on the <hi>Jesuits Plot,</hi> or the <hi>Jesuits</hi> the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing one another, is not a farthing matter: But that the <hi>devil</hi> and his <hi>dam</hi> are now at work in the shape of <hi>Angels of light,</hi> to destroy our <hi>Sacred Soveraign,</hi> the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> there is no more doubt to be made, then that if it were not for the hope of <hi>another</hi> world, a man had better be hang'd out of the way, then be Honest in <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the malevolent intent of the <hi>Book</hi> it self were not so <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>manifest,</hi> that a man may <hi>run</hi> and <hi>reade</hi> it, we could produce several other Instances of the same temper that fell from the <hi>same pen,</hi> and spake the <hi>man</hi> as much an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as to the <hi>Ministers:</hi> And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the <hi>Secretary</hi> to a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> should write with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Re-publican:</hi> But we shall spare his <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> in that particular, and only tell the <hi>Reader</hi> in one word more, that tho' the <hi>many turns</hi> of <hi>State</hi> that have hapned since Mr. <hi>Marvells Account</hi> of the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government</hi> came first abroad; have laid the <hi>book</hi> open to further <hi>confutation</hi> and <hi>censure;</hi> we shall yet take no <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> of those <hi>Events,</hi> but leave this following <hi>discourse</hi> to shift for it self, <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>unlick'd,</hi> as it came <hi>first</hi> into the <hi>world.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give you my Opinion freely of the two Libels that you sent me, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Design of them lies too open to do much Mischief; for I never saw so bare-fac'd an Araignment of the Government, and all the Parts of it: <hi>King, Lords, Commons, Iudges, Ministers of State;</hi> they are all of them made <hi>Conspirators,</hi> against the Sovereign Multitude, forsooth; and when the Libeller has done with the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> he gives you a Defamatory List of betwixt two and three hundred of their <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> provoking and abusing all Sober Interests; Insomuch, that he has left himself no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trust to, but the contemplation of a <hi>General Tumult,</hi> which is the very Point he drives at in his <hi>Appeal</hi> to the <hi>Rabble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man, I confess, is a great Master of VVords; but then his Talent is that which the Lord <hi>St. Albans</hi> calls <hi>Matter of Wonder without Worthiness;</hi> being rather the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleness and Address of a Tumbler, than the Force and Vigor of a Man of Business. And you cannot but observe too, that his Excursions, many of them, are unmannerly and Vulgar, and fitter for the Stage of a <hi>Merry-Andrew,</hi> or a <hi>Iack-Pudding,</hi> than for a Paper of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You would have me guess at the Author; and you might as well bid me tell you the right Father of a Child by a common Strumpet: But I think I may call him <hi>Legion,</hi> for they are <hi>MANY;</hi> and there's a <hi>Club</hi> to his <hi>Pen,</hi> as well as to his <hi>Pocket.</hi> This I dare assure you, that the Author of <hi>A Letter from a Parliament-man to his Friend in the Country, concerning the Proceedings of the House of Commons, &amp;c. in</hi> 75. is very particularly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Author of <hi>An Accompt of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Government, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Seasonable Argument, &amp;c.</hi> that follow'd it, in 77.</p>
            <p>The Pretence of the former Pamphlet is exhibited in the Title of it: <hi>viz, An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Government in</hi> England: And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from <hi>November</hi> 1675, to <hi>Iuly</hi> 1677. Upon these <hi>Nineteen Months</hi> the <hi>Composer</hi> has bestow'd precisely <hi>Nineteen Sheets of Paper,</hi> and laid himself out most wonderfully in his Politicks and Conceits, for the better Grace and Relish of the Discourse: But the Malignity of it is so rank, that there's scarce a Page where the Poyson has not eaten quite thorough the Vernish, and discover'd the Spring and Malice of the Design. View it narrowly, and you shall find the Pique to be as well Personal as Seditious, and the VVork only of some Mercenary Pen to serve his principall's Animosity, as well as his Ambition. For a Man may see with half an Eye, how he <hi>aggravates,</hi> or <hi>extenuates; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages</hi> or <hi>commends, reflects</hi> upon, or <hi>passes</hi> over, as well <hi>Actions,</hi> as <hi>Men,</hi> according to the various Aspects of <hi>Affections</hi> or <hi>Parties;</hi> and without any regard to the Pulse or Truth of Publick Proceedings. By his Vein of improving the Invective Humour, it looks in some places as if he were <hi>Transprosing</hi> the <hi>First Painter;</hi> only he has chang'd his Battery, which is a Property peculiar to his Party, constantly to hate those that are uppermost.</p>
            <p>I was once a thinking to write a Just Reply upon the whole Relation, and to lay open the falshood of many Passage in it, in matter of Fact; the Partiality of it in others;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43627:4"/>
how perverted, and misapply'd it is throughout; and to shew what Gapp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and Maimes the Compiler of it has left in the Story, purposely to divert the <hi>Reader</hi> from minding the Coherence of Actions, and the reasonable Congruity of Counsels, and Affairs: VVhat uncharitable and illogical inferences he has drawn from matters as remote as <hi>Tenterdon</hi> Steeple from being the cause of <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands. This was the Method I had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to my self, but upon second Thoughts I quitted it, for these Reasons. First, It would have been 'too tedious; for I must in Honesty have printed the Libel as well as the Reply, which in Proportion would have amounted to near forty sheets of Paper. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It would have been superfluous; for part of my Business being the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Truth from Calumny: I find the thing already done to my Hand, in the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is passed upon it for a lew'd and shameless Imposture. And Thirdly, The Author himself, you see, has upon better consideration reduc'd his Pamphlet of 19 Sheets, into another of <hi>Three,</hi> as a more compendious Exposition of his Meaning: I speak of that Libel which you sent me, under the Name of <hi>A Seasonal le Argument to perswade all the Grand Iuries in</hi> England <hi>to Petition for a New Parliament; or á List of the Principal Labourers in the great Design of Popery, and Arbitrary Power, &amp;c.</hi> So that my Task is only to make good in my Discourse the Paralel that I promis'd you in my Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and then to pass some Remarks upon the Scope, and Venome of the Pamphlets themselves.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that you may not take the Libels here in question for <hi>Originals,</hi> let me assure you that these Notable Pieces are neither better, nor worse, than the Old <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi> of 40, and 41 only <hi>Turn'd,</hi> and <hi>New trim'd;</hi> The <hi>Contrivance,</hi> the <hi>Positions,</hi> and the <hi>Drift</hi> the very same; and upon the whole Matter, there is so near a resemblance betwixt them, that one Egg is not liker another. If you would have a full History of the Faction, you may read it at large in <hi>Bancroft's Dangerous Positions</hi> or <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ylin's AERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US REDIVIVUS.</hi> But my purpose is principally to compare the Project of 77. with that of 40. and 41. and by tracing the Foot-steps of that Rebellion, from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Fact of things passed, to gather some probable conjecture at things to come.</p>
            <p>To begin my <hi>Paralel</hi> with the Alarm of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi> in 1677, take notice that it was likewise the Pretext and the very Foundation of the Rebellion in 41. <hi>A Malignant and Pernicious Design</hi> (says the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 15. 1641.) <hi>of subverting the fundamental Laws, and Principles of Government, upon which the Religion and Iustice of this Kingdom is firmly establish'd.</hi> Husband's Collections, p. 4, and in the same Page he tells us of <hi>Such Counsellers and Courtiers, as for Private Ends have engag'd themselves to further the Interest of some Foreign Princes or States, to the Prejudice of His Majesty and the State at home,</hi> Which <hi>Counsellers,</hi> and <hi>Courtiers</hi> of those days, are now translated into <hi>French Pensioners</hi> and <hi>Conspirators</hi> in 1677. But if you would see the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in their Colours, read the <hi>Declaration, and Protestation of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament</hi> (as they stile it) <hi>to the Kingdom, and to the whole World,</hi> where, beside the Horrid Invocation of Almighty God to Countenance the Juggle, the whole stress of the Quarrel is laid upon the Kings being <hi>Popishly Inclin'd;</hi> and the War foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that Execrable Cheat. <hi>The Kings Counsels, and Resolutions</hi> (Say they) <hi>are so engag'd to the Popish Party, for the Suppression and Extirpation of the true Religion, that all hopes of Peace and Protection are excluded; and that it is fully intended to give Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Papists, by Alteration of Religion &amp;c.</hi> And a little further they say that <hi>the King endeavour'd to keep off all Iealousies and Suspicions, by many fearful Oaths and Imprecations of maintaining the Protestant Religion.</hi> But what were all their Stories of <hi>Popish Plots, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letters, Dark Conspiracies,</hi> but only Artifices to gull the Credulous and Silly Vulgar? For the King was so far from being <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> that never any Prince purg'd himself of an Imputation, by two more Credible and Dreadful Solemnities: The First, Publickly upon the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in <hi>Christ-Church Oxon.</hi> 1643; and afterward, at his <hi>Death</hi> upon the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> Now see the Harmony betwixt <hi>Those Remonstrants,</hi> and <hi>Our Libeller</hi> in his <hi>Growth of Popery. There has now for divers Years,</hi> says he, <hi>a Design been carried on to change the Lawful Government of</hi> England <hi>into an absolute Tyranny, and to convert the establish'd</hi> Protestant Religion <hi>into down-right</hi> Popery. p. 3. He begins in the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>the Remonstrants</hi> with a <hi>General Charge</hi> upon <hi>Ill Ministers,</hi> and he shall <hi>Advance</hi> with them too, next step, to an <hi>Attaque</hi> upon the <hi>King himself.</hi> And not a Pin matter what is said on either side to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is true,</hi> (says the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi> p. 155.) <hi>that by his Majesty and the Churches Care, under God's special Providence, the Conspiracy hath received frequent disappointments, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43627:4"/>
And do not the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> on the other side say as much for the Late King? That <hi>His Majesty indeed had past more Bills to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Advantage of the Subject, than had been in many Ages,</hi> pag. 16. But how comes our <hi>Libeller</hi> to be so kind to the Church all on a sodain? From whose Pen there never fell any thing yet but poyson upon that Subject. Can any thing be kinder than the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> were to the late King (pag. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Support His Royal Estate with Honour, and Plenty at Home; with Power, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation Abroad: and by their Loyal Affections, Obedience, and Service, to lay a sure and lasting Foundation of the Greatness and Prosperity of his Majesty and his Royal Posterity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</hi> But what do you think rather of the pretended Loyalty of these People after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, even in the state of an Actual Rebellion? p. 663. <hi>We the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, do in the presence of Almighty God, for the satisfaction of our Consciences, and the Discharge of that great Trust which lies upon us, make this</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station <hi>and</hi> Declaration <hi>to this</hi> Kingdom <hi>and</hi> Nation, <hi>and to the</hi> Whole World, <hi>that no private Passion, or Respect, no evil Intention to his Majesties Person, no Design to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his just Honour, and Authority, engag'd us to raise Forces, and take up Arms against the Authors of this War, wherewith the Kingdom is now enflam'd.</hi> And does not our <hi>Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> follow <hi>the Remonstrants</hi> in their <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> too? <hi>This Book</hi> (says he, p. 156.) <hi>though of an extraordinary Nature, as the Case requir'd, and however it may be calumniated by interressed Persons, was written with no other Intent, than of meer Fidelity, and Service to his Majesty; and God forbid that it should have any other Effect, than that the mouth of all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and Flatterers may be stopped, and that his Majesty having discerned the Disease, may with his healing Touch apply the Remedy: For so far is the Relator himself from any sinister Surmize against his Majesty, or from suggesting it to others, &amp;c.</hi> The Pamphlet, I confess, is, as he calls it, <hi>A Book of an Extraordinary Nature;</hi> but why does he say, <hi>As the Case requir'd?</hi> Where's the Importance of it; unless he means, that it was the very Nick of Time for him to embroyl the Nation: And for the <hi>Interessed Persons,</hi> who (he says) may <hi>Calumniate</hi> it; they are only the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>His Ministers,</hi> who are all of them the subject of his <hi>Scoptical</hi> and <hi>Malevolent Satyre.</hi> Of his <hi>Intent,</hi> we shall speak hereafter.</p>
            <p>This is not the first time that we have heard of <hi>Words smoother than Oyl, which yet are very Swords.</hi> It is the very Stile that brought the Late <hi>King</hi> to the Block; and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World was betray'd by a <hi>Hail Master,</hi> and a <hi>/kiss.</hi> It is the very Crown of the <hi>Paralel</hi> betwixt 77, and 41. Now to proceed: What was the <hi>Old Remonstrance,</hi> but a Spiteful and Invidious Misrepresentation of the State of the Kingdom, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Declaring Common Grievances? <hi>(For His Majesty's Healing Touch</hi> too no doubt) and is not that also the very Aim, and Profession of these two Libels? What is the Publication of This same Scandalous List, but the Old Trick over again, of <hi>Posting</hi> those Members for <hi>Staffordians,</hi> that would not consent to the Death of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?</hi> And is not their Tampering of the <hi>Grand juries</hi> to Petition for a <hi>New Parliament,</hi> the Old Practice reviv'd of drawing and folliciting Petitions against Grievances of their own framing; and menaging Affairs of State by <hi>Tumults?</hi> Would not our <hi>Remonstratour</hi> of 77, rather than his Life, be at the Old Sport again, with a Kennel of Brutes at his Heels, in full <hi>Cry, with No Bishops, No Popish Lords, No Evil Counsellors, No Rotten Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, No Porters Lodge;</hi> and at last, <hi>No King too,</hi> which was the very Fact in Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, upon this Method.</p>
            <p>So soon as the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> (those Sons of <hi>

               </gap> upon the Anvil for the Publick Good; and not forgetting to arrogate all those Acts to themselves, which his <hi>Majesty</hi> had passed of his proper Grace and Bounty. <hi>Other things</hi> (say they, p. 15.) <hi>of main Importance for the Good of this Kingdom, are in Proposition; as the Establishing and Ordering the King's Revenues, that so the Abuse of Officers, and Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Expences may be cut off, and the necessary Disbursements for his Majesty's Honour, the Defence and Government of the Kingdom, may be mor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43627:5"/>
               <hi>Many without the Consent of</hi> Parliament; <hi>That against</hi> Papists <hi>sitting in either House, &amp;c.</hi> The Libels in sine of 77, are so exact a Counterpart of the others of 41, that two Tallies do not strike truer: and undoubtedly such a Correspondence in Method, cannot be without some Conformity also of Design.</p>
            <p>There needs no other Argument to prove the <hi>Late Rebellion</hi> to have been originally a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> against the Government, than the Proportion that appears betwixt the Means, and the End; and the orderly Connexion of proper Causes and Regular Effects. For it was a Perfect Train of Artifice, Hypocrisie and Imposture, from one end of it to the other. The Confederacy was form'd in a Cabal of <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English Presbyterians;</hi> as appears not only from their Correspondent Practices in both Nations; but from his late Majesties Charge against the <hi>Five Members;</hi> and likewise from the Care that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon his Majesties <hi>Restauration to date the</hi> English <hi>Act of Indemnity from the beginning of the</hi> Scotch <hi>Tumults</hi> (Jan. 1. 1637.) which was three Years before the Meeting of the Long Parliament in November 1640. The two Ministers that stood in the Gap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Conspiracy, and the Government, (and who were only cut off, as appear'd by the Sequel, to clear the passage to the King himself) were the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud:</hi> So that their <hi>First Attaque</hi> was upon the <hi>Earl,</hi> and their <hi>next</hi> upon the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> under the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Evil Counsellors;</hi> and upon the <hi>Common Charge</hi> of <hi>Popery, and Arbitrary Proceeding,</hi> their Impeachments were carried on by <hi>Tumults,</hi> and these Brave Men were rather baited to Death by Beasts, than Sentenc'd with any Colour of Law, or Justice: And as they liv'd, so they dy'd, the Resolute Assertors of the <hi>English Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 41; But the <hi>Archbishop</hi> was kept lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in the <hi>Tower,</hi> till <hi>Ian.</hi> 44. And their Crime was not in Truth, their being Men of <hi>Arbitrary Principles themselves,</hi> but for being the <hi>Opposers</hi> of those Principles in <hi>Others.</hi>

               </gap>, for want of <hi>Papists,</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> directed their Spleen against the <hi>Kings Ministers,</hi> only as Persons <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> (which in time came to be most Injuriously apply'd to his Majesty, and his whole Party) Just so does our Libeller in 1677. <hi>Were these Conspirators</hi> (says he) <hi>but avow'd</hi> Papists, <hi>they were the more Honest, the less dangerous, and their</hi> Religion <hi>were Answerable for the Errours they might commit in Order to promote it: But these are Men</hi> (says he, in the next pag.) <hi>Obliged by all the most Sacred Ties of Malice and Ambition, to advance the ruine of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and qualify'd much better than Others, under the Name of</hi> Good Protestants, <hi>to effect it.</hi> As who shauld say; Popery <hi>is to be brought in by some that pass for</hi> Good Protestants. (As <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> were brought in by the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> under the Profession of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to their Country.) A very Compendious way of making every Man, that will not be a <hi>Traytor,</hi> a <hi>Papist.</hi> For who can say what any Man is, or what he is not, in his Heart?</p>
            <p>From his Majesty's Yielding in the Business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the Faction took their Measures how to deal with him in <hi>Other Cases;</hi> and never left, till by gradual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, and Approaches, they first stript him of his <hi>Friends;</hi> Secondly, of his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority;</hi> Thirdly, of his <hi>Revenue;</hi> and Lastly, of his <hi>Life.</hi> Whereas, had but this Pious and Unfortunate King follow'd the Advice of his Royal Father to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> he might upon cheaper Terms have preserv'd himself, and his Three Kingdoms. <hi>Take heed,</hi> (says King <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>to such</hi> Puritans; <hi>very Pests in the Church, and Common-weal, whom no Deserts can Oblige; neither Oaths, or Promises Bind. Breathing nothing but Sedition, and Calumnies, and making their own Imaginations (without any warrant of the Word) the square of their Conscience. I protest before the Great God, (and since I am here as upon my Testament, it is no place for me to ly in) that ye shall never find with any</hi> Highlands <hi>or</hi> Border-Thieves, <hi>greater Ingratitude, and more Lyes, and vile Perjuries than with these</hi> Phanatick Spirits. <hi>King Iames</hi> his Works, p. 305, and 160.</p>
            <p>Upon the Ripping up of <hi>Publick Grievances,</hi> it was but matter of Course to follow their Complaints with Petitions for <hi>Redress;</hi> and the Good King, on the other hand, <hi>to heap Coals of fire upon their Heads,</hi> deny'd them nothing: But <hi>the Two First Bills</hi> that his Majesty pass'd were Fatal to him: That for the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the other for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> They complain'd of the <hi>Star-Chamber; High Commission Court; Ship-Moneys; Forrest-Laws; Stannary-Courts; Tonnage, and Poundage, &amp;c.</hi> and had every Point for the Asking: Nay and as'an instance of his good Faith and Meaning, his Majesty took some of their Principals even into his very Council. But so soon as he had parted with so much, as almost put it into their Power to take the Rest, they began then to think of setting up for themselves (see his Majesties <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43627:5"/>
of <hi>August</hi> 12. 1642.) <hi>and nothing but a thorough Reformation they said would ever do the Work.</hi> Now see the <hi>Gradation.</hi> First, The People must be Alarm'd with the Noise of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> and the <hi>Evil Counsellors</hi> must be Remov'd that are <hi>Said,</hi> not <hi>Prov'd,</hi> to stand that was inclin'd. <hi>His Majesty must be humbly Petition'd by Both Houses to Employ such Counsellors, Ambassadours, and other Ministers, in managing his Business at Home, and Abroad, as the Parliament may have Cause to conside in, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, <hi>It may often fall out,</hi> they say, <hi>that the Commons may have just Cause to take Exceptions at some Men for being Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and yet not charge those Men with Crimes; for there be grounds of Diffidence, which lie not in Proof; there are Others which though they may be prov'd yet are not legally Criminal; to be a Known Favourer of</hi> Papists, <hi>or to have been very Forward in defending or Countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some great Offenders questioned in Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> So that at first Dash all the <hi>King's Officers</hi> are but <hi>Tenants</hi> at the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Faction.</hi> The next Step is, To fill the Places of those whom they cast out, with <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of their <hi>Own Chusing;</hi> as well <hi>Privy Counsellors,</hi> as <hi>Iudges.</hi> As in the 19 <hi>Propositions</hi> of <hi>Ian.</hi> 2. 42. Wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>The Translation of the Power of Chusing Great Officers, and Ministers of State, from the King to the Two Houses.</hi> Secondly, <hi>All matters of Sate in the Interval of Parliaments to be debated, and concluded by a Council so chosen, and in Number not above</hi> 25, <hi>nor under</hi> 15; <hi>and no Publick Act esteem'd of any validity, as proceeding from the Royal Authority, vnless it be done by the Advice and Consent of the Major Part of that Covncil; attested under their Hands, and these also sworn to the Sence of Both Houses.</hi> Thirdly <hi>The Lords, and Commons must be intrusted with the</hi> Militia. Fourthly, <hi>His Majesty may appoint, but the Two Houses, or the Council (in such manner as afore-said) must approve of all Governours of Forts and Castles.</hi> Lastly, <hi>No Peers hereafter made, must sit, or vote in Parliament, unless admitted thereunto by the Consent of Both Bouses.</hi>

            <p>By this time the Plot is Ripe for a <hi>Rebellion;</hi> they <hi>Levy War, Impose Oaths, Seize</hi> the Revenues of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Crown; Kill, Plunder,</hi> and <hi>Emprison,</hi> their <hi>Fellow-Subjects; Depose</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> under a Form of <hi>Publick Iustice;</hi> by these Means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing themselvs into That <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> which they pretended to Fear; <hi>Over-Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> under the Colour of a Zeal to <hi>Support</hi> it: and instead of Setting us <hi>Right</hi> in our <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> they left us neither <hi>Church</hi> nor <hi>Law,</hi> nor <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor <hi>Properties,</hi> nor <hi>Freedoms.</hi> Behold the Blessed reformation; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Outcries against <hi>Tyranny, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Evil Counsellors,</hi> were the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it. What was their <hi>Covenant,</hi> but a Blind to their Designs? <hi>A Popular Sacrament of Religious Disobedience;</hi> and only a Mark of Discrimination who were against the King, and who for him? Nay, in the very Contemplation of their Purpose, they knew before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, That there was no gaining of their Point, but by <hi>Rapine, Sacrilege, Perjury, Treason,</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After these Notorious Violations of <hi>Faith, Honour, Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> to the Common destruction of <hi>Prince, Government,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and All upon the same Bottom with our Late Libels; what can this <hi>Underminer of Parliamenns,</hi> What can our <hi>Geneva-Faux</hi> find to say for himself? Is not <hi>Mercury</hi> as good <hi>Poyson</hi> in 77, as it was in 41? Do we not <hi>strike Fire</hi> the same way <hi>Now,</hi> that we did <hi>Then?</hi> And may not a <hi>Spark</hi> in the <hi>Gun-Room</hi> do as much Mischief <hi>This Year,</hi> as it did <hi>Thirty,</hi> or <hi>Forty Years ago?</hi> Are not the <hi>People</hi> as much <hi>Tinder</hi> now as they were Formerly? and as apt to take Ill Impressions? What if the same Method should work the same Confusion over again? or in Truth, what is there else to be expected? For <hi>the same Cause acting at Liberty, must eternally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the same Effect.</hi> There's no <hi>Chance-medley,</hi> or <hi>Misadventure</hi> in the Case; but the Thing is manifestly done with <hi>Prepense Malice</hi> and <hi>on set Purpose</hi> to embroyl the State: As upon Examination of the Matter will undeniably appear.</p>
            <p>You cannot but take Notice, That the Author of <hi>The Growth of Popery,</hi> does upon the Main, principally labour these Two things. First, To insinuate that the King is in some Cases <hi>Accomptable to his People.</hi> (of which hereafter) And Secondly, To provoke the People, by suggesting that their <hi>Souls,</hi> and their <hi>Liberties</hi> are at stake, to make use of that <hi>Power.</hi> From the former Proposition he passes into a Florid and Elaborate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againg <hi>Pop<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ery;</hi> and when he has wrought up the Figure to a height, to make it Terrible and Odious, his next Business is to tell the People, That this Gobling is coming in among them, and to possess the Multitude with the Apprehension of a Form'd Conspiracy against our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> And this too, under the Countenance of an <hi>Historical Deduction of Affairs;</hi> but with the Faith of a <hi>Iesuitical Legend;</hi> wherein all the Kings <hi>Ministers</hi> are in General Terms branded for <hi>Conspirators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Hand being now in, he is resolv'd to go thorough-stitch, and nothing scapes him that falls in his way: He makes the <hi>House of Lords</hi> (p. 72.) to be <hi>Felon of it self;</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43627:6"/>
(p. 82.) <hi>Non Compos;</hi> Arraigning their Proceedings in several Cases with Boldness and Contempt. But he makes a great deal bolder yet with the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> he divides them into <hi>Three Parts. It is too notorious to be conceal'd</hi> (says he, p. 73.) <hi>that near</hi> a Third part of the House, <hi>have Beneficial Offices under his Majesty in the Privy Council, the Army, the Navy, the Law, the Houshold, the Revenue both in</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>or in Attendance upon his Majesties person.</hi> Upon this Exception, he expounds himself, that '<hi>Tis to be fear'd, their Gratitude to their Master, with their own Interest, may tempt them beyond their Obligation to the Publick.</hi> What can be more Audacious than this Charge upon <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> in the Face of <hi>a Sitting Parliament?</hi> He says that <hi>It is too Notorious to be conceal'd &amp;c.</hi> And where's the Crime, or the Shame, I beseech you, for an Officer of the Kings, to be a Member of the House of Commons? As if he that has an Office, and he that has none, had not Both of them the same Master; or that a Man might not as well be a Knave without an Office, as with it. This was the Complaint also of 41, against Officers, till the Complainants had gotten those Offices themselves, and then all was quiet. This is only a slyer way of declaring the King's Servants Enemies to the Kingdom, and Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Opposition betwixt the Common and Inseparable Interests of his Majesty, and his Subjects. Beside that, the same Reason would reach to the Excluding of the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from any other Trust in the Government, as well as from That of a Member in the House of Commons; and his Majesties Favour should at that rate Incapacitate any Man for Publick Business. If the Libeller had open'd his mouth a little Wider, he would have told us in <hi>Plain English,</hi> that there are three, or four of <hi>Oliver's</hi> Old Servants out of Office, and that the King is strangely over-seen to bestow his Boons upon a Company of Fellows that never had any hand in the bringing of him to the Crown, by the Murther of his Father, as they did. But yet he is content upon some Terms, that they may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>provided that they do not croud into the House in numbers beyond Modesty,</hi> (pag. 74.) which may seem to be some amends for the Rascalls he made of them the very Page before. <hi>Suppose</hi> (says he) <hi>that the Question concerning this</hi> Prorogation, <hi>were by the Custom of</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments <hi>to be justify'd, (which hath not been done hitherto) yet who that desires to maintain the Reputation of an Honest Man, would not have laid hold upon so plausible an Occasion, to break Company, when it was grown so scandalous?</hi> And then he assigns the matter of Scandal. <hi>For it is too notorious</hi> (says he) <hi>to be conceal'd, that near a Third Part of the House have Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Offices under his Majesty, &amp;c.</hi> Here's a great deal of Business done in one Period. First, He pronounces this <hi>Parliament</hi> void, and consequently all their Proceedings to be Nullities. <hi>Secondly;</hi> He will not allow any Man to be Honest, that right or wrong would not improve the Opportunity of Breaking This <hi>Parliament. Thirdly,</hi> He makes <hi>the House of Commons</hi> to be <hi>scandalous Company, and scandalous for having Beneficial Offices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majesty.</hi> The first time that ever I heard the King's Bounty was a Scandal to any Man. But to my Point.</p>

               <hi>And yet</hi> (says he, p. 77.) <hi>These Gentleman being full, and already in Employment, are more good Natur'd, and less dangerous to the Publick, than those that are Hungry, and out of Office, who may by probable Computation make</hi> another Third Part of this House of Commons. And a while after, <hi>They are all of them,</hi> he says <hi>to be bought, and sold.</hi> And then he goes on; (p. 78.) There is a Third Part still remaining, <hi>but as contrary in themselves, as Light and Darkness. These are either the Worst, or the Best of Men; The first are most profligate Persons, &amp;c.</hi> Concluding (p. 79.) That <hi>it is less difficult to conceive how Fire was first brought to Light in the World, than how any thing Good could ever be produc'd out of a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons so Constituted.</hi> And (p. 149.) he calls them <hi>this House, or BARN of Commons;</hi> treating the Members accordingly. <hi>They list themselves</hi> (says he) <hi>into some Court Faction, and it is as well known among them to what Lord each of them retain, as when formerly they wore Coats and Badges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he has not done with them yet neither; for nothing will do his Jobb, but a Final Dissolution; <hi>Considering</hi> (says he, pag. 81.) <hi>how doubtful a Foot this long Parliament now stood upon by this long Prorogation there could not have been a more</hi> Legal, <hi>or however, no more</hi> Wise, <hi>and</hi> Honest <hi>a thing done, than for Both the Lords and</hi> Commons <hi>to have</hi> Separated Themselves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could wish that he had not appeal'd from the <hi>Legality</hi> of the thing, to the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> of it: But however Legal, or not Legal, the thing is to be done: For he knows very well that so long as this House of <hi>Commons</hi> continues in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rebellion can never turn up Trump again. <hi>But it was otherwise order'd,</hi> he says, and so he betakes himself to an Experiment of Tampering, all the <hi>Grand Iuries</hi> in <hi>England, to Petition for a New Parliament,</hi> upon the Credit of his Story concerning the Corruptions of this. Wherein by the Foul Reflections he has past upon many Persons of Known, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43627:6"/>
Eminent Example, for Piety, Integrity, and Moderation, he has utterly disappointed the Malice of his Scandal upon the Rest. It was well enough said, methought, by a Worthy Member of the House of <hi>Commons; Do not you see</hi>- says he, <hi>how they have Libell'd me in that damn'd List of the Parliament-men?</hi> One told him that he was mistaken, for his name was not in't. <hi>Why, that's the Business,</hi> says he, <hi>for 'tis only a Libel upon those that are left out.</hi> Nay, rather then fail, he does as good as Advise a downright Insurrection, (in these Words, p. 155.) <hi>It is now come to the fourth Act</hi> (says he) <hi>and the next Scene that opens may be</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Paris, (by the Plot, it should be rather <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Edinburgh) yet Men sit</hi> by, <hi>like Idle Spectators, and still give mony toward their own Tragedy.</hi> And why does he blame them for <hi>Sitting by?</hi> And like <hi>Idle SPECTATORS?</hi> unless he would have them enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Tumult,</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> A very fair Encouragement to make Men bestir themselves, and without more Ceremony, lay violent Hands upon the Publick. Good God! That ever such a Creature as this should propound to himself by the Dash of a Pen, to move the Foundations of the <hi>English Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he descends to the <hi>Iudges. Alas!</hi> (says he) <hi>the Wisdom and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of the Law went off, for the most Part, with</hi> Good Sir Mathew Hales, <hi>and Iustice is made a meer Property.</hi> And then he raves upon <hi>The Constant Irregularities, and Injustice from Term to Term, of those that administer the Iudicature betwixt his Majesty, and his People</hi> (p. 154.) <hi>This Poysonous Arrow</hi> (meaning the Choice of the Judges) <hi>strikes to the very Heart of Government, and could come from no Quiver, but that of the</hi> Conspirators. <hi>What</hi> French Council, <hi>what</hi> Standing Forces, <hi>what</hi> Parliamentary <hi>Bribes, what</hi> National Oaths, <hi>and all the other Machinations of Wicked Men have not yet been able to effect, may be more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Acted by Twelve Iudges in Scarlet</hi> (p. 66.) And is not this directly 41 again? When no <hi>Iudges</hi> would serve the Turn, but those that betray'd the People to <hi>Slavery,</hi> and <hi>His Sacred Majesty</hi> to the <hi>Scaffold?</hi> He has another Fling at the <hi>Sheriffs. If any Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> (says he, p. 80.) <hi>chance to carry the Election, some Mercenary or Corrupt</hi> Sheriff <hi>makes a double Return;</hi> and so the Cause is handed to the Committee of Elections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly he does not give either the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> much better Quarter than he allows the rest; as you shall see by and by: So that nothing less than the <hi>Thorough Reformation</hi> of 41 will do the Work of 77. And the whole Frame of the Government must be unhing'd, to gratify the Caprice of a Pragmatical <hi>Mal-content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Passion,</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of the Libeller is so evident, that he does half confess it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by an <hi>Anticipation</hi> of the <hi>Charge. The Relator,</hi> (says he, pag. 155.) <hi>foresees that he shall on both hands be blam'd for pursuing this Method. Some on the One side will expect that the very Persons should have been Nam'd: whereas he only gives Evidence to the Fact, and leaves the Malefactors to those that have Power of Enquiry.</hi> If he can but acquit himself on the Other hand for <hi>Writing the Libel,</hi> as well as on This for <hi>not Naming the Persons,</hi> he will do well enough. For <hi>first;</hi> It is not his Business to <hi>Prove,</hi> but to <hi>Defame. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The <hi>Naming</hi> of <hi>Particulars</hi> would have restrein'd the Calumny: whereas his work is to wound <hi>All the Kings Ministers</hi> that Faithfully adhere to their Master in the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Scandal. Thirdly;</hi> He judges it sufer, and more expedient to amuse the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with <hi>Iealousies</hi> that cannot be <hi>Disprov'd,</hi> than point-blank to fasten upon <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> an Accusation that cannot be <hi>Prov'd.</hi> What does he mean by saying that <hi>he gives Evidence to Fact?</hi> It is the first <hi>Libel</hi> certainly that ever was given in <hi>Evidence.</hi> But where's the <hi>Relator</hi> himself all this while, upon whose bare word, Parliaments are to be-Dissolv'd; Ministers of State Arraign'd; Judges Displac'd; and the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new Modell'd? What if he should appear, and be found at last to have been one of <hi>Oliver's Cabal?</hi> Would any Man desire a more Competent Witness for <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> than the <hi>Martherer</hi> of <hi>Charles the Frst?</hi> But he has been so us'd to call the King himself <hi>Traytor,</hi> that he may be allow'd to call his <hi>Friends Conspirators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other hand</hi> (says he pag. 155.) <hi>some will represent this Discourse (as they do all Books that tend to detect their Conspiracy against his Majesty, and Kingdom) as if It too were written against the Government. For now of late, as soon as any Man is gotten into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment by ill Acts, and by worse continues it; he, if it please the Fates, is thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Government, and by being Criminal, pretends to be Sacred.</hi> This is only crying Whore first, to call those People <hi>Conspirators,</hi> who are likely to censure him for a <hi>Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:</hi> which with his Learned Leave, is but a Course Figure neither; and runs much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Common Billinsgate</hi> of <hi>You are a Knave your self to say that I am one:</hi> Which in few words is all that's in't. For he does not offer so much as one Syllable in his Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but with another Lash or two at the King's Ministers, winds up his Period. <hi>Now of late,</hi> says, he, (he means I suppose, since <hi>Oliver</hi> went out of Play) <hi>as soon as any Man is got into Publick Employment by ill Acts, &amp;c.</hi> He should do well to consider who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43627:7"/>
before he says that Villany is the ready way to Preferment; <hi>He if it please the Fates, is thenceforward the Government, and by being Criminal, pretends to be Sacred.</hi> I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer That in the Case of a Publick, and Legal Accusation, the Minister is not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Charge terminates in, and operates no further than his Person; but in the Affront of a Nameless, and Indefinite Libel, the King himself is wounded in a General Reflection upon his Ministers; for it is his Choice, and Commission, not the Officers Misdemeanour, that is there in Question: Nor does he pretend to be <hi>Sacred</hi> because he is <hi>Criminal;</hi> but the <hi>Libeller</hi> (who still writes after the <hi>Remonstrance</hi>) makes every thing <hi>Criminal</hi> that is <hi>Sacred,</hi> and gives the Construction of <hi>Rebellion</hi> to <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and of <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there be not Mischief in the very Project of this Libel, there's nothing at all in't; for I cannot frame to my self the least Colour or Possibility of any other End. He says, <hi>It was his Design indeed</hi> to give Information, <hi>but not to turn</hi> Informer. That is to say, He would set the People together by the Ears, and no body should know who did it. Now see the <hi>End</hi> he propounds. <hi>That those</hi> (says the Relator) <hi>to whom he as only a Publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, no Private Animosity, might have the Priviledge of States-men to Repent at the last hour, and by one single Action to expiate all their former misdemeanours.</hi> Which is e'en as Civil a way as a body would wish, of Recommending a Publick Minister to his last Prayer. It remains now to speak a word to the <hi>Timing</hi> of his Enterprize, which, in a wicked Sence, is in Truth the Glory of it.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to speculate upon the Power, and Designs of <hi>France,</hi> the deplorable State of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the Consequences that must inevitably reflect upon <hi>England</hi> in the Loss of the <hi>Spanish Neitherlands:</hi> the matter being agreed upon at all hands, that an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affections, Counsels, and Interests, was never more necessary to this Nation than at this Instant it is; and that <hi>Delay</hi> is <hi>Death</hi> to us. This being given for granted, it is likewise as certain, that nothing under Heaven, but the Credit of this Sitting Parliament, and the Blessing of a Fair Unnderstanding betwixt his Majesty, and his Two Houses can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this Kingdom, (Morally speaking) from Irreparable Ruine. And yet this is the Critical Juncture that the Libeller has made choice of, for the blasting both of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Administration of it; for the Violent Dissolution even of this most necessary Parliament; for the sowing of Jealousies, and alienating the Peoples Hearts from their Duty to their Sovereign. Let the World now judge betwixt the <hi>Libeller,</hi> and the pretended <hi>Conspiratours;</hi> who are more probably the <hi>Pensioners of France;</hi> those that are only <hi>Calumniated</hi> in the Dark, and without any <hi>Proof,</hi> or the least <hi>Colour</hi> of it, or the <hi>Calumniators themselves,</hi> (I mean, the <hi>Libeller</hi> and his Adherents) who are doing all that is possible toward the Facilitating of the Work of <hi>France,</hi> and the Putting of <hi>England</hi> out of Condition to defend it self. What is it, I beseech you, that can now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us in this Exigent, but the Wisdom, and Reputation of a Parliament? which they are at this very Instant, labouring to defame and dissolve: Distracting and Dividing the Nation, at a Time when our best Union is little enough to preserve us; and obstructing those Parliamentary supplys, without which we must unavoidably perish: For it is to this Session, that the <hi>Libeller</hi> directs the <hi>Mock</hi> of <hi>Still giving Money toward their own Tragedy.</hi> But sure we are not so mad yet, as to take the <hi>Subverters</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> for the <hi>Advocates</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi> I would know in the next place, What any Man can say to excuse his <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> from being a <hi>Daring,</hi> and a <hi>Spightful Libel</hi> against the King, and his <hi>Government.</hi> And I shall begin with the Liberties he takes with his Majesty, sometime in direct Terms, and otherwhile under the Blind of the <hi>Conspirators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the Shutting up of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> (pag. 31.) <hi>The Crown</hi> (says he) <hi>made Prize of the Subject, and broke all Faith, and Contract at Home, in order to the breaking of them Abroad with more Advantage.</hi> The <hi>Copy</hi> has in This Point outdone the <hi>Original;</hi> for the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> were in <hi>Arms,</hi> before they presum'd to word it at this Audacious height. Take it in the Insolent Representation of the Fact; the Malicious Construction and Presumption of the Inteut; and to Both these, add the Sordid Manner of Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Extraordinary thing done upon an Extraordinary Occasion, and wherein the Subject has since receiv'd so Ample, and Generous Satisfaction; the Clamour is so foul, as if an <hi>Aegyptian Plague</hi> were broken in upon us, and the <hi>Frogs</hi> of <hi>Geneva crept into the King's Chambers.</hi> And 'tis much at the same Rate that he treats the King about his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Indulgence,</hi> (pag. 33.) <hi>Hereby</hi> (says he,) <hi>all the Penal Laws against</hi> Papists, <hi>for which former Parliaments had given so many Supplyes, and against</hi> Non-conformists, <hi>for which this Parliament had pay'd more largely, were at one Instant suspended, in order to defrand the Nation of all that Religion, which they had so dearly purchased, &amp;c.</hi> Observe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43627:7"/>
here how ungratefully he charges the <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Declaration</hi> to be <hi>The defrauding the Nation of their Religion;</hi> which, on the contrary, was a Manifest Concession, only to gratifie the restless Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of his own Gang. And see what Sport he makes, but five or six Lines further, with the very Reason of that Law which he takes here so hainously to be suspended. <hi>It appears</hi> (says he) <hi>at the first Sight, that Men ought to enjoy the same Propriety, and Protection in their</hi> Consciences, <hi>which they have in their</hi> Lives, Liberties, <hi>and</hi> Estates: <hi>But that to take away these in Penalty for the other, is meerly a more Legal, and Gentile way of Padding upon the Road of Heaven; and that it is onely for want of</hi> Money, <hi>and for want of</hi> Religion, <hi>that men take these desperate courses.</hi> Now, by his Favour, there is a great Disparity betwixt a Pretence to <hi>Propriety,</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> and a Pretence to them, in <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Estates;</hi> for the <hi>Latter</hi> are liable to <hi>Violence,</hi> and may be <hi>taken away,</hi> but the <hi>Other cannot.</hi> And now he talks of <hi>Padding</hi> upon this <hi>Road;</hi> the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> (as I remember) were very good at it, that <hi>drove away from their Churches,</hi> 85. <hi>Ministers of</hi> 97. <hi>within the Walls of</hi> London. We'll agree in the Matter with him, That <hi>want of Money, and want of Religion will put Men upon desperate Courses;</hi> for my Charity perswades me, <hi>he would never have written these Libels else.</hi> He is a little positive, methinks, in Averring that a Great Lord lost his Place for defending the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> (pag. 44.) But he has forgotten the Statute of his own <hi>Citing</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 15.) that makes it <hi>Incapacity,</hi> for saying That the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Papist,</hi> or <hi>an Introducer of Popery,</hi> and that it was the King himself that remov'd his Lordship. And what do you think of his <hi>Irony,</hi> (pag. 43.) where he says, that <hi>The</hi> Parliament, <hi>by</hi> the Conspirators <hi>good Leave; was admitted to sit again at the day appointed?</hi> He tells us of another Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair too, pag. 51; which <hi>being transmitted to his Majesty was easily chang'd into a</hi> Court intrigue; And (pag. 63.) That <hi>the Conspiratours might so represent things to his Majesty, as to incense him against the Parliament, and distrusting all Parliamentary Advice, to take Counsel from</hi> Themselves, <hi>from</hi> France, <hi>and from</hi> Necessity.</p>
            <p>In this Disloyal and Irreverent Licence, he drops you a word or two now and then, before he is aware, against the <hi>King himself;</hi> and other whiles, Discharges his Malice to the <hi>Government,</hi> upon the Heads of <hi>Publick Ministers.</hi> The Subject Matter of his Complaint is a Tendency of Counfels, and Actions towards <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> But <hi>the King</hi> (says he, pag. 4. (<hi>can do no wrong;</hi> and so goes on, <hi>nor can he receive wrong.</hi> What is this, but a Justification of all the Violences that were acted upon the late <hi>King;</hi> even to the very Murther of him; under that Mortal, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous Distinction betwixt his <hi>AUTHORITY,</hi> and his <hi>PERSON?</hi> And an Allowance, that the same Course may be taken with his Royal Successors; <hi>The King can receive no wrong;</hi> (he says) What does he mean by this? Is not his Majesties Breath in his Nostrils? Is he not Flesh and Bloud? Is not his Body lyable to Wounds, Distempers, Emprisonment, and Death? He'll tell you, <hi>Yes;</hi> but <hi>This</hi> is not the <hi>KING,</hi> but the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>PERSON:</hi> But the <hi>KING,</hi> all this while, that is to say, the <hi>Authority,</hi> is Sacred, and Invulnerable.</p>
            <p>Now for Peace, and Brevity sake, let us suppose that this Charge of a <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Design,</hi> does neither Intend nor Reflect any Imputation upon his Majesty; (his Religion, and his Tenderness of Nature being Unquestionable) It is yet <hi>a worse Libel another way.</hi> Worse (I say) both as to the <hi>Drift,</hi> and to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of it, by how much <hi>Contempt</hi> is more dangerous to a Prince, than <hi>Hatred:</hi> For he employs his Utmost Skill to represent his Majesty only <hi>Passive</hi> in all his <hi>Administrations,</hi> and so to lessen the Indubitable Fame of his Royal Prudence, and Courage among his People.</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Freedom he takes with the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Ministers;</hi> the next Point will be to enquire how he stands affected to the <hi>Government</hi> it self. <hi>The Subjects</hi> (says he, pag. 3.) <hi>retain their Proportion in the</hi> Legislature. In which saying, he makes them <hi>Partners of the Sovereignty,</hi> and turns the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> into a <hi>Tripartite</hi> and <hi>Coordinate Government;</hi> which is as well De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> on the one hand, as of <hi>Royalty,</hi> on the other. Upon the Admittance of this <hi>Coordination,</hi> any <hi>Two</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> may destroy the <hi>Third:</hi> the <hi>Two Houses</hi> may destroy the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> with <hi>Either</hi> of the <hi>Houses,</hi> may destroy the <hi>Other.</hi> Which, if it be so, what Prince that is Imperial in the <hi>Intervals,</hi> would ever hazard the Dethroning of himself by a <hi>Session? The making of Laws is a Peculiar, and Incommunicable Priviledge of the Supreme Power,</hi> and the Office of the <hi>Two Houses</hi> in this Case is only <hi>Consultive,</hi> or <hi>Preparatory;</hi> but the Character of <hi>Power</hi> rests in the Final <hi>Sanction,</hi> which is in the <hi>King:</hi> And Effectually, the Passing of a <hi>Bill,</hi> is but the granting of a <hi>Request:</hi> The <hi>Two Houses</hi> make the <hi>Bill,</hi> 'tis true, but the <hi>King</hi> makes the <hi>Law;</hi> and 'tis the <hi>Stamp,</hi> not the <hi>Matter,</hi> that makes it <hi>Current:</hi> Nor does the <hi>Subject</hi> any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise make <hi>Laws,</hi> than <hi>the Petitioner</hi> makes <hi>Orders of Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Suspicious, and Ill-looking Passage that he has, <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. <hi>As to matter of Government,</hi> says he, <hi>If to murther the King, be (as certainly it is) a Fact so horrid,</hi> (he does not say how horrid) <hi>how much more Hainous is it to Assassinate the Kingdom?</hi> Here is First involv'd in this Clause, the <hi>Deposing Position</hi> of 41, that the King is <hi>Singulis major, Universis minor:</hi> For it is clear that the <hi>Comparison</hi> was only made to draw on the <hi>Preference,</hi> and to possess the People that they have a greater Prize at Stake in the hazard of their <hi>Religion,</hi> than in the <hi>Tye</hi> of their <hi>Civil Obedience.</hi> (the very Translation still of 41.) And for their further Encouragement, he tells them (pag. 4.) that <hi>We have the same Right (modestly understood) in our Propriety, that the Prince hath in his Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi> which carries with it an <hi>Innuendo,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> may as well Forfeit his <hi>Crown,</hi> as the <hi>Subject</hi> his <hi>Free-hold.</hi> It cannot be imagin'd that all these Leading and Desperate Hints should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43627:8"/>
fall from a Man of Brains and sense, by Chance; and you see the whole Tract takes the same Biass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No King of</hi> England (says he, pag. 58.) <hi>had ever so great a Treasure of his peoples Affections, except what those ill men have (as they have done all the rest) consum'd; whom, but out of an Excess of Love to his Person, the Kingdom would never (for it never did formerly) so long have suffer'd.</hi> Here's still the Crocodile of 41; nothing but Love and Reverence to his late Majesty too, till his Head was off. But let us Reason the Matter in a word. <hi>These Ill men</hi> have no <hi>Names,</hi> it seems; so that any Man that's near the King, is by this Libeller set up for a Mark to the Outrage of the People. And then he says, <hi>The Kingdom would never have suffer'd them.</hi> Who are they, I pray, that he calls the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but the <hi>Rabble</hi> still of 41; the Execrable <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>That Rebellion,</hi> and the <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Another?</hi> But if the <hi>Kingdom</hi> would not suffer it, what would he have them do to help themselves? The Law is open, in Case of any Legal Impeachment, and 'tis too Early Days yet for a Tumult,</p>
            <p>In his Descant upon the Test, he is wonderfully free of his Figures. <hi>Never</hi> (says he pag, 59) <hi>was so much sence contain'd in so few words; no Conveyancer could ever in more Compendious, or Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms have drawn a Dissetlement of the whole Birth-right of</hi> England. This Test has made a great Noise, and it will be worth the while to examine what is said against it. The Form of it is as follows,</p>
            <p>I, A B. <hi>do declare that it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever to take up Arms against the King; and that I do abhor that Trayterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority, against his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or against those that are Commission'd by him in Pursuance of such Commission. And I do swear that I will not at any time Endeavour the Alteration of the Government, either in Church or State. So help me God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He says, pag 57. That <hi>it was thrown out of the House in the Plague-year at</hi> Oxford, <hi>for fear of a general Infection of the Vitals of this Kingdom;</hi> whereas in truth it was, <hi>brought into the House</hi> as an <hi>Antidote</hi> against that <hi>Poyson</hi> which had seiz'd the <hi>Vitals</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> already; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than the <hi>Unswearing</hi> of That on the <hi>Behalf</hi> of the Government, which had been formerly sworn for the <hi>Destruction</hi> of it. The Author of <hi>A Letter from a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, &amp;c.</hi> calls it, p. 1. <hi>A STATE-MASTER-PIECE,</hi> and design'd to these Ends. <hi>First, To make a Distinct Party, from the rest of the Nation, of the High Episcopal Man, and the Old Cavalier.</hi> Now I took it rather to be a Design of <hi>Uniting</hi> All Parties, under one Common Bond of Duty, and Obedience to the Government: And where That could not be obtain'd, to distinguish who were for the Government, and who against it; for the Late King was murther'd upon this very Distinction betwixt his <hi>Authority</hi> and his <hi>Person.</hi> Nor is there any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Face of the Earth, without some Obligation upon the Subject, Equivalent to this Test.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> says he, <hi>they design to have the Government of the Church sworn to as</hi> Unalterable, <hi>and so Tacitely own'd to be of Divine Right.</hi> This, under favour, is a Fallacy. The Test does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it self whether the Government be Changeable, or not, but only provides that the State may be serv'd with Magistrates and Officers, that stand well Affected to the Establishment. Those that do so, will never scruple the Oath; and for those that do not, it is the very Intent of it to discriminate, and to exclude them: And to encounter the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by Virtue of which they dissolv'd the <hi>Late Government,</hi> with an <hi>Oath</hi> never to endeavour any further <hi>Alteration</hi> in <hi>This.</hi> And certainly, a Man may better swear the <hi>Maintaining</hi> of a Government <hi>According</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> than the <hi>Alteration</hi> of it <hi>Against</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, says the Author of the Letter, <hi>In Requital to the Crown, they declare the Government</hi> Absolute, <hi>and</hi> Arbitrary, <hi>and allow</hi> Monarchy, <hi>as well as</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>to be</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>and not to be bounded, or limited by Humane Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>This Test</hi> does either Declare, or Pretend the <hi>Government</hi> to be <hi>Absolute,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> I cannot imagine: But on the Contrary, every Man is ty'd by it from Endeavouring to make it so, if it be not so already, in <hi>Swearing</hi> that <hi>he will not at any time endeavour the</hi> Alteration <hi>of it.</hi> And then in his Explication of the meaning of <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State</hi> in the <hi>Test,</hi> by <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in his <hi>Reflection</hi> upon it, he has done us a greater Kindness than he was aware of; for he has wholly Disappointed the Spight, and the Intent of his next Clause. <hi>And</hi> (as he goes on) <hi>to secure all this, they resolve to take away the Power, and Oppertunity of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>to alter any thing in Church or State, only leave them as an</hi> Instrument <hi>to raise</hi> Mony, <hi>and to pass such Laws, as the Court, and Church shall have a mind to: The Attempt of any other, how Necessary soever, must be no less a Crime than Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now whether or no this be fair dealing. It is, by his own Confession, the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> it self, and not the <hi>Administration</hi> of it, that is here in Question. He would have it believ'd, That by this Test, <hi>Parliaments</hi> are barr'd upon Pain of <hi>Perjury</hi> from <hi>Attempting</hi> any <hi>Alteration IN Church</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> whereas they are left at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to debate what Alterations they please in the <hi>Parts</hi> of the Government provided, they do not strike at the <hi>Root</hi> of the Government it self. And the Deliberation and Result of the whole Matter, is no more than This. Many of the People (and all the Principles) are yet Living, that destroy'd the King, and the Bishops in the last Rebellion; Let us have a Care of the same Hands again, and trust none of them in the Government but under an Oath, not to endeavour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43627:8"/>
the <hi>Alteration</hi> of it. That is to say, of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> into a <hi>Republique</hi> or of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> into <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery;</hi> as they did before. And this was the Clear Scope of the Test.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> discoursing upon this Subject; <hi>There is nothing</hi> (says he, p. 57.) <hi>more Portentous and of worse Omen, than when such an Oath hangs over a Nation like a New Comet, foreboding the Alteration of Religion or Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A word first to the <hi>Oath,</hi> which, for want of an <hi>Epithete</hi> to express the hainousness of it; the <hi>Libeller</hi> so Emphatically calls <hi>SUCH an Oath.</hi> It is an <hi>Oath</hi> founded upon the same Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegience,</hi> and directed to the same End; and every jot as Necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der This King, as That was under his Grand-Father. The <hi>Iesuited Papists</hi> had invited the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> to Invade <hi>England:</hi> The <hi>Iesuited Protestants</hi> in the late Rebellion, did, in like manner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> laid a Plot for the Blowing up of the <hi>Parliament:</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> executed the Plot of Destroying <hi>Parliaments,</hi> Changing the <hi>Government,</hi> and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>King.</hi> The People were misted in the <hi>One</hi> Case, upon the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Principle that a Prince being Excommunicate by the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Subject is discharg'd of his Duty to him; and they were seduc'd in the <hi>Other,</hi> by a Persuasion that the Sacred Character of a <hi>King</hi> rests in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and is separable from the <hi>Person;</hi> which <hi>Authority</hi> they lodg'd in the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> and so did their Business. This Practice of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> occasion'd the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegience</hi> in the Statute 30 <hi>Iacobi,</hi> intitled <hi>An Act for the Discovering, and Repressing of</hi> Popish <hi>Recusants.</hi> In which Oath you have this Clause. <hi>And I do further swear that I do from my Heart detest and abjure, as Impious and Heretical, this damnable Doctrine, and Position, That Princes which be Excommunicated, or Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the</hi> Pope, <hi>may be Deposed, or Murther'd by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.</hi> Here was an <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Discovering</hi> and <hi>Repressing</hi> of <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> with an <hi>Oath, under a Penalty, and a Declaration against, and an Abhorrence of</hi> that Impious Position, whereupon the Treasons of those Times were founded: And why not a Provision as well against those People that with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Malice, as well as Ambition, over-turn'd the Late Government; and against That Principle, of Dividing his Majesties <hi>Authority</hi> from his <hi>Person,</hi> which was the Countenance and Support of the late Rebellion? Take it in short, and the <hi>Test</hi> is but a Supplement to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> The <hi>Scottish</hi> Faction Impos'd upon the People that they might be true to the <hi>King,</hi> though they Levy'd Arms against his <hi>Person:</hi> and the end of this Oath is only to expound <hi>That Position</hi> to be <hi>Treasonous,</hi> and to Secure the Government for the Future against Men of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: According to Equity and Conscience, and to the Common Practice, and according to the Prudence of all well Order'd States.</p>
            <p>Is this the Oath now that he calls <hi>SUCH an Oath?</hi> The Oath, <hi>than which there is nothing more</hi> Portentous, <hi>and of worse</hi> Omen <hi>to a Nation?</hi> He has forgotten the <hi>Fore-boding,</hi> and <hi>Portentous Omens of Forty One,</hi> and the Dire Events of those Presages What do you think of a deliberate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to spoil the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Subject:</hi> And all this in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> for the Honour of the <hi>King,</hi> and the Good of the <hi>People?</hi> And then the Entitling of Providence to all the Advantages that the Faction got by the Ruine of <hi>Three Kingdoms?</hi> Here's the unrepented Guilt of <hi>Sacriledge, Treason,</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> to the Highest Degree, and so Transcendent an <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> that some of the very Men that were Pardon'd for One Rebellion, are now the Advocates for Another. If these Practises should be suffer'd, there would be no need to consult the Stars for a Prognostick of Change of Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oaths</hi> (says he, pag. 58.) <hi>in our Late King's time taught the</hi> Phanaticks, <hi>because they could not swear, yet to Covenant.</hi> His Memory fails him, I perceive, for the <hi>Covenant</hi> was a Foot in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before any <hi>Oaths</hi> complain'd of here; by the Token that the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> in 1638, came to this Resolution upon the Point. <hi>It is lawful for Subjects to Covenant and Combine, without the King, and enter into a Bond of mutual Defence against him.</hi> Take notice next that the <hi>Oath</hi> commplain'd of, was the <hi>Oath ex Officio,</hi> which Oath was Abolish'd, before any <hi>Covenanting</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> And he is so much out again, in saying that <hi>the Phanaticks Covenanted, &amp;c. because they could not swear,</hi> that in Truth, <hi>they Covenanted because they car'd not</hi> what <hi>they swore.</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness their <hi>Covenants, Negative Oaths,</hi> and Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> in Opposition to their <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> and <hi>Canonical Obedience:</hi> There was no <hi>Compounding,</hi> no Living in their <hi>Quarters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Swearing.</hi> There was an <hi>Oath,</hi> given at a Communion at <hi>Fife,</hi> obliging People not to take the King's Covenant; And <hi>it was one Condition upon the Treaty at the Isle of Wight, that his Majesty himself should give Assurance by</hi> Solemn Oath <hi>under his Hand, and Seal, for settling Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant.</hi> So that they made no Conscience (you see) either of <hi>Swearing,</hi> or <hi>Forfwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> either of <hi>taking</hi> Oaths <hi>Themselves,</hi> or of <hi>Forcing them</hi> upon <hi>Others</hi> for the Advancement of their Design.</p>
            <p>He takes exception (pag. 59.) to the <hi>Two Declaratory Points</hi> of the <hi>Test.</hi> First That <hi>it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King.</hi> And he reasons the Matter in these Words: <hi>It were difficult to instance a Law, either in This, or Other Country, but that a Private Man, if any King in Christendom Assault him, may, having Retreated to the Wall, stand upon his Guard.</hi> That is to say, A Private Man may kill his Prince in his own Defence. For he puts this Case in Opposition to the Declaration; Only translating the <hi>Taking up of Arms against the King,</hi> into a Man's <hi>Standing upon his Guard.</hi> All that's Honest, in't is This, That he refuses to declare That to be <hi>Unlawful,</hi> which he holds to be <hi>Lawful..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43627:9"/>His second Scruple is, <hi>The Abhorrence of that Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his</hi> Authority, <hi>against his</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <hi>or against those that are</hi> Commissioned <hi>by him,</hi> in <hi>pursuance of such</hi> Commission. <hi>Here</hi> (says he) <hi>is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Frivolous Shift, knows very well, that the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Commissions</hi> vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Circumstances of <hi>Time, Place, Fact, Person;</hi> that the <hi>Qualification</hi> of the <hi>Commissioner</hi> does not at all operate upon the <hi>Authority of the Commission:</hi> and that if the <hi>Bill</hi> were drawn out to the length of the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> there would not yet be room enough to obviate all Cavils, and Objections. But in the next Page, he speaks his Mind a little plainer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the</hi> Commission, (says he) <hi>if it be to take away a Man's Estate, or his Life, by Force, yet it is the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: Or if the Person Commissionated be under never so many Disabilities by Acts of Parliament; yet his taking this Oath, re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oves all those Incapacities, or his Commission makes it not disputable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Seditious Hint, (for I cannot call it an Argument) lyes open so many ways, that I am only at a Loss where to begin with it. First, Let the <hi>Commission,</hi> and <hi>Commissioner</hi> be what they will, <hi>no Man is to be Iudg in his own Cause;</hi> but the <hi>Law</hi> must be the <hi>Iudg</hi> both of the <hi>Legality</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> Secondly, If upon this Ground <hi>an injur'd Person</hi> may take Arms, in <hi>One</hi> Case; so may a <hi>Criminal,</hi> up<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the bare <hi>Pretence</hi> of it in <hi>any Other:</hi> For 'tis but saying that the <hi>Commission is Unwarrantable,</hi> or that <hi>the Officer is a Rascal,</hi> and there's his Justification. Thirdly, Suppose a <hi>Double Abuse</hi> in Manner, as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s here suggested; That <hi>Abuse</hi> does not yet void the <hi>Authority,</hi> to which the Law on the <hi>One</hi> side requires <hi>Obedience,</hi> or at least <hi>Submission;</hi> and there is no Law, on the <hi>Other side,</hi> that allows <hi>Resistance.</hi> Fourthly, The End and Prospect of all Laws is Publick Convenience, and there was never any Law invented, so Profitable to a <hi>Community,</hi> but it was in some Respect or other, to the Detriment of some <hi>Particulars:</hi> So that the very Admittance of his Suppositions, does not at all affect the Reason of the <hi>Test,</hi> if the <hi>Benefit</hi> be <hi>General</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> hand, and the <hi>Mischief</hi> only <hi>Particular</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> How many Men are sworn out of their Lives, and Fortunes by <hi>False-Witnesses?</hi> Shall we therefore quarrel the Method of Proceeding <hi>Secundum Allegata, &amp; Probata?</hi> A Man is Arrested upon a Fobb'd Action, for a sum of Mony, knowing First, that he ows not a Penny, Secondly, that the Consequence of it will be his Ruine; Thirdly, that the Action is meerly Malicious; And Fourthly, (to make it strong enough) that the Officer that serves the Writ is Consederate with his Adversary, and that they have Both complotted his Destruction: All this will not yet Authorize a Resistance; but if an Officer that has the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> or any other Lawful Warrant, though <hi>Erroneous,</hi> shall be slain in the Execution of it, This is <hi>MURTHER</hi> A word now as to the Occasion of it.</p>
            <p>The People of 41, when they had forced his Majesty from his Palace, by Affronts and Arm'd Tumults, Publish'd this Doctrine to the Nation, that though his <hi>Person</hi> was gone, his <hi>Authority</hi> resided in the <hi>Two Houses:</hi> under which Colour they imposed <hi>Ordinances</hi> upon the People, for <hi>Laws,</hi> and by Degrees proceeded to an Exercise of all the Acts of <hi>Sovereignty;</hi> making War against the <hi>Person</hi> of the King, and those that were <hi>Commission'd</hi> by him, under the Pretence afore said: as <hi>Rebellious, Traytours,</hi> and <hi>Conspirators.</hi> Now to prevent the <hi>same Mischief</hi> again, from the <hi>same Principles,</hi> it was thought fit to propose this <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Abhorrence.</hi> The Objections against it are, That <hi>the King may grant a Commission to take away a Mans Life, or Estate, and Employ any Man at a venture to execute it:</hi> which is First, The Supposal of an <hi>Unjust,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Commission:</hi> Secondly, A Case so <hi>Rare,</hi> that it would be a hard matter to produce a <hi>President</hi> for it, without a Reference to a Tryal at Law: And Thirdly, What would be the Fruit of such a <hi>Resistance,</hi> but the turning of an <hi>Oppression</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> side, into a <hi>Rebellion</hi> on the other; and the <hi>Forfeiting</hi> of that <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Estate To the Law,</hi> which was otherwise invaded <hi>Contrary</hi> to the Law? For 'tis a Thousand to one that the Power that Issu'd the Commission, will find Assistants to Execute it, So that the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance pleaded for in this Case, is First, of a very remote Supposition: Secondly, of dangerous Consequence to the Resistent: And Thirdly, of no Avail to him at all.</p>
            <p>If we may not <hi>Resist</hi> (says the Faction) under these Circumstances, our Lives, Liberties, and Estates are at the King's Mercy; for that which may be one Mans Case, may be any Mans: And so because of This Possibility of Wrong to Particulars, we judg it Reasonable, that every Particular Man should be Allowed to Defend himself. See now the Inconvenience, which, upon the Allowance of this Liberty in Favour of Particulars, will redound to the Publick.</p>
            <p>An Honest Man is charg'd with Treason in the King's Name, and by his Majesties Order to be taken into Custody, and by an Officer too, under what <hi>Disabilities</hi> you please. Here's the whole Case. <hi>An Innocent Person; Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> and <hi>Estate</hi> at stake, and an <hi>Unqualifi'd Commissioner.</hi> If <hi>One</hi> Man may <hi>Resist,</hi> because he is <hi>Innocent, Another</hi> upon the same Pretence may <hi>Resist</hi> too, although he be <hi>Guilty.</hi> For no Man under a Charge, is either Guilty, or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the Eye of the Law, till he be Legally, either Convicted, or Acquitted. So that the <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the <hi>Guilty,</hi> are to be try'd indifferently by the <hi>same Law,</hi> and so are the Pretended Errours either in the Commission. or <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> Take matters once out of the Channel of <hi>Tryal by our Peers,</hi> There's an end of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self is become Passive, and Precarious Will you have the true Reason now, why this <hi>Abhorrence</hi> goes so much against the hair with some People? The <hi>Position</hi> is to be <hi>Cherish'd,</hi> and kept in Countenance, till the time comes for putting it in <hi>Practice.</hi>

            <p>No Man can be so blind, as not to discern by the correspondent Motions of the <hi>Consistorians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Scottish English,</hi> that they Act already by <hi>Concert,</hi> and it is as plain by this Bold and Adventurous way of Libels all on the soddain, that they depend upon <hi>France</hi> for a <hi>Second:</hi> Which is no more than was done in the Late Rebellion, by the fame Faction, as appear'd by a Letter of the Lord <hi>Lowdens</hi> to the <hi>French King,</hi> for his Protection and Assistance, for which he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and it was also confirm'd by the Fourth Article against the Five Members, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing them to have <hi>Traytero<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
