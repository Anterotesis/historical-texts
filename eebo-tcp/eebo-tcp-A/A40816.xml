         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ENGLANDS Lamentation FOR THE Duke of Monmouth's Departure: Reflecting on his Heroick Actions.</head>
            <l>IS <hi>Monmouth</hi> baniſh't? muſt HE not ſtay here?</l>
            <l>Can he, Eclips'd, ſo quickly diſappear?</l>
            <l>Methinks we ſink, and our diſjoynted State,</l>
            <l>Rowles headlong down the Precipice of Fate:</l>
            <l>Our Anchor's weigh'd, and this great Iſland-Boat,</l>
            <l>Like the fam'd <hi>Delos,</hi> on the Sea does float,</l>
            <l>A Sea whoſe Waves bear a far redder hue,</l>
            <l>Than thoſe which <hi>Pharoh's</hi> mighty Hoſt o'r-threw;</l>
            <l>In which each Papiſt like a Rock do's ſit,</l>
            <l>Ready to ſplit us, when we daſh on it.</l>
            <l>That King's unſafe, who ſits upon a Throne,</l>
            <l>Whoſe ſtrongeſt Pillar's loſt, and leans, alone,</l>
            <l>On the weak ſhoulders of a yielding Crew,</l>
            <l>Who never yet a greater Burthen knew,</l>
            <l>Than their own fleſh, which they could ſcarcely ſave</l>
            <l>From falling in the Dirt, before the Grave.</l>
            <l>That King art thou, great <hi>Charles,</hi> now <hi>Monmouth's</hi> gone,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Monmouth</hi> was truly Loyal to thy Throne,</l>
            <l>Wou'd <hi>Atlas</hi>-like, with his ſtrong Shoulders bear</l>
            <l>The Weight of our declining Hemiſphere:</l>
            <l>Who, maugre all Shocks of mighty Foes,</l>
            <l>Stood fixt, nor valu'd all the Threatning Blows.</l>
            <l>He, whom the <hi>Scots</hi> next to their God and Thee,</l>
            <l>Fear'd, and Ador'd, like a new Deity.</l>
            <l>He, who ſo lately quell'd the num'rous croud</l>
            <l>Of freſh ſpawn'd Rebels, that Proclaim'd aloud,</l>
            <l>War 'gainſt the Government, nor could they fear,</l>
            <l>Till within <hi>Scotland Monmouth</hi> did appear;</l>
            <l>Whoſe very Sight ſhot Death among them all,</l>
            <l>More ſeem'd with Fear than by the Sword to fall.</l>
            <l>This is the leaſt our Glorious DUKE hath done,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>France</hi> lov'd that Valour once which <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> won,</l>
            <l>With which, like the <note n="†" place="margin">Alexander.</note>
               <hi>Pellaean</hi> Conquerour,</l>
            <l>Himſelf his Standard on the Rampiers bore,</l>
            <l>Whilſt the amazed <hi>French</hi> ſtood idly by,</l>
            <l>Deſerving not to ſhare the Victory.</l>
            <l>They Wondred then, and ſince as much have fear'd,</l>
            <l>When He at <hi>Mons</hi> ſo Terrible appear'd,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Mars,</hi> all o'r with Blood and Duſt beſmear'd,</l>
            <l>When He, like the Great <hi>Troján Hector</hi> fought,</l>
            <l>And whereſoe'r he came, ſuch Wonders wrought,</l>
            <l>That as of old, now <hi>Jove,</hi> with Scales in hand,</l>
            <l>Weighing each Fate, did on <hi>Olympus</hi> ſtand,</l>
            <l>And found the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though in number leſs,</l>
            <l>In Valour equal, could not chuſe but bleſs</l>
            <l>Th' Attempt: whilſt ſmiling, he might ſee from far,</l>
            <l>The Bloody labours of the God of War:</l>
            <l>'Till <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> was force't his Ground to quit,</l>
            <l>And Victory, which on a Hill did ſit,</l>
            <l>Doubtful to which ſhe might her Favor ſhew,</l>
            <l>Now clapt her Wings, and to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flew,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> who deſerv'd her beſt, and knew,</l>
            <l>Beſt by their Valour always to maintain,</l>
            <l>That which their Valour nobly did obtain.</l>
            <l>Thus the brave DUKE prov'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits are,</l>
            <l>In Fight, as daring now as e're they were.</l>
            <l>And thus he got himſelf Renown, to be,</l>
            <l>For that ſent hence, as the States Enemy.</l>
            <l>Sure, Poyſonous Envy did their Breaſts invade,</l>
            <l>Who did your Majeſty to THIS perſwade;</l>
            <l>You were abuſed when you baniſh't thus,</l>
            <l>Him, the Delight of Your Self and us.</l>
            <l>They knew, whilſt he did in your Boſom lye,</l>
            <l>Their Daggers could not reach Your Majeſty:</l>
            <l>Therefore t'effect their Villanous Intent,</l>
            <l>He, who alone could their dire Acts prevent,</l>
            <l>Muſt be remov'd, that ſo your Breaſt might be,</l>
            <l>More open to each daring Enemy.</l>
            <l>Know then, Great <hi>Charles,</hi> Thou art more hurt than He,</l>
            <l>For th' Wiſe and Valiant ne'r can Exil'd be.</l>
