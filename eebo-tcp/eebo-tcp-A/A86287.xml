         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am to give thee notice, that in one
week of the laſt Term, I was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
twice, firſt of my name, and
ſecondly of my good name. Firſt,
plundered of my name by one <hi>William Leak</hi>
a Book-ſeller, who publiſhing a Diſcourſe of
mine, under the title of <hi>France painted to the
Life,</hi> (but publiſhing it by a falſe &amp; imperfect
Copy) hath father'd it in the Stationers Hall
on one <hi>Richard Bignall,</hi> a fellow to me utterly
unknown. Next, plundered of my good name
by Mr. <hi>Hamon L' Eſtrange,</hi> the Authour of
the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reign of King Charles,</hi> who
taking me to be the Author of the <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
on his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> not long ſince publiſhed,
hath loaded me, both in my owne perſon,
and in that of the Obſervator, to whom I am
made the <hi>Alter Idem,</hi> or the ſame man with
him, with many foule, unworthy, and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
names, not more unfit for me to take,
than for him to give. Reproached in my own
perſon by the name of a <hi>Theologaſter,</hi> called
<pb facs="tcp:114885:3"/>
in the way of ſcorn a Doctor in <hi>Coſmography,</hi>
impeached for impudent forging and falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Records, accuſed for loving the world,
none like me, with many things of like odious
nature; which with the like titles of Honour,
conferred upon me in the perſon of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
(too many and too long to be here
repeated) thou ſhalt find briefly ſummed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in c. 2. and p. 40, 41. of this preſent Book.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe I was ſomewhat the more
amazed at this ſtrange proceeding, becauſe I
had not been of late accuſtomed to ſuch <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingsgate</hi>
language. There was indeed a time
when my name was in almoſt every Libell,
which exerciſed the patience of the State for
ſeven years together; &amp; yet I dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, that all of them together did not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſo much filth upon me, as hath proceeded
from the mouth of the Pamphleteers, whom
I have in hand. But then I muſt confeſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that I had been much more amazed at this
ſtrange alarme, had I not been prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
to receive the charge. For being
informed, that the Hiſtorian looked upon me
as the Author of the Obſervations, that he
was hammering out an Anſwer, and that he
would not handle me with over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when once he had me on the Anvill; I
uſed ſome means, to get into my hands, the
printed, but unpubliſhed ſheets of his firſt
<pb facs="tcp:114885:3"/>
Edition, whereof thou ſhalt heare more in its
proper place. I found there, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had a <hi>perſonall malice,</hi> an old grudge
againſt me, and was <hi>reſolved to make his, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
doe the drudgery of his owne deſpight;</hi>
though in the Preface to the Reader, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the contrary. I found my ſelfe there
called, <hi>The bold Champion of the Prelates,</hi> a
Dr. in <hi>Coſmography,</hi> a <hi>Theologaſter,</hi> accuſed
of Ignorance, and Virulence in a Book bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up (for ſo he words it) againſt the Biſhop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> on whom I am after ſaid to fawne,
and to cringe to him, no man more, &amp;c. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Arguments, that his quarrell is not with
the Obſervator, but with Dr. <hi>Heylyn;</hi> though
I was ſtill to ſeek (not without ſome trouble)
<hi>quid vel in vita, vel in gratia, vel in hac mea
mediocritate despicere poſſet,</hi> what there might
be in one of my meane parts, and meaner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
that might provoke the mightineſs of
his Indignation.</p>
            <p>Not being <hi>Oedypus</hi> enough for ſo dark a
<hi>Sphinx,</hi> he ſends me in good time, his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
called, <hi>The Obſervator obſerved;</hi> which
when I had peruſed, I perceived the grounds
of his diſpleaſures, and needed not that any
body ſhould tell me, where the Shoo did
wring him. For finding him to be ſtiffly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
in the Puritane Tenets, a <hi>Semi Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
at the leaſt, in the forme of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               </gap>ormiſt in matter of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
&amp; a rigid Sabbatarian in the point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as ill a <hi>looking a Fellow</hi> as he makes me,
I could eaſily ſee, that my known Contrariety
in Opinion, had raiſed this Storme: it being
the humour of too many of the Stoicall Sect,
neither to treat their Oppoſites, with that
Civility which belongs to them, as men, nor
with that Charity and meekneſſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
them as Chriſtians. <hi>Parcius Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen
vexavit Achaia victrix,</hi> in the Poets
language. Our Hiſtorian was not ſo uncivilly
dealt with by the Obſervator, and he ſeemes
much diſpleaſed at it; the intemperancy of
his own pen, being thereby made the more
apparent, &amp; the leſs excuſable. If the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
tell him, that he hath his parts and perſon
in an high Eſteem, he is <hi>wiſhed to ſpare that coſt
of complement, his Bits being as little cared for,
as his Knocks.</hi> If he give him the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as he doth) of a good Hiſtorian, when
he proceeds upon the grounds of true intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
then—<hi>Out upon this Obſervator,</hi> ſhall be
all his thanks. If he direct his lines to him,
with the tile of <hi>worthily eſteemed,</hi> it ſhall be
ſent back againe, as not worth the keeping.
What ſhould a poore man doe to get a good
word from him, if this will not do it?</p>
            <p>Thou maiſt perhaps expect, Good Reader,
that after ſo many neglects &amp; provocations,
<pb facs="tcp:114885:4"/>
I ſhould cauſe him to be paid in the ſame coyn
which I have received; and if I ſhould, I have
a good example for it, from theſe words of
<hi>Cicero, Non tractabo illum ut Conſulem, nec
ille quidem me ut Conſularem;</hi> but I have ſo
much power on the hand which writes this
Tractate, as to hold it back from any unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
language, conſidering rather what is
fit for me to give way unto, than what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
And beſides, our Author may pretend
unto ſome eſpecial privilege, of which both the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> &amp; his <hi>Alter Idem,</hi> may be thought
uncapable; there being ſome creatures mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Laertius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which
are not to be kick'd again, kick they never ſo
often. Indignation may ſometimes tranſport
him beyond his naturall diſpoſition, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hurry him beyond the bounds of <hi>Wit</hi> or
<hi>Manners,</hi> which both the Obſervator and my
ſelf are affirmed to want, and therefore ſent
to ſchoole to learn them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am to let thee know, that though
our Author doth pretend to have written <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions</hi>
on the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> yet he hath
done it but in part, more than half of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vations
being left untouch'd. And as for thoſe
which he hath pleaſed to touch upon, they are
but <hi>touch'd,</hi> not cured of any of the <hi>evils,</hi> of
which he hath rendered them ſuſpected. The
whole body of the Obſervations, and every
<pb facs="tcp:114885:5"/>
branch and clauſe thereof (not above one or
two excepted) remaining in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in which he found them, as the diſcourſe
enſuing, will ſufficiently evidence. And as for
the diſcourſe enſuing, that it may look more
like to a methodicall, and well-compoſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I have not bound my ſelf to the tract
and method of the Pamphlet, but digeſted all
the ſcattered limbes thereof under ſeverall
heads, to the end thou maiſt peruſe them
with the more content and ſatisfaction. Yet
ſo, that there is not any one Paragraph, or
any one part or member of it, which in ſome
place or other, of this following Tractate, is
not fully anſwered. Our Author ſhall finde
no cauſe of complaint, as to that particular;
nor any juſt reaſon to give out, that any thing
which hath paſſed his pen (be it great or little)
hath not been fully taken into conſideration.
In that reſpect more juſtly and exactly dealt
with, than is accuſtomed in theſe caſes, or that
he hath reaſon to expect by the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
preſcript of his own example. The
points in difference by this meanes will be
brought more punctually and ſuccinctly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy peruſall. Judge thou according to the
truth, and God bleſſe thee in it: So wiſheth
he, who would not with the loſſe of Truth
buy the greateſt Victory;</p>

fear to write any thing which was true.
To theſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> addes a third, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beautifying of the Style, and from
him take them all together in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words. <hi>Nam qui Hiſtoriam et rerum
propter antiquitatem obſcurarum expoſitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>for they (ſaith hee) that make
profeſſion to write Hiſtories, and to
recite ſuch things as are obſerved by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
ought not only ſtudiouſly to
conform their ſtyle, but alſo to beautifie
the ſame with ornaments of Eloquence;
to the intent the Reader may converſe
in their writings with the more delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But above all things they muſt
have an eſpeciall care, ſo exactly to ſet
down the truth, that they who know not
how theſe things came to paſs, may be
the more duly and fitly informed and all
this, to the end, as before he telleth us,
<hi>that we neither omit any thing through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
nor bury ought in forgetfulneſſe.</hi>
                  </q>
And certainly, if Hiſtory be the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor
of ſucceeding times, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
of neceſſary truths, will as much
conduce to the miſunderſtanding, or not
knowing the true State of things, as any
unneceſſary falſhoods (and I conceive no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114885:10"/>
falſhood can be counted neceſſary) are
preſumed to do. But our Author was
not of this mind when he writ his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and therefore came reſolved, as his
Preface telleth us, to <hi>content himſelf with
ſaving truths;</hi> the firſt Hiſtorian, I dare
confidently ſay it, which ever publiſhed
a profeſſion ſo contrary to the nature and
rules of Hiſtorie. For he that is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to write nothing but <hi>ſaving truths,</hi>
muſt of neceſſity conceal much Truth,
which he ought to write, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubduct from the eye of the Reader,
the greateſt part of thoſe inſtructions,
which the <hi>true</hi> repreſenting of affairs
would afford unto him. And therfore it was
well ſaid by Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Church-Hiſtory
newly publiſhed, that though it
<hi>be dangerous to follow a</hi> Truth <hi>too neer the
the heels,</hi> yet <hi>better it is that the teeth of an
Hiſtorian be ſtruck out of his head for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi>
Truth, <hi>than that they remain ſtill, and
rot in his jaws by feeding too much on the
ſweet-meats of Flattery.</hi> Lib. 9. fol. 232.
The <hi>Obſervator</hi> (as it ſeemeth) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
thus alſo, profeſſing, that <hi>as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
that buſineſs, with a mind free from
love or hatred, or any of thoſe other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which pre-engagements in a party do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
men with, ſo he would carry it all along
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114885:10"/>
with ſuch impartiality and conſidence, as
might witneſs for him that he preferred truth
before intereſs: without reſpect to fear, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends,
or any particular relation of what ſort
ſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my Author, though he will not be
thought to <hi>love the world ſo well,</hi> as the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> is ſaid by him to do, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he much better how to ſave his
ſtake, than twenty ſuch <hi>Obſervators,</hi> and
<hi>Church-Hiſtorians;</hi> and therefore is not

nothing <hi>but Saving truths,</hi> but falls upon the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> for writing <hi>truths</hi> which are
not <hi>ſaving.</hi> How ſo? marry ſaith he, <hi>the

                  </gap> ſo, for Fol. the fourth, he telleth us
of the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that <hi>he falleth foul upon
King</hi> James, <hi>inveighing against, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
detracting from his King-craft,</hi> and for
that ſends him to Squire <hi>Sanderſon</hi> to
<hi>learn wit and manners.</hi> Squire <hi>Sanderſon;</hi>
with ſcorn and contempt enough. Squire
<hi>Sanderſon,</hi> for ought I know, may be as
good a Gentleman as Squire <hi>L 'Eſtrange,</hi>
there being at this time one Lord, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114885:11"/>
ſome Knights of that Family, which is as
much as the Hiſtorian, or any of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Houſe can pretend unto. Now to
the matter of the charge, he telleth us,
that the <hi>Obſervations</hi> are not ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Narrative,</hi> as <hi>againſt King</hi> Charles,
and yet takes notice only of two paſſages,
which ſeem to him, to be upon or againſt
that King. Had there been more, my
Auth or was the more to blame to keep
the <hi>Obſervators</hi> counſell, and conceal the
crime, rendring himſelf thereby an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the fact, and at leaſt parcel-guilty
of it, if not as guilty altogether as
the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> The firſt of theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
is, that <hi>the Biſhops had ſate longer (in
the houſe of Peers,) in their Predeceſſors,
than any of the Lay Nobility in their noblest
Ancestors,</hi> having as <hi>much right of voting
there, as either the Prerogative Royall, or
the Laws could give them;</hi> and therfore, it
<hi>was ill done of our Author to exclude them
then,</hi> and <hi>not well done (by him that ſhould
have kept them in) to exclude them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
For this the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is called
<hi>Canis Palatinus,</hi> a <hi>Court-cur</hi> at the leaſt,
<hi>a Fellow unconcerned in the buſineſs,</hi> and
therefore not to ſnarl at the Kings <hi>heels now
his back is turned.</hi> And why all this? Fol. 19.
Marry becauſe the King hath told us, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114885:11"/>
he did it <hi>out of a firm perſwaſion of their
contentedneſs to ſuffer a preſent diminution in
their hights, and honour, for his ſake.</hi> Our
Author herexsupon undertakes for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs</hi>
of <hi>almoſt all (not for all)</hi> the
Biſhops in ſuffering that diminution for
their Soveraigns ſake. But what makes
this unto the purpoſe? Doth the King
ſay he did well in it, or doth he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay elſewhere, (in his Declaration, as
I take it, of the 12 of <hi>August</hi>) that he gave
way unto the Bill for excluding the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
from ſitting in the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> in
hope by that means to preſerve their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Houſe of God. Two evils being
laid before him, he made choiſe of that
which ſeemed the leaſt, and yet affirms
not any where (for ought I can find) that
he did well in chooſing either. So as the
King not ſaying that he <hi>did well in it,</hi> nor
my Author proving that he did, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath no reaſon to deal thus with the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> but that ſome men have ſo
much in them of the <hi>Curre,</hi> that they will
be alwaies <hi>barking</hi> though they cannot
<hi>bite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other paſſage charged upon the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> is <hi>taxing the King and the Lords
of the Scotiſh councell for Overſights, great
overſights,</hi> in not puniſhing the principal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114885:12"/>
Authors of the tumuls of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> my
Author thereupon infers with diſdain
and ſcorn, how <hi>gallantly all things will he
ordered, when the Obſervator comes to be of a

                     </gap> of State,</hi> Fol. 30. But Sir, The
Obſervator did not only ſay it, but he
proved it too, and it had ſhewn more
judgement in you to confute his reaſons,
than to fall foul upon his perſon. Errors
in conduct of affairs, and Effects in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
are not unprofitably noted by the
beſt <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and that too in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Princes. Their ſucceſſors might be
elſe to ſeek in the knowledge of ſome
things of weight and conſequence, and
ſuch as moſt nearly do concern their own
preſervation. He that <hi>ſoweth pillows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Elbows</hi> of great Princes, when they
are alive, ſhall be termed a Flatterer; and
he that flatters them being dead, to the
prejudice and wrong of their poſterity,
deſerves not to paſs for an Hiſtorian.
That wit is alwaies better cheap, which
is purchaſed with the price of another
mans errors, than with the feeling of our
own.</p>
               <p>And here I might have left King <hi>Charles,</hi>
would my Author let me, who though
he tell us in his Preface, that <hi>the very fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of Kings have been in former times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted,

like their perſons, ſo ſacred, that to
touch them, though never ſo tenderly, hath

either by their communication

is a good old Rule, learnt by our
Author in his Grammar, but forgotten
now, he had not elſe <hi>enveighed</hi> ſo much
againſt King <hi>James, and detracted alſo
from his King-craft,</hi> as he after doth,
and then accuſe the <hi>Obſervator</hi> of the ſelf-ſame
crimes: For hath he not told us in
his Hiſtory, as it is now extant? <q>That
in Religious exerciſes, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Demeanor is a grand part of that
ſacred homage, he was ſomewhat too
incurious and irreverent; that he was
too indnlgent to his Palate, and had a
ſmack of the Epicure in him; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-ſtudious in purſute of Peace,
he incurred the note of <hi>Puſillanimitie,</hi>
which made the thought of warr be ſo
terrible to him, that he was Cajolled,
and kept in Deluſory chat with ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fallacies by the <hi>Austrian Faction,</hi>
whilſt his children were exterminated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114885:15"/>
from their lawfull Patrimony; that in
the ſeverall negotiations of <hi>Carlile, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
Bristoll</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> he ſpent
ſo vaſt ſummes, that the moiety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
diſpoſed in military levies, would
have totally diſſipated all the forces of
thoſe uſurpers, and re-eſtated the <hi>Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave;</hi>
that there could be no ſtronger
evidence of <hi>defect of courage,</hi> than his
tedious courting the Alliance of <hi>Spain,</hi>
whom his Predeceſſors had ſo often baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled.
And finally, that by his faint-heartedneſs
on the one ſide, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
levies on the other, he grew into
ſuch diſaffection and contempt with his
people, <hi>that though</hi> thoſe diſmal cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which befell his Sonne, were
ampliated by a ſuperfetation of cauſes,
yet was their firſt and main exiſtence,
derivative from the grounds which were
layed by the Father.</q> Thus alſo hath
he told us, in his printed, but not publiſht
ſheets, <q>that never any treaty was by a
wiſe Prince ſo bungled up (the treaty
with <hi>Spain</hi> it is he meaneth) upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
ſo imprudent, ſo inconſiſtent
with the welfare of his dominions, by
making ſuch an ample reſignation of the
Proteſtant intereſs; and that his exceſſive
indulgence in purſute of thoſe Articles
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114885:15"/>
mightily exaſperated, nothing more, the
acute diſtempers, and irritated the bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
animoſities of his people againſt
him.</q> What hath been ſaid of him,
touching his liberal and promiſcuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
of Honors, we have ſeen before;
take this now for the cloſe of all, <q>that
by his luxury and diſſolute paſtimes,
which were the only delights of his
times, he waſted and decocted the
publick treaſury; and by his moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Largeſſes to his minions, he
entailed a perpetuity of indigence upon
his poſterity, ſquandring his wealth, till
he had given away even liberalitie
herſelf,</q> &amp;c. What call you this my
moſt dear Hiſtorian? is not this <hi>an
inveighing againſt</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and a <hi>detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
from his King-craft?</hi> greater I think,
but I am ſure with leſs excuſe, than any

as not worth the teaching. <hi>Vel neutrum

               <p>Follow this Game a little further, now
we are on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents, and we ſhall find no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114885:16"/>
ſex, no order or degree of men, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of eminent imployment in Church
or State, who are not brought under the
cenſorious laſh of our Authors pen. And
firſt the Queen, notwithſtanding all the
miſeries which have fallen upon her, muſt
be made the more miſerable in bearing
the blame of that indulgence, which the
late Arch-biſhop ſhewed to them of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction. The Obſervator gives
two reaſons why that Arch-biſhop might
afford ſome favours to the <hi>Catholick</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,
the one grounded upon point of State,
the other on prudentiall conſiderations.
But our Author not content with theſe,
he ſubjoyns a third, and that which he
conceives to be the very <hi>true cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>
Fol. 33. and ſo conceives not upon <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
reports, as formerly, but upon certain
information;</hi> that is to ſay, that it was <hi>done
to pleaſe the Queen.</hi> Aſſuredly, if it had
been ſo, the Arch-biſhop was not of ſuch
weak parts, and ſo ill a keeper of his
own counſel, as to make any ſuch precla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his reaſon for it; that being a
readier way to diſpleaſe than to <hi>pleaſe
the Queen,</hi> who although ſhe were willing
that all offices of grace and favour ſhould
be extended to that party, yet was not
willing, that the burden of it ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114885:16"/>
laid upon her ſhoulders. And beſides
this our Author cannot chooſe but know,
that at ſuch time as the Archbiſhop made
his complaint unto the King, at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
Table, againſt Mr. <hi>Walter Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Toby Matthews,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi>
was almoſt at the higheſt of her power
and greatneſs, and therefore had the
Arch-biſhop favoured the <hi>Romiſh Factions</hi>
on a'deſire to <hi>pleaſe the Queen,</hi> when her
power was only in the <hi>increaſe,</hi> he would
not have hazarded her diſpleaſure when
it was at the full. This therefore only
ſerves to accuſe the Queen, not to juſtifie
him, or otherwiſe might have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at this time, when there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
or occaſion for it, but that our
Author had a mind to <hi>fly at the whole Covy,</hi>
as he knows who ſaith; and therefore
having made ſo bold with the King, as
we ſaw before, he thinks it fit the Queen,
like a loving wife, ſhould bear him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>But being ſo great a perſon as the
Queen muſt not go alone, without ſome
Ladies to attend her; the Counteſſe of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> comes in next, of whom our
Author told us in the firſt Edition of his
Hiſtory, <hi>that (if fame belied her not) ſhe
loved the Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln <hi>better than was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114885:17"/>
fit.</hi> Reproved for this impudence by the
Obſervator, he hath left that paſſage out
of his new impreſſion: But fearing leſt
the Lady might come off with too much
honour, he pleadeth very ſtrongly for the
<hi>Fame,</hi> which, <hi>though not always an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Informer, ſome rumours being begot by
malice, and nurſed up by credulity, yet true
it is,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſhe is ſometimes a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
teſtimony, and the wiſe</hi> Tacitus <hi>doth
many times preſent her in the like concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Fol. 9. And this (I take it) is not
a righting of the wronged Lady, but an
authorizing rather of the ſcandal which
was laid upon her. Nor will he have her
Innocence as to that particular to be
grounded on her own vertue, but the
Biſhops impotency: Not that the Biſhop
was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

affirmed by Brother <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who
went too far in that, as my Author
telleth us; but that he was made impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>when he was a Boy, by falling on a
Stake,</hi> as it after followeth. Of this the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> is not pleaſed to inquire any
farther, nor is there reaſon why he
ſhould; only I can aſſure our Author,
that <hi>Welden</hi> (another of the ſame tribe)
was perſwaded otherwiſe, as is apparent
in the Pamphlet called <hi>the Court of King

became for the ſmall time he enjoyed

Finally he aſſureth us of all <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi>

from all imputation of pretio, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with Court-qualifications, the moſt

cannot ſcape the hands of our Hiſtorian,
of whom though he borrow the whole
Story of the Diſcovery made by <hi>Andreas

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114885:18"/>
to be beholding to his Author for
it, whom he eſteems of little credit,
ſaying expreſly, that he <hi>inſerts it, not on

aſſured of the truth of it by a more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſon, and one of principal relation to
to Sir</hi> William Boſwell: And that Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> may have ſome Company of his
own to go along with him, he telleth us
of the Presbyterians, that by their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
formality, and ſupple mildneſſe, they
prevailed dayly on the affections of ſuch, who
little thought ſuch out ſide Lambs had claws
and asperities (ſo cunningly did they conceal
them) far more ſharp and terrible than the
Prelates had, whereof they gave ſome years
after ſenſible Demonstration.</hi> Our Author
cares not much who knoweth it, <hi>Tros, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuſque
mihi nullo diſcrimine habentur,</hi> that
all men are alike to him when they come
before him. A man would think our
Author were that <hi>John Kinſaider</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

it is to ſnap at every one he meets,
and yet no hurt done: But he is neither
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114885:19"/>
of all theſe, no ſuch matter verily. Our
Author (he doth not care who knows it)
is a Gent. <hi>every inch of him,</hi> except his

for a further proof hereof, we will ſee
how he layeth about him when he comes
to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> of whom in general he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

and erecting an arbitrarineſſe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>prelatical</hi> whimzies, the <hi>Fictions

and Chimeraes of their giddy brains.</hi> Of the

and ungratefull perſon. To <hi>Mountague</hi>

of him he telleth us in thoſe printed but

Court Biſhops netled with this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
this oppoſition (he means that
which was made by the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
againſt placing the Communion
Table <hi>Altar-wiſe</hi>) to their grand deſign,
laboured as vehemently to maintain
their own proceedings, and put out
the work to their bold Champion
Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> who thereupon undertakes
the Biſhop, and bungleth up a reply to
him full of ignorance and virulence,
ſo much the fiercer becauſe he thought
the Biſhop not in the ſtate of operating
any thing conſiderably noxious to him.
But the next luſtre this Biſhop became
for a while illuſtrious, and then he did
fawn upon and cringe to him, on
whom he had formerly trampled, no
man more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What a <hi>Goliah</hi> have we here ſtretching

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114885:21"/>
and to that I leave him. The honour he
hath done the Dr. in giving him a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſo much good company, requireth
from any friend of his, a more gentle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
then <hi>Pap with anhatchet</hi> in thoſe
times to the elder Martiniſts. And though
it is to be confeſſed, that much of this
ſtrain ſtuffe died under the Preſs, &amp; never
was permitted to come abroad (whether
upon the ſecond &amp; more ſober thoughts
of the Author himſelf, or the care and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
of ſome friends who peruſed the
ſheets, doth not concern me to enquire)
yet doth our Author ſtand convicted in
his firſt intention, &amp; may be counted, <hi>voto
ſaltem ſi non opere,</hi> as guilty of the crime of
defamation, as any other whatſoever in
theſe laſt ill times: great pity certainly,
that ſuch a two-hand ſword as this,
ſhou'd be kept in the ſcabbard, and that he
was perſwaded not to draw it out, though
he had only fenced and flouriſhed with it
(like a Whiffler in my Lord Maiors ſhow)
to delight the multitude.</p>
               <p>And yet (a bleſſing on him for it) he
would be ſain thought to write ſome of
them, but leaves them at the laſt in a worſe
condition, then he had brought them to
at firſt. He is content to leave out the firſt
part of that character, which he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

given my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> whom he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114885:21"/>
had formerly affirmed to be <hi>none of the beſt
Scholars;</hi> and now ſtands only to the laſt
that he was <hi>none of the worst Biſhops,</hi> not
that he finds himſelf to be fully ſatisfied
with the <hi>Obſervator</hi> touching the abilities
of that Prelate, but <hi>that he was loath
to abide any miſconſtructions, finding the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
noate verified, Virorum ut magna
admiratio, ita cenſura difficilis est,</hi> Fol. 26.
and therefore he ſtands to it ſtill, that he
ſaw no reaſon, why he <hi>might not ſafely
ſay, that this Biſhop was none of the greateſt
Scholars, without diſparagement to his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Scholarſhip, or</hi> his own <hi>prudence,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon a wild diſcourſe, touching the
meaſure of learning, required to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of a Biſhop, and ſo reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the point, that a Biſhop may be <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſufficient for his place, though he be none of
the greatest magnitude.</hi> Which, whether
it be a righting of the perſon, or rather a
wronging of the Biſhop, I leave unto the
conſideration of the critical Reader. And
for that part of the Character which he
hath left ſtanding by it ſelf, without that
<hi>Deleatur</hi> which he ſeems to brag of, it is
ſuch a ſorry peece of commendation, as
the Hiſtorian gives us of a noble <hi>Roman,</hi>
of whom he ſayth, that he, was <hi>magis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
vitia quam cum virtutibus,</hi> rather not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114885:22"/>
guilty of any notorious vices, than adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with any eminent virtues. No
<hi>hearty commendations,</hi> this, according to
the <hi>old ſtyle</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but a cold <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
commendation, a commendation
<hi>Stylo novo,</hi> and ſuch a one as I conceive
our Author would not be well pleaſed
with from another man. <hi>None of the
worſt Biſhops,</hi> and none of the worſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,
may ſeem to intimate, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are poſitively good in their ſeveral
kinds, or though amongſt ſo many bad
ones (as almoſt all the Biſhops are by
him preſented) they may paſs for tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and therefore I deſire our Author,
if either the Hiſtory or Pamphlet live
to another edition, that he would paſs
a <hi>deleatur</hi> upon this part alſo, leaving
this reverend perſon unto that <hi>amends</hi>
which our Author hopes he hath made in
the reſt that followeth.</p>
               <p>Leſs candidly doth he deal with the
other Biſhop, accuſed for ſaying (in his
<hi>Pontificall ruffe,</hi> as he elſewhere phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it) <hi>that he hoped to live to ſee
the day when a Miniſter ſhould be as good
a man, as any Iack-Gentleman in</hi> England.
For, though he doth confeſſe, that his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was not then ſo good as it hath been
ſince,</hi> and hath therefore corrected that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114885:22"/>
according to the Obſervators (for
ſo I think he meaneth by that <hi>Authors
own Copy</hi>) and added <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart</hi> to <hi>Jack-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
in the new Edition, yet will he
not allow that the <hi>Obſervators vindication
of him, from any ſuch diſtemper in his words
or actions,</hi> as he freeth him from; or
that the <hi>expreſſion</hi> ſo <hi>corrected, doth argue
much of that temper or wiſdom, which the
Obſervator crieth up in him.</hi> Fol. 29. This
is hard dealing in our Author, firſt to
expoſe a man, one of the Fathers of the
Church, for words which were never ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him, and not ſo ſpoken as preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the eye of the Reader, to the
publique hatred, and after when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
ſtands ſo qualified and corrected
in the Author himſelf, as to admit a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
with all ſober men, to keep
him ſtill under the ſame uncharitable
terms of reproach and obloquy. For why
a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſhould not be <hi>as good a Man
as any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart Jack-Gentleman</hi> in all the
Pack, I can ſee no reaſon; the dignity,
office, function, and the civillity of his
breeding, with other neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
required in him, being well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>With greater zeal, but with as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
intention, doth he advocate for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114885:23"/>
Biſhop <hi>Potter,</hi> of whom the Obſervator
telleth us, <hi>that his preferment unto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of</hi> Carlile, <hi>could not get the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
love in the hearts of his people.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hereupon inferreth, Fol. 14. <hi>That this
muſt neceſſarily ſignifie ſomething of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
quality, in either the perſon or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Dr.</hi> Potter, <hi>or both, to be efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to obſtruct and impede the affection of the
Subject.</hi> The Gentleman telleth us, Fol.
35. <hi>That really there are many better Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
than himſelf,</hi> which I readily grant,
but addeth withal, that <hi>there are ſome worſe
Diſputants alſo,</hi> which I more than doubt.
For who can ſay which hath but the leaſt

Obſervators <hi>Premiſes</hi> about the Biſhop,
muſt neceſſarily inferr any ſuch <hi>Concluſion</hi>
as our Author maketh? he might as well
conclude from that paſſage in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
(and perhaps more truely) that
there was <hi>ſomething of abominable quality,</hi>
in the Kings calling in of <hi>Montagues</hi>
book, as in the perſon and Doctrine of
Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> which might <hi>obstruct</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Kings Liege people, both
being joyned together by the Obſervator
to rove this <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> That it <hi>never
falls out well with Christian Princes, when
they make Religion bend to policy;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114885:23"/>
no reaſon eminently viſible why that
Doctor (being a <hi>Thorow-paced Calvinian,</hi>
and otherwiſe unqualified for ſo great a
charge) ſhould be made a Biſhop, but
only <hi>ad faciendum populum,</hi> to gain the
King ſome reputation and eſteem with
the reſt of that party. But the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Biſhop is not the main point
which our Author driveth at. For ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an occaſion by the word <hi>Calvinian,</hi>
he telleth us, that though a man be never
ſo great a <hi>Scholar, never ſo pious, never ſo
conſcientious in all his actions,</hi> he muſt (if
he paſſe under the notion of a Calviniſt)
be ſaid to <hi>dote,</hi> or to be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or
be called a <hi>Knave, with all which titles of
honour</hi> (as our Author ſaith) <hi>he hath
known the gallanteſt men in this Nation dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</hi>
He had done well to have ſpecified
the names of thoſe, who have given any
of thoſe vile terms to ſuch gallant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and not to leave it as a brand on all
thoſe of the contrary perſwaſion, ſo much
the more odious and uncharitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
delivered in the general.</p>
               <p>Thus I have layed together ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
paſſages as ſerve beſt to diſcover
our Authors temper, and the ill ſpirit
which doth guide him in all his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114885:24"/>
and cenſures; that when it comes
either to the Doctors turn, or the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
to be arraigned (but not convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted)
before his Tribunal, it may not
ſeem any wonder to a charitable and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious

frequently with the like reproaches.

Aſſuredly I cannot doubt but that many

their words and phraſes, as our Author
is, who yet diſdain to diaper their ſtyle

his plea from <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> who
could not ſpeak out of the Dialect of the

for his juſtification, viz. <hi>linqua mea

in our Authors <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they <hi>were

from <hi>Cato de Originibus,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid.
But Sir, the <hi>cenſure</hi> under which <hi>Livy</hi>

as for that cauſe <hi>Aſinius</hi> called it.
And for the obſolete words which are

hath been fain to ſend with ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds

in his defence of Poeſie hath for the

our chief <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet, for affecting in

that neither any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> or
<hi>Latines</hi> in their <hi>Eclogues,</hi> or <hi>Bucolicks,</hi>
did affect the like. Nor did <hi>Spencer,</hi>
though he lived long after it, endeavour
to juſtifie himſelf, as our Author doth:
the affectation of new words never heard
before, and of old words, worne out of
uſe by long tract of time, being equally
faulty and ridiculous. And though our
Author promiſeth (twice for failing) to
reform this errour, yet I ſee little refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

fellow as the Obſervator, or
one of ſo mean parts, as his <hi>alter idem,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> muſt be thought to be.
I ſee our Author is paſt cure by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means and applications. No way

and practiſed by <hi>Coln,</hi> and <hi>Cupes</hi>
on their <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and to that I leave
him. And firſt with reference to his

<hi>that no Engliſh Reader could climb over it</hi> he
telleth us, <hi>that it is a wooden conceit made
by as wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

continually at rack and manger with my
Lady Philologie, and is ſo <hi>converſant
with Authors of the nobleſt remarque in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
languages,</hi> that a poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> writer
cannot get a good look from him, he
might have known that in the firſt Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Coſmography, writ but when 20
years of age, or not much above, the
Doctor underſtood the meaning of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114885:27"/>
old word <hi>Stylus.</hi> 
                  <q>It is an Inſtrument
(ſaith he, pagina 741. of the Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Micorocoſm.</hi>) with which they
wrote, &amp; was a ſharp-pointed Iron, which
they called <hi>Stylus,</hi> a word now ſignifying
(the original hence taken) the peculiar
kind of Phraſe which any man uſed, as
<hi>negligens Stylus</hi> in <hi>Quintilian, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatus
Stylus in Cicero.</hi>
                  </q> And if the
Doctor and the Obſervator make but
the ſame one perſon, as our Author
telleth us, the Obſervator is as free
from this piece of ignorance, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelf, how poorly and ſcornfully
ſoever he is pleaſed to think and ſpeak of
the one, and the other.</p>
               <p>To clear our way to that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
I think my ſelf obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Reader with a Catalogue of
thoſe ſcornfull names, and reproachfull
charges, which he hath laid upon the
Obſervator and the Doctor too, that I
may ſhew what manner of man we have to
deal with; &amp; what neceſſity there is of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
off thoſe ſlanders and calumniations
which with a prodigal hand he beſtoweth
upon them. For if they be ſuch men as
our Author maketh them, the very truth
will prove unwelcome for their ſakes;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114885:28"/>
little credit being commonly given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any ſuch thing, as is commended by
the Pen of unworthy Perſons. Dividing
therefore all theſe ſlanders and calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are meerly verbal, from ſuch
as carry with them ſome <hi>charge</hi> of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
we will only make a generall
muſter of the firſt, and ſo paſs them over,
knowing full well, <hi>convitia ſpreta exoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,</hi>
that obloquies of this nature have
been better contemned than anſwered by
the wiſeſt men. And for ſuch <hi>charges</hi> as
our Author hath reproached them
with, we doubt not but we ſhall be
able to wipe them off, and to retort the
intended imputation on the Authors
head. Firſt then, he telleth us of the
wooden <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that his <hi>head is made
of blocks,</hi> and his <hi>face of metal,</hi> Fol. 2.
Sends him to <hi>Squire Sanderſon</hi> to <hi>learn
wit and manners,</hi> Fol. 4. Gives him the
name of an <hi>impudent Obſervator,</hi> Fol. 9.
Of <hi>Canis Palatinus, Court-curre,</hi> a fellow
ſo unconcerned, &amp;c. Fol. 12. of This
man in the Moon, Fol. 15. of Doctor
<hi>Coale</hi> whom the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> carbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoed,
Fol. 27. of one between Hawk
and Buzzard, Fol. 30. of the light-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
Obſervator, Fol. 35. of a modern
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114885:28"/>
Poet, and a wit every inch of him, Fol.
36. of an ill-looking Fellow, Fol. 36.
of as arrant an errant as ever was, Fol.
39. accuſeth him of metaphyſical whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whams,
Folio 5. of failing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
fouly, Fol. 9. of notorious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
and falſifying, Fol. 45. of jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
and ſuppoſititious foiſtings, Fol. 10.
of being more ſhamefully out than
ever man was, out of the ſtory beyond all
meaſure, and out of charity beyond all
Religion, Fol. 41. Then for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
he honoreth him with no other
title than that of a Doctor in Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
Fol. 22. the which he ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected, that though it was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one of the unpubliſhed ſheets,
yet he muſt needs vent it in this ſecond
Pamphlet: in which unpubliſhed ſheets
he makes him amends indeed (and we
thank him for it) by calling him the
<hi>bold Champion of the Prelates,</hi> or Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
party, to all which they need
ſay no more (but that the accuſations
ſhall be anſwered in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
than as a wiſe man once did upon
the like provocations, viz. <hi>Tu linguae
nos aurium domini ſumus,</hi> that is to
ſay, that they have as much command
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114885:29"/>
of their eares to hear with <hi>patience,</hi> as
our Author hath of his tongue to ſpeak
his paſſions, our Author being like thoſe
who love to ſay, <hi>with our tongue we will
prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over
us?</hi> Pſal. 12. v. 4.</p>
               <p>Then, for the charges they ſtand thus,
Firſt for the Obſetvator, that he <hi>hath
fouly forged and failed,</hi> in leaving out a
word in the Authors Preface, Fol. 9. for
which called <hi>impudent Obſervator</hi> there,
and taxed with <hi>notorious corrupting and
falſifying</hi> in the latter end of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Pamphlet. And 2ly. That the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
doth ſave him part of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
(that is to ſay in naming any of
thoſe men whom he had accuſed of <hi>being
vicious even to ſcandall</hi>) in naming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for one of them, Fol. 28. Then of
the Doctor it is ſaid, that <hi>Coſmography</hi>
was a work very proper for him, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>none</hi> fitter to deſcribe the world
than he, who all his life hath loved the
World, none like him, Fol. 22. 2ly.
That in the buſineſs of the Sabbath he
hath falſifyed the words of <hi>Pareus</hi> by
changing <hi>quando</hi> into <hi>quomodo;</hi> it being
ſubmitted thereupon unto all the World,
to conſider what it is for a Doctor of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114885:29"/>
                  <hi>Divinity,</hi> for ſo great a Champion of
<hi>Antiquity</hi> againſt <hi>noveltie,</hi> not in an idle
circumſtance, but in the grand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a controverſie, to forge and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifye
a Record ſo boldly, the modeſt
Gentlemam not daring (as he telleth us)
to ſay, ſo impudently, Fol. 24. 3ly.
That having, as all the World knoweth,
moſt inſolently trampled and inſulted
upon this Biſhop, (the Biſhop of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> he means) he no ſooner
heard of his inlargement, but inſtantly
he came creeping and cringing,
and crawling, and crouching to him
ſo ſervilely, as made his Lordſhip mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at the uncouth ſight, and all this to
ſtand his friend, or at leaſt not appear
his foe at that time, when that Doctor
was in a moſt ſorry plight, Fol. 40. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to this effect occurs in the unpubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
ſheets of our Authors Hiſtory,
which hath been touched upon already
in their proper place, and therefore
do not ſtand in need of a repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the charges which our
Author hath drawn up againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and unto theſe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114885:30"/>
we ſhall ſay with <hi>Phaeton.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Pudet haec appropria nobis</l>

               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay,

                     <l>And we ſtand mute, not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then, it is charged on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,
that he hath <hi>fouly failed and
forged,</hi> in leaving out a word in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Preface. How ſo? marry becauſe
our Author having expreſſed himſelf in
theſe very words, viz. <hi>Confident I am,
I stand ſecure againſt any ſubſtantiall
falſhoods, and I hope againſt circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
alſo;</hi> The Obſervator in trimming or
abbreviating theſe words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
leaves out <hi>I hope,</hi> making the
whole ſentence to run thus, viz. that
<hi>he is confident he ſtands ſecure, not only from
ſubstantiall falſhoods, but even from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial
alſo;</hi> and this he calls a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
corrupting and falſifying of his
Preface, Fol. 45. With pride and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114885:30"/>
enough, <hi>parturiant montes</hi> &amp;c. you
have ſhewed us the mountain gentle
Sir, but pray you Sir where is the
mouſe? For though you ſeem to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your confidence <hi>in ſtanding ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
circumſtantial falſhoods, eſpecially in
point of Temporalities, with this word, I Hope;</hi>
yet you are <hi>bold to ſay,</hi> in the following
words, that <hi>no one thing or action, is ſo in
thoſe Annals of</hi> yours <hi>miſlaid,</hi> as to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Annuate;
no hoping here in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto ſuperanuating (as you pleaſe to
phraſe it) but an abſolute confidence, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
a confidence as theſe words of yours,
<hi>I will be bold to ſay,</hi> can expreſs or ſignifie, &amp;
tis in reference to your ſuperannuating, if
you mark it well, that the Obſervator
puts you in mind of your confident Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
For thus it followeth word for
word in the <hi>obſervations,</hi> that is to ſay,
<q>This is a very ſtrange Hyſteron prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
ſetting the Cart before the Horſe,</q>
as we uſe to ſay, For certainly the articles
<q>at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> being made part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Anno
1615. as indeed they were, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time be ſent to the Aſſembly,
or Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which was not
held till three years after, Anno 1619.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114885:31"/>
and this I take to be ſomewhat more?
than a ſuper-annuating as he calleth it
in his temporalities, though he be
<hi>confident</hi> in his Preface, that he ſtands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
not only from ſubſtantiall falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
but even from circumſtantiall
alſo, in aſſigning all, both things and
actions,</q> their proper places. How ill
this confidence is grounded we have
ſeen in part, and ſhall ſee more hereof
hereafter, as occaſion ſerveth. What
think you now on the whole matter,
my moſt precious Pamphleter? Do
not thoſe words you quarrel in the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> follow immediatly upon
ſo groſſe a ſuper-annuating, as you ſtand
convinced of, and was it not of your
not ſuper-anunating that you ſpeak
ſo boldly, without that qualifying <hi>hope,</hi>
which though it may ſave your credit in
ſome other <hi>circumstantiall falſhoods,</hi>
cannot d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it here? Take therefore back
unto your ſelf, your <hi>failing</hi> and your
<hi>forging,</hi> your <hi>notorious falſifying and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting,</hi>
and your impudence too, into the
bargain; the Obſervator hath no title
unto either of them.</p>
               <p>It is charged next on the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that he <hi>ſaveth</hi> our Author <hi>part of his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114885:31"/>
labour</hi> (that is to ſay) in nameing any
of thoſe men whom he had accuſed of
being <hi>vitious even to ſcandal, in naming
himſelf for one of them.</hi> This is good Fiſh
indeed if it were well fryed, but who
ſhall have the cooking of it? It muſt
ſure be ſome Cook of the Devills ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one who is <hi>accuſator fratrum,</hi> a
ſlanderer or Calumniator of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as before was noted: for this charge
he grounds himſelf on theſe words of
<hi>Jerome, Quando ſine nomine contra vitia

that is to ſay, When vices are declamed

is angry, accuſeth himſelf. A very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Lawiers call it, a ſelf condemnor at the

               <p>4 The 2 charge laid upon the Doctor,
and the 4th. in order, is ſaid to be the falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the words of <hi>Pareus,</hi> by changing

               <p>5. The 3 charge laid upon the Doctor,
and the fifth in courſe, is a matter of fact,
viz. <hi>That having, as all the world knoweth,
moſt inſolently trampled and inſulted upon the
Biſhop when he was down, he no ſooner heard

creeping <hi>and</hi> cringing, <hi>and</hi> crawling, <hi>and</hi>
crouching <hi>to him ſo ſervilely, as made his
Lordſhip merry with the uncouth ſight, and all
this to ſtand his friend, or at leaſt not appear
his foe at that time, when that Doctor was in

Know then, that the Doctor having
done his ſervice to the King at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his laſt Parliament, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3.
<hi>An.</hi> 1640. retired himſelf into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that being far off, and out of ſight,
he might the leſſe provoke the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome turbulent men, who were
reſolved to bear all down that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; Not ſtartled with the ſtones
thrown at him in the Speeches of Sir
<hi>Benjamin Rudyard,</hi> and ſome others, he
continued there, till the news, that Dr.
<hi>Baſtwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
were ſent for from their ſeveral Priſons,
brought him back to <hi>Westminſter,</hi> there to
abide ſuch fortune, whether good or ill, as
that conjunction of ill Planets, which
ſeemed deſtructive to ſo many, ſhould
portend to him. No ſooner was he come,
but he was advertiſed, that his retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Country, was taken by moſt men
for a flight from <hi>England;</hi> and wagers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be laid, that he ſhould be ſeen
no more while the Parliament laſted. The
better to cry down this clamour, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
all ſuch as conceived ſo of him, He
went the next morning in his Gown and
Tippet into <hi>Westminſter Hall,</hi> ſhewing
himſelf with no leſſe confidence than
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114885:36"/>
courage to the eyes of many, who would
have been much better pleaſed with his
Room than his Company. To the Biſhop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then releaſed from impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he gave no attendance at all, in his
private lodging or elſewhere, till
meeting him one day in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where the Prebends were then met
together, he gave him in as few words
as might be the common civility of a
complement, for his return unto the
College. The Doctor knew that Mr. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> had been in private
with the Biſhop ſome two days before;
and he knew too much of that Prelate,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd his exaſperations, either to look for
aavour from him, or rely upon him. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to attend before the Committee
for the Courts of Juſtice, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>December,</hi> on the complaint of
Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> who had joyned him in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with the Lord Arch-Biſhop, as
the chief Agents and contrivers of all his
ſufferings, he appeared accordingly. <hi>In
what a ſorry plight he was,</hi> or rather how
far from being in any ſuch <hi>ſorry plight,</hi> how
little dijectedneſſe there appeared in his
Spirits, with what vivacity of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and with what readineſs of ſpeech,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114885:36"/>
he behaved himſelf in the ſeveral times
of his attendance, not only Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
himſelf, but ſeveral Members of that
Committee, who are ſtill alive, are beſt
able to teſtifie. The ſequel of the whole
was this, that though he made his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
with all thoſe diſadvantages of
prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſtruct the way to an equal hearing,
yet got he ſo much ground of them, by
his own modeſt confidence on the one
ſide, and want of fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> roofs on the other,
that in the end he was diſmiſſed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with cheerfull countenance from them
all, but with expreſſions alſo of eſteem and
favour from divers of them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was ordered and <hi>reſolved upon the
Queſtion,</hi> on <hi>Tueſday April</hi> 20. 1641.
That the Sentences againſt Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in
the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> were illegal, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt ground, that he ſhould be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of his impriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nment and fine, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
ſhould be made him by all thoſe
Lords of his Majeſties Council, whoſe
names were to the warrant for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment;
It was ordered at the ſame
time that the charge againſt the Doctor
ſhould be tranſmitted to the Committee
for Religion, to be conſidered of with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114885:37"/>
ſuch other charges and complaints as
were come againſt him. So Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
relates the buſineſſe in the ſtory of his
own proceedings, <hi>Page</hi> 142, and 143. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which time the Doctor never heard
more of this buſineſſe, nor of any other
which did or might create any trouble to
him from the Houſes of Parliament, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the committees or members of
it.</p>
               <p>It hapened in the mean ſeaſon, that
the Doctor preaching in the Abby-Church
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on the next Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after his firſt appearance before that
Committee, was interrupted in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
(after a very unuſual manner) by
the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> knocking with
his Staff upon the Pulpit, and ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
<hi>No more of that point, no more of that
point,</hi> with which <hi>Alarm</hi> the Doctor
was ſo little diſturbed, that without any
haeſitance in ſpeech, or change of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
He addreſſed himſelf unto his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
telling them, that he had not
much to come of the preſent point, but
being that he was commanded not to
preſſe it further, he would proceed unto
the next, which he did accordingly. No
ſooner was he brought back to his Stall,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114885:37"/>
but the Biſhop calling one Doctor <hi>Wilſon</hi>
(another of the <hi>Prebendaries</hi>) to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that which paſſed between them,
required the Doctor to deliver a Copy of
the Sermon by him preached, to which
the Doctor chearfully yeelded, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gave his Lordſhip the whole book
of Sermons which he had then with him:
a thing, in which it was much feared by
ſome of his friends, that he had been ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſurpriſed, and gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en thereby a great
and notable advantage to a dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
But the Doctor knew well enough
on what grounds he went, expecting
without any trouble the ſucceſſe of that
daies adventure. The ſame day, as they
came from the evening Service, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſent one of his Gentlemen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the <hi>Sub-Dean,</hi> Doctor <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> to come to his lodging,
to which it was anſwered openly, and in
a full Cloyſter, by Doctor <hi>Heylyn,</hi> that he
would not go: that he would meet his
Lordſhip in either of the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or any of the Courts in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi>
or the publique Chapter-Houſe
of the Church, and would there
anſwer any thing he could charge him
with, but that he would never ſhuffle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114885:38"/>
up the buſineſs in the Biſhops lodging, or
take a private ſatisfaction for a publick
Baffle. Scarce had he put off his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtments,
when his moſt honoured friends
the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Robert Filmer</hi> (who had heard all that
paſſed before) came to ſpend an hour
with him, and not long after comes the
<hi>Subdean,</hi> from the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with
the Book of Sermons, aſſuring him that
the Biſhop meant him nothing but well,
that he had read none of the Sermons but
that which had been preached that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he profeſſed himſelf much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him for committing into his hands
ſo great a truſt, and finally, that ſince
the Doctor would not come to receive
the Book, he had ſent it to him. To which
the Dr. made reply, that the Book was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him in the ſight of hundreds,
and that he would not otherwiſe receive
it, than either in the ſame place, or a place
more publick, that therefore he ſhould
carry back the Book to him that ſent it, to
the end that he might read over all the
reſt of the Sermons, and pick out of them
what he could to the Doctors diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
that as he did not court his favours,
or expect any thing from him, ſo neither
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114885:38"/>
did he fear his frown, or any further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
which he could do to him, equall to
what he had done already; And finally,
that he was more aſhamed of the poorneſs
of this proſtitution, than at the inſolencies
of the morning, which being the beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that the Sub-dean could at that time
obtain from him, He threw the Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Room, and ſo went his way. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of this buſineſs on the Drs. part was
variouſly cenſured the next day, as men
ſtood affected, <hi>Laudatnr ab his, culpatur ab
illis:</hi> ſome thinking that he had carried it
with too high a hand, others, that he had
done no more, than what he was obliged
to do for his own juſtification. What think
you my moſt precious Author, where is the
<hi>creeping aud cringing, the crawling and
crouching</hi> which your Pamphlet ſpeaks
of? where that <hi>ſervility</hi> of carriage <hi>which
made his Lordſhip merry</hi> at the <hi>ſight</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
though poſſibly as the caſe then ſtood, &amp;
in that very nick of time when the Biſhop
might either <hi>stand his Friend</hi> or appear his
Foe, a little cringing in the Doctor had
not been ſcandalous as the Gentleman
makes it. Nor did the Doctor only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
his Fame, but he took order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his ſafety alſo. And therefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114885:39"/>
underſtanding what reports had been
ſpread abroad upon the accident, ſome
ſaying that the Biſhop had interrupted
him for preaching againſt the Scots (ſome
of whoſe (o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> niſſioners were then preſent)
others, for preaching in defence of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
&amp; others for <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and I
know not what, he gave an accompt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to the King, and then tranſcribed a copy
of the whole paſſage, which had been and
was to have been ſpoken, and ſent it in a
letter to Mr. <hi>John White</hi> of the Temple,
whom he obſerved to be at the Sermon,
deſiring him to communicate it at the
next ſitting of the Committee, that when
he was to appear before them the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, they might be ſatisfied
in all things touching that particular.
Which addreſſe took ſo good effect, that
Mr. <hi>White</hi> (though moſt eagerly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Doctor at his firſt appearance)
did the buſineſſe for him, reading the
whole paſſage to that Committee, and
teſtified what he ſaw and noted when he
was at the Sermon; and thereupon it was
declared by the unanimous voice of all
then preſent, that there was nothing in
that paſſage which did not become an
honeſt man to ſpeak, and a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114885:39"/>
to hear; and not ſo only, but that the
Biſhop was tranſported beyond his
bounds, and failed in his accuſtomed pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And this perhaps both ſmoothed
the way unto the Doctor for his next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
where he found better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
than he did at the firſt; and
drew the Biſhop unto gentler; and
more moderate Counſels.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, matters continuing
between them in this State till aftre
<hi>Candelmas,</hi> the <hi>Sub-dean</hi> findeth the
Doctor! walking in the Common Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,
perſwades him to apply himſelf
to the Biſhop, as being better able to help
or hurt him than any other whatſoever,
preſſing the point with ſuch a troubleſom
importunity, that the Doctor asked him
at the laſt whether that Propoſition came
from himſelf, or the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln?</hi>
If from himſelf, it would no otherwiſe be
look'd upon than a fruitles motion; if from
the Biſhop, it would require ſome further
time of conſideration. Being aſſured that
it came from the Biſhop, and that he
ſhould not doubt of a fair reception, he

acquaint ſome friends therewith, for
removing of all ſuch umbrages and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114885:40"/>
as otherwiſe that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parlance
might have occaſioned, which
having done, he ſignified to the <hi>Subdean</hi>
about 2 days after, that he would wait
upon his Lordſhip in the evening fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
being <hi>Saturday</hi> night, when he
conceived his Lordſhip would be moſt at
leaſure from the buſineſſe and affairs
of Parliament. His Lordſhip being thus
prepared, the Dr. went accordingly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his viſit, but finding ſome company
in the room, whom he knew to be of the
Scotiſh Nation, he recoyled again, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
immediatly at the heels by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
whom the Biſhop ſent after him,
to let him know, that the Company
was upon the parting, and that he
ſhould find his Lordſhip all alone, at his
coming back, as indeed he did; Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
he was preſently taken by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
into his private Gallery, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
commanded to withdaw, and the
Doctor left in private with him, where
after ſome previous expoſtulations on the
one ſide, and honeſt defences on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they came by little and little unto
better terms, and at the laſt into that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
and freedom of diſcourſe, as
ſeemed to have no token in it of the old
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114885:40"/>
diſpleaſures; the Biſhop in concluſion,
accompanying the Doctor out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
commanding one of his Servants to
light him home, and not to leave him
till he brought him to his very door. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which time the Doctor never ſaw
him more (except at the Church) till his

I goe on again.</p>
               <p>The Obſervator being freed from thoſe
<hi>failings</hi> and <hi>forgings,</hi> thoſe <hi>falſifyings</hi>
and <hi>corruptings,</hi> which the Pamphleter
had charged upon him, it will be worth
our time to ſee, whether our Author
be not truly guilty of the ſelf ſame crime,
which he falſly lays unto his charge, in
<hi>falſifying</hi> and <hi>corrupting</hi> the Text of his
own Hiſtory, by ſoiſting many words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, to make his quarrel with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
the more juſt and rational. For
as I have ſome where read of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that
having firſt made his Book of Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he did afterwards ſo tranſlate and
expound the Scripture as to make it ſpeak
agreeable to the ſenſe and Doctrine
which he had publiſhed in that Book: ſo
I may very ſafely ſay, that our Author ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
framed his anſwer to the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as much to the diſadvantage of the
Obſervator as he poſſibly could, did after
change and alter the very ſenſe of his
Hiſtory, to make it ſpeak agreeable to the
words of his Pamphlet; as for example.</p>
               <p>1. The Obſervator faulted it in the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
for ſaying, <hi>that as a man without a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114885:41"/>
conſort, ſo a King without his ſupreme
Councel, was but a half-formed ſterill thing,
the natural extracts of the one,</hi> (for ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the Author) <hi>procreated without
a wife, being not more ſpurious, than the
politique deſcendents of the other, without the
Caution of a repreſentative.</hi> This looked on
<q>by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> as a Paradox moſt
dangerous to ſupreme Authority, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Parliaments ſo neceſſary to all acts
of State, as if that Kings, or they that have
the power of Kings, could do nothing
lawfully, but what they do with their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</q>
and by their conſent. What
ſaith the Pamphleter to this? marry he
hopes, (for he ſtill ſaves himſelf by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping)
that no man of any ingenuity, can
ſo much as queſtion, but that his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Deſcendents imply Statute Laws,
which no King of <hi>England</hi> hath power to
make without Common conſent in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Fol. 7. and that the text may
ſpeak agreeably to the words of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he hath foiſted the word Laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, where before it was not; as may
appear to any man who will be pleaſed
to compare the Editions.</p>
               <p>2ly. The Hiſtorian had affirmed for
certain that Sir <hi>Robert Manſell as Vice-Admirall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114885:42"/>
had an unqueſtionoble right of
the chief conduct of that enterprize</hi> (againſt
the Spaniard) <hi>upon the Dukes default.</hi> For
which being contradicted by the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi>
grounding himſelf on the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and common practice of our Kings, in
granting thoſe commands to any, as they
ſee cauſe for it; The Pamphleter ſtands
ſtil to his former errour, upon this ground,
that many men of wiſdome and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hold it for a Rule, not only in this
particular, but in all ſuch as <hi>have vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
poteſtatem,</hi> Fol. 7. But yet to make
ſure work withall, he hath thruſt theſe
words, <hi>as they thought,</hi> into the text
of his Hiſtory, and thereby made his own
poſition, <hi>that Sir Robert Manſell had an
unqueſtionable right to the chief comduct in
that enterprize,</hi> to be the opinion of thoſe
many men of wiſdome and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whom the comment points too. New
if we ask what theſe men were, who
<hi>thought</hi> ſo of it, we find them in ſome lines
before to be the <hi>Mariners;</hi> men (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe)
of <hi>long experience,</hi> but of no great
<hi>wiſdome,</hi> and ſuch as better underſtand the
Juriſdiction of their <hi>Maſters-place,</hi> than
of the Vice-admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and what
ſuch men as theſe may hold, touching the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114885:42"/>
Powers and privileges of ſuch as have <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carium
poteſtatem,</hi> is ſo inconſiderable, that
I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to inſiſt more
on it.</p>
               <p>3ly. The Hiſtorian had declared, that
for <hi>Armianiſm,</hi> the informations were
very pregnant, &amp;c. For which being
blamed in many things by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi>
he puts off the odium from himſelf, to Mr.
<q>
                     <hi>Pym</hi> and the Committee for Religion,
profeſſing that he only recited, what that
Committee declared as the product of
their enquiries, and with this anſwer he
conceiveth he might eaſily avoid no leſs
than 25 pages of the <hi>Obſervation,</hi> Fol. 15.</q>
So he, and that it may be thought ſo by the
Reader too, he hath thrice foiſted in theſe
words, <hi>they ſaid,</hi> into that part of his
Narrative, which concerns this buſineſs,
as Fol. 97. l. 27. for, <hi>Arminianiſn,</hi> they
ſaid, <hi>informations were very pregnant, &amp;c.</hi>
and Fol. 98. l. 12, 13. the <hi>hazard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c. flowed,</hi> they ſaid,
<hi>partly from the uncontrouled publiſhing of
ſeverall points tending and working
that way,</hi> and ibidem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine 19, 20. <hi>the
greateſt danger was from Popery direct,</hi>
and <hi>from this,</hi> the <hi>danger</hi> they ſaid <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very great,</hi> &amp;c. Here have we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114885:43"/>
                  <hi>dicnnt, ferunt, aiunt,</hi> theſe words <hi>they
ſaid,</hi> no leſſe than thrice, in half a leaf,
foiſted in the text, to make it ſuitable to
the Pamphlet. And we had a <hi>praedicant</hi>
in it too, (that you may ſee, I have ſtill
ſome ſmattering of my <hi>Grammar,</hi>) an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of ſome men for their <hi>uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
preaching of ſeveral points <hi>tending and
warping towards</hi> Popery, though now upon
an admonition from the Obſervator, he
hath turned <hi>preaching</hi> into <hi>publiſhing,</hi> as
appears, fol. 98 line 14. guided thereto,
by the illuſtration of his comment, and
a deſire to do ſome right to Doctor
<hi>Cozens,</hi> which I thank him for, whom
he had formerly accuſed for <hi>preaching
many things which warped towards Popery,</hi>
but now agreeth ſo far with the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as to excuſe him from <hi>publiſhing</hi>
and direct Popery, in his <hi>Hours of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The Obſervator had declared, that
the Primate had conceived a diſpleaſure
againſt the Lord Deputy for abrogating
the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed by
the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſetling in their
place the Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
to which the Pampleter replyeth,
that the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114885:43"/>
in the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> were never abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
though thoſe of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
and <hi>approved</hi> by that convocation,
Fol. 42. For proof whereof he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a Certificate under the hands of
Doctor <hi>Barnard,</hi> and one <hi>Samuel Pullain,</hi>
whoſe title and degree I know, and
therefore am not to be blamed, if I give
none to him. Whether this Superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Articles of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> amount not to an abrogation of
thoſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall be conſidered of
hereafter in that Chapter which concerns
Armianiſm. Now I ſhall only tell you
this, that whereas our Author had it
thus in his firſt Edition, Fol. 132, <hi>viz.</hi>
that in the Synod aſſembled in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the body of Articles formed by that
Church, Anno 1615. were repealed, and
in their places were ſubſtituted the
thirty nine Articles of the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> Now to conform his text to
the former Comment, he hath left
out the word <hi>repealed</hi> in his new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Fol. 137. and tells us a
clean contrary ſtory to that before,
which ſhall be looked upon in the
place before mentioned, as more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114885:44"/>
And ſo I cloſe this Chapter, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
chiefly for the juſtication of the
Obſervator, and the retorting of ſome
<hi>Foiſtings,</hi> on the Authors head; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
confuting many of the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Anſwers, which could not be
ſo well conſidered of in an other

anſwer, that he would impower
the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to give his Majeſty
all ſatisfaction in that particular,
which accordingly he did.</q> The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
ſeems much diſpleaſed, that any
ſuch inference ſhould be made from the
former words, as the impowering of the
Earl by <hi>Proxie,</hi> to proceed to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Marriage, and cals it
<q>An adoe about nothing. How ſo?
Becauſe (ſaith he) the Obſervator
might have found his meaning in
the page next following, where he
ſpeaks of the Earls delivering of the
Proxie, clearly importing, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his cuſtody to conſign to another,
Fol.</q> 3. But gentle Sir, men that write
Hiſtories, muſt write both properly and
plainly, and not poſt off the Reader
from one place to another, to finde out
their meaning, or elſe be forced to put
ſuch a ſenſe and underſtanding on their
words, as they will not bear, whereof
we ſhall ſpeak more anon on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>In the mean time he proceeds to tell
us, firſt that the Proxie was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> only, not to
him and <hi>Don Charles,</hi> as the Obſervator
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114885:46"/>
ſaith; And ſecondly, that he would
gladly know, who this <hi>Don Charles</hi> was,
he being the firſt <hi>Don Charles,</hi> as he, or any
body elſe he thought had ever heard of,
<hi>Ibid.</hi> To reply firſt unto the laſt, he need
not be deſirous to know who this <hi>Don
Charles</hi> was, the Obſervator having told
him poſitively and plainly enough, that
he was the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Brother; and
though the Gentleman pretending to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue (as his <hi>Encuerpoes,</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collados</hi>
do moſt plainly fignifie) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Obſervator ſhould have called
that Prince by the name of <hi>Don Carlo,</hi> as
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do: yet, if he pleaſe to
look into the general Hiſtory of that
Kingdome, written in <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Lewis
de Mayerne,</hi> and tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by
<hi>Grimſtone,</hi> he ſhall not fail of finding there
the name of <hi>Don Charles</hi> many ſcores of
times. But for his confident aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Proxie was made, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
only to the King, and not unto
the King and his Brother, or to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, as the Obſervator hath
enformed him; if that prove true,
I muſt renounce my knowledge in all
other Languages, but my natural <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>

               <p>The next thing faulted in our Author,

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114885:47"/>
The contrary whereof being proved
by the Obſervator, the Pamphlet telleth
us, that <hi>any fair mannered man,</hi> would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the word <hi>ever,</hi> with reference to
<hi>the State of Reformation,</hi> Fol. 3. and then
the meaning muſt be this, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>

that is to ſay, ever ſince the time of

Gent. meaning, but we poor men that
cannot ſearch into his thoughts, muſt
know his <hi>meaning by his gaping,</hi> by what
he ſpeaks or writes, not by what he
thinks: and ſure I am, the words can
bear no ſuch Grammatical conſtruction
as he puts upon them. Nor is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

he gives us of it; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never
troubling our proceedings in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> nor
in the firſt beginnings of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
(of whoſe life next under God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
he was the principal preſerver) till
firſt by an underhand fomenting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by appearing viſibly in the broyles
of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> he was in forced to
arm againſt her: reaſons of State, and

He doth <hi>but ſeem</hi> ſo them, that's one thing,
and he doth <hi>not ſeem</hi> ſo, that is another:
the Obſervator ſaying only, that if upon
the provocations given by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
in ſupporting the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> took up armes againſt us, he had
all the reaſon in the world for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
which certainly is not ſo much

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>This is that letter in the <hi>Cabala,</hi> to
which the Author doth direct us, and
refer himſelf, in which it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
firſt, that there is not one word in
it touching the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> that being a
point which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not
hear of in that long Treaty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the match was finally agreed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114885:48"/>
on, as was plainly ſhewn by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator:
which makes it evident how ill
credit is to be given to our preſent Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
citing this Letter for a proof,
that the reſtoring of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> was
never ſincerely intended by the Court
of <hi>Spain.</hi> This Letter rather ſeems to
prove, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not ſtick
at the Palatinate, if he could come off
handſomely from the Match it ſelf. The
King commanding <hi>Olivarez, in all other
things to procure the ſatisfaction of the King of
Great Britain;</hi> and therefore why not
amongſt <hi>other things,</hi> in the reſtitution of
the Palatinate to the Prince Elector? In
the next place we are to know that this
Letter was written before the Prince
went into <hi>Spain:</hi> where by the gallantry
of his carriage, and his prudent conduct
of the buſineſſe, he not only overcame all
thoſe difficulties, which had before been
interpoſed, but conquered the <hi>averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
of the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> who became
afterward extremely affectionate to him.
And for the Rupture which enſued, it
is moſt clear and evident, that it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not from the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulency
or delays of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:114885:49"/>
After this followes the Negotiation of
the Match with <hi>France,</hi> communicated
by King <hi>James</hi> (as the Hiſtorian would
inform us) to his Houſes of Parliament,
by whom it was entertained with una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
conſent. The improbability of
which, is proved by the Obſervator, by
the averſneſſe of that King from parting
with ſuch a ſpeciall <hi>branch</hi> of his Royal
Prerogative, and the diſdain with which
he entertained the like propoſition from
them, a few years before. To this the
Pampletter replieth, <q>That it was no
more leſſening of his Prerogative, to
communicate with them in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into, then in the breach of a
treaty of that nature, as he did in that
of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was the main buſineſſe
debated in the Parliament of the 21. of
King <hi>James.</hi>
                  </q> But Sir, who told you
that King <hi>James</hi> communicated with his
Houſes of parliament, in the Breach with
<hi>Spain?</hi> I trow you finde not any ſuch
thing in the Journals of either of the
Houſes, with which you ſeem at other
times to be very converſant; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
would have vouched them now,
had he found this in them. That
King had no deſign or purpoſe of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off his correſpondence with his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114885:49"/>
Catholick Majeſty, and could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
thoſe counſels with his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament, which he never had.
In the courſe of that buſineſſe, he was
meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> forcibly drawn to yeeld
unto it at the laſt, by the continual ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of the Prince, and the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> and an importunate Petition
of the Lords and Commons, preſented by
Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a
principal Agent in promoting the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Breach. It followeth by our Authors
<hi>Logick,</hi> the King communicated not
with his Parliament in the Breach with
<hi>Spain; Ergo</hi> (which is in Engliſh <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
as we know who ſaid) he did not
communicate with them neither in his
Treaty with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Obſervators not <hi>inveighing
againſt King</hi> James, we have ſpoke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and of King <hi>James</hi> his ſtickling
againſt the <hi>Arminians</hi> (ſo far forth as
the Pamphleter leads me to it) I ſhall
ſpeak hereafter. The error about the
day of that Kings interment, and the
new Kings marriage is confeſſed and
mended by the Author, but ſo that he
would fain have the firſt error accompted
but a <hi>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p of his pen,</hi> Fol. 6. and putteth
on ſome reaſons, ſignifying nothing, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114885:50"/>
conclude it for him. And for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
error, that about the marriage, he
confeſſeth that he was miſtaken. But
ſaith withall, he could <hi>inſallibly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that it was deſigned upon the</hi> 8. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which I would firſt know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this demonſtration were <hi>à Priore,</hi>
or <hi>à Posteriore,</hi> as the Logicians have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
or that it was not rather
ſome ſuch ſorry Argument, drawn from
the common Topick of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> as he
commonly builds on, or poſſibly ſome
<hi>fallacy put</hi> upon him, <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid,
ad dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> or ſome ſuch like
Elench. But let it be the firſt for this
once, and then I ſhall next ask him, why
he communicated not the <hi>infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi>
to us, which he ſaith he had,
ſince otherwiſe we are not bound to
believe him in it; he being no niggard
of his ſtory, when there is leſſe occaſion
for it, then was given him now. And
we know the Rule in Logick to be very
true, <hi>viz. non exiſtentium &amp; non apparentium,
eadem eſt ratio,</hi> A Demonſtration not
produced, is as good as none.</p>
               <p>In their Majeſties goings to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
the Pamphleter ſtill adheres to his
firſt expreſſion, and ſeemeth diſpleaſed,
that the Obſervator ſhould not have ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114885:50"/>
much <hi>ordinary capacity,</hi> as <hi>to diſcern the
difference between the taking Coach to and for</hi>
Whitehall, Fol. 6. But Sir, a good Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
(amongſt which number you
would fain count your ſelf for one)
muſt write both properly and plainly,
as before was ſaid, and not trouble and
torment the Reader, in <hi>drawing dun out of
the mire,</hi> in a piece of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And he
that ſhall compare thoſe words, with the
reſt that follow, will finde no reaſon to
collect any thing out of them, but that
their Majeſties went all the way by
Coach, till they came to <hi>London.</hi> He
that ſhall ſay, that any Gent. of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi>
takes Coach for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> when
he alighteth out of the Coach at the
<hi>Temple-gate,</hi> walketh on foot to the
ſtairs, from thence takes Boat to the
Kings Bridge, and ſo walketh on foot
again till he come to the Hall, muſt
needs be thought to ſpeak improperly
at the leaſt, that I ſay not worſe: no
man of ordinary capacity being able to
underſtand him otherwiſe, but that the
Gent. went by Coach all the way to
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and not the leaſt part of it
only. But our Author will not yeeld
himſelf to be out in any thing, whereof
we have had many examples already, and
have more to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114885:51"/>
Of reſtraining the Kings power in Acts
of State to the will of Parliaments, and
the wrong ſuppoſed to be done to Sir
<hi>Robert Manſell,</hi> with our Authors falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Text on thoſe occaſions, we
have ſpoke before. The next thing which
occurs <hi>de novo,</hi> is the ſcorn, put by our
Author on the <hi>Coronation</hi> of Kings, which
he plainly cals a <hi>ſerious vanity,</hi> affirming
that they <hi>cannot be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le to better purpoſe.</hi>
Reproved for this by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and
thoſe ſolemn <hi>Inaugurations</hi> being proved,
to be <hi>very ancient, directed by the holy Spirit
in the Book of God, exemplified</hi> not only, in
<hi>David,</hi> and many other Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi>
but alſo in the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the chief
King of all: our Author ſtandeth unto
it ſtill, becauſe (ſaith he) it conferreth
no one dram of ſolid Grandure to the
Throne, Kings being perfect Kings, and
qualified fully to all intent of Royalty
without it, Fol. 7. Igrant indeed, that
<hi>Kings are perfect Kings</hi> without this ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The Caſe of <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Watſon</hi> in
the firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Murderers</hi> and <hi>Felons</hi> in the firſt year
of King <hi>Charles,</hi> make this plain enough:
all of them being indited for their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Felonies and Treaſons, committed by
them againſt the peace of thoſe ſeveral
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114885:51"/>
Kings, their Crowns and dignities, they
neither of them crown'd at the time of
thoſe trials, ſo that I ſhall not trouble
my ſelf with looking into the caſe of
the <hi>Post-nati,</hi> as to that particular. But
yet I cannot yeeld unto him, that theſe
ſolemnities confer not ſo much as a ſingle
dram of ſolid Grandure to the Throne.
For certainly the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> entry into a
Cognizance or ſtipulation with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to govern them according to their
ſeveral Lawes, and their Atturning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to him, or acclaiming him to be
their King, in our Authors language,
muſt needs contribute much to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Regal Throne. Were
it not thus, King <hi>Charles</hi> had been very
ill adviſed, in putting himſelf to ſuch
immeaſurable charges for receiving the
poor Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi>
not more adviſed then he, in threatning
him, that if he <hi>long deferred the duty</hi> of a
Coronation, <hi>they might perhaps be inclined
to make choice of another King.</hi> For which
conſult our Author, Fol. 125. It ſeems
by this, that neither of them did eſteem
it a <hi>ſerious vanity,</hi> and that the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it to have ſomewhat in it of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Grandure; and this our Author
ſaw at laſt, and therefore is compell'd by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114885:52"/>
the light of Reaſon, and the convicting of
his judgement (whether by the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
or not, ſhall not now be queſtioned)
to conclude thus with him, that <hi>there is
ſomething of a ſolid ſignification</hi> in thoſe <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
vanities.</p>
               <p>But then he adds withall, <hi>that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings are not concerned</hi> in it, as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the <hi>Obſervator, his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
not being touched</hi> in it, <hi>becauſe not
Crowned.</hi> Nor doth this inference hold
good by the Rules of Logick, that becauſe
his <hi>Catholick Majeſty is not crowned at all,</hi>
therefore the Rites of Coronation are
not accompted ſacred by him, or that
he is unconcerned in thoſe ſcoffs and
ſcornes, which are put upon it by our
Author. Betwixt all Kings there is that
ſacred correſpondence, that the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Rites or perſon of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all the reſt: and though the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
King</hi> hath not been Crowned in
theſe laſt ages, yet do they ſtill retain a
<hi>ſolemn initiation into Regality,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
calleth it, at their firſt entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
State. Not Crowned, I grant in
theſe latter Ages, though they were of
old; that which our Saviour ſpake in
the caſe of Marriage between man and
woman, <hi>viz. Non fuit ſic ab initio,</hi> that it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114885:52"/>
was not ſo from the beginning, being
true in the Political Marriages of theſe
Kings and Kingdomes. For in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Spain</hi> written by <hi>Lewis de Mayerne,</hi>
it is ſaid of <hi>Inigo Ariſta</hi> the 6. King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
that he was anointed and crowned,
after the manner of the Kings of <hi>France</hi>
(of which he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſaid to have been a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)
that cuſtome being afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the following Kings. And
though it be believed by ſome, that this
cuſtome came only into <hi>Navarre,</hi> after
they had Kings of the Houſe of <hi>Champagn,</hi>
yet that will give it the antiquity of
Four hundred years, and prove withall
that Crowning and Anointing, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by ſome Kings in that Continent.
Nor was it thus only in <hi>Navarre,</hi> but
in <hi>Caſtile</hi> alſo, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the third of that
name, King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> (fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in his wars againſt his Neighbours)
cauſing himſelf to be Crowned Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Cathedral Church
at <hi>Leon,</hi> with the ſolemnities and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
requiſite in ſo great an Act, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the holy Unction, and the
Crown from <hi>Don Raymond</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Toledo:</hi> performed in <hi>Leon, anno</hi> 1134.
and afterwards iterated in <hi>Caſtile</hi> (as
ſome writers ſay) for the Crown of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:114885:53"/>
as a diſtinct and different Kingdome.
The chargeable repetition of which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Act in ſo many Kingdomes, as
now and of long time have been united
in the perſons of the <hi>Catholick Kings,</hi> may
poſſibly be the reaſon of the diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of it in theſe latter daies: each
Kingdome in that Continent, being apt
to think it ſelf neglected (as the <hi>Scots</hi>
did here) in caſe the King received not
a particular Coronation for it. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
therefore that one Coronation
could not ſerve for all, it was the thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
way in reſpect of charges, and the
way moſt like to pleaſe the particular
Nations, not to receive the Crowns of
any of them, in that ſolemn way, which
was and is obſerved to this day in moſt
Chriſtian Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Coronation being paſt, the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
for the Parliament approaching;</hi> alſo
in the way of preparation, he thought it
fit, that ſome who in the <hi>laſt, had been
uncivil towards the Duke, ſhould be made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
upon which accompt</hi> (ſaith our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian)
<hi>the Lord Keeper Williams fell, and
his place was diſpoſed of to Sir</hi> Thomas Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry.
From which what can be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
concluded by a knowing man, but
that the diſplacing of the Lord Keeper
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114885:53"/>
                  <hi>Williams,</hi> muſt fall between the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the following Parliament? And
then our Author will not yeeld, that he
was out in this <hi>Temporality.</hi> How ſo?
becauſe (ſaith he) I never intended it, to
be in that moment of time to which that
Paragraph relates, Fol. 8 Is not this
like to prove a brave hiſtorian think
you, who profeſſeth openly that he
writes one thing and intends another?
Is not the Reader like to be very well
edified by ſuch reſervations, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

                  </gap>de the
errors of his pen but theſe ſilly ſhifts.
And yet <hi>Solamen miſeris,</hi> as the old verſe
hath it. It is ſome comfort to him, that
the Obſervator ſhould be out himſelf, in
ſaying that the Great Seal was taken
from him in <hi>October,</hi> whereas it is ſaid
by Mr. <hi>Howell,</hi> that he departed from the
Seal in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Fol. 8. But what if
Mr. <hi>Howels</hi> intelligence fail him, who
though a very honeſt man pretends not
to the Spirit of infallibility, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
doth? then certainly the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
is not out, nor my Author in.

But that we may not ſpend more time in
toſſing this debate like a <hi>Tenice Ball,</hi>
from one hand to another; the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
may be pleaſed to know, firſt,
that the committing of the Great Seal to
Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry,</hi> is placed by the
Continuator of <hi>Stowes</hi> Chronicle after
the 25. of <hi>September,</hi> which makes it very
near <hi>October</hi> if it were not in it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is affirmed by thoſe who have cauſe
to know it, that the Seal was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that Gent. preciſely on the firſt
or ſecond Sunday of <hi>October,</hi> neither
ſooner nor later. And Thirdly, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
certain, that whenſoeuer it was given
to Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry,</hi> it was taken from
the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> but a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the newes of taking it from the one,
and giving it to the other, being brought
to <hi>Oxford</hi> in the ſame Letters. But then
admitting fourthly, that the Biſhop part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Seal in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> yet what
makes this to our Authors juſtification?
makes it not to his further condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather? Who placeth it after Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemas,
and makes it one of thoſe things
in which the King thought fit to <hi>prepare</hi>
himſelf (the Coronation being ended)
for the following Parliament. Never
had writer ſuch ill luck, or ſo little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114885:54"/>
ſuch ill luck, in calling after
any thing which comes in his way, but
finding nothing that will keep him up
from ſinking in his own miſtakes; ſo
little modeſty, in yeelding to no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which is brought againſt him: our
Author being like the bold Wraſtler, I
have ſomewhere read of, who though
he had many fals, and was often foiled,
would ſtill perſwade the company that
he had the better.</p>
               <p>But yet he makes us ſome amends in
the next that followes, <hi>Confeſſing that
he was miſtaken in making Dr.</hi> Laud <hi>Biſhop
of</hi> Bathe <hi>and</hi> Wells, <hi>when he officiated at the
Coronation.</hi> But then withall, he ſlights the
error, calling it ſcornfully <hi>Grande nefas,</hi> an
horrid crime no doubt, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Not noted
by the <hi>Obſervator</hi> as a <hi>crime,</hi> or a horrid
crime, but as an error or miſtake in his
<hi>Temporalities;</hi> concerning which he ſaith,
and <hi>will be bold to ſay it,</hi> in the end of his
Preface, <hi>that no one thing or action is ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid,
as to ſuperannuate, and not many to vary
from the very day of their prime exiſtence.</hi>
Not <hi>from the very day of their prime exiſtence!</hi>
that were brave indeed, but braver if it
were good in the courſe of the Hiſtory.
Some <hi>variations from the very day of their
prime exiſtence,</hi> being ſeen already. We
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114885:55"/>
have here a <hi>ſuper-ſemi-annuating</hi> (a fine
word of our Authors new faſhion) in
making Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and
<hi>Wells,</hi> ſeven moneths at leaſt before his
time: a <hi>ſuperannuating</hi> in the great rout
given to <hi>Tilly</hi> by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
placed by our Author in the year 1630.
whereas that battle was not fought till
the year next following; a <hi>ſuper-triennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi>
in placing the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> before
the convocation of <hi>Ireland</hi> held in the
year 1615. that Synod not being holden
untill three years after, and if I do not
finde a <hi>ſuper-ſupe-annuating</hi> (that is to ſay,
a lapſe of ſix years) either in the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
or the Hiſtory, I am content, our
Author ſhall enjoy the honour of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
triumph; he muſt take greater pains
then this to <hi>relieve his Preface,</hi> from the
purgatory of the Obſervator, of which
he telleth us Fol. 9. or otherwiſe it is
like to lie there, till the next general
<hi>Gaol-delivery</hi> by a Bull from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>ſuperannuating</hi> in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of the Councel of <hi>Dort,</hi> (a <hi>ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuating</hi>
call'd in the true ſenſe of the
thing) our Author hath very much to
ſay, though little to the purpoſe, in his
own defence; for he reſolves to act the
<hi>Wraſtler</hi> above mentioned, and will not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114885:55"/>
yeeld himſelf foyled, fall he never ſo
often. And firſt he flyeth as formerly
to his private intentions, telling us, that
he <hi>intended his not ſuperannuating of ſuch
things and actions, as have reference to the
ſixteen years of King</hi> Charles, <hi>whereof he
treateth in that Hiſtory, not of ſuch things as
antecedently occurred, and were taken in by the
By,</hi> Fol. 8. And this is like an help at
<hi>Maw,</hi> kept in his hands to turn the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the game, when it ſeemeth moſt
deſperate. But beſides this <hi>ſubterſuge</hi> of
his private intentions, he not only tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, that in things <hi>taken in by the By,
he never will, nor did ever mean, to warrant
the truth to every particular year;</hi> but that
this errour <hi>being extravagant, and out of the
bounds of his principal Narrative,</hi> may come
within the <hi>confidence of his not ſuperannua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
A rule and reſolution no leſſe <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
then the truths he writes, and ſuch as
ill-becomes the mouth of a good Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
who if he pleaſe to walk abroad
into forein Countreys, or look back
into former times, muſt have as great
care in the circumſtances of time and
place (his <hi>Temporability</hi> and <hi>localities</hi> in
our Authors language) as in relating
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114885:56"/>
But leſt this ſhould not ſerve the turn,
he hath a trick to make all ſure above all
diſpute, which is by fathering this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
on the Committee for <hi>Religion,</hi>
whoſe <hi>report,</hi> he there did, or at leaſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
(he will be ſure that his <hi>intentions</hi>

dares he ſtand to this? dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s he ſtand to
any thing? no, we finde the contrary.
For though he telleth us, that the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi>
would be <hi>wondrous blank,</hi> at his
<hi>Ridiculus mus,</hi> and after ſuch a ranting
triumph, if the error ſhould be found
to be none of his, but the infallible
Committees, yet in the end it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that it was <hi>infallibly his own,</hi> himſelf
confeſſing, that <hi>thinking fit to contract the
Report of that Committee to a narrow ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
not minding the words, ſo he ſecured the
ſubſtance,</hi> he failed in the tranſcript of
his copy, which did erroneouſly (he
grants) preſent the Articles ſent to <hi>Dort,</hi>

on the whole matter the greater wonder,
that the man having made this ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

ſhould reckon as a defence of his not
ſuperannuating in this particular; which
is ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114885:56"/>
of the Report, the miſtake committed,
and clearing of the Committee for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
upon which he had laid it. Or
granting that the copy was not of his

ſome others, the broken fragments, and

before that Committee; that ſuch a
bold affront ſhould be offered to their
infallibility, by laying this miſtake on
them: or that Gent. Mr. <hi>Pym<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

bear witneſs to it? But our Author will
not leave it ſo. The Obſervator muſt
be charged for fetching a <hi>running leap</hi> to
pag. 96. rather then <hi>not finde another</hi>
miſtake (ſor ſo I think he meaneth) in
the Hiſtory which is now before us. I
thought the Obſervator had in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a more fair acknowledgement, in
laying theſe miſtakes together, then if
he had took them one by one, as they
came in his way, eſpecially conſidering
that he gives a good reaſon for it, that is
to ſay, that he might <hi>not trouble himſelf
with the like obſervation at another time:</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:114885:57"/>
and did I think the Pamphleter would
be ruled again by reaſon, I could give
him another reaſon for it: that he was
now to take his leave of thoſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which perſonally related to the
two Kings, in their ſeveral and diſtinct
capacities: This of King <hi>James</hi> in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> to the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Aſſembly at
<hi>Dort</hi> being the laſt point in which he
was concerned in his own particular,
without relation to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and
not ſeconded by him. It's true, we finde
them acting afterward in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
but in ſeveral times; King <hi>James</hi>

lawfull ſports, and King <hi>Charles</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding

               <p>Only I muſt crave leave to hoop in

of another as bad, telling us in
that leafe new printed, (but not new
printed only, if at all, on that occaſion)
that he was <hi>after ſtyled Duke of York.</hi> For
which, being reprehended by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,
as one that did <hi>accommodate his
Style to the preſent times,</hi> the Gent. ſeemeth
much diſtreſſed, and in the agony of
thoſe diſtreſſes, asks theſe following
queſtions: 1. <hi>How it is poſſible to eſcape
the Obſervators laſh? 2. What ſhall an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

In theſe two doubts I ſhall reſolve him,
and reſolve him briefly, letting him
know, that an <hi>honeſt Hiſtorian</hi> ſhould have

But becauſe the ſame truth may poſſibly

him to conſult the new <hi>Church Hiſtory,</hi>

occaſioned by a book this year
ſet forth by <hi>P. Bound Dr. in Divinity</hi>
(and enlarged with additions, <hi>anno</hi>

are maintained. 1. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of ſanctifying every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, as in the <hi>Moſaical Decalogue,</hi> is
moral and perpetual. 2. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all other things in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi>
were taken away (<hi>Prieſthood, Sacrifices,</hi>
and <hi>Sacraments</hi>) his <hi>Sabbath</hi> was ſo
changed as it ſtill remaineth. 3. That
there is a great reaſon, why we <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
ſhould take our ſelves as ſtrictly
bound to reſt upon the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as
the <hi>Jewes</hi> were upon their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it

on to tell us, <q>how much the <hi>learned

about theſe <hi>Sabbatarian Doctrines;</hi> ſome
embraced them as ancient truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to <hi>Scripture,</hi> long diſuſed and

               <p>This being ſaid, we ſhall proceed unto
the anſwering of the Pamphleters argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not more remarkable for their
paucity, then they are for their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
He telleth us firſt that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Whitgift</hi> in his <hi>defence of the Anſwer
to the Admonition,</hi> ſaith, <hi>in the preſent tenſe,
that the Sabbath is ſuperſtitiouſly uſed by ſome,
and ſpeaks ſoon after of a Sabbath, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the fourth Precept.</hi> The Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
hereupon inferreth that he could
not mean the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath, and if not
that, it must of neceſſity be the Lords day,</hi>
Fol. 23. Here is a ſtout argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
able to <hi>knock</hi> down any man which
thinks the contrary; for mark the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
thereof. Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi>
gives unto the <hi>Lords day</hi> (in a <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
and <hi>figurative</hi> ſenſe) the name of
<hi>Sabbath, Ergo,</hi> which is in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it muſt be kept with all the rigors
and ſeverities which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equired unto
the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by the
Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> or therefore, which is in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114885:64"/>
Latine <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is as much divinity in
the Lords day now by whomſoever it was
ordained, as had been heretofore aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> of Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing.
And then again, the <hi>Lords
day</hi> is by him called a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and ſaid
to be <hi>there commanded by the fourth precept,</hi>
therefore there is ſuch a Divinity in it
as Dr. <hi>Bound</hi> aſcribes to his <hi>Lords daies Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
according to his Articles and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
laid down. Did ever man ſo argue in
a point which he makes to be of ſo great
concernment, or make ſo ill a choice both
of the <hi>Medium</hi> and the Author, which
he groundeth upon? Firſt of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
for may we not conclude by the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
<hi>Logick</hi> that there is a <hi>Divinity</hi> in all
the <hi>holydaies</hi> of the Church; becauſe all
grounded on, and warranted by the
fourth commandement, as all learned
writers ſay they are? and that there is a
Divinity in <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> becauſe
<hi>both places ſet apart for ſacred Actions, and
maintenance alſo for the perſons,</hi> which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate

alledgeth, <hi>are included alſo in this

hath put upon him. Aſſuredly
unleſs the Pamphleter had been bribed to
betray the cauſe, and juſtifie the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
he would have paſſed over the
debating of this <hi>new Divinity,</hi> or elſe
found more then one man in the ſpace
of 36 years (ſo long it was from the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114885:65"/>

               </p>
               <p>Let us next ſee what comfort he can
finde from the book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> of which
he ſaith, that <hi>there was not any thing more

that look into that Book, will finde
many points more <hi>ſpecially</hi> taught, and
more throughly preſſed, then this <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
he talketh of; witneſſe thoſe long

                  </gap>ourth) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the obſervation of the Sabbath, which
is our Sunday</hi>] Fol. 23. If this be ſo, and
to be underſtood of ſuch a <hi>Divinity,</hi> or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114885:65"/>
ſuch a divine inſtitution of the Lords
day, as our Author would fain put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: firſt then we muſt have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
warrant, and command from God
himſelf, altering the day, from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day of the week, on which he
commanded it to be kept by the Law
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> unto the firſt day of the week,
on which it is now kept by the Church
of Chriſt. But ſecondly that Homily
(I mean that Of the time and place of
prayer) doth inform us thus: <q>That
the goldly Chriſtian people began to
follow the example, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, immediately after the
Aſcenſion of our Lord Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to chooſe them a ſtanding day of
the week to come together, yet not
the ſeventh day which the <hi>Jewes</hi> kept,
but the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the day of the Lords
Reſurrection, the day after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, which is the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt day of the
week <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And thirdly, it is ſaid in
the ſame Homily, that by <hi>this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we ought to have a time,</hi> as one day in
the week, <hi>wherein we ought to reſt, yea from
our lawful and needful works, &amp;c.</hi> Which
paſſages being laid together, will amount
to this, firſt that the Homilie doth not
ſay that by the <hi>fourth Commandement</hi> we
ought to have <hi>one day in the week,</hi> which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114885:66"/>
is plainly peremptory; but that we ought
to have a <hi>time, as one day in the week,</hi>
which is plainly Arbitrary. Secondly,
that being Arbitrary in it ſelf, and ſo
eſteemed of by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
times, they thought it good, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after Chriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcenſion, to chooſe
a ſtanding day of the week to come
together in, namely the Lords day,
or the day of the Reſurrection. Not
that they were required ſo to do by
the fourth commandement, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
the Sabbath (the ordinary time of
worſhip) to the day foregoing; nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
ſo to do by Chriſt, this choice
of the day not being made till after his
aſcenſion, and no command of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
in the holy Scripture; nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
by any Precept or <hi>Injunction</hi> of the
holy Apoſtles: of which as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are quite ſilent; ſo the Homilie
aſcribes it wholly to the voluntary
choice of <hi>godly Christian people,</hi> without
any mention made at all of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So the then meaning of thoſe words,
produced by our Author, for the ground
of this new Divinity, will be only this,
that as God reſted on the ſeventh day,
and commanded it to be kept whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſo the <hi>godly Chriſtian
people</hi> after Chriſts Aſcenſion, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114885:66"/>
his example, and warranting
themſelves by his Authority, did chooſe
a ſeventh day of the week, though not
the ſame which had been kept holy by
the <hi>Jewes</hi> for the day of worſhip. And
this is all we are to truſt to for the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or Divine inſtitution of the <hi>Lords
day Sabbath,</hi> from the Book of <hi>Homilies;</hi>
neither ſo <hi>poſitively,</hi> nor ſo <hi>clearly rendred,</hi>
as to lay a fit or ſure foundation for ſo
great a building.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the Pamphleter
quarrels with the Obſervator, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it a prodigie and a paradox too, that
neither the order nor revenues of the
Evangelical Prieſthood, ſhould have
any exiſtence, but in relation to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of the Lords day. But Sir the
Obſervator doth not only ſay it, but he
proves it too, and proves it by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the holy Scriptures, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the calling of the Apoſtles, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Diſciples of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and others to
the work of the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and pleading
ſtrongly in behalf of an Evangelical
maintenance, as belonging to them; at
ſuch time as the Lords day no ſuch exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
no ſuch Divinity of exiſtence, as
our Author ſpeaks of. In ſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to theſe proofs, the Pamphleter telleth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114885:67"/>
us, that there is not <hi>a man of note, who
treateth of the 4. Commandement</hi> (himſelf
eſpecially for one, and the chief one too)
<hi>that owneth not this prodigious opinion;</hi> and
therefore aske<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
of all learned men, ſhould be ſo wondred at to
be called a prodigie.</hi> Fol. 23. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to this will be very eaſie. For firſt,
all the men of note which write upon
the 4. Commandement, all learned men
(our Author too into the bargain) are
no fit ballance for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor able to
counterpoiſe the expreſſe and clear Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the holy Scriptures. And
ſecondly, the Pamphleter after his great
brag, that <hi>all learned men,</hi> almoſt <hi>all men
of note, which write upon the 4 Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
are of his opinion, is fain to <hi>content</hi>
himſelf at the preſent with <hi>only one,</hi> and
ſuch an one, who though he be <hi>inſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
omnium</hi> with the Pamphleter, is not ſo
with me, nor with the <hi>Obſervator</hi> neither.
Not that we fail in any part of due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to that Reverend Prelate, whoſe
name he uſeth to make good the point
which is in queſtion, but that we think
the work imputed to him by the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
to be none of his, never owned
by him in his life, nor juſtified for his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114885:67"/>
by any of relation or nearneſſe to him,
therefore to undeceive ſo many, as ſhall
read theſe papers, they may pleaſe to
know, that in the year 1583. Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi>
was made the Catechiſt of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook-hall,</hi>

grounds of Divinity; that though he
was then but a young man, yet his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
were ſo well known, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe of the ſame foundation, but
many of other Colledges in that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
and ſome out of the Countrey
alſo, came to be his Auditors; that
ſome of them taking notes of his Lectures
as well as they could, were ſaid to have
copies of his Catechizing, though for
moſt part very imperfect, and in many
points of conſequence very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
that after his coming to be Biſhop
he gave a ſpecial warrant unto one of
his Chaplains, not to own any thing for
his, that was ſaid to have been taken
by notes from his mouth. And finally
that hearing of the coming out of that
Catechiſm, as in diſcourſe with thoſe
about him he would never own it, nor
liked to have it mentioned to him, ſo
he aboliſhed (as it ſeemeth) his own
original Copy, which they that had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114885:68"/>
command to ſearch and ſort his papers
could not finde in his ſtudy: and though
this Catechiſm came out ſince in a
larger volume, yet not being publiſhed
according to his own papers (although
under his name) it can no more be ſaid
to be his, then many falſe and ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious

Of all this, I am punctually advertiſed
by an emin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a great honourer of him ſince his death,
and have thought fit to ſignifie as much

whom the name of this moſt reverend
Prelate might elſe work upon: which
ſaid, there needs no Anſwer to this
doughty argument, which being built
upon a ruinous and falſe foundation,
fals to the ground, without more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>doe,
as not worth the anſwering. We ſee
by this that all the learned men which
our Author brags of, are reduced to
one, which one upon examination proves
as good as none, if not worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>But the Pamphleter may be pardoned
for coming ſhort in this preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114885:68"/>
                  <hi>in regard of the great pains he had taken
in writing a Book of the Doctrine of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
or Divinity of the Lords day, publiſhed in
the year 1640. unto which Treatiſe he refers
all men who ſhall deſire his judgement in that
ſubject, that Book being never yet anſwered by
any,</hi> as he gallantly braves it, Fol. 24.
In this there are many things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
For firſt it is probable enough
that this Treatiſe to which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
for our ſatisfaction, was either ſo
ſhort lived, or made ſo little noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that it was not heard of. For
had it either moved ſo ſtrongly, or cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo loud, that it intituled our Author
(the dear Father of it) to any <hi>Eſtate</hi> of
Reputation for <hi>term of life,</hi> as Tenant by
the courteſie of the gentle Reader; it
is not poſſible, but that we ſhould have
had ſome tale or tidings of it in ſo long
a time, and therefore I conceive that it
was <hi>ſtill-born,</hi> and obſcurely buried, and
perhaps buried by the Man-midwife, I
mean the Bookſeller or Printer, who
gave it birth, before the Godfathers and
Godmothers, and the reſt of the good
Goſſips could be drawn together, to give
a name unto the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant, or at the beſt
like the ſolſtitial herb in <hi>Plautus,</hi> quae <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentino
orta eſt, repentino occidit,</hi> withered
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114885:69"/>
as ſoon as it ſprang up, and ſo came to
nothing. Secondly, if it were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
I would not have the Gent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
think, that it was therefore not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
becauſe unanſwerable (though
he were apt enough to think ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Praecaution) but for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
For firſt the year 1640. was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
year, and brought ſo much trouble
and encumbrance on the Engliſh Clergy,
as gave them neither liſt nor leiſure to
anſwer all impertinent ſcribbles, which
by the liberty of that time, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſneſſe
thereby prompted unto
ſeverall men, did break out upon
them: <hi>Securi de ſalute, de gloria cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temus,</hi>
as you know who ſaid. Men
have ſmall edge to fight for honour, and
undertake unprofitable and fruitleſſe
quarrels, when unſecure of life and
ſafety, and all things elſe which are
moſt near and dear unto them. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
taking it for granted, that ſome
men were at leiſure to attend thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
how may we be aſſured, that there
was any thing in the book which was
worth the anſwering, or that any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
could be gotten from the work or
Author? For it is poſſible enough, that
every man might not have ſuch opinion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114885:69"/>
of you, as you ſay the Obſervator had,
who did therefore (if you judge aright
of his intentions) profeſſe an <hi>high eſteem
of your parts and perſon,</hi> only <hi>to make the
world believe,</hi> that <hi>you were worthy the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</hi>
And if they did not think ſo
of you, they had all the reaſon in the
world to decline a combate, <hi>ubi &amp; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
inglorium eſſet, &amp; atteri ſordidum,</hi> in
which to overcome, or to be conquered,
is like inglorious.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever opinion the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
had of you, you have not the like opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his <hi>Alter idem,</hi> the Doctor in
Coſmography, as you pleaſe to taunt
him, whom you accuſe, for <hi>forging and
falſifying a Record ſo boldly,</hi> the modeſt
Gent. <hi>will not ſay ſo impudently,</hi> and that
too <hi>not in an idle circumſtance, but in the
grand concernment of a controverſie</hi> with
ſpight and calumny enough. And why all
this? Marry ſay you in the ſecond book
and 6. Chapter, of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
publiſhed in the year 1636. he hath
miſreported the words of <hi>Pareus</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down <hi>quomodo</hi> for <hi>quando,</hi> adding
withall, <hi>in vindication whereof, he never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any thing as yet,</hi> Fol. 24. This I
confeſſe is <hi>grave crimen, &amp; ante hoc tempus
inaudi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114885:70"/>
to which was never charged upon him
by his greateſt enemies. In anſwer
whereunto, I muſt tell you for him that
being plundred of his Books, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
no remembrances, and collections
of his Studies by him, he cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
reſolve what Edition he followed
in his conſulting with that Author.
He alwaies thought, that <hi>Tenure in capite,</hi>
was a nobler and more honourable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
then to hold by Copy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
careleſly neglected to commit any
part of his readings unto notes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
of which he never found ſuch want
as in this particular, which you ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charge upon him. Or were it ſo as you
inform us, both he and I have cauſe to
wonder why our learned Author did not
rather chooſe to confute that whole <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Sabbath,</hi> then ſpend his time
in hammering ſome petit Tractate; of
which the world hath took no notice;
that being a work, which might have
rendred him conſiderable, and made more
noiſe then all the <hi>Geeſe in the Capitol</hi> to
the awakening of the dull Doctor, and
the drowſie Clergie: or if he thought
this task too great, and the burden too
heavie for his ſhoulders; why did he
let theſe falſifyings and forgings ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when it may juſtly be ſuppoſed, that not
your zeal unto the truth, but ſecret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ort it from you?
Thirdly, I am required to tell you that
if there be ſuch a miſtake in the citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he more then doubts, it was
not willingly and wilfully committed
by him, and therefore not within the
compaſſe of thoſe <hi>forgings</hi> and <hi>falſifyings</hi>
which you tax him with. For he would
fain know <hi>cui bono,</hi> or <hi>cui malo</hi> rather, to
what end, whether good or bad, he
ſhould uſe thoſe <hi>forgings</hi> or <hi>falſifyings,</hi> in
that Author, when he was compaſſed
about with a cloud of witneſſes, atteſting
poſitively and plainly to the point in
hand; or what need there ſhould be of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing
on <hi>Pareus</hi> to appear fair for him,
when more then a whole <hi>Jury</hi> of learned
and Religious men, as learned and as
good as he, had given up their verdict in
the caſe? Now that this may appear
to be ſo indeed, and that withall the
Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der may underſtand the true ſtate of
the Queſtion, I will lay down that Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Pamphleter doth refer us
to, together with the next before it and
the next that followes, and ſo ſubmit
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114885:71"/>
the whole controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie to his better
judgement. This only is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
that the 5. ſection ſhews, that the
Reformators found great fault, both
with the new Doctrine of the Papiſt,
about the natural and inherent holineſſe,
which they aſcribe to ſome daies above
the reſt, and the reſtraints from Labour
on the Lords day and the other holy
daies; upon which it followeth in theſe
words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(6) Indeed it is not to be thought,
that they could otherwiſe reſolve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of it, conſidering what their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is of the day it ſelf; how different
they make it from a <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> which
doctrine, that we may perceive with the
greater eaſe, we will conſider it in three
propoſitions, in which moſt agree:
1. That the <hi>keeping holy one day of ſeven,
is not the Moral part of the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
or to be reckoned as a part of the Law
of Nature.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Lords day is not
founded on divine Commandement, but only on
the authority of the Church;</hi> And 3. That
the <hi>Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath ſtill Authority to change the
day, and to transfer it to ſome other.</hi> Firſt
for the firſt, it ſeems that ſome of <hi>Rome</hi>
(conſidering the reſtraints before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
and the new Doctrine thence
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114885:71"/>
ariſing, about the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>inherent
holineſſe,</hi> which one day had above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
had altered what was formerly
delivered amongſt the <hi>Schoolmen:</hi> and
made the keeping of <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>ſeven,</hi> to
be the <hi>Moral</hi> part of the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
This <hi>Calvin (Inſtit. l. 2. c.</hi> 8.
11. 34.) chargeth them withall, that they
had taught the people in the former
times, that whatſoever was <hi>ceremonial</hi> in
the fourth Commandement, which was
the keeping of the <hi>Jewes ſeventh day,</hi> had
been long ſince abrogated: <hi>Remanere
vero quod morale eſt, nempe unius diei ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervationem
in hebdomade,</hi> but that the
<hi>moral part</hi> thereof, which was the keeping
of one day in ſeven, did continue ſtill.
<q>Which what elſe is it, as before was ſaid,
then in diſhonour of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to
change the day; and to affix as great
a ſanctity thereunto, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> ever
did?</q> As for his own part he pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſeth,
that howſoever he approved of the
<hi>Lords day</hi> meetings: <hi>Non tamen numerum
ſeptenarium ita ſe morari, ut ejus ſervituti ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſias
aſtringeret;</hi> 
                  <q>yet ſtood not he ſo
much for the number of <hi>ſeven,</hi> as to
confine the Church unto it.</q> If <hi>Calvin</hi>
elſewhere be of another minde, and
ſpeak of keeping holy one day in ſeven,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114885:72"/>
as a matter neceſſary; (which ſome ſay
he doth) either they muſt accuſe him
of much inconſtancy, and forgetfulneſſe;
or elſe interpret him, with <hi>Rivet (In
Decalog.</hi>) as ſpeaking of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
cuſtome,</hi> not to be neglected; <hi>non de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate
legis divinae;</hi> and not of any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
layed upon us by the Law of
God. Neither is he the only one that
hath ſo determined. <hi>Simler (in Exod.</hi> 20.)
hath ſaid it more expreſly, <hi>Quod dies una
cultui divino conſecratur, ex lege naturae eſt;
quod autem haec ſit ſeptima, non octava, nona,
aut decima, juris eſt divini ſed ceremonialis:</hi>
                  <q>That one day ſhould be ſet apart for
Gods publick worſhip, is the Law of
nature, but that this day ſhould be
the ſeventh, and not the eighth, ninth
or tenth, was not of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but <hi>ceremonial.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Aretius (Loc.</hi> 55)

between the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
the time thereof: <q>The <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it,
which was <hi>reſt,</hi> and the works of <hi>piety,</hi>
being in all times to continue; <hi>tempus

time, to keep it on the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
that was not neceſſary in the

                  </q> So alſo <hi>Franciſc. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi>

that great undertaker againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi>

or any ſolid argument drawn from
thence, <hi>unum è ſeptem diebus ex vi praecepti

that by the fourth Commandement, one
day in ſeven is of neceſſity to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Gods ſervice. And <hi>Rivet</hi> as
profeſt an enemy of the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi>
though for the antiquity of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
he differeth from the ſaid <hi>Gomarus;</hi> yet
he agreeth with him in this: not only
making the obſervance of one day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to be meerly <hi>poſitive,</hi> as in our firſt
part we obſerved; but laies it down for
the received opinion of moſt of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Divines, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num ex ſeptem diebus non

<hi>p.</hi> 190.) the very ſame with what <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi>
affirmed before. So laſtly for the
<hi>Lutheran Churches, Chemnitius</hi> makes it part
of our <hi>Christian Liberty, quod nec ſint alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati,

                  <q>That

otherwiſe he account it for a <hi>barbarous

Therefore in his opinion alſo, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>ſeven,</hi> is neither any
<hi>moral</hi> part of the fourth Commandement,
or parcel of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> As for

it may then ſerve, when there is nothing

<q>That this was rather choſe then that,

                  <q>That of their own accord,

                  <hi>Gualter</hi>
(<hi>in Act. Apoſt. Hom.</hi> 13) more generally,
that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> firſt aſſembled on the

then not <hi>enjoyned</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Yea
<hi>Beza,</hi> though herein he differ from his

meetings, <hi>Apostolicae &amp; verae divinae traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
(<hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10.) to be indeed of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical</hi>
and <hi>divine tradition:</hi> yet being a
<hi>tradition</hi> only, although <hi>Apostolical,</hi> it is
no <hi>commandement.</hi> And more then that,
he tels us in another place (<hi>in Act</hi> 20.)
that from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching at <hi>Troas,</hi>
and from the Text, 1 Cor. 16. 2. <hi>Non

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114885:75"/>
that then the <hi>Christians</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to meet that day; the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> beginning
by degrees to vaniſh. But ſure the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
of the people makes no <hi>divine tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
and ſuch concluſions, as not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
may be gathered from the <hi>Text,</hi> are
not <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf. Others there be, who
attribute the changing of the day to the
<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> not to their <hi>precept,</hi> but their
<hi>practiſe.</hi> So <hi>Mercer (in Gen.) Apoſtoli in
Dominicum converterunt,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Lords day. Paraeus</hi>
attributes the ſame <hi>Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae,</hi>

for the <hi>Lutheran Divines:</hi> it is affirmed by
Dr. <hi>Bound, That for the moſt part they aſcribe
too much unto the liberty of the Church, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
daies for the aſſembly of the people:</hi>
which is plain confeſſion. But for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
<hi>Brentius,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> tels us,

and no <hi>Commandement</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi>
which is no more indeed then what

ſure I am, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> tels us, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
did not impoſe the keeping of <hi>this</hi>

whatſoever: <hi>ſed libera fuit obſervatio ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

been voluntarily uſed amongſt them, of
their own accord.</p>
               <p>(8) Thus have we proved by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of what <hi>ſide</hi> ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and thoſe of greateſt credit in their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114885:76"/>
ſeveral <hi>Churches,</hi> eighteen by name, and
all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in general, of the ſame
opinion; That the <hi>Lords day</hi> is of no
other <hi>inſtitution</hi> then the <hi>Authority</hi> of the
<hi>Church:</hi> which proved the laſt of the
three <hi>Theſes. That still the Church hath power
to change the day, and to transfer it to ſome
other:</hi> will follow of it ſelf, on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
grounds: the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred, in ſaying that the
<hi>Church</hi> did inſtitute the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as we
ſee they do; confeſſing tacitely, that ſtill
the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to change it.
Nor do they tacitely confeſſe it, as if
they were affraid to ſpeak it out: but
ſome of them in plain terms affirm it, as
a certain truth. <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> the <hi>firſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> hath reſolved it ſo, in
his diſcourſe againſt one <hi>Valentine Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
a new <hi>Arrian</hi> Heretick (<hi>Tom. 1. p.</hi>
254. <hi>a.) Audi mi Valentine, quibus modis &amp;
rationibus, Sabbatum Ceremoniale reddatur.</hi>
                  <q>Hearken now <hi>Valentine,</hi> by what waies
and means the <hi>Sabbath</hi> may be made a
<hi>Ceremony:</hi> if either we obſerve that
<hi>day</hi> which the <hi>Jewes</hi> once did, or think
the <hi>Lords day</hi> ſo affixed to any time, <hi>ut
nefas ſit illum in aliud tempus transferre:</hi>
that we conceive it an impiety, it ſhould
be changed unto another; on which,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114885:77"/>
as well as upon that, we may not reſt
from labour, and hearken to the word
of God: if perhaps ſuch neceſſity ſhould
be, this would indeed make it become
a <hi>Ceremony.</hi>
                  </q> Nothing can be more plain
then this: yet <hi>Calvin</hi> is as plain; when
he profeſſeth, That he regarded not ſo
much the number of <hi>ſeven, ut ejus ſervituti
Eccleſias aſtringeret,</hi> as to enthral the
<hi>Church</hi> unto it. Sure I am, Doctor <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
(<hi>in Orat. de Sab.</hi>) reckoneth him, as
one of them, who teach us, that the
<hi>Church</hi> hath power to <hi>change</hi> the <hi>day,</hi> and
to transfer it to ſome other. And that
<hi>John Barclaie</hi> makes report, how once he
had a conſultation, <hi>de transferenda Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
in Feriam quintam,</hi> of altering the <hi>Lords
day</hi> unto the <hi>Thurſday. Bucer</hi> affirmes as
much, as touching the <hi>Authority:</hi> And
ſo doth <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Brentius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine</hi> and
<hi>Chemnitius,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
Of <hi>Bullinger, Bucer, Brentius,</hi> I
have nought to ſay, becauſe the places are
not cited; but take it, as I think I may,
upon his credit. But for <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> he
ſaith often, that it is <hi>libera obſervatio,</hi> a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
obſervation; that it is an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of our <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> not to be
<hi>tyed</hi> to <hi>daies</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> in matters which
concern Gods <hi>ſervice;</hi> and that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>

The Dr. findes the ſame fault in him, by

and ſatisfaction unto others, he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
himſelf more fully as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether the Superiority of
ſuch perſons over ſuch Presbyters in the
Church <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> was fixed in them
during life; or that paſſed from one to
another in their ſeverall turns like the
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>deratorſhip,</hi> in the <hi>generall Aſſembly</hi> of
the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the Chair-man,
in the Conferences, and debates of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in the reſt of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches.
For if he mean in this laſt ſenſe, as I hope
he doth not, Epiſcopacy is no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to him, then it was to <hi>Beza;</hi> who
notwithſtanding he maintained a party
of Miniſters without any fixed <hi>Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
which one may claim above another,
yet he allows a moveable Preſidency to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114885:81"/>
be not unuſuall, nor unfrequent in the
very times of the Apoſtles. And yet that
ſome ſuch ſecret meaning may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him by ſuch as have a minde to
interpret all things to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
will be made not improbable by
his ſtanding to this Propoſition, That
there is no place in <hi>Holy Text, wherein
Presbyters import not Biſhops, and Biſhops Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſidering therefore that he ſtill
ſtands to his former Principle, that <hi>Biſhops
and Presbyters in Scripture phraſe are of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
import, and denote the ſelf ſame perſons
without the leaſt diſtinction,</hi> and requireth
it of the Obſervator, or of any man elſe
36. to tell him <hi>where ſuch perſons in Holy
Text, are diſtinguiſhed</hi> ſo <hi>really, that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
doth not import a Presbyter, and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth not import a Biſhop.</hi> I think my ſelf
as much concerned as the Obſervator,
to make anſwer to it. Firſt, then ſay I,
that though thoſe words may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
though but rarely uſed promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> denoting a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and the word Biſhop importing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Presbyter, yet that more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and in other places they are uſed
in a more limited and diſtinct ſenſe, as
in times ſucceeding. And 2. I ſay that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114885:81"/>
the word <hi>Epiſcopus, 1 Timothy</hi> 3. 2. and the
deſcription of a Biſhop which is therein
made, is meant of a Biſhop truly, and
properly ſo called, according as the
word was uſed and appropriated by the
Antient writers, and not appliable to
the Presbyters or inferior Miniſters. For
proof whereof, I ſhall offer ſome few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
out of the Text it ſelf,
leaving them to the judgement of the
ſober and intelligent Reader. And firſt,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a Biſhop in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number, but of inferiour Miniſters in
the Plurall. One Church, or City, though
it had many <hi>Presbyters,</hi> had one Biſhop
only. And therefore we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
conceive, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking
of a Biſhop in the ſingular number, ſpeaks
of him in his proper and true capacity,
as one diſtinguiſhed from, and above the
Presbyters. 2. The Apoſtle ſeemeth to
require in him an Act of Government,
as being a man, that is to take care of
the Church of God: and thereupon
gives order for an Inquiſition to be had
upon him, whether he hath <hi>ruled his houſe
well,</hi> &amp;c. A charge of too tranſcendent,
and ſublime a nature, to be entruſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every common <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by him, who as our <hi>Hooker</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114885:82"/>
though he be ſomewhat better
able to ſpeak, is as little able to judge
as another man. And if not fit to judge,
no fit man to govern. 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in a Biſhop, that he be given to
<hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> i. e. that he receive the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
entertain the Native, and in a
word, admit all Comers. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth
ſo expound it, ſaying, that if a <hi>Lay-man</hi>
entertain but two or three, <hi>Hoſpitalitatis
officium implebit,</hi> he hath exceeding well
complyed with all the Rules of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<hi>Epiſcopus niſt omnes receperit, inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
eſt,</hi> but that the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhop is accounted
a Churle or <hi>Niggard,</hi> if his Houſe be not
open unto all. Which howſoever it
might poſſibly agree in thoſe antient
times to the Condition of a Biſhop, who
had the keeping and diſpoſing of the
Churches Treaſures; yet I can ſee no
poſſibility, how it could be expected
from the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that out of his poor
pittance from the <hi>ſportula,</hi> he ſhould be
able to perform it. For I believe not that
the Lord intended to work miracles dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as in the lengthning and increaſing
the poor womans oyle. Fourthly and
laſtly, it is required by St <hi>Paul,</hi> that his
Biſhop muſt not be <hi>neophytus,</hi> a <hi>novice,</hi> as
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> reads it, and exceeding right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114885:82"/>
that is, as <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and out of him
<hi>Theophylact</hi> expound the word: one new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Catechized as it were, lately inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Faith. Now who knoweth
not, but that in the beginnings of the
Church, ſome of theſe new plants, theſe
<hi>Neophyti,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be taken into
<hi>holy orders,</hi> for the increaſe and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Goſpel? The Presbyters
were many, but the Biſhops few. And
therefore howſoever there muſt be found
ſufficient Standards, upon the which to
graffe a Biſhop; yet I can hardly finde a
poſſibility of furniſhing the Garden of
the Church, with a fit number of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
unleſs we take them from the
<hi>Nurſerie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It then it be demanded, whether St. <hi>Paul</hi>
hath utterly omitted to ſpeak of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
I anſwer no; but that we have them
in the next Paragraphe, <hi>Diacones ſimiliter;</hi>
which why it ſhould not comprehend
the Presbyters, and all inferior Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
under the degree of Biſhops; I can ſee
no reaſon, there being no qualification
requiſite in or to the Presbyter, which
is not found in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Character of
theſe <hi>Diaconi.</hi> And though the word in
our laſt tranſlation, be rendred <hi>Deacons:</hi>
yet in our old tranſlation, and in that of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114885:83"/>
                  <hi>Coverdale,</hi> we read it <hi>Miniſters,</hi> according
to the generall and native meaning of the
ſame. An expoſition neither new, nor
forced. Not new, for <hi>Calvin</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>alios ad Presbyteros referre Epiſcopo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriores,</hi>
that ſome referred thoſe words
to Presbyters, ſubordinate or inferiour
to the Biſhop. Not forced, for if we
ſearch the Scriptures, we ſhall there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that generally <hi>Diaconus</hi> is rendred
<hi>Ministers,</hi> and that not only in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
before that <hi>Deacons</hi> had been inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Church of God; but alſo in St.
<hi>Pauls Epiſtles,</hi> after the planting of the
Church, when all the Officers therein
had their bounds and limits. Thus <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

is <hi>Epaphras</hi> entituled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 7, &amp;c. And
hereunto I ſhall further add, that I can
ſee no convincing reaſon why the <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi>
and <hi>Deacons,</hi> or the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
mentioned in the firſt words of St.
<hi>Pauls Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> may not be
underſtood of the Biſhops (properly ſo
called) of <hi>Philippi</hi> and the bordering Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or inferiour
<hi>Miniſters</hi> under their authority. Not to
ſay any thing of the Subſcription of the
Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and the 2. to <hi>Timothy;</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:114885:83"/>
in which the word Biſhop is taken in
this proper and limited ſenſe, becauſe
(whatſoever opinion I have of them)
the Pamphleter perhaps may not think
them to be authentick. Next that the
word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is uſed ſometimes in the
ſame ſtrict, and limited ſenſe, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
a perſon inferiour to the Biſhop,
and ſubject unto his authority aud juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
appeareth plainly, by that Text
in the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> c. 5. v. 19, 20.
where it is ſaid, <hi>Adverſus Presbyterum accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationem
noli recipere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Againſt a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
and <hi>Elder</hi> (as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> reads it)
<hi>receive not an accuſation, but before two or
three witneſſes.</hi> But if they be convicted,
<hi>them that ſin rebuke before all, that others alſo
may fear.</hi> In the declaring of which power,
I take for granted, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> here
by <hi>Elder</hi> doth mean a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> according
to the Eccleſiaſtical notion of that word,
though I know that <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or a man well grown in years.
And then the meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> will be
briefly this, that partly in regard of the
Devils malice, apt to calumniate men of
that holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unction; and partly to avoid
the ſcandal which may thence ariſe; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
and in him all other Biſhops ſhould
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114885:84"/>
be very cautious in their proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
men of that Profeſſion. But if they
finde them guilty on examination, then
not to ſmother or conceal the matter, but
cenſure and rebuke them openly, that
others may take heed of the like offences.
The Commentaries under the name of
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> do expound it ſo, <hi>Quoniam non
facile credi debet &amp; Presbytero crimen,</hi> &amp;c.
becauſe a crime or accuſation is not to
be credited againſt a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> yet if the
ſame prove manifeſt and undeniable, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> commandeth that in regard of his
irregular converſation, he be rebuked
and cenſured publiquely, that others
may be thereby terrified. And, ſaith he,
<hi>non ſolum ordinatis ſed &amp; plebi proficit,</hi> will
not be only profitable unto men in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
but to Lay people al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o. Herewith
agreeth, as to the making of theſe Elders
to be men in Orders, the Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Epiſtle a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cribed to <hi>Jerome.</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
then are ſubject unto cenſure;
but to whoſe cenſure are they ſubject?
not unto one another ſurely, that would
breed con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſion, but to the cenſure of
their Biſhop. See to the ſame purpoſe alſo
<hi>Epiphanius adverſus Haereſ.</hi> 75. n. 5. and
<hi>Theophylact</hi> upon the place; not to ſay any
thing of <hi>Lyra</hi> and ſome others of a later
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114885:84"/>
ſtanding. And in this limited ſenſe, I
underſtand thoſe Presbyters ordained by
St. <hi>Paul</hi> in many of the Churches of his
Plantations, whom we finde mentioned
in the <hi>Acts;</hi> ſome of which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made Biſhops, and over other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſuch Biſhops as he thought moſt
fit.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſatisfied our Author, in
telling him <hi>where Presbyters import not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and Biſhops Presbyters;</hi> we next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to anſwer thoſe objections which
are made againſt the Obſervator. And
firſt, it is objected, that our Author doth
not at all <hi>deliver his own opinion in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but what many did then aſſert,</hi> fol. 35.
To which I anſwer, Firſt, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
puts the opinion down ſo ſavourly,
and with ſuch advantages, as any man
would eaſily take it for his own, or at
the leaſt, that he himſelf was alſo of the
ſame opinion. This not improbably to
be gathered from the word <hi>aſſered,</hi> which
plainly intimates that thoſe many whom
he ſpeaks of did not only affirm or ſay,
that <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters in Scripture phraſe
were of equivalent import,</hi> &amp;c. but had proved
it too. For thus be underſtands the word
in another place, where ſpeaking of the
Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> he telleth us that <hi>he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114885:85"/>
publiſhed a Book,</hi> aſſerting <hi>poſitively, that
the holy Table was to ſtand in</hi> Gremio or
Nave of the <hi>Quire,</hi> fol. 137. By which if
he means only a bare affirming of the
thing, it then ſignifies nothing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
as little to his purpoſe. For the
word <hi>Aſſero</hi> (if he be <hi>critick</hi> enough to
underſtand the true meaning of it) not
only ſignifieth ſimply to affirm, or ſay,
but to confirm that affirmation, and
make good that ſaying. Once for all
take this out of <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Metamor.</hi>
lib. 1.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>At tu, ſi modo ſum coelesti ſtirpe creatus,</l>

2. Though he tells us that if the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
had not been an ill looking fellow, he might
with half an eye have diſcerned, that he doth not
at all deliver his own opinion in this particular;</hi>
But I have a bird in a corner which ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the contrary. For fol. 137. of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that the <hi>truth contended for,</hi> touching
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114885:85"/>
                  <hi>the right on which the Hierarchy was founded
was (as his late Majesty hath (no man better)
ſufficiently demonſtrated) to be awarded to the
Prelates;</hi> which ſpeaks more plainly for
Epiſcopacy, then the reſervedneſs of
your laſt expreſſions, which in your
Pamphlet you have given us for your full
ſenſe in this Controverſie, <hi>enough</hi> (you
ſay) <hi>to ſatisfie Spirits of the moſt modeſt and

it comes publiſhed to our hands, theſe
words are totally left out, which ſhews as
plainly, that you have either altered
your opinion (if you ever were of that
opinion) or elſe for fear of offending the
weak Brethren, dare not own it now.
What meaneth elſe, <hi>this bleating of the

of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to grub up by the roots
thoſe goodly <hi>Cdars</hi> of the Church the

ſay, that <hi>you believe it will puzzle the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
to finde any one who ever interpreted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
by Prieſt,</hi> fol. 35. But Gentle Sir, the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114885:87"/>
Obſervator never told you that it was ſo
rendred; ſo that you need not trouble
him to prove what he never ſaid, or
charge him <hi>with any vaſt difference in this
particular from Dr.</hi> Heylyn, unleſs you
can finde in him, that the antients did not
call the <hi>Miniſter of the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
ſometimes Presbyter, Elder, and ſometimes
Sacerdos, Prieſt,</hi> as I think you cannot. If
you come off no better in your other
<hi>criticiſmes,</hi> then you do in this, your beſt
way were to keep your ſelf to plain <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>

               <p>You quarrel next with the Obſervator,
firſt, for bringing in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> amongſt
his Lay Champions for Epiſcopacy, who
(as the Pamphleter ſaith) <hi>ſeems clear of
another minde,</hi> in his <hi>Book De Synedriis,</hi>
where he extols <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and <hi>Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Argument,</hi> &amp;c fol. 37. But had the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi>
been <hi>obſerved</hi> here, as he ſhould have
been, he might have found that the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is not brought in by him, as
a Champion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or Biſhops, but as <hi>not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt</hi> them. And this he proves by the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114885:87"/>
Retortion made to Mr. <hi>Grimſtons</hi> double
argument in the Houſe of <hi>Commons.</hi> The
Obſervator knew as well as the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was no friend to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
as conſtituted and eſtabliſhed in
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and he knew too,
which perhaps the Pamphleter doth not,
what moved him to appear againſt them,
when by the Complexion of affairs, he
might ſafely do it. For being called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> and forced to
make a publique acknowledgement of
his error and offence given unto the
Church, in publiſhing a Book entituled
<hi>The Hiſtorie of Tithes,</hi> it ſunk ſo deep into
his ſtomack, that he did never after affect
the men, or cordially approve the calling,
though many wayes were tryed to gain
him to the Churches intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Pamphleters quarrels againſt
<hi>Church-men</hi> (perhaps as good a man as
himſelf, or, I am ſure, as true) I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
unto a time and place more proper;
keeping my ſelf here to thoſe he hath
with the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> And the next quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
is, that he <hi>findes not King</hi> Charles <hi>amongſt
his Aſſertors for Epiſcopacy.</hi> Of whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
in that Argument he makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a very fair and ingenuous declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
fol. 38. though all that he hath ſaid
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114885:88"/>
can add nothing to him. But Sir, if you
will look but with <hi>half an eye</hi> on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
you will finde there, that in
the naming of his <hi>Lay Champions</hi> as you
call them, he made choice of ſuch only,
as were not likely to be <hi>ſuſpected of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
men no wayes intereſſed (but onely by their
good affections) in the Churches quarrels.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which choice, he could not
make uſe of that Royall pen, which gave
the deaths wound to <hi>Henderſon</hi> in the
town of <hi>New-castle,</hi> and foyled the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> It was the
<hi>intereſs</hi> of <hi>King Charles</hi> to maintain Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,
as one of the chief Supporters
of the Regall Throne. <hi>No Biſhop, no
King,</hi> the known old maxime of <hi>King
James,</hi> in the ſad events thereof, hath
been found Propheticall. And therefore
if the Obſervator had produced his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
the Pamphleter might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
(as perhaps he would) that the
Kings judgement was corrupted by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi>
and ſwayed with intereſs, which
rendred him no fit witneſs in the preſent
<hi>Tryall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſay truth, if all be <hi>Oracle</hi> which

                  </gap>s from the <hi>deſerts</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> there is
good reaſon for <hi>ſaving all advantages of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi>
againſt the Teſtimony of that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114885:88"/>
King, had it been produced. The Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
telling us, that he did not only
employ the <hi>Pen,</hi> but <hi>took up the Bucklers in
good earneſt to defend</hi> Epiſcopacy, fol. 38.
But Sir, who told you in <hi>good earneſt,</hi> that
his Majeſty either drew the ſword, or
took up the <hi>Bucklers</hi> in that quarrell, or
on that occaſion? His Majeſty in all his
meſſages, and declarations, profeſſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
that he was forced to take up
Armes to preſerve himſelf: His Forts,
Caſtles, Royall Navy, and the <hi>Militia</hi> of
the Kingdome, being taken from him.
His Negative voice denyed, his Magazine
at <hi>Hull</hi> employed againſt him, his faithfull
Servants threatned under the name of
evill Counſellors, and nothing left unto
him but the name of a King. Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
not ſo much as touched on for a
ground of that quarrel; nor was there
reaſon why it ſhould. The King by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Acts had yielded up their place and
vote in the Houſe of Peers, and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Coercive power of their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
that which remained being then
thought ſo inconſiderable, that in the
19. Propoſitions, containing the whole
demand of both Houſes, the Abolition of
Epiſcopacy was not touched upon. So
that there is not any thing more falſ, then
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114885:89"/>
that the King <hi>took up the Bucklers</hi> to defend
Epiſcopacy. But I know well enough
what the Author aims at. The wars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by this King againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> is
by our Pamphleter in his Hiſtorie, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Biſhops wars,</hi> and he hath layed
ſome grounds here, to have the long
wars raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> called by that
name alſo, the <hi>Biſhops war,</hi> no doubt of
that, if he ſhould fortune to go on with
the reſt of the ſtory. Of which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may take notice, and our Author
too.</p>
               <p>His laſt quarrel with the Obſervator,
with reference to the point of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi>
is that he makes our Author <hi>take it for
granted, that the Government of the Church by
Biſhops is a thing of indifferency, and thereupon
was much agrieved that the Clergy ſhould binde
themſelves by Oath not to conſent to any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</hi> On this occaſion the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
flies out againſt them with no

and then we will not fear to tell him, that
his own words ſhall be the only evidence
we will uſe againſt him. The introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he makes to his diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Oath required by the new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
inſtruct us, <q>That many aſſerted in

in Scripture phraſe were of equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
import, and denoted the ſelf ſame
perſons, without the leaſt diſtinction,
&amp;c. That thereupon, the Prelates ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their deer <hi>Palladium</hi> ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and heaved at, did firſt cauſe
the Preſs to ſwarm with Books, ſetting
forth the right upon which Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was founded; and finding how
little this advantaged them, they took
meaſure from their profeſſed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Generall Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:114885:90"/>
and by their example framed the Oath
as an Anti-Covenant.</q> This is the
ſubſtance of the Preamble to thoſe obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but that I would not ſtir the mans
patience too much, I had called them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
which our Author makes againſt
that Oath, that <q>ſome things were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
to be ſworn to which were never
thought to have any ſhew or colour of
ſacred right, but were conceived Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and at the diſpoſition of the
State; and to exact an Oath of diſſent
from Civill eſtabliſhments, in ſuch
things of indifferency, was an affront
to the very fundamentals of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
Now the Oath being made for
maintenance of the Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or Government, eſtabliſhed in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Doctrine being
confeſſed on all ſides to be <hi>ſignanter,</hi> and
expreſly pointed at, and the diſcourſe dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at the Government of the Church
by Biſhops; who can conceive but that
his Argument or Objection muſt tend
that way alſo, and that Epiſcopacy muſt
be reckoned in the number of thoſe
things of indifferency for which there
was no reaſon to require the Oath? And
though the Pamphleter would fain have
it that Epiſcopacy is not in thoſe things
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114885:90"/>
of indifferency, but excluded rather, yet
this will do him as ſmall ſervice, as the
Preſs when it was ſaid to have ſwarmed
with Books, had done the Biſhops. For
firſt he doth not ſay that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was
not <hi>pointed</hi> at, at all, in thoſe things of
indifferency, but not ſignanter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly;
our Author keeping a reſerve, or
ſecret intention to himſelf, upon al oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
Nor doth it help him, ſecondly,
to ſay, that the <hi>things there ſpoken of are ſuch,
as never had any ſhew or colour of ſacred right,
whereas Epiſcopacy in the very account of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
hath ſome colour and ſhew of it,</hi> fol.
39. Where firſt, he pleadeth but very
coldly for Epiſcopacy in giving it only
ſome ſhew and colour which all Hereſies,
Enthuſiaſticks, and Fanaticall fancies, all
that have ſet up any other Government,
Papall, Anarchicall, Presbyterian, do
pretend unto. And ſecondly, it is not
true, hath any ſuch <hi>colour or ſhew in the
account of its adverſaries.</hi> Epiſcopacy, as
it ſtood in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, being by
<hi>Beza</hi> called <hi>Humanus,</hi> and <hi>Diabolicus,</hi> as
it ſtood in theſe latter ages. An Humane
invention in the firſt, a Diabolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
in the laſt times of the Church;
and therefore queſtionleſs without any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114885:91"/>
ſhew or colour of ſacred right. Nor doth
he help himſelf much by the little Army
raiſed out of the <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Kentiſh</hi>
forces under the command of the Lord
<hi>Digby;</hi> which is ſo far from <hi>putting the
matter out of all diſpute</hi> in the ſenſe he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that it rather doth conclude againſt
him. For if the <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> and
<hi>Kent</hi> Exceptions limit themſelves to
Arch-biſhops, Arch-deacons, &amp;c. our
Author certainly is to blame in theſe
two reſpects: Firſt, that he did not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his things of indifferency as they did
before him; And ſecondly, that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſuch generall termes as he ſhould think
to help himſelf in the Poſtfact by their
limitations. Tis true, the Hiſtory ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> as friend to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
when the <hi>London</hi> Petition came to
be conſidered of in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
before which time he had begun
to look toward the Court, but telleth
us not that he was ſo in the very firſt
openings of the Parliament, when the
Oath required in the Canon was in
moſt agitation. And this I hope is fair
for a Senior Sophiſter (as you pleaſe to
call the Obfervator) who could have
preſſed theſe anſwers further, but that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114885:91"/>

Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> whom our Author
had made the predeceſſor <hi>penultime,</hi> or
next predeceſſor but one to Archbiſhop
<hi>Laud.</hi> This he confeſſeth for an error,
but puts it off, not as a want of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
(he will by no means yeeld to
that) but a <hi>lapſe</hi> of memory, Fol. 35. A
priviledge which if all other writers of
Hiſtory ſhould pretend unto as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as our Author doth, we ſhould finde
little truth among them, and not much
aſſurance of any thing upon which to
reſt: This not being the firſt time in
which our Author hath been forced to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114885:93"/>
uſe this remedy, as in theſe words (as is
beforeſaid) is here acknowledged. We
had the ſame excuſe before in the miſtake
about Marriage of the one King, and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

for this by the Obſervator, and ſome
points produced in which <hi>Calviniſm</hi> and
the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

makes them not to be all one in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
<hi>but only in oppoſition to the</hi> Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
<hi>and</hi> Arminian <hi>Tenets,</hi> Fol. 23. And
this I look on as another of our Authors
priviledges, who when he hath given us
any things in general termes, thinks all is
well if he can make it hold good in a few
particulars. Whereas if he had limited his
propoſition to thoſe points alone, and
told us that he was ſtifly principled in
that part of St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Doctrine,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114885:94"/>
which was in oppoſition to the tenets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred, there had been no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
given to the Obſervator to except

to make a queſtion of that which is out
of Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
and <hi>Calvin</hi> differ in the point of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi>
he telleth us, that they differ in the point
of the Sabbath or Lords day, which is
more then the Obſervator had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and for which we thank him.</p>
               <p>In the ſtory of the Sequeſtration of
Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> there are four miſtakes
noted by the Obſervator, 1. That in
the Commiſſion granted to the 5 Biſhops
Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> is ſaid to be of the <hi>Quorum.</hi>
2. That the declared impulſive cauſe of
it was a ſuppoſed irregularity. 3. That
this ſuppoſed irregularity was incurred
upon the caſual killing of the keeper of
his (the Archbiſhops) game. And 4. That
the irregularity is ſaid to be but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
only, and no more then ſo. To
this the Pamphleter firſt anſwereth in his

<hi>Heraclitus</hi> grin, and put <hi>Democritus</hi> into
tears, producing contrary operations on
their ſeveral humours. I thought before
I read this paſſage, our Gent. had been one
of the right Worſhipful of the Bench, in
comiſſion for the Peace at leaſt, if not one
of the <hi>Quorum</hi> but I ſee now that he is not
ſo well skilled at it, as a Juſtices Clerk.
Did the man ever hear of any Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in which five or more perſons were
nominated, of which one or two are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be of the Quorum, and by that
word underſtand, with ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
want of underſtanding, that nothing
more was meant in it, but that the ſaid
one or two, were to be of the number?
Confident I am (and I think may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſay it) that we have not had ſuch
a learned piece of ignorance, ſince <hi>Jack</hi>
Maior of <hi>Brackley</hi> being by his place a
Juſtice of the Peace, and one of the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
by the publick charter of that
Town, threatned to binde a poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

fellow (who had carried himſelf
ſomewhat ſawcily to him) not only to
the <hi>Peace,</hi> but to the <hi>Quorum</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Paſſe we on to the next that followes.
And there, or no where, we ſhall finde
one of thoſe many ſuppoſititious Foiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which are charged upon the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator.
The Hiſtorian having ſaid that
the Archbiſhop was ſequeſtred from his
Function, and a Commiſſion granted by
the King to five Biſhops (Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>
being of the Quorum) to execute Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal
juriſdiction within his Province;
addes preſently in the very next words,
that the declared impulſive to it, was a
ſuppoſed irregularity in him by reaſon
of a Homicide committed by him <hi>per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunium
&amp;c.</hi> Can any intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  </gap>ation,
whatſoever it was, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
or ſuppoſed to be declared in that
Commiſſion? For who but the King,
that granted the Commiſſion, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the impulſive cauſes to it? or
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> elſe ſhould they be declared but in
that Commiſſion? Yes, ſaith the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the King granted the Commiſſion,
and common Fame, our Author, or I
know not who, declared the <hi>Impulſives</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:114885:95"/>
to it. What pity 'tis our Author had not
ſerved ſeven years to the Clerk of the
Crown, before he undertook the Hiſtory
of a King of <hi>England,</hi> that ſo being better
verſed in all kinde of Commiſſions he
might the better have avoided theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
errors which he falleth into?
And yet this is the only thing, namely,
that <hi>the irregularity or ſuppoſed irregularity of
the ſaid Archbiſhop, was not touched upon in
the Commiſſion as the impulſive cauſe unto it;</hi>
for which not one alone, but <hi>many</hi> (no
man knoweth how many) ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
foiſtings are charged with ſo much
noiſe and clamour on the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>Somewhat more modeſtly in the third,
but with as little thought of rectifying
any thing, as in thoſe before. Told by
the Obſervator, that the perſon whom
this Archbiſhop ſo unfortunately killed,
was not the keeper of his own Game,
but a keeper of the Lord <hi>Zouches</hi> in <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zill
Park;</hi> he acknowledgeth his error
in it, Fol. 44. and yet not only keeps
it in the Text of his new impreſſion, as
before it was; but ſtands unto the truth
of it in the very ſame Pamphlet, Fol. 11.
and this he ſtands to on the authority of
<hi>Aulicus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

elſewhere of no credit with him, though
here they be, but both miſtaken in this
point on uncertain hearſay. Confeſſed
for an error in the Pamphlet, becauſe
upon a further inquiry he could do
no otherwiſe; juſtified for no error in the
very ſame Pamphlet, becauſe he muſt
not yeeld (as inconſiſtent with his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit)
to be out in any thing; And finally
retains ſtill, in the Text of the Hiſtory,
becauſe he loves not to walk ſingle in
thoſe paths of error, but muſt have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
followers for the greater State.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing noted by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,
namely, that ſome pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and
learned men being nominated and elected
Biſhops, refuſed to be conſecrated by
him, in regard that they conceived that
there was more incurred by that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
then a ſuppoſed irregularity
only, is by the Pamphleter paſſed over;
in place whereof he <hi>foiſts</hi> in another,
which he thinks may be more eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that is to ſay, his <hi>vouching Biſhop</hi>

him home in ſome of his own <hi>Billingſgate</hi>
language, for <hi>falſifying ſo boldly, I will not
ſay ſo impudently</hi> (as you know who did)
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114885:96"/>
the plain and manifeſt words of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator;
who is ſo far from <hi>vouching</hi>
this amongſt the reſt of his errors, that
he affirmes it to be <hi>true, that the learned
Biſhop</hi> Andrewes (as our <hi>Author</hi> telleth
us) did do the Archbiſhop very great
ſervice in this buſineſſe. Here is no fair
dealing in this to begin withall, and far
more ſophiſtry then ingenuity in the
reſt that followes. For though the whole
<hi>ſcope of that Commiſſion, was to inquire
into the matter of Fact, and to reſolve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Archbiſhop (notwithſtanding that
miſchance) was regular or not regular,</hi> as the
Pamphleter tels us, fol. 11. Yet Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Andrewes</hi> in the executing of that
Commiſſion, might proceed with favour,
and was not bound to preſſe the point
to the utmoſt extremity, when he ſaw
what further inconveniencies might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
upon it. That learned Biſhop might
do this, and did <hi>really</hi> do it, without
drawing <hi>blame</hi> upon himſelf, or being
<hi>belied</hi> in it by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> as in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
eloquence of the Pamphleter he is
ſaid to be.</p>
               <p>But ſtay a while, we have another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
found out for this <hi>irregularity,</hi> and
found out chiefly (as it ſeems) becauſe
the <hi>Obſervator ſo diſlikes</hi> the other, fol. 46.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114885:97"/>
And yet I trow the <hi>Obſervator</hi> never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
any ſuch diſlike, as to the <hi>cauſe
impulſive</hi> of his (the Archbiſhops) irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity;
no ſuch matter verily, but only
ſhewed that the unfortunate accident
which our Author ſpeaks of, was not
the <hi>declared impulſive cauſe</hi> in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for <hi>ſequeſtring</hi> him from his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and granting it to the five Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
which are therein named, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was not. The <hi>impulſive</hi> cauſe it
might be, though not there <hi>declared;</hi> the
Commiſſion only ſaying in the general,
<hi>That the ſaid Archbiſhop could not at that
preſent, in his own perſon, attend thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which were otherwiſe proper for
his Cognizance and Juriſdiction;</hi> not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
any certain <hi>impulſive cauſe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was conceived uncapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his office. And now what new
impulſive will he give us in <hi>exchange</hi> for
the other? marry he telleth us, that
though it was not publickly declared,
yet it was by knowing men in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
beheld as the reall and genuine
cauſe of this commiſſion; that the Arch-Biſhop
had refuſed to licenſe Dr. <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorps</hi>
Book, Fol. 47. The Book here
meant, was a Sermon preached at <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>
by that Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r before the Judges
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114885:97"/>
of Aſſize <hi>anno</hi> 1627<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after printed
with the name of Apoſtolical obedience.
A Sermon made of ſuch a temper, that
if our Author be in the right, and
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> be not in the wrong, it hath
pleaſed all parties. Refuſed to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Archbiſhop <hi>Abbet,</hi> as our Author
telleth us, though he doth not tell the
reaſons of it; but if it were refuſed to be
licenſed by him, it was becauſe it had
too much of the Court, as tending part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the juſtification of the generall
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an</hi> which was then required of the
the Subjects. Not ſuffered to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> becauſe it had too
little of the Court, till ſome paſſages
which ſeemed offenſive in it touching
the profanation of the Sabbath, and
toleration of Popery (as we are told
by Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>) had been firſt expunged.
But whatſoever the Sermon was, the
Archbiſhops <hi>refuſal</hi> to <hi>licenſe</hi> it (if it were
brought to him to be licenſed) could be
no ſuch crime, as to draw after it both
his removing from the Court, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring
from his Juriſdiction, if other
things of greater moment had not then
concurred.</p>
               <p>Paſſe we unto the next Archbiſhop,
of whom, being then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:114885:98"/>
our Author telleth us, that <hi>many had no
fancy to the work</hi> (the repairing of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church) <hi>meerly becauſe he was the promoter
of it.</hi> But the contrary being proved by
the Obſervator, moſt of the Clergy, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, contributing very
largely to it, becauſe he promoted it,
he only anſwereth, that <hi>many, and moſt,
may be conſistent, and that many may be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the major vote,</hi> Fol. 21. but proveth
not that any of thoſe <hi>many,</hi> did diſlike it
in reſpect of the the Biſhop, or that it
was not rather diſliked by them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the work, which was there
proved from a baſe and ſcurrilous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> Letany. And to this laſt,
our very Author himſelf hath hinted
ſomewhat in his Hiſtory, Fol. 124. where
he affirmes, that <hi>ſome did not forbear to cry,</hi>
what needs this coſt to <hi>decore a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Relique?</hi> This the chief cauſe, why
the work went ſo ſlowly forward, that
at length the diſtempers of the State
ſpoiled the temper of the mortar, as our
Author there.</p>
               <p>Next look upon him as Archbiſhop, in
which capacity we ſhall finde him made
by our Hiſtorian, a principal occaſion of
the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> war; Reproved by the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi>
for calling the war againſt the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114885:98"/>
                  <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops war,</hi> he now ſtands to it
that it was, and might be ſo called for
theſe reaſons following: Firſt, becauſe
not the <hi>Covenanters</hi> only, but <hi>many an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Proteſtant</hi> did ſo call it alſo, Fol. 30.
Some <hi>Engliſh Protestants!</hi> I beleeve not ſo.
The <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> were otherwiſe
perſwaded of it, though the <hi>Puritans</hi>
were not, and 'twas the <hi>Engliſh Puritan,</hi>
not the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> who joyned
with the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the
main deſign, and gave it conſequently
the name of the Biſhops War. He asketh
us ſecondly, <hi>If it were not a war undertaken
at firſt for defence of their Hierarchy.</hi> Which
queſtion being equivalent to an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
doth amount to this, that <hi>the
war was firſt undertaken</hi> in the Biſhops
quarrel, and in <hi>defence</hi> of their Order.
This is well ſaid indeed, if it were well
proved; but this the Pamphleter doth
not prove, I am ſure he cannot: the
King who beſt knew the reaſons of his
taking Armes, and publiſhed a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the proceedings of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
imputes the cauſes of the war to their
continuing the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſcow</hi> when
by him diſſolved, ejecting ſuch of the
Clergy, as had refuſed to ſubſcribe
to the Acts thereof, then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114885:99"/>
to do, ſuſpended and repealed
Lawes without his Authority, putting
the Subjects into Armes, ſeizing upon his
Forts and Caſtles, and intercepting his
Revenues. All which, or any one of
which might have moved the King to
undertake a war againſt them, without
conſulting with our Author how to
bring the poor Biſhops into that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and make it rather ſeem their
quarrell, then the Kings own intereſſe,
which inforced him to it.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith thirdly, <hi>That one of that
Order</hi> (he means the late Archbiſhop of
<hi>Canterbury) was the main cauſe of that war,
by introducing the Liturgie amongſt them,</hi>
and thereupon he doth conclude, <hi>that
the war which the Archbiſhop occaſioned, and
which was entred into for maintaining that
Hierarchy, may, he hopes, without offence, be
called the Biſhops war.</hi> And now we are
come to that we looked for, a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
tale indeed, and one of the fineſt he
hath told us; none of the <hi>Hundred merry
Tales,</hi> nor ſuch a tale as made <hi>his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
wondrous merry,</hi> which we had before,
but a new <hi>Canterbury Tale,</hi> and the Eſquires
tale too. Our Author, a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and ſober Gent. then the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
is, hath told us, that the Kings
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114885:99"/>
demand of the Abby Lands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in
the firſt year of his reign (made by the
Obſervator) was the true cauſe of the
war, and the bug-words ſpoke by the
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords on that occaſion, firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
a mutuall and immortal diſtance
between them, which being in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed
ſheets, Fol. 18. is ſeconded in
the Book now extant, where we are
told that thoſe diſcontents (upon which
the war was after grounded) did break
out in <hi>Scotland, anno</hi> 1633. four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Liturgie was commended to
them; that the next year after, theſe
diſcontents began to contract a little
more confidence in his abſence, and to
attempt his patience by a moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
plot againſt his Fame, as preambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
to another againſt his perſon:
That the firſt work and operation in the
method of Sedition, being to leaven the
maſſe of the peoples mindes with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
impreſſions, they firſt whiſpered
and inſtilled into them cloſe intelligence
of ſome terrible plot againſt their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and after ſent abroad a venemous
libel, in which amongſt other things,
they ſuggeſted formidable fictions of his
tendency to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Belief, Fol. 133.
And finally, that for the Liturgie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114885:100"/>
ſelf, there was a purpoſe in King <hi>James,</hi>
to ſettle ſuch an one amongſt them, as
might hold conformity with that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and that King <hi>Charles</hi> in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Fathers purpoſe, gave dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and to divers Biſhops
of that Kingdome, to reviſe, correct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and change as they pleaſed, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
compiled in his Fathers time; and
finally, that the Book ſo altered, was by
the King ſent by the Counſel of that
Kingdome, with order to proclaim the
Reading of it upon next <hi>Eaſter day,</hi> Fol.</p>
               <p>By this we ſee that ſacriledge and
rapine was the firſt ground of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
theſe diſcontents brake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſedition, and that ſedition ended in an
open war, to which the introducing of
the Liturgie could not be a cauſe, though
it might be made uſe of by thoſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rebellious ſpirits for a preſent
occaſion: and ſo much is confeſſed by
the Pamphleter himſelf, in that there
was no doubt, but many of them had
other then Religious deſigns, as hoping
to obtain that honour and wealth in a
troubled State, which they were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they ſhould never arrive at in a
calm, Fol. 31. <hi>Adeo veritas ab invitis
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114885:100"/>
etiam pectoribus erumpit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lactantius</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
By this it alſo doth appear, that
the Arch-biſhop had not the ſole hand
in the Scotiſh Liturgie, the Book being
reviſed by many, by the Kings directions,
and ſent by him to the Lords of his
Councell in that kingdome, with order
and command to ſee it executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>But the beſt is, that the Pamphleter hath
not only his <hi>tale</hi> ready, but his <hi>Tales
maſter</hi> too, fathering it on the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Author of the <hi>Elenchus motuum,</hi> in
which he findes the Arch-biſhop named
for the main cauſe of introducing that
Liturgie among the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that he
did it <hi>ſpe quidem laudabili, eventu vero peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,
with a good intent, but exceeding ill
ſucceſs,</hi> fol. 30. I have as great an eſteem
for the Author of that Book (whoſoever
he was) as any Pamphleter can have of
him; but yet could tell him of ſome
things in which he was as much miſtaken
as in this particular, but ſince the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
hath made that Authors words
his own, and ſeems to approve of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
though the ſucceſs proved not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable;
I ſhall only put him in mind
of a ſaying in <hi>Ovid, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:114885:101"/>
                  <l>—Careat ſucceſsibus opto,</l>
                  <l>Quiſquis ab eventu facta notanda putat.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay,
<q>
                     <l>Ill may he proſper in his beſt intents,</l>
                     <l>That meaſures Counſels by their ſad events.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſatisfie both the Pamphleter,
and the ingenuous Author by him
alleadged, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat here of
the buſineſs of the Scotiſh Liturgie,
which is not commonly obſerved, and
tends both to the juſtification of the King
himſelf, and of thoſe whom he intruſted
in it. Know then that when the <hi>Scots</hi>
required aid of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (in the
beginning of their Reformation) to
expell the <hi>French,</hi> they bound themſelves
by the Subſcription of their hands to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the form of worſhip, &amp; other Rites
and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England.
Religionis cultui, &amp; ritibus, cum Anglis
communibus, ſubſcripſerunt,</hi> as <hi>Buchannan,</hi>
their own Hiſtorian, and no friend unto
the Anglican Church, informs us
of them. But being cleared of the French
Forces, and able to ſtand on their own
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114885:101"/>
legs, they broke their faith (tis hard to
ſay they ever kept it) in this particular,
and fell on thoſe extemporary undigeſted
prayers, which their own Fancies had
directed, or were thought moſt agreeable
to <hi>Knoxes</hi> humour. The confuſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
and ſad effects whereof
being well known to <hi>King James,</hi> he
thought himſelf concerned (I will not
ſay obliged) to bring them back again,
to that firſt ſubſcription; or to commend
ſuch a Liturgie to them, as might hold
ſome conformity with that of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this end having
reſtored the Biſhops, and ſetled the five
Articles of Perth, as neceſſarie introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to it, he gave order to the Biſhops,
and the reſt of the Clergy then aſſembled,
to compoſe a Liturgie for that Church,
deſiring it might be as near the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
forms as they could conveniently. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as he did little doubt of their ready o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
ſo queſtionleſs, it had been fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by the ſitting of the next Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
if the long and dubious expectation
of the match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Kings
death not long after had not layed it by.
So that <hi>King Char.</hi> had not only the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſubſcription of the nation never yet
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114885:102"/>
lawfully reverſed, but the order of <hi>King
James</hi> regiſtred in the Acts of the General
Aſſembly, to proceed upon; and he
proceeded on it accordingly, as ſoon as
by the Coronation, and the enſuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
he had given contentment to that
people. And therefore they who can
conclude that the Liturgie firſt grounded
on their own ſubſcription, deſigned by
their own generall Aſſembly, reviſed by
their own Biſhops, and confirmed by
their own naturall and native King, was
or could be the ground of their taking
Armes (for I muſt not ſay the <hi>Scots</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did) may by the ſame
Logick conclude as well, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Luther,</hi> was the cauſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
of the Boors in <hi>Germany,</hi>
or that <hi>Tenterden Steeple was the cauſe of
Goodwins ſands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We left the late Arch-biſhop acquitted
(as we hope) from being a principal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> war, we muſt next
free him and the reſt of the Biſhops from
introducing <hi>Innovations, Popery, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi>
and I know not what. And
firſt, our Author told us of him, that <hi>be
tampered to introduce ſome Ceremonies bordering
up on ſuperſtition, diſuſed by us, and abuſed by
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114885:102"/>
them,</hi> that is to ſay, by thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And being told by the Obſervator, that
if they were diſuſed only, they were ſtill
in force, as appeared by the caſe of <hi>Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi>
the Pamphleter anſwered thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the word <hi>diſuſed</hi> doth not at all imply,
that thoſe Ceremonies were in force, but
rather layed aſide by the Reformators,
obſerving how much they were abuſed
by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore
not fit to be retained, fol. 33. A piece of
Law like this we had in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where the Pamphleter had broached
this Doctrine, that <hi>the diſcontinuance of the
execution</hi> (that is to ſay, of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of King <hi>James</hi> about lawfull ſports)
<hi>was a tacite ſuppreſsing and calling of it in.</hi>
To that we referre the Reader for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this. I adde now only by the
way, and <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that many things
may be in <hi>abejance</hi> (as your Lawyers
phraſe it) which are not utterly loſt, and
irrecoverable, but carry with them a hope
or longing expectance, that though for
the preſent they be in no man, yet
be in the hope and expectation of him
who is next to enjoy them. For as the
<hi>Civilians</hi> ſay of <hi>Haereditas jacens,</hi> that
goods and lands do <hi>Jacere</hi> whilſt they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114885:103"/>
want a poſſeſſor, and yet not ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they lately had one, and may ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have another; ſo the common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
do ſay, that things in like eſtate are
in <hi>Abejance.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Cowell</hi> hath defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that word in his <hi>Interpreter.</hi> And this
I take to be the caſe of thoſe antient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which were reduced into the
Church by the Arch-biſh. though a while
diſuſed: and this may ſerve for anſwer
to the laſt Objection of this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
in the preſent point, <hi>viz.</hi> that
things abuſed may be lawfully reſtored
to the Primitive uſe; but then it muſt
be (ſaith he) by lawfull authority, and
in a lawfull manner. Which Rule of his
I hold to be undoubtedly true in the
<hi>Propoſition,</hi> but of no uſe at all in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
the Arch-biſhop having in
himſelf a lawfull power of reſtoring ſuch
antient Rites and Ceremonies, as had
been formerly diſuſed only, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
abrogated, and what he had not in
himſelf, was made up by the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
of which more anon.</p>
               <p>But next our Author tells us of this
Arch-biſhop, that he commanded in his
metropoliticall viſitation, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-table
which formerly ſtood in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114885:103"/>
the midſt of the Church or Chancell,
ſhould be placed at the Eaſt end, upon a
graduated advance of ground with the
ends inverted, and a wooden traverſe
of Railes before it. To which the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
anſwereth, that the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſufficient authority to it, a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the viſitation which our Author
ſpeaks of, in the determination of the
caſe of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> Church, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
3. 1633. The Pamphleter hereunto
replyeth, that by the Arch-biſhops out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
Authority, he intended not,
his placing the Communion Table Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
at the Eaſt of the Chancell (ſo then
we have gained that point, if nothing
elſe) but by enjoyning a wooden Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of Railes to be ſet before it, and
commanding all the Communicants to
come to it to receive the Sacrament, fol.
27. which ſaid, he makes a long diſcourſe
to prove that by the Queens Injunctions,
and the 82. Canon, the Table is to be
placed within the Church or Chancell,
that the Communicants may in greater
numbers receive the Sacrament, which is
beſt done (ſaith he) when the Table is in
the Body of the Church or Chancell.
And againſt this, or in defence of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114885:104"/>
Railes before the Table, ſo as the
Communicant ſhould come up to thoſe
Railes to receive. He is ſure, that there
is no ſuch thing in the Declaration, not
a ſyllable that tends that way. Theſe
Colworts have been boyled already, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, and ſet by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi>
on his Holy Table; ſo that there needs
no other Anſwer, then what we finde in
the <hi>Antidotum Lincolnienſe,</hi> Chap. 7. and
therefore I referre him thither for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
But ſince he hath appealed
to the Declaration; to the Declaration
he ſhall go. In which it is expreſly ſaid,
That for aſmuch as concerns the liberty
given by the ſaid Common Book
or Canons, for placing the Communion
Table in any Church or Chappell
with moſt conveniency; that liberty is
not ſo to be underſtood, as if it were
ever left to the diſcretion of the Pariſh,
much leſs to the particular fancy of any
humorous perſon, but to the Judgement
of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> to whoſe place and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it doth properly belong to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in that point, both for the thing
it ſelf, and for the time, when and how
long as he may find cauſe. So that his
Majeſties Declaration leaves it to the
power of the Ordinary; and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114885:104"/>
as chief Ordinary enjoyneth the
Table to be placed at the Eaſt end
of the Chancell, and the Communicants
to come up to it to receive the Sacrament;
to which the adding of a Rail as a matter
of decency, and for keeping off diſorders
and profanations, is but as an acceſſary.</p>
               <p>But he hath one more fling at the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,
by which he is like to get as
little as by that before. The <hi>Obſervator</hi>
telleth us, that the Arch-biſhop procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his viſitation according to his
Majeſties Declaration above mentioned,
made the year before <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. And
this ſaith he is <hi>London meaſure,</hi> and he
proves it ſtoutly, becauſe, <hi>I ſay</hi> (this
muſt be underſtood as ſpeaking in his
own proper perſon) <hi>metropoliticall viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was</hi> 1635. and therefore the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being made, 1633. cannot be ſaid
to have been made the year before, but
by <hi>London</hi> meaſure, fol. 27. What a <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
have we here, with his <hi>Ipſe dixit;</hi>
if not the whole man, yet the Soul at leaſt
of that grave Philoſopher, transfuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Authors body by a <hi>Metempſucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
I ſay it, therefore nothing truer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be replyed againſt it. But good
Sir, not ſo faſt, let a poor man ſpeak and
he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l tell you, if your Maſterſhip will
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114885:105"/>
hear him out, that though perhaps the
metropoliticall viſitation was not held
till the year 1635. in thoſe parts and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
in which you ſerved, as one of
the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ders of the Veſtry, yet I am very
well aſſured, that it was held in other
places of the Kingdome, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
(if my memory deceive me
not) in all the Counties or Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conries,
of the Dioceſs of <hi>Lincoln, Anno</hi>
1634. which was the next year after the
Declaration, without making any ſuch
<hi>London meaſure</hi> as you ſport your ſelf
with.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt next ſee how far the reſt of the
Biſhops were concerned in thoſe Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
They were firſt charged with the
<hi>audacious obtruding of divers ſuperſtitious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
as erecting of fixed Altars, and
dopping and cringing towards them.</hi> But in
the Pamphlet we hear nothing of theſe
fixed Altars, or againſt placing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table Altar-wiſe, at the Eaſt end
of the Chancell; the Author ſeeming ſo
far ſatisfied, that he ſees not now any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
of Authority in that particular.
And he is ſo far ſatisfied alſo out of his
own <hi>knowledge in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>numents of moſt
pure Antiquity,</hi> which the <hi>Obſervator</hi> had
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114885:105"/>
appealed to, that bodily adoration
and worſhipping toward the Eaſt, was
an antient cuſtom of the Primitive
Church, of which he grants that there
is evidence enough in the Antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
adding that as it was <hi>antient,</hi> ſo he
could not ſay it was illaudable in them,
and might be tolerable in us, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth,
were all men ſatisfied in the
<hi>Decorum</hi> of it; or a liberty left to thoſe
who are ſtill dubious of the lawfulneſs
thereof, to forbear it, fol. 17. In this we
both agree, none better. <hi>Antient, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,</hi>
and tolerable, who can wiſh for
more? yes, <hi>liberty to be left thoſe</hi> who are
dubious of it, either to uſe it or not uſe
it, according to the light of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
That if we do not grant
him, we ſhall not deal ſo friendly with
him as he hath deſerved. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſult the 7. Canon of the year
1646. in which <hi>the Church commending the
reviving of this antient laudable cuſtome to the
ſerious conſideration of all good people</hi> (and not
obtruding it on any) concludeth the
whole with this deſire, <hi>that in the practiſe
or emiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of this rite the Rule of Charity
preſcribed by the Apoſtle may be obſerved,</hi> which
is, <hi>that they that uſe this rite,</hi> deſpiſe <hi>not them
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114885:106"/>
who uſe it not,</hi> condemn <hi>not thoſe who uſe
it.</hi> And in requitall of this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I ſhall not ſtick to allow of his
diſcourſe enſuing, about the not
uſing of ſuch words and names,
by the <hi>ambiguity whereof not eaſily diſcerned
in ordinary diſcourſe, any thing may ſeem to be
intended not conſonant to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi>
according to that golden ſaying of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which is cited by
him.</p>
               <p>But now comes in the naughty Cow
of <hi>Frier Richard of Roughton,</hi> which gave a
good meals milk with one heel (it ſhould
ſeem a Bull rather then a Cow, by the
lowing of it) and kicks it down with
the other. For he telleth us <q>That for
dopping or cringing to, or towards
the Altar or Holy Table, as oft as they
approached to, or retreated from it,
which was oft practiſed by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
pretenders to conformity with
the Primitive Church, he finds not
the leaſt trace thereof in any genuine
Author,</q> of the firſt 500 years, fol. 17.
Let us indulge him this alſo for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
kindneſs, yet what makes this unto
the purpoſe? The Biſhops ſtand accuſed
(whether before the Committee or not, is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114885:106"/>
all one to me) of an audacious obtruding
of new Rites and Ceremonies, and in
particular of this cringing to, or
towards the <hi>Altar,</hi> or <hi>Holy Table.</hi> This
is the charge, a very heavy charge indeed,
and but lightly proved; the charge is of
obtruding; but the Proof of practiſing;
the <hi>obtruding</hi> charged upon the Prelates,
but the practiſe layed on ſome <hi>indiſcreet
pretenders to conformity with the Primitive
times;</hi> who if they did it on their own
heads, and had no warrant for it from
their Superiours, let them ſtand or fall
unto themſelves. But that the <hi>children
ſhould eat ſowre grapes, and the Fathers teeth
ſhould be ſet an edge,</hi> is ſuch a manner of
proceeding, as neither <hi>Proverb, Law,</hi> nor
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> can give countenance to.</p>
               <p>The next Innovation, affirmed to be
obtruded by the Biſhops, is ſtanding up
at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> to which the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
Anſwered, <hi>That the Rubrique of the
Church requiring us to ſtand up at the</hi> Creed,
<hi>obligeth us by the ſame reaſons to ſtand up at the</hi>
Goſpels, <hi>and</hi> Gloria Patri, <hi>the</hi> Goſpels
<hi>being the foundation of the</hi> Creed, <hi>as</hi> Gloria
Patri <hi>is the Abſtract and Epitome of it.</hi> What
ſaith the Pamphleter to this? marry he
firſt askes the Theologaſter (the Dr. or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114885:107"/>
the Obſervator 'tis no matter which) of
what <hi>Creed</hi> the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is by him ſaid
to be the <hi>Epitome;</hi> and then reſolves it of
himſelf, that it is not that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
at which the Rubrick enjoyned us to
ſtand up, becauſe there are in that Creed
ſome other points, which relate not the
Doctrine of the Trinity, fol. 18. But
good Sir <hi>have a little patience, and I will pay
you all.</hi> In the mean time take this for
earneſt or in part of payment, that though
that Creed containeth the profeſſion of
our Faith, in ſome other points, then
thoſe of the Father, of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghoſt, included ſummarily in
the <hi>Gloria Patri;</hi> yet are they all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to that part of the Creed, as being
the repetition of ſuch ſignall Benefits, as
redound to us by the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of the <hi>Son,</hi> our moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
or communicated to us by the
influences of the Holy Ghoſt. So that
if this be all you have to object againſt
us, we may ſtand up at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi>
and ſtand up at it by the authority of
that very <hi>Rubrick,</hi> which requireth our
ſtanding at the Creed.</p>
               <p>But then he telleth us not long after,
that as <hi>ſtanding is not improper</hi> (we are glad
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114885:107"/>
to hear that howſoever) <hi>ſo is it not a poſture
peculiar to the action of doxologie and glorifying
God, as is evident by our Church, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(as in our Communion Service) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it from our knees,</hi> fol. 19. An objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
eaſie to be anſwered. The Obſervator
no where ſaith that ſtanding is a poſture
peculiar to the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> as not to be
communicated to any other part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip, it being practiſed at the
Goſpels, and required at the Creed, and
ſo the firſt part of this Objection falls
without more ado. And 2. though the
Communion Book require <hi>kneeling</hi> in the
people, when <hi>Gloria in excelſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> is ſaid or
ſung by the Prieſt; yet is not this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto it as it is a doxologie, a giving
of glory unto God, but as it is an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
on Chriſt our Saviour to have
mercy on us, and to receive thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which are offered to him. And knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
doubtleſs is the moſt proper poſture
in the act of prayers, required therefore
in all ſuch as receive the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is given them with a prayer by
the Prieſt or Miniſter.</p>
               <p>That <hi>many things may be retained in a
Church reformed, ex vi Catholicae conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
eſpecially, <hi>where there is no Rule to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114885:108"/>
the contrary.</hi> The Pamphleter alloweth
well enough with a <hi>Bene, Bene;</hi> but ſayes
withal that it is litle to the purpoſe, there
being in the Act of Uniformity a <hi>Vae</hi> or
Woe, to him who <hi>ſhall willingly uſe any
other Rite or Ceremony, &amp;c. then is ſet forth in
the Book of Common Prayer,</hi> fol. 19. I
thought our Author had been ſuch an
enemy to all <hi>etcaeteras,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
import,</hi> as you know who ſaid,
which they carry with them, eſpecially
in a Law or Canon, that no ſuch ſham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing (for he calls it ſomewhere a
<hi>ſhamefull &amp;c.</hi> if my memory fail not)
ſhould have been found in all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
but I ſee he can make uſe of them
when there is occaſion; and that too in
the citing of a Law or Statute, which, as
he ſaith, <hi>doth binde all men to a ſtrict confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the very letter of it.</hi> I finde by this,
that our Author is better at the <hi>Bar</hi> then
upon the Bench; not ſo much ſtudied in
the <hi>Querks</hi> and <hi>Quorums</hi> of a Commiſſion,
as in the ferreting and fingring of a
Statute-law, in which no Barreſter
of them all, no not the Utter Barreſter
of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne is to be named the ſame
day with him. For what an Argument
had here been for Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> if he could
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114885:108"/>
have ſeen ſo far into this <hi>mill-ſtone</hi> of
the Law, as our Author can, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
bowing at the name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi>
no where appointed in the <hi>Rubricks</hi>
of the publique Liturgie, but firſt
retained, <hi>ex vi Catholica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

required afterwards by the Queens
injunctions, and finally by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of 603. Neither of which could
ſtand before the face of an Act of
Parliament, if produced againſt
them. What a brave Argument could
our Author have hinted and held
forth to <hi>Harry Burton</hi> (never the
Princes Tutor Sir, you are out in
that, though honoured by you with
that title in the ſheetes unpubliſhed)
againſt ſtanding up at the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,
had he been conſulted in the
caſe, as he ſhould have been? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
how many men might he
have brought his Action in the
times of conformity, for ſtanding
up at the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds,
at the <hi>Te Deum, Benedictus,</hi> and the
other Hymnes? all Treſpaſſes againſt
this Statute, which <hi>binds all men</hi> (as
we are told by this man of Law) <hi>to
a ſtrict conformity to the very letter of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:114885:109"/>
But the beſt is, there is no ſuch
thing in all that Statute, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſpeaks of, no <hi>Vae or Woe to him,
who ſhall willingly uſe any other rite, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
&amp;c. then what is ſet forth in

forth in the ſaid Book.</q> Nothing
in this to reſtrain men from uſing
any one or none ſingle Rites or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in uſe, and againſt which there is
nothing directed or commanded in

verily; but a Command, that

in Orders, ſhall uſe any other Rite,

of ſuch, who ſhall <hi>willingly uſe any

to underſtand the difference between
the doing of a thing <hi>willingly,</hi> and
ſtanding obſtinately and wilfully to
it after it is done. Had any of theſe
things been found in the Obſervator,
he had been told of forging and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Record, and I know not
what. But in our Author it is
only one of thoſe <hi>Piae fraudes</hi> which
neceſſarily conduce to the advancing

               <p>I might expect a fee of my Author

the Rubricks of the Liturgy, nor

any Canon of the Church do require
it of us. His following maxime, <hi>that
standing is the moſt proper poſture of
Attention,</hi> I like wondrous well;
and I like better, that he ſaith <hi>it
becometh him not, to have</hi> his Hat on,
<hi>when his Lord and Master ſpeakes to
him,</hi> fol. 19. But for all, I would
have him take a ſpeciall care, leſt
whilſt he thus zealouſly <hi>purſueth
Order, he out-run authority,</hi> as we know
who did. For certainly the Canon
which he built upon will not bear
him out in it againſt the Statute,
if the Statute were to be ſo expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as to reſtrain the uſe of all <hi>Rites</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> not ſpecified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the Book of Common
Prayer, as he told us lately. For
though <hi>Genuflexion or bowing of the knee
cannot be done</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
poſture,</hi> yet men that ſit may
tender due and lowly reverence at
the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by the humble
bowing of their Bodies, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by that ſign and <q>geſture, their
inward humility, Chriſtian Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and due acknowledgement
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114885:111"/>
that the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the true
and eternall Son of God, is the
only Saviour of the world,</q> &amp;c. As
in the 18. Canon of 603.</p>
               <p>But one good turn requireth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
The Pamphleter in requitall,
ſhall adviſe the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> not to
be <hi>too confident,</hi> in ſaying, he was <hi>ſure,
that ſtanding at the</hi> Gloria Patri, <hi>was
never obtruded</hi> by the Prelates; <hi>for
fear there ſhould prove ſome flaw in his
aſſurance, whoſoever was of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
in it,</hi> fol. 18. This is a friendly
admonition, and I ſhall make the
beſt uſe of it accordingly. But how
doth he weaken this aſſurance, and
abate this confidence? Marry becauſe
<q>in <hi>Biſhop Wrens</hi> Articles framed
for the Dioceſs of <hi>Norwich,</hi> ſure he
is Chap. 4. there are theſe words,
<hi>viz.</hi> Do they, i. e. the people, at
the end of every Pſalm ſtand up,
and ſay, Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.
And he thinks things inquired after
in Dioceſan viſitations, may be
ſaid to be urged and obtruded,</q> fol.
18. <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic ſaltus;</hi> this is

him he that can. But Sir, though
I have heard ſome men aſcribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallibility
to the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet I never heard of any man
till now, that did intitle them, their
Committees inſtruments, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
to the <hi>Spirit of prophecy;</hi> and
'tis impoſſible, that they could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
tell, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. what
Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> would do at <hi>Norwich</hi>
above ſeven years after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636.
For marke the ſtory as it lieth. The
Committee for Religion declared
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. That upon due inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they found it in a very totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and declining condition, &amp;c.
partly from the audacious obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of divers ſuperſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
by the Prelates, as ſtanding at
the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. Hiſt. fol. 96.
This is the information, but what
Proofs have they of it? The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
is in matter of Fact, <hi>of
divers Superſtitious Ceremonies, ſtanding
up at the Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. At that
time and before <hi>obtruded by ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
Prelates.</hi> The Proof is given
them by the <hi>Spirit of prophecy,</hi> in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114885:112"/>
telling them what was, or ſhould
be done above ſeven years after,
when <hi>Biſhop Wren</hi> ſhould hold his
firſt viſitation for the Dioceſs of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>
I ſee our Author is as good at
<hi>Logick</hi> as he is at Law. For mark
the Argument in Biſhop <hi>Wrens</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>framed for the Dioceſs of Norwich
(Anno</hi> 1636. why was that left out?)
it is enquired into, <hi>whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at the end of every Pſalm did ſtand up
and ſay, Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
which is in <hi>Engliſh, therefore,</hi> This
<hi>Superſtitious Ceremony</hi> of ſtanding at
the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> was obtruded by the
audacious Prelates above ſeven years
before. <hi>Anno 1628. Brave man at
Arms</hi> I muſt confeſs, though weak
to <hi>Baltazar.</hi> And now I hope I

               </p>
               <p>But yet I have not payed him all,
there is ſome behinde. For is not

Hiſt. fol. 127. yet he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
it well enough; For he tels
us in his Pamphlet, fol. 27. <hi>Oportet
eſſe memorem,</hi> but he leaves out the
moſt ſignificant word of all, that
which moſt properly doth concern
him, <hi>Mendacem: Oportet mendacem
eſſe memorem,</hi> was the Rule of old,
and it concerns our Author to take
notice of it. I well remember thoſe
words ſaith he, <hi>but never meant they
ſhould relate to the ſetting Railes before
the Holy Table,</hi> fol. 28. Well then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
our Author his more ſecret
meaning, we have gained thus much,
that placing the Table Altar-wiſe,
and bowing towards it, and ſtanding
at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> are no more to
be reckoned for <hi>Innovations,</hi> but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi>
rather, as our Author freely
hath acknowledged. For telling
us that he <hi>never meant,</hi> that the
words alleadged <hi>ſhould relate to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Railes before the holy Table;</hi> he doth
ingenuouſly confeſs he meant it in
all the reſt; according to the good
old Rule, <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam
in non exceptis.</hi> And again, is not this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114885:113"/>
the man that tels us <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. in
his new Edition, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to <hi>pourtray England</hi> in her full
Stature of externall Glory, may
now take her dimenſions; he ſhall
behold her Church ſhining in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
Empyreall brightneſs, and
purity of Evangelicall truth. Her
religious performances, her holy
offices, ordered and regulated agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the ſtrict expedient of ſuch
ſacred actions. Her Diſcipline, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
ſutable to the Apoſtolick form.
The ſet and ſuite of her Holy
Tribe renowned for piety and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and all thoſe in ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
a degree, that no Church
on this ſide of the Apoſtolique, can
or ever could, compare with her in
any one, fol. 142. Here is an <hi>Euge

I confeſs, and I thank him for
it, but very different from thoſe
Taxes, charges, and <hi>obtruſions,</hi> which we
finde elſewhere. Out of which I ſhall
only note, as proper to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

is placed by him <hi>Anno</hi>

Table <hi>Altar-wiſe,</hi> and <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
towards it, and ſtanding at the
<hi>Gloria Patri</hi> were grown more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in uſe, then they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
And ſecondly, that it is
here ſaid, that <hi>her Religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and holy offices, were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
agreeable to the</hi> ſtrict Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<hi>of ſuch ſacred Actions.</hi> If <hi>regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
by the <hi>strict Expedients of ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Actions,</hi> as he ſaith they were,
then neither placing the <hi>Table Altar-wiſe,</hi>
nor bowing towards it, nor
<hi>ſtanding at the Gloria Patri,</hi> no nor
the very <hi>Railes</hi> themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within the compaſſe of theſe

of as <hi>Innovations,</hi> and <hi>Obtruſions</hi> by
the Committee for Religion of which
we ſpeak, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628.</p>
               <p>The Prelates being thus freed,
and freed even by our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
from <hi>innovating</hi> in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, here by Law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we muſt next ſee, what danger
there was feared from <hi>Doctrinal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,
by the uncontrouled preaching of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114885:114"/>
ſeverall points, tending and warping that
way,</hi> by <hi>Mountague, Goodman, Cozens,</hi>
and others, as in the Hiſtory, Fol.
96. To which the <hi>Obſervator</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>That neither <hi>Mountague</hi>
nor <hi>Cozens,</hi> were queſtioned for
preaching any thing which warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward Popery; but the one of
them for writing the Book called
<hi>Appello Caeſarem,</hi> the other for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
a <hi>Body of Devotions,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Hours of Prayer,</hi> in
neither of which, an equall and
judicious Reader will find any
Popery.</q> What ſaith the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to this? Why, firſt he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
That in ſtead of <hi>preaching,</hi> he
ſhould have ſaid <hi>publiſhing:</hi> and this
miſtake (with more then ordinary
ingenuity) he hath rectified in the
laſt Edition, Fol. 98. Secondly,
as for Dr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> he grants inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
enough, that in his Book,
<hi>there is no direct Popery,</hi> though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(as he ſaith) which might
<hi>raiſe a jealouſie of his tendency that
way;</hi> but yet forbears to preſſe it
further (and it is well for him,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114885:114"/>
that he had ſo good a colour to
forbear the preſſing of that, which
he could not prove) <hi>Seeing that
Doctor hath appeared of late ſo ſtout an
Advocate for the Reformed Church;</hi> as
<hi>he hath been informed by ſome, and
aſſured by others,</hi> fol. 17. To the
Obſervators defence of Bp. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi>
there is no Reply: ſo that
the Action being withdrawn againſt
one of the parties, and the other
quit by Proclamation, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
them of the Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more adoe. Finally, as for Bp.
<hi>Goodman,</hi> the Obſervator hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
you, that <hi>though he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſomething once which might warp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Popery, yet he did not preach it
uncontrouled, being not only queſtioned
for it, but ſentenced to a Recantation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King.</hi> To this I find no
Reply neither, and I wonder at it,
conſidering the great advantage gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by that Biſhop at his death, to
increaſe the ſcandall; a ſcandal ſo
unſeaſonably, and untimely given,
as if the Devil himſelf had watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an opportunity to deſpight this
Church. And though ſome men
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114885:115"/>
have gladly cheriſhed this occaſion,
to draw the reſt of the Prelates, and
Prelatical party, into a generall
ſuſpicion, of being as much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Popery, as that Biſhop was;
yet Chriſtian charity ſhould inſtruct
them, not to think evil of all, for
the fault of one, or prejudge any
one man, much leſſe the whole
Body of a Clergy, for the fault of
another. It rather ſhould be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at by all moderate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
men, that notwithſtanding
ſo many provocations of want, and
ſcorn, which have of late been put
upon them, there ſhould be found
but one of that ſacred order, and
but three more (that I have heard
of) of the Regular Clergy to fall
off to Popery: though to ſay
truth, it was not in this Biſhop a
late falling off, but a purſuance
rather of ſome former inclinations
which he had that way, that being
thought to be the reaſon why he
refuſed ſubſcription to the Canons
of 640. mentioned in our Hiſtorian
fol. 186.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:114885:115"/>
But, <hi>oportet eſſe memorem,</hi> as we
know who ſaid: and now it will
be time to paſſe from thoſe <hi>Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Innovations,</hi> which ſeemed to
threaten, <hi>that Tiber would drown the
Thames,</hi> in our Authors language,
to thoſe deſigns which tended to
the bringing in of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> if all
be true, which was brought in to

Suppreſſion of the Publique Libertie; and
make thoſe Provinces, <hi>Unius quaſi familiae
haereditas,</hi> the Patrimonie and Inheritance
of the <hi>Naſſovian</hi> Familie. Hereupon fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Prince had made himſelf the
head of the rigid <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> he joyned
himſelf to thoſe, whom our Author calls
<hi>Arminians,</hi> but paſſed in their own
Country by the name of <hi>Remonstrants;</hi>
and thereby brought the Prince into ſuch
a ſtreight, that to preſerve his power, and
make ſure of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> he violated all
the privileges of thoſe ſeveral States,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:114885:119"/>
for which they had firſt took up Armes
againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For firſt drawing
out ſuch Forces as were moſt at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
he paſſeth from one Town to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
diſplaceth the Magiſtrates, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the Garriſons, and removes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
putting none into the Rooms,
but ſuch as were of the other party, and
aſſured unto him; And 2ly, having thus
altered the whole Face of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<hi>Barnevelt</hi> by theſe new Magiſtrats
is ſeized upon, and contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of <hi>Holland</hi> (whereof he was
a native) put over to certain Delegats ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the States Gen. (men utterly
uncapable of dealing in matters of that
nature) to hear his proceſs, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was
condemned, and accordingly executed.
And this is that <hi>wicked Conſpiracy,</hi> for
which he <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſo <hi>condignly,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
telleth us; but whether it were ſo
or no, the moderate and <hi>unconcerned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
but ſome what leſſe concerned than
the Pamphleter is, will be better able
to diſcern, if he peruſe the <hi>Apologie of the
Remonſtrants,</hi> in which are many things
of note which concern this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>As for that <hi>Damnable and Helliſh Plot
about three years after, wherein the States
ſitting in Councel at the</hi> Hague, <hi>and after
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114885:119"/>
them all, other Anti-Arminian Magiſtrates
were deſtin'd to ſlaughter,</hi> as the Pamphleter
hath it, Fol. 46. If all be true that is
reported, and the deſign as <hi>damnable</hi> and
<hi>helliſh,</hi> as the Pampleter makes it, yet
doth not this concern the <hi>Arminian</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but only the Children and Kinred of
<hi>Barnevelt,</hi> whoſe deſign it was; who
to revenge his death, ſo unworthily and
unjuſtly contrived (and, as they thought)
ſo undeſervedly, and againſt their Lawes,
might fall upon ſome deſperate counſels,
and moſt unjuſtifiable courſes in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it. But what makes this to the
<hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> partie? <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelts</hi>
Children were convicted of a
<hi>Damnable</hi> and <hi>Helliſh plot</hi> againſt the
State; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> or <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>

                  </gap>ently, not to be <hi>ſuffered</hi> in a
<hi>Commonwealth.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> approved
not of this Logick, when it was moved by
ſome hot-headed Members of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Houſe, to ſeize upon the perſons, and
Confiſcate the Fiſtates of all <hi>Engliſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi>
as guilty of the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi>
becauſe ſome diſcontented, turbulent and
ambitious ſpirits had deſigned the Plot;
<q>I know (ſaith he, in his Speech to both
Houſes of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605.)
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114885:120"/>
that your hearts are ſo burnt up with
zeal in this errant, and your tongues ſo
ready to utter your dutifull Affections,
and your hands and feet ſo bent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
in the execution thereof, (for
which, as I need not to ſpurre you, ſo
can I not but praiſe you for the ſame:)
As it may very well be poſſible that
the zeal of your hearts ſhall make ſome
of you in your ſpeeches raſhly to blame
ſuch, as may be innocent of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
But upon the other part, I wiſh
you to conſider, that I would be ſorry
that any being innocent of this practice,
either Domeſtical or Foreign, ſhould
receive blame or harm for the ſame:
For although it cannot be denied, that
it was the only blind Superſtition of
their errours in Religion, that led them
to this deſperate device; yet doth it
not follow, that all profeſſing the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion were guilty of the ſame.</q> So
he. And how far different this is from
the Pamphleters <hi>Logick,</hi> (though that
the beſt Logick of theſe times) is left to
the Conſideration of all equal and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
men. And 2ly, admitting that
the whole <hi>Arminian</hi> partie were engaged
in theſe Treaſons, either in <hi>voto</hi> or in <hi>Re,</hi>
yet doth it not follow hereupon with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114885:120"/>
to other Countries; <hi>that they are
none of the beſt ſubjects, be their Doctrine as
Orthodox as they pretend:</hi> Which is the
Corollary which the Pamphleter hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon it. My reaſon is, becauſe
<hi>Arminianiſm</hi> it ſelf, as it relates to the
five points in difference (which in our
Authors <hi>Style</hi> is called <hi>Arminianiſm</hi>) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
not the Profeſſors of it to any ſuch
practices. And therefore if the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
ſhould prove to be as <hi>turbulent</hi> and
<hi>ſeditious,</hi> as the Pamphleter makes them,
yet muſt we not impute it to them, as
they are <hi>Arminians,</hi> that is to ſay, as men
following the <hi>Melancthonian</hi> way, and
differing in thoſe five points from the reſt
of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> but as they are a <hi>branch
of the Sect of Calvin, to whoſe Diſcipline in
all particulars, they conformed themſelves,
and to his Doctrine in the most,</hi> as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> And we know
well what Dangerous Practices and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been ſet on foot within this
Iſland, by ſuch as have purſued the one,
and embrace the other.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, I muſt turn back again, where
I find the <hi>Obſervator</hi> put to an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but invidious task. The <hi>Obſervator</hi>
had affirmed, that St. Auguſtines <hi>zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>tranſported him into
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114885:121"/>
ſuch inconvenient expreſſions, as the wiſest
men may fall into on the like occaſions.</hi> To
this the Pamphleter replieth, <hi>That it were
a work very proper for the Obſervator, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in thoſe inconvenient expreſſions, and
to undertake the confutation of them,</hi> Fol. 5.
And this I call, both an unneceſſary and
invidious task: unneceſſary, as being no
way pertinent to the preſent buſineſſe;
invidious, in regard of that high eſteem
which that great Father hath attained to
in the Chriſtian world. And yet I ſhall
crave leave to ſay, that if he had not run
himſelf into ſome Inconvenient expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in condemning Infants unbaptized
to the pains of Hell, he never had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the name of <hi>Infanto-Mastix:</hi> A
more particular accompt whereof I
had rather the Reader ſhould take
pains to collect from his writings, than
expect from me. All I ſhall further add
is this, that St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he was
alive, did neither think himſelf infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or exempt from errours; Nor was
diſpleaſed with St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> for canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or confuting any point of Doctrine by
him delivered. This liberty they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
indulged on one another, and good
reaſon for it; <hi>Non tam Stultus ſum ut di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitate
explanationum tuarum me laedi pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114885:121"/>
quia nec tu laederis ſi nos contraria ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerimus.</hi>
This was St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a point between
them; equally full of piety, and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing required of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
is, <hi>To produce the men of the</hi> Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
party, <hi>who ſay, that a man is forcibly
drawn and irreſistibly with the Cords of
Grace in the work of converſion.</hi> Fol 5.
He grants indeed, that <hi>they take away
an actual reſiſtance of the will, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent,</hi>
ſimul &amp; ſemel, <hi>with efficacious
Grace,</hi> and I grant that too: <hi>Grace</hi> not
being <hi>efficacious,</hi> or deſerving ſo to be
accompted, when all mans <hi>actual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
is not took away. But ſuch an <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibility,
as the Obſervator mentioneth, he
thinks</hi> that <hi>none</hi> of them <hi>aſſert.</hi> But he
doth but <hi>think</hi> it, and he is able to think
more then the moſt ſubtle diſputant of
that party is able to prove: But the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi>
or <hi>contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> have thought
otherwiſe of it, who in the conference
at <hi>Hague</hi> 
                  <q>maintained an irreſiſtibility
no leſſe evident in the workings of
Grace, then in thoſe of the natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
or ſupernatural reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead, man being no more
able in their opinion to reſiſt the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114885:122"/>
of Grace, then he is able either
to hinder his own begetting, or his
laſt raiſing from the grave:</q>

then the Pamphleter muſt have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of this <hi>Metaphyſical whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wham,</hi>
viz. <hi>How Eternity</hi> (for ſo ſaith
he the Obſervator ſaith) <hi>not Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can</hi> recipere majus &amp; minus, <hi>receive
either augmentation or diminution from man,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ol. 5. But Sir, without any of your <hi>whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whams,</hi>
where find you any ſuch thing, or
any thing that looks that way in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator?
Cannot the Obſervator ſay,
that by the doctrine of ſome <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>
and <hi>Rigid Lutherans, a man contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his own Eternity,</hi> but preſently
you muſt cry out of I know not what
<hi>Metaphyſical whimwhams,</hi> as if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that <hi>Eternity</hi> might <hi>recipere majus
&amp; minus?</hi> For though <hi>Eternity</hi> cannot
<hi>recipere majus &amp; minus,</hi> as indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
yet I hope the Pamphleter or our
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:114885:122"/>
Author will not ſtick at this, that ſome
men do contribute more or leſs, to their
own <hi>Eternity,</hi> or towards the attaining
of their own <hi>Eternity</hi> (if that will better
pleaſe the man) than ſome other do. But
had the obſervator uſed the word <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
as the Pamphleter ſayeth he
ſhould have done, had he ſpoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
then this great quarrel had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<hi>Salvation</hi> being ſuſceptible of a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
et minus,</hi> (what elſe can be inferred
from the Pamphleters words?) though
<hi>Eternity</hi> be not: which indeed I will
not ſay is ſuch a <hi>Metaphyſical Whimwham,</hi>
but ſuch a fine piece of <hi>Norfolk</hi> Drapery,
<hi>that tis pitty we ſhould have no more of the
Remnant,</hi> as well and wiſely ſaid the
Gentleman on another occaſion.</p>
               <p>Next for King <hi>James,</hi> the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeems much diſpleaſed, that having
been inclinable unto the Calvinian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
as well by the courſe of his Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as by the inſinuations of Dr. <hi>James
Mountague,</hi> firſt <hi>Dean</hi> of the Chapell,
and afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi>
and at laſt of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> he ſhould be
thought to change his Judgements in
thoſe points on Reading of Mr. <hi>Richard
Mountagues</hi> Book againſt the <hi>Gagger,</hi>
and this (ſaith he) is <hi>moſt unlikely, It being
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:114885:123"/>
well known, that in Theological controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
King</hi> James <hi>was able enough to go alone,
and needed not, like a Child, be led up and
down by the hanging Sleeves from one opinion
to the other,</hi> Fol. 5. But then it is but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
only, though <hi>moſt unlikely,</hi> that
it ſhould be ſo; And being but unlikely,
though <hi>moſt unlikely,</hi> there is no ſuch
impoſſibility in it, but that it may be
certified without any injury to the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that King in <hi>Theological controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:</hi>
it being no unuſuall thing in the
greateſt Scholars, not only to alter their
opinions, in matters of opinion only,
and not fundamentll (as the Pamphleter
makes theſe not to be) but <hi>Retract</hi> and
<hi>Recognize</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Saint
<hi>Augustiue</hi> did) what they ſaid before.
And that the King had either altered his
opinion in thoſe points, or abated much
of his rigor in it, appeareth by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
which he gave to <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagues</hi>
Book, and the incouragements
which the Author had from him, to
vindicate both his Fame and Doctrine
againſt <hi>Ward</hi> aud <hi>Yates,</hi> the two Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;
a full accompt whereof we have in
the obſervations. Fol. 33.</p>
               <p>But the Pamphleter will not have
done with Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> telling us a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:114885:123"/>
very pretty tale, <q>that in the year 1628
this Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> then Biſhop, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Doctor <hi>Neile</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
being remonſtrated to the King,
as Abettors of thoſe Tenets, profeſſed
with Tears in their eyes, that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thoſe opinions, and before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and his Counſell renounced them,</q>
Fol. 6. Here is indeed a dolefull ditty,
the <hi>Lamentation of a ſinner,</hi> to the Tune
of <hi>Lachrymae;</hi> a tale like this wee had
before, but that it was the <hi>Squires tale</hi>
then, and the <hi>Knights Tale</hi> now. For
if we aſk what authority, what Proof
he hath to make good the ſtory; Marry
ſaith he, it was <hi>ſo averred by Sir</hi> Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey
Mildmay in open Parliament, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
contradicente, no one near the Chair
contradicting.</hi> Never was ſtory better
proved, nor proved by more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of ſuch waight and moment. It was
averred <hi>by Sir Humphrey Mildmay</hi>
(whether miſtaken in the name, or man,
I regard not,) and therefore moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falliblly
true, for if Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaid
the word, it muſt needs be ſo: and yet I
do not think that Sir <hi>Humphry,</hi> or Sir
What you will, was any of the Kings
Councell, or called into the Conncell
Chamber, to behold the Comaedie. It
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114885:124"/>
was averred ſecondly in the open Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,

of Alcumy, it was made a truth, a moſt
unqueſtionable truth. It was averred
thirdly, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> and very good
reaſon for that too; there being none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
then preſent, who were admitted to
the ſight of that <hi>Enterlude,</hi> as Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry
was,</hi> or otherwiſe its worth the
while to diſprove the Fable. But here
I find ſomething worth the Learning,
which is, that <hi>nemine contradicente</hi> doth
not ſignifie only (as the poor <hi>Theologaſter</hi>
might conceive it did) <hi>no one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting,</hi>
but no one contradicting who
ſtood near the Chair. A pretty piece
of Grammar-learning, and I thank him
for it; the rather, in regard it may be
gathered from theſe words, that though
no man who ſtood <hi>near the Chair</hi> did or
durſt contradict Sir <hi>Humpry</hi> in this pretty
figment; yet others who ſtood farther off
(and being <hi>procul à Jove,</hi> might be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114885:124"/>
à fulmine</hi>) did preſume to do it. And
this I hope will ſatisfie the Pamphleter,
and Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> too.</p>
               <p>We have now done with Biſhop
<hi>Mountague,</hi> but we muſt have another

that too) that they might have ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
grudges againſt that Prelate. Doctor
<hi>Marſhal</hi> claimed ſome fewell yearly out
of that Biſhops woods, in the right of
his Parſonage, which that Biſhop (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an old Courtier, but of no great
Courtſhip) did refuſe to make him. This
gave him occaſion of diſpleaſure, and
being withall a man of ſome indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he might poſſibly, not carry the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo diſcreetly, but that he might be
liable to ſome juſt reproof. But as for
Doctor <hi>More,</hi> I ſhall need no other
matter againſt him, than what I find in
the unpubliſhed ſheets of our Author
himſelf, where he tells us of him, that

                     </gap>aculeated wit,</hi> Fol. 69. A man (it ſeems)
of more <hi>Sting</hi> than <hi>Hony,</hi> and was not
ſparing of it (in his heats of zeal) upon
all occaſions; Inſomuch that there goeth
a ſtory of him, that Mr. <hi>Hugh May</hi> who
had commended <hi>Archie</hi> to the Court not
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114885:126"/>
long before, obtained a turn for this
Doctor before King <hi>James,</hi> in which he
ſhewed ſo much heat, and ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
that the King told <hi>Hugh May</hi>
when he ſaw him next, that <hi>he thanked him
more for his Fool than he did for his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Beſides our Author telleth us of him
in the place above mentioned, that
preaching after the Dukes return from the
Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> he took occaſion in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
to ſpeak of the defeat given to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army, under the command of
<hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> by the <hi>German</hi> Nations,
adding theſe words of the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> that
this Army periſhed, <hi>propter inſcitiam &amp;
temeritatem ducis:</hi> In which being thought
to have put a ſcorn upon the Duke, and
reprehended for it by his Dioceſan, he
was judged fit to be made uſe of againſt
that Biſhop, when the teeth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
were edged againſt him.</p>
               <p>Proceed we next to the <hi>Lambeth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
the great Diana of the Epheſians</hi> of
our times. It was affirmed by the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
that they were never looked on as the
Doctrin of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſo looked upon by them that made
them.</hi> But this the Pamphleter puts off
to Mr. <hi>Pym, and the Committee for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but grants withall, <hi>That it is very
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114885:126"/>
probable, that the Compilers of the Book of
Articles, and the Book of</hi> Homilies, <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from</hi> Calvins <hi>ſenſe in the point of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,
and its ſubordinates,</hi> Fol. 15.
Nor doth he only grant it to be probable,
but he proves it alſo, <hi>It being</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>very rare for two, even of the ſame party, to
agree exactly in all parcels of theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</hi>
So then, whether it were our
Author, or the Committee <hi>for Religion,</hi>
which declare theſe Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi>
to ſpeak the ſenſe of the 39 Articles of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it comes all to
one, the Pamphleter leaving them in
the plain field, and ſiding with the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi>
in this particular. In the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Articles, or rather in one
circumſtance of it, the Obſervator was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
affirming Page 74. That <hi>on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe Articles to</hi> Cambridge, Dr. Baro
<hi>found himſelf ſo diſcouraged &amp; diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that at the end of his firſt 3 years he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
his Profeſſorſhip, and retired not long
after into</hi> France; to this the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
makes anſwer, <hi>That</hi> Peter Baro <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed
not his profeſſorſhip at the end of
his first three years,</hi> proved by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
upon <hi>Ionah,</hi> to be Profeſſor there,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1574. and confeſſed to be ſo by the
Obſervator, <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. 2. That that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114885:127"/>
                  <hi>Profeſſorſhip</hi> is not <hi>eligible,</hi> from 3 years
to 3 years, but at the end of each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year; proved by the Statutes of the
Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> (Counteſſe of <hi>Richmond</hi>
and <hi>Derby</hi>) the foundreſſe of it. 3. That
<hi>Peter Baro</hi> never went or retired into
<hi>France,</hi> after the reſignation of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip,
but lived and dyed in <hi>Crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Friers,</hi> as may be proved by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a Son of his, who is ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
               <p>In the two firſt of theſe we have <hi>Confiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
reum,</hi> the Obſervator crying <hi>peccavi,</hi>
and confeſſing guilty, but ſo that he had
good authority for his errour in it; For
firſt the Pamphleter hath told us, <hi>That
very many were of the contrary belief,</hi> that
is to ſay, to the election of that Profeſſor
every ſecond year, &amp; ſo the wonder is the
leſſe, if the Obſervator ſhould be one of
thoſe very many. 2. He had found in the
Hiſtory of the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles printed
at <hi>London</hi> 1641. that <hi>Baro</hi> at the third
years end (for ſo long he was to hold
that Lecture by their antient Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
relinquiſhed his Profeſſorſhip, and
betook himſelf to his private ſtudies.
<hi>Baro</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>elapſo tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

book called <hi>Reſponſio neceſſaria,</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by the Remonſtrants, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615.
That notwithſtanding the coming of
thoſe Articles, he continued in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip,
<hi>Donec exacto ſuo triennio (profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio
utique il a qua in Collegio fungebatur, in
triennium ſolum prorogabatur) profeſſione ſe
abdicavit, &amp; tranquillam ut viveret vitam
privatis ſe ſtudiis totum dedit;</hi> that is to
ſay, that his three years being expired
(that Profeſſorſhip being continued in
that Univerſity but for three years only)
he left the place, retired unto a private
life, and gave himſelf wholly to his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
4. He hath found alſo in the Hiſtory of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> writ by Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> a <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
man, and one that ſhould have
known the Cuſtoms and Statutes of that
Univerſity, that <hi>the end of Doctor Peter
Baro (the Marguaret Profeſſor) his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial
Lectures began to draw near, &amp;c.</hi>
Sect. 21. which layed together, I would
fain know of the equal and impartial
Reader, Firſt, whether the <hi>Obſervator</hi>
may not be excuſed for making that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to continue from three years to
three years; And ſecondly, whether the
<hi>exacto ſuo Triennio,</hi> in the Book called
<hi>Reſponſio neceſſaria,</hi> and the end of his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:114885:128"/>
Triennial Lectures in <hi>Fullers</hi> Hiſtory,
might not induce him to conceive, that
Dr. <hi>Baro</hi> gave over the Profeſſorſhip at
the end of his firſt three years.</p>
               <p>In the laſt point the cauſe is not ſo
clear on the Pamphleters ſide, nay it
will rather go againſt him. Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> a
man diligent enough in the ſearch of any
thing which concerns his Argument,
hath told us poſitively, in his <hi>Auli-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm,
pag.</hi> 268. that being conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the heads of that Univerſity,
he was not only forced to forſake the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity,
but the Kingdom too; For
which he citeth Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> in his <hi>Concio ad
Clerum, Anno</hi> 1626. and <hi>Thytius</hi> in his
Preface <hi>ad Fratres Belgas;</hi> Nor do the
Pamphleters proofs come home to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the contrary; unleſſe the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be good, that <hi>Baro lived and died in
London,</hi> and was buried there in St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laves
Church. Ergo he retired not into
France, upon his firſt relinquiſhing of the
Univerſity.</hi> And if it be true which the
Pamphleter telleth us, <hi>That the Biſhop
of London ordered the moſt Divines in that
City to be preſent at his interment;</hi> it is a
good Argument, that both the Biſhop,
and <hi>moſt eminent Divines of London,</hi> were
either inclinable to his opinions, or not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:114885:128"/>
ſo much averſe from them, as not to give
a ſolemn attendance at the time of
his Funeral.</p>
               <p>As for the Story of theſe Articles, as
layed down in the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerh
us it was never heard off, till the
year 1641. which ſheweth how little
he is verſed in his own concernments,
the ſame ſtory, let him call it
a Tale if he will, being publiſhed
in the <hi>Reſponſio neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Dom. 1615. which was 26 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and but the 20th year from the
meeting at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> And though the
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> man he ſpeaks of, whoſoever he
were, might be unborn at the time of
the making of the Articles, as he ſaith he
was, yet the Remonſtrants who publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the <hi>Reſponſio neceſſaria,</hi> muſt be
born before, and probably might have
the whole Story from <hi>Baro</hi> himſelf, with
whom they coreſponded in theſe points
of controverſie. <hi>Adeo abſurda argumenta
ineptos habent exitus,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath it.</p>
               <p>On what accompt theſe Articles were
made a part of the confeſſion of the
Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath been ſhewen
elſewhere, we muſt next come unto the
abrogating or repealing of them, for
ſaying which the Obſervator ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:114885:129"/>
although <hi>repealing</hi> be the word of
our Author himſelf in the firſt Edition,
Fol. 132. yet now he ſingeth a new
Song, and telleth us many things quite
different from the common opinion, and
from his own amongſt the reſt: aſſuring us,
that the <hi>Articles eſtabliſhed in the Church
of Ireland,</hi> Anno 1615. <hi>were never abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,</hi>
and proving it by a Certificate
under the hands of Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> and
one Mr. <hi>Pullein,</hi> (if he be not of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degree,) both of them convocation
men, and preſent at the concluſion of it,
Anno 1634. But this Certificate will
prove upon examination to conclude
nothing to the purpoſe. It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
both in the Certificate and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<q>That they did not only <hi>approve</hi>
(which might a been a ſufficient mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of their agreement with the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the confeſſion
of the ſame Chriſtian faith) but that
they alſo did receive the Book of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of religion, agreed upon by the
Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, and the
whole Clergy, in the whole convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
holden at <hi>London,</hi> Anno Dom.
1562.</q> Now the Receiving or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinducing
of a new confeſſion, will
prove equivalent in the Fact, and I think
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:114885:129"/>
in Law,) to the repealing of the old, for
otherwiſe there muſt be two confeſſions
in the ſame Church, differing in many
points from one another; Which would
have been ſo far from creating a unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of belief between the Churches, and
taking away thereby the matter of Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which was given the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in two
diſtinct (<hi>and in ſome points contrary</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
yet both pretending unto one
and the ſame Religion; that it would
rather have increaſed their Scorn, and
made a greater diſagreement in <hi>Ireland</hi> it
ſelf, than was before between the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of both Kingdomes. And this the
<hi>Certificate</hi> it ſelf doth ſeem to intimate. In
which we find, <q>That one of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
(ſome rigid <hi>Calvinist</hi> belike)
ſtood up, and deſired that the other
Book of Articles, (that is to ſay in the
year 1615) ſhould be be joyned
with it</q> which propoſition, being it
might have made ſome rub in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if it had been abſolutely denied, was
put off, by this cleanly and handſome
Temperament, that this <hi>would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
that Book having been already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ratified by the dcer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of the former
Synod.</hi> With this all parties ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and the Canon paſſed. So ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:114885:130"/>
may the weak Brethren be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
by more able heads. To
make this matter plainer to their
ſeverall capacities, I will look upon
the two Subſcribers, as upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and on the Pamphleter, our
Author, as a <hi>Man of law.</hi> Of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers
I would ask, whether Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> were out in the Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi>
when he proved the Abrogating of the
old Covenant by the ſuperinducing of
the new. <hi>Dicendo autem novum, vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit
prius, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, as our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> reads it, in <hi>that he ſaith, a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
he hath made the firſt old.</hi> Heb.
8. 13. and then it followeth, <hi>that that
which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to
vaniſh away,</hi> that is to ſay, the old
being diſanulled by the new, there muſt
neceſſarily follow the Aboliſhment of
its uſe and practice. Nor find they any
other <hi>Abrogation</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath,
than by the ſuper-inducing of the Lords
day, for the day of Worſhip; By means
whereof, the Sabbath was leſned in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and reputation by little and little,
&amp; in ſhort time, was abſolutely laid aſide
in the Church of Chriſt; the 4th Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
by which it was at firſt ordained,
being ſtil in force. So then, according to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:114885:130"/>
theſe grounds, the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi>
were <hi>virtually,</hi> though not <hi>formally Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogatad,</hi>
by the ſuper-inducing of the
Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
is as much as need be ſaid for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the two Subſcribers, taking
them in the capacity of Divines, as before
is ſaid. Now for my <hi>Man of law,</hi> I
would have him know, that the firſt
Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, was
confirmed in Parliament, with ſeverall
penalties to thoſe who ſhould refuſe to
officiate by it, or ſhould not diligently
reſort and repair unto it. 2, 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th
c. 1. But <q>becauſe divers doubts had
ariſen in the uſe and exerciſe of the ſaid
Book, (as is declared in the Statute of
5, 6. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. c. 1.) for the faſhion
and manner of the miniſtration of the
ſame, rather by the curioſity of the
Miniſters, and miſtakers, than of any
other worthy cauſe; therefore as
well for the more plain and manifeſt
explanation hereof, as for the more
perfection of the ſaid order of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſervice, in ſome places where it
is neceſſary to make the ſame prayer
and faſhion of Service more earneſt
and fit to ſtir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People to
the true honouring of Almighty God;

and by the authority of the ſame,
hath cauſed the foreſaid Order of
Common ſervice, entituled <hi>The Book
of Common Prayer,</hi> to be faithfully and
Godly peruſed, explaned, and made
fully perfect.</q> Which Book being thus
fitted and explaned, approved by the
King, and confirmed in the Parliament
in the 5, 6 years of his reign, was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
generally received into uſe and
practice, in all parts of the Kingdom,
the former <hi>Liturgy</hi> being no otherwiſe
ſuppreſſed and called in, than by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinducing
of this, the Statute upon
which it ſtood continuing <hi>un-repealed,</hi> in
full force and vertue, and many clauſes
of the ſame related to in the Statute
which confirmed the ſecond. But fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be cenſured by both parties, for
reading a Lecture of the wars to <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
I knock off again.</p>
               <p>Now, foraſmuch as the Obſervator is
concerned in this certificate, being ſaid,
<hi>to have abuſed the ſaid Convocation with
ſuch a groſſe miſtake, ſo manifeſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,</hi>
I would fain know in what that
<hi>groſſe miſtaking,</hi> and the <hi>manifeſt untruth</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:114885:131"/>
which theſe men ſpeak of is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
The Premiſes which uſher
in this concluſion are theſe, <hi>viz. But that
the leaſt motion was then or there made for
the ſuppreſſing of thoſe Articles of</hi> Ireland,
<hi>hath no truth at all in it:</hi> The Concluſion
this, therefore the Obſervator, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe hath, or doth averr, that the
ſaid Articles either were aboliſhed, or
any motion made for the ſuppreſſing or
aboliſhing of them, are groſly miſtaken,
<q>and have abuſed the ſaid Convocation
in delivering ſo manifeſt an untruth.</q> But
firſt the Obſervator ſpeaks not of any <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made there for the ſuppreſſing of thoſe
Articles.</hi> The Propoſition for <hi>approving</hi>
and <hi>receiving</hi> the Confeſſion of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> might be made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
(and ſo it ſeems it was) without
any ſuch motion: And therefore if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
ſtand accuſed in that particular,
the <hi>manifeſt untruth,</hi> and <hi>groſſe miſtake</hi>
which thoſe men dream of, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
upon themſelves. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide if he be charged with this <hi>groſſe
miſtake and man feſt untruth,</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, but that he ſaith, thoſe
Articles were aboliſhed, as they charge
it on him; they ſhould have firſt ſhewed
where he ſaith it, before they fell ſo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:114885:132"/>
rudely and uncivilly on a man they know
not: The Obſervator never ſaid it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant it, he underſtands himſelf too
well to ſpeak ſo improperly. The word
he uſed was abrogated, and not aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The firſt word intimating that thoſe
Articles were repealed, or diſannulled,
&amp; of no force in Law, whereas to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
ſignifieth to be defaced, or raced
out, that ſo the very memory of the
thing might periſh. The word abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(rightly and properly ſo taken) is
<hi>Terminus forenſis,</hi> or a term of Law, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
if they did impoſe a Law to be made by
the people, were ſaid <hi>Rogare Legem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of asking, moving, or perſwading
to enact the ſame, <hi>velitis Iubeatiſne Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
&amp;c. from whence came <hi>prorogare
Legem,</hi> to continue a Law which was
in being for a longer time, and <hi>abrogare</hi>
to repeal or abrogate it for the time to
come, unleſſe upon ſome further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
it were thought fit to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
But giving theſe men the benefit
and advantage of their own Expreſſion,
and let the two words <hi>Abrogated</hi> and
<hi>Aboliſhed</hi> ſignifie the ſame one thing;
where is their equity the while, for
charging that as a <hi>groſſe miſtake, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114885:132"/>
nntruth</hi> in the Obſervator, which
muſt be looked on only as a failing, or an
eaſie ſlip, <hi>within the incidence of frailty,</hi> as
we know who ſaid, in their friend our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
the Syſteme, the Body of Articles
formed by that Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615, were

<hi>had appeared moſt in it:</hi> The Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
anſwereth, <hi>that there was never any
Controverſie in that Synod, between the Lord
Primate and that Biſhop, concerning thoſe
Articles,</hi> Fol. 43. But tell me Gentle Sir,
might not the Biſhop of <hi>Derry</hi> be moſt
active in it, without a perſonal contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
betwixt him and the Primate, if ſo,
then was the Primate more engaged in
the quarrel, about receiving, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114885:133"/>
the Articles of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> than you would gladly ſeem to
have him; If otherwiſe, your Anſwer is
nothing to the purpoſe, nor confutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing affirmed by the Obſervator.
Some diſagreement he confeſſeth to have
been between them in that Synod, about
the Canons, not the Articles of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> but neither he nor
the Obſervator being preſent at it, they
muſt rely upon the credit of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
The Obſervator (as he telleth
me) had his intelligence from ſome of
the Biſhops of that Kingdom, men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and great worth, preſent at all
debates and conferences amongſt thoſe of
their own order, and ſo moſt like to give
a juſt account of all paſſages there. The
Pamphleter takes his (it ſeems) from
two members of the lower Houſe of
Convocation, who neither were bound
to tell more than they knew, nor to
know more than the advantages of the
place they ſerved in could communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to them. Which of the two <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi>
have, or ſhould have moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <hi>moving</hi> the <hi>Sphear</hi> of any common

               <p>The Pampheter is almoſt ſpent, and

for ſaying that this Convocation
was held in <hi>Ireland Anno</hi> 1633. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> whom he makes to be his
<hi>alter idem,</hi> hath placed it in his Hiſtory of
the Sabbath, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. It could not
then proceed from ignorance in the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,</hi>
you have cleared him very well
for that, and it will be very hard for you
to prove, that it proceeded from negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or from (your ordinary excuſe) a
<hi>lapſe</hi> of memory. Printers will fall into
ſuch errours do we what we can, though

The Pamphleter agreeth with the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,

with the differences between
the Liturgies. The words of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

no more favourable to Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
than thoſe which are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

they were diſſolved.</q> Doth the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter

Confeſſing, that though the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

all <q>where the light-fingered Obſervator

what the Lawyers ſent along with their
opinions;</q> viz. <hi>that they would adviſe

Fol. 35. For this we are to take his

no danger or inconvenience likely
to fall upon him, for giving evidence in

Not in the Paper I am ſure, there was no

ſure, by whom the paper was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:114885:136"/>
containing their opinions, with
their names ſubſcribed. The Lawyers
durſt not be ſo bold as to ſend him upon

his errant by the way, or betrayed the

And if by any body elſe, I muſt

if ſo, (and be it ſo this once) I doubt

ſaith, that <hi>never was any rule more

he only ſay it, but he proves it too. He
proves it firſt by the powers granted to
the Procurators or Clerks of the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
from the ſeveral and reſpective Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes
for which they ſerve; next by a

Againſt this the Pamphleter makes
theſe two Objections: The firſt drawn
from the moſt infallible judgement of the
Houſe of Commons, in which ſo <hi>many
wiſe and learned men</hi> had declared it ſo,
Fol. 39. To which there needs no other
Anſwer, but that many things paſſed in
that Houſe, rather to purſue their own
intereſt, and carry on the deſign which
they had in hand, than that they ſhould
be urged in ſuceeding times, as a Rule
to others. The next drawn from the
practice of Convocations, <hi>conſtantly
praying</hi> and <hi>deſiring their Grants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
may be confirmed and ratified by the
High Court of Parliament, Ibid.</hi> A practice
taken up in the latter times of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. when the cenſures of the
Church were grown invalid, and held on
in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6th. when
the authority of the Clergy was under
foot; and though continued afterwards
in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
the Kings ſucceeding, as the ſhorter and
moſt expedite way; yet not ſo binding,
but that they did and might proceed by
their own ſole power, as is apparent by
the Preſident in the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> The
Parliaments ratification, when deſired
by the Clergy, ſignifies <hi>all;</hi> but when
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:114885:138"/>
the Clergy have a mind to proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, then it ſignifieth <hi>nothing.</hi> This
ſaid, I ſhall <hi>ex abundantia</hi> let the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
know, that the Convocation had
in this particular, the advice of the Kings
Counſell learned in the Laws, who at firſt
were of opinion, that the Clergy could
not make this grant, but by way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
but when they had peruſed the
Inſtrument, and found that the Grant
paſſed not by the name of a Subſidie, but
of a <hi>Benevolence or extraordinary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
according to the preſident before
mentioned, they then changed their
minds, and gave their Counſell and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to go on accordingly. So
then, according to this <hi>Criticiſm</hi> of the
Councel learned, the <hi>Convocation</hi> may be
delivered of a <hi>Benevolence,</hi> without the
help and <hi>Midwifry</hi> of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but of a Subſidie it cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now the Impulſives to this grant
were not only the conſideration of
their duty owing to his Majeſtie, for
his conſtant defence of the Faith, and
protection of Chriſts holy Church, by
the maintenance of the happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. but alſo of thoſe great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
whereat he was then like to be,
as well for the honourable ſuſtentation
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:114885:138"/>
of his Royal Eſtate at home, and the
neceſſary defence of this his Realm, as
alſo for the effectual furtherance of his
Majeſties moſt Royal and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deſigns abroad.</q> This gives me ſome
occaſion to look toward the <hi>Scots,</hi> and
to conſider ſo far of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, as it lyeth before me
in my Author; of this <hi>Liturgy</hi> he telleth
us, how <hi>unhappily the King had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that it little differed from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi>
to which the Obſervator anſwered,
<hi>that the King needed no perſwaſion in this
point, The difference between the two Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
(whether great or little) being known
unto him before he cauſed that to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
the Pamphleter replyeth, <q>that
though the King was ſhewed the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Scotiſh Liturgy;</hi> yet might
he ſo apprehend or be perſwaded that
the differences were ſmall, and yet
might they be great for all that, and
perhaps not diſcovered by him.</q> But
<hi>might be</hi> and <hi>perhaps</hi> are but forry <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi>
on which to huild a Concluſion of
ſuch weight and conſequence. 1. For if
they <hi>might</hi> be great for all that, they
<hi>might</hi> for all that not be great, the one
as probable as the other; if <hi>perhaps</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by him, it is but a <hi>perhaps</hi> they
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:114885:139"/>
were not, and perhaps they were; So
that his argument concludeth nothing to
the contrary, but that <hi>the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Liturgies (whether great or
little)</hi> were (not only ſhewn, but) made
<hi>known unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obſervator noted next, <q>that
the alterations in the Liturgy being
made and ſhewed to the King, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
well of them; in regard that
comming nearer to the firſt <hi>Liturgy</hi> of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Lords Supper (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
being more agreeable to the
ancient Forms) it might be a means to
gain the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to the Church, who
liked far better of the firſt, than the
ſecond <hi>Liturgy.</hi> In this the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very cunningly (that I ſay no worſe)
leaves out theſe words, <hi>and conſequently
being more agreeable to the ancient
Forms</hi>
                  </q> faſtning the hopes of gaining
<hi>Papiſts</hi> to the Church, on the nearneſs of
the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Liturgie to the firſt of King
<hi>Edwards,</hi> without relating to the <hi>Forms</hi>
of more elder times, to which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
ſtand affected, Fol. 29. This
is no fair dealing by the way. But let
that paſs, he grants it is a matter <hi>beyond
diſpute, that the Papists liked the firſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:114885:139"/>
of</hi> King Edward, <hi>better than the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi>
Why ſo? Becauſe <hi>the words of
Distribution of the Elements are ſo framed,
as they may conſiſt with tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
Fol. 30. If that be all, the <hi>Papists</hi>
have as good reaſon to like the Liturgy of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> now by Law
eſtabliſhed, as they had or have to like
the firſt Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth,
The words of <hi>Distribution</hi> uſed in the
firſt <hi>Liturgy</hi> being ſtill retained in the
preſent, together with the words of
<hi>Participation (take and eat, take and drink,
&amp;c.</hi>) which only did occur in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Liturgy. No more conſiſtency with
tranſubſtantiation, in the words of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution</hi>
uſed in the firſt <hi>Liturgy</hi> of King
<hi>Edward,</hi> nor conſequently in that for
<hi>Scotland,</hi> than in that continued in the
firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But then
the Pamphleter ſubjoyns, that <hi>the gaining
of Papists to our Church, was indeed the
great pretended project of forty years conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
and yet in all that time not ſo much
as one taken with that Bait.</hi> In anſwer
unto which I deſire to know, where the
fault was, that for the ſpace of <hi>forty years</hi>
the <hi>intended project of gaining Papiſts to
the Church</hi> took no more effect. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
certainly was pious, and intended
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:114885:140"/>
really, and where the fault was we ſhall
hear from our Author himſelf, <q>the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
of late yeares (ſaith he) ſupinely,
either careleſs or indulgent, had not
required within their Dioceſes, that
ſtrict obedience to Eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
which the Law expected, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Liturgy began to be totally
laid aſide, and inconformity the
uniform practice of the Church.</q> Hiſt.
Fol. 137. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> loving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and order in Gods publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
will not be taken with the hatefull
<hi>Bait</hi> of <hi>Inconformity,</hi> and <hi>forty years</hi> of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
conformity will be hardly found,
in which we might have gained upon
them. Had Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi>
and the intended <hi>Project</hi> been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
without interruption, there is
little queſtion to be made, but that our
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (by this time) might have
been a <hi>City at unity in it ſelf.</hi> Beſides,
the Pamphleter might have obſerved, had
he been ſo minded, that the <hi>Obſervator</hi>
ſpeaks theſe words of <hi>gaining Papiſts to
the Church,</hi> as a thing hoped for by the
King, of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Liturgy, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which it had to the firſt of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
which they liked better than the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
If the pamphleter can prevail ſo far
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:114885:140"/>
with my <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> as to ſettle the
<hi>Scotiſh Liturgy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the firſt
of King <hi>Edward</hi> in this Kingdom, we
may in leſſe than forty years give him a
better accompt of the <hi>Papiſts gained unto
the Church,</hi> than can be made (for the
reaſons above mentioned) for the like
ſpace of time now paſt. If any <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
have been loſt</hi> hereby, as here is
affirmed, when he hath told me who,
and how many they are, he ſhall find me
very ready to <hi>grieve</hi> with him for it. In
the mean time I ſhall grieve for him who
ſo vainly ſpeaks it.</p>
               <p>We have one only thing to adde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to this Convocation, the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi>
ſaying, <hi>that he had ſome reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Clergy of that Convocation
did not appear in the Parliament by their
Councel learned, ſufficiently authorized and
instructed to advocate for them.</hi> To this
the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> replyeth by halves, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that he will not determine</hi> ('tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot) <hi>how the Councel</hi> for the
Clergy <hi>were inſtructed</hi> by them; but
withall confidently averring, <hi>that by their
Councell they did appear, first by Mr.
Chadwell</hi> of Lincolns Inne, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26.
<hi>then again by Mr. Holburn, the 15 day of
Decemb. who argued two hours in defence
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:114885:141"/>
of them,</hi> Fol. 40. That theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>appeared</hi> in this buſineſſe for the
Clergy, I ſhall eaſily grant, that is to
ſay, that they <hi>appeared</hi> in it, out of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
piety, and an honeſt zeal to doe
them the beſt offices they could in their
great extremities. If the Pampleter mean
no otherwiſe than thus, he ſhall take me
with him; But there he takes the
word equivocally, and not according to
the legal acception of it, and there can
be no legal <hi>appearance,</hi> but by men <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized</hi>
and <hi>inſtructed</hi> by the parties whom
it doth concern, and that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were ſo, the Pamphleter can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay, nor will <hi>determine.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the Members of that Convocation
had been ſo ill-adviſed as to ſubmit their
perſons, Cauſe, and Juriſdiction, which
I am very well aſſured they did not, and
would never doe, to the Iudgement of
the Houſe of Commons, it had been
more proper for them to have made this
appearance by his Majeſties Attourney
and Solliciter, and others of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
learned; the Kings intereſſe and
theirs, being ſo complicated and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as the caſe then ſtood, that the
one could not fall without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:114885:141"/>
Being thus entered on this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will look back to thoſe before,
and take them in their courſe and order.
And the firſt thing we meet with, is an
<hi>ancient Order,</hi> ſaid in the Hiſtory to be
<hi>found by the Lords,</hi> (that is to ſay, the
Lords which were of the popular party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Duke) <hi>that no Lords created</hi>
ſedente Parliamento <hi>ſhould have voice du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Seſſion, &amp;c. whereupon their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
was excluded.</hi> The vanity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
of which Report, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Obſervator by theſe two
Arguments; Firſt, that the Lords <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
Littleton, Capel,</hi> &amp;c. created <hi>ſedente
Parliamento, Anno</hi> 1640. were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their ſuffrages, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
though in a time when a ſtrong
party was preparing againſt the King.
And 2ly. That when a Propoſition of this
nature was made unto the King at <hi>York,</hi>
he denied it abſolutely, though then in
ſuch a low condition, that it was hardly
ſafe for him to deny them any thing which
they could reaſonably deſire, which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
the Pamphleter not being able
to anſwer, requireth <hi>a Demonſtration of
his. Errous from the Records themſeves,</hi> or
otherwiſe no <hi>recantation</hi> to be looked for
from him, Fol. 10. Whereas indeed it
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:114885:142"/>
doth belong unto our Author, according
to the ordinary rules of Diſputation, both
to produce a Copy of that <hi>ancient Order,</hi>
and to make proof out of the Journals of
that Houſe, that the <hi>new Lords</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from their ſuffrage accordingly:
And this ſince he hath failed to doe, the
<hi>Obſervators</hi> Arguments remain un-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
and the pretended Order muſt
be thought no Order, or of no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>In the buſineſſe of the <hi>Levy</hi> made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Subject, <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. there is
little difference, the <hi>Obſervator</hi> calling
it a <hi>Loan,</hi> becauſe required under that
name, in relation to the Subſidies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and paſſed by the Commons in
the former Parliament, our Author cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it <hi>a Tax, as being a compulſory tribute,
impoſed upon the Subject at a certain rate,</hi>
and ſuch is this affirmed to be in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, Fol. 10.</p>
               <p>And this is no great difference, nor
much worth our trouble; Only the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
is miſtaken, in making this <hi>Loan</hi>
or <hi>Tax</hi> to be impoſed upon the Subject
at a certain rate; Whereas the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
(if I remember it aright) impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not any <hi>certain rate</hi> upon the Subject;
but ſcrued them up as high as they could,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:114885:142"/>
with reference to their Abilities in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and Charge of Familie.</p>
               <p>Our Author calling the Members of
the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1627.
not only <hi>Petty Lords and Maſters,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Petty Kings;</hi> and finding that the
<hi>Obſervator marvelled</hi> at this ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
fitſt puts it off upon King <hi>James,
who having ſaid the like before</hi> (but rather
in the way of Jear than otherwiſe) he
thinks it <hi>no great marvell that a poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſhould uſe the ſame expreſſion alſo,</hi> Fol.
11. The difference is, that the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
ſpeaks that in earneſt, which the
King (moſt probably) ſpoke in Jeſt; and
proves it by the power which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
aſſumed unto themſelves in the late
long Parliament, of whom he telleth us,
that they <hi>were not Petty Lords, but Lords
Paramount; not Petty Kings, but Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
to Kings themſelves,</hi> Ibid. Tis true, he
hath a kind of Plaiſter to ſalve this ſore
(for he would willingly write nothing
but <hi>ſaving truths</hi>) advertiſing that the
<hi>Expreſſion</hi> above mentioned, doth <hi>not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
what theſe Gentlemen were</hi> de jure, <hi>but
what</hi> de facto, <hi>and what in reputation;</hi> but
then withall he leaves it ſtanding in the
Text, as a plain Poſition, to ſerve as a
Preſident to the Commons of arrogating
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:114885:143"/>
the like powers unto themſelves in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Parliaments. And in this he
may be thought the rather to have ſome
deſign, becauſe he makes no Anſwer to
that part of the <hi>Obſervation,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
out of the very <hi>Writs of Summons,</hi>
that they <hi>are called only to conſent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch reſolutions and Concluſions, as
ſhould be then and there agreed on by the
Kings great Councill, or the great Council
of the Kingdom;</hi> that is to ſay, the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, aſſiſted by the
Reverend Judges, and others learned in
the Laws.</p>
               <p>To make this poſition the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
our Author telleth us, that the Houſe
of Commons <hi>was then able to buy the Houſe
of Peers, though 118, thrice over,</hi> that is to
ſay, although there were 354 Lords in
the <hi>Houſe of Peers.</hi> For this being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to an accompt by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> in
regard of the low value which was put
upon the Peerage by it, he thus proceeds
to make it good, valuing the eſtates of
each L. in the Houſe of Peers ato more
than 3000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the Houſe of Commons at no leſſe
than <hi>2124l. per annum,</hi> one with another.
Whereas, unleſſe he make the Baronage of
<hi>England</hi> to be very deſpicable, there were
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:114885:143"/>
but few whoſe eſtates could be valued at
ſo mean a rate, as on the other ſide there
were not very many members in the
Houſe of Commons whoſe Eſtates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the proportion which he puts
upon them, ſome of them being of mean
eſtates, and ſome of very little or none
at all. But give him leave to ſet the
members of each Houſe at what rate he
pleaſeth, then he may as well enable
the Houſe of Commons to buy the
Houſe of peers ten times over, as to buy
it <hi>thrice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obſervator having entred into a
a Conſideration, why the Biſhops or
<hi>ſpiritual Lords ſhould be left out</hi> by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<hi>in this valuation, as if they were no
members of the Houſe of Peers,</hi> is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>that if the Biſhops were members of the
Houſe of Peers, then theſe words of his were
turn-key enough to let them in; if the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
ſay not, their excluſion is his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture?</hi>
Fol. 12. Well applyed <hi>John
Ellis,</hi> and poſſibly intelligible enough
in a place of manufactures, but nothing
proper to the true meaniug of the word
in the vulgar <hi>Idiome.</hi> But let us take
his meaning whatſoever it be, and in
what Country Dialect ſoever, we may
<hi>trade</hi> the word; and yet all will not ſerve
the turn to ſave our Author from the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:114885:144"/>
purpoſe of excluding the Biſhops from
the <hi>valuation,</hi> and conſequently from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
members of the Houſe of Peers;
my reaſon is, becauſe it is affirmed by the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> that <hi>there were at that time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an hundred and eighteen Temporall
Lords, in the Upper Houſe,</hi> and therefore
that the Biſhops were not reckoned in
the <hi>calculation.</hi> This is ſo plain, that the
Pamphleters <hi>turn-key</hi> will not ſerve to
<hi>let them in;</hi> and I have reaſon to believe
that he had as great a mind as any to
thruſt them out: it being one of his <hi>poſitions</hi>
in the ſheets unpubliſhed, that the Root
of <hi>Epiſcopacie had not ſap enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſo ſpreading and ſo proud a top as was
contended for,</hi> Fol. 185. Whether the
King did well or not, in paſſing a way the
Biſhops Votes, in the late long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hath been conſidered of already,
and therefore we ſhall need to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here as to that particular.</p>
               <p>No Parliament after this, till thoſe of
the year 1640. Where the firſt thing
that offers it ſelf, is the ſtating of the true
time of the charge brought in againſt
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his
Commitment thereupon. The Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
following the accompt of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
Diary, abbreviated and publiſhed by
Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Anno 1644. doth ſtate it thus,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:114885:144"/>
viz. <q>That on Wedneſday the 16th
day of <hi>December,</hi> a Committy was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to draw up a charge againſt
him; that on the ſame day he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an Incendiary by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
who promiſed to bring in
their Complaint on the morrow after,
and that on Friday morning, December
18. Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> was ſent up with the
impeachment, and preſently came in the
charge of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners</q>
The pamphleter tells us from the Journals
(if we may believe them,) <hi>that on Thurſday</hi>
December 17. <hi>there was a conference
between the two Houſes, at which time the
Lord</hi> Paget <hi>read the</hi> Scotch <hi>charge againſt
the</hi> Archbiſhop, <hi>in which charge he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an Incendiarie,</hi> Fol. 40. A man would
think that the Arch-Biſhops own Diary
written with his own hand, and in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which ſo nearly concerned his life,
ſhould find as much credit in the world,
as any thing which the Pamphleter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to have found in the Journals, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
conſidering how eaſie a thing it
was (as was proved before) to abuſe his
credulity, and make him pay for falſe
Copies as if true and perfect. We found
him in the ſnare before, when he was fain
to rouſe up Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> Ghoſt, to help
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:114885:145"/>
him out of it; and now there is do remedy
(for ought that I can ſee) but to conjure
up the ſilly ſhaddow of <hi>Iohn Brown,</hi> that
famous <hi>Clericus Parliamentorum</hi> (as he
ſtiled himſelf) to give him a caſt of his
old Office in the preſent plunge. And
yet upon theſe ſorry grounds he builds
his triumph, and doth not only reckon
this among the <hi>Obſervators</hi> miſtakes, Fol.
45. but tells him, that in <hi>this particular,
he is as arrant an Errant as ever was,</hi> Fol.
39. If he muſt needs be an <hi>Errant</hi> as you
pleaſe to make him, you will allow him
to be a <hi>Knight Errant</hi> at the leaſt, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
of that, and then none fitter than
our Author to be made his Squire; 'tis
pitty that ſuch a <hi>Don Quixot</hi> ſhould not
have his <hi>Sancho,</hi> eſpecially conſidering
how eaſily he may fit him, with ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fland,
or other of the <hi>Terra incognita,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Vice</hi> may ſpend his wit, and
abuſe his authority.</p>
               <p>Our Author telleth us, that the
Biſhops, <hi>upon conſideration</hi> of ſome <hi>antient
Canons forbidding them to be aſſistant in
cauſes of blood or death, abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
at the tryal of the Earl of <hi>Strafford:</hi>
in which he more miſtakes the matter
than I thought he did, or the <hi>Obſervator</hi>
hath obſerved. For whereas he conceivs
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:114885:145"/>
the Biſhops to <hi>abſent themſelves,</hi> as if
they did it by their own voluntary act,
of their own accord, in reference to ſome
antient Canons: Certain it is, that they
were purpoſely excluded by the Votes of
both Houſes, from taking Examinations,
and hearing the Depoſitions of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the courſe of that buſineſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the former practice, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
rights, long time before this Cauſe
was btought to a publike tryal; and that
not in relation to any ſuch Canons, but
for fear they might diſcover ſome
of thoſe ſecret practices which were
to be contrived and hatched againſt him.
Againſt which Preparations to a finall
tryal, <hi>or taking the Examinations, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Depoſitions of Witneſſes, or giving
counſell in ſuch Caſes as they ſaw occaſion;</hi>
the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> ſaith nothing to
their diſadvantage; and therefore is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
here by the Pamphleter, to no end
at all, but only for the oſtentation of
his mighty reading. The Canon is, <hi>Si
quis Sacerdotum diſcurſor in altenis pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
extiter it apud Eccleſiam proprium perdat
gradum,</hi> that is to ſay (in our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
very words) <hi>If any Priest ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeadle
in caſes endangering the life of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
let him be degraded,</hi> Fol. 40, 41.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:114885:146"/>
Hereupon I conclude againſt him, that
the Biſhops were to be admitted to all
preparatory examinations in the preſent
buſineſſe, becauſe their Counſell and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
would have tended rather to the
preſervation, than conduced to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
of the parties life.</p>
               <p>Our Author being told by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
that the paper which contained
the names of the Straffordians, was not
paſted on the Gates of <hi>VVeſtminster,</hi> but
on the corner of the wall of Sir <hi>VVilliam
Brunkards</hi> Houſe, makes anſwer, that the
Reports were various, concerning this
paper, that ſome of them agreed with
the <hi>Obſervator;</hi> and finally that for his
part, he had faſtned upon another place;
not undertaking to warrant the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but the thing, Fol. 41. A very
<hi>ſaving</hi> Declaration, and of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
of which if our Author had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
himſelf when he made his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
it would have ſerved his turn bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and with leſs exceptions than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
himſelf ſo confidently from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
falſhoods, and as he hopes, (I
muſt be ſure not to leave out that) <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall</hi>
alſo. <hi>Not undertaking to

What a brave medicine have we here,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:114885:146"/>
a Panpharmacon fitted for all diſeaſes in
his <hi>Temporalities,</hi> and <hi>Localties</hi> too.
He may now confidently go on, in miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
not only daies but years, in his <hi>Super-ſemi-annuating,
Super-annuating, Subter-trienniating,</hi>
and <hi>Subter-ſexenniating</hi> (for I
muſt <hi>cant</hi> to him in his own Language)
without all controul. He doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to warrant the <hi>circumstance,</hi>
but the <hi>thing.</hi> He may miſplace battels,
feaſts, and entertainments, with equal
privilege. It is but a matter of <hi>Locality,</hi> and
mere point of <hi>circumſtance,</hi> and tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
his <hi>undertakings</hi> extend only to
warrant the <hi>things</hi> themſelves, and not
the <hi>circumſtances.</hi> How eaſily might the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> have excuſed the Errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the firſt <hi>Trennium</hi> of <hi>P. Baro,</hi> could
he have gotten but a lick on my Authors
<hi>Gallipot,</hi> and helped himſelf with the
ſame medicine, when his need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>preſervative,</hi> our Author keeps
only to himſelf, not having ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as to allow any part of it to the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> ſhould he miſtake only in a
day. He makes it one of his miſtakes in
the generall Catalogne, Fol. 45. that he
had erred concerning the <hi>proteſtation,</hi>
that is to ſay, for ſaying the <hi>protestation
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114885:147"/>
was taken the very ſame day in which it was
framed, before the Members were permitted
to go out of the Houſe.</hi> Whereas ſaith he,
<q>the <hi>Protestation</hi> was debated on the 3
day of <hi>May,</hi> the ordering and framing
thereof kept the Houſe all that day, till
late at night. So the Journals of that

Reading, and taking thereof the next

Theſe Journals are an other of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

to be only falſe and imperfect Copies, as
hath appeared by our inquiry into ſome
of thoſe which before were cited. But
ſay his Copies what they will, the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi>
ſhall not vary from what he ſaid,
nor ſave himſelf by declaring his <hi>underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,</hi>

without further proceſſe or delay, before
they came out ſubſcribed by the whole Houſe,
except the Lord</hi> Digby, <hi>and an Unkle or

not as a Countercheck to the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>If no conſideration could be had of the

only, had it hapned, ſo he is not to expect
it in offences of a higher nature, wherein

and out of Charity beyond all Religion,</hi>
Fol. 41. charged thus in general, the
Pampheter ſets upon him with 5 particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
relating to the conference between
the King and the Biſhops in the buſineſſe
of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that is to ſay:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:114885:148"/>
1. Theſe Biſhops were not ſent by the
Parliament to the King, but ſent for by
him. 2ly. They were five, not four. 3ly.
If any of them depended upon the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the others, it was the Biſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> who at the laſt meeting and
conſultation ſpake not one Syllable. 4ly.
The Lord Primate had no ſharp
tooth againſt the Lieutenant. And 5ly.
The Convocation of <hi>Ireland</hi> was not
1633. as the Obſervator placeth it. To
the laſt of theſe we have already anſwer'd
in the former Chapter, to the three firſt
there are no proofs offered, but his <hi>ipſe

without more adoe, but being <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially</hi>

to that which had been ſaid by
the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> I will examine them one
by one as they lie before me.</p>
               <p>And firſt he ſaith, that <hi>theſe Biſhops
were not ſent by the Parliament to the King,
but ſent for by him,</hi> Fol. 41. And for this
we have his own word, worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
witneſſes, without further proof.
But firſt I remember very well, that on
<hi>Saturday</hi> the 8th. of <hi>May,</hi> as ſoon
as the Houſe of Peers was riſen, I
was told of the deſignation of the
four Biſhops, that is to ſay, the Lord
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:114885:148"/>
Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Carl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

day unto the King, to ſatisfie and inform
his conſcience in the <hi>Bill of Attainder.</hi>
2ly. The King had before declared, the
ſatisfaction which he had in his own
conſcience, publickly, in the Houſe of
Peers, on good and ſerious deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore needed not to ſend
for theſe Biſhops, or any of them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it now. 3ly. If any doubt were
ſtirred in him after that Declaration, it
is not probable that he would ſend for
ſuch men to adviſe him in it, in ſome of
which he could place no confidence in
point of judgement, and was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well anured in the diſaffections of the
other. For (not to inſtance any thing in
the other two can any man of wiſdome
think, that the King, out of ſo many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
as were then in <hi>London,</hi> would put
his conſcience into the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> a man ſo many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated

or that, he would confide any thing in

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:114885:149"/>
ſo much want, ſo many weakneſſes, that
nothing but the <hi>Lawen Sleeves</hi> could make
him venerable and, ſo moſt like to be the
man whoſe <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> the King faulted for
having four tearms in it, of which the
Pamphlet tells us, Fol. 42. None but a
man of ſuch credulity as onr Authors is,
can give faith to this, and I muſt have
ſome further proof, than his <hi>Ipſe
dixit,</hi> before I yield my aſſent unto
it.</p>
               <p>He ſaith next, they were <hi>five, not four,</hi>
Fol. 42. And <hi>five</hi> there were indeed,
I muſt needs grant that, but <hi>neither ſent to
him, or ſent for by him.</hi> For the truth is,
that the King hearing of the Deſignation
of the other four, ſent for the fifth,
the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to come to him in
the morning betimes, with whom he had
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Chap. 2. that Biſhop <hi>counſelling</hi> him,
<hi>not to conſent againſt the vote of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
as is there affirmed. So we have
here five Biſhops, in all, that is to ſay,
four ſent to him by the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the fifth ſent for by the King;
ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld to have failed in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, if <hi>any of them depended on
the judgment of the others, it was the Biſhop
of</hi> London, Ibid. whether with greater
injury to that Biſhop, to have his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus pinned on another mans
Sleeve, or to the King in chooſing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
a Counſeller to inform his conſcience,
It is hard to ſay. Our Author in the firſt
Edition had told us of him, that he was
<hi>none of the beſt Scholars;</hi> and the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
brings this argument now in full
proof thereof. But how is this dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
proved? Becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>at the laſt
meeting and conſultation he ſpake not one
ſyllable.</hi> A moſt excellent argument. <hi>He
ſpake not a ſyllable at the laſt meeting; Ergo,
he ſpake</hi> nothing in the firſt. For if it be
granred, that he declared himſelf in the
firſt conference, though not in the laſt,
it is enough, accotding to our Authors
<hi>Logick,</hi> to ſave himſelf from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>depending</hi> on another man. Or
thus, admitting it for true, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſpoke nothing in the firſt confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
neither, the argument will be as
faulty as it was before. The Biſhop of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:114885:150"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> ſpoke nothing, not one <hi>ſyllable,</hi>
during the whole time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> which is in <hi>Engliſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
he <hi>depended on the Judgment of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
four.</hi> For if he ſpake nothing all
the while, how can the Pamphleter
aſſure us, what his judgment was, or
upon whom it did depend? But the
truth is, that wiſe Prelate, knew the
temper of thoſe preſent times, and how
unſafe it would be for him to declare
himſelf againſt the Senſe of the Houſes,
and therefore having declared his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the morning privately, and
thereby given the King the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before mentioned, he rather choſe
to hear what the other ſaid, than to ſay
any thing himſelf.</p>
               <p>Whether the Lord <hi>Primate had</hi> any
<hi>ſharp tooth againſt the Lord Lieutenant</hi> or
not, I diſpute not now, the parties
being both dead, and the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
buried in the ſame Grave with
them, which for my part I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
revive. But as to the occaſion of
them (whatſoever they were) in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the firſt Articles of the Church of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Debates between the
Lord Primate and the Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> I
have already vindicated the <hi>Obſervator</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:114885:150"/>
in the former Chapter. The reſt which
doth remain in this redious nothing,
which taketh up ſo great a part of rhe
Pamphlet, conſiſteth of ſome offers of
proof, that there was a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dearneſſe between the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and the Lord Primate (by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
no ſharp tooth, no grudge upon
either fide) a thing (ſaith he) ſo likely,
that it is almoſt Demonſtrable. And
firſt (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> Lieutenant <hi>did from
time to time adviſe with the</hi> Primate <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Anſwer to his change,</hi> Fol. 42.
A thing ſo far from being <hi>almost Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable,</hi>
that it is not likely. For let me
ask (for I hope it will be no <hi>abuſing of
your patience,</hi> my moſt eloquent <hi>Cicero,</hi> to
ask one queſtion) whether he adviſed
with the Primate in point of <hi>matter,</hi> or
of <hi>form,</hi> in framing his <hi>anſwer to the
charge.</hi> I know you do not think the
Primate ſo great a Lawyer as to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
and adviſed with, for putting the
Anſwer into <hi>Form.</hi> The Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
being furniſhed with more <hi>learned
Counſell</hi> as to that particular. And I
think alſo that you know, how able the
Lord Lieutenant was, how well ſtudied
in his own affairs, how well provided of
all advantages, in Order to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:114885:151"/>
tryal, and conſequently how unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
the Lord Primate muſt needs be to
him, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of his Anſwer.
And whereas it is ſecondly ſaid, <hi>that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſentence he deſired and obtained of the
Parliament, that the Primate might be ſent
to him, to ſerve him with his ministerial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in his laſt and fatal extremity,</hi> Fol. 43.
There was good reaſon for this too,
though it make nothing at all to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
purpoſe. For firſt the Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
were engaged in a dayly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
both in Parliament and Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
not to be taken off (had he deſired
it) upon his concernments, eſpecially
conſidering, that the Lieutenant had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Lord Primates company, not only
from the time of his ſentence (as the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter
ſaith) but from the very time
that the Bill of Attainder was formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. And 2ly. had he made it his
requeſt to have ſome or any one of the
Engliſh Biſhops to aſſiſt him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
with him in that laſt neceſſity, It is
moſt probable, the Fears and Jelouſies of
the time conſidered, that the ſute had
abſolutely been rejected. As for his <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand, and leading him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him to the Scaffold,</hi> there wanted
not very good reaſons to induce him to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:114885:151"/>
it. 1. To declare to all the world the
reality and ſincerity of their Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the utter abolition of all former dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
And 2ly. That the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Piety of his laſt Deportment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from the mouth of one, who was
known to be none of his greateſt friends,
might find the greater credit amongſt his
Enemies. I ſee my man of Law is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Advocate, though he may be good
for Chamber-Councel; for never was
good cauſe more betrayed, nor ill worſe
managed.</p>
               <p>Having thus done with the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as to this particular, I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to my next and laſt Chapter; but
that I muſt needs meet with Doctor <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
whom I left but now upon that
promiſe. Not thinking he had Edified
ſufficiently by the general Doctrine of
the Certificate, without a particular
application, he makes a uſe of Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Reproof to the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and
fearing that might not be enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the man (for it appeareth not, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e aimed at his Converſion) he muſt
needs have a fling at him in his Sermon
preached at the Lord Primates Funeral;
in which he had ſome words, to this, or
the like effect, as I am credibly informed,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:114885:152"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>There is one thing which I cannot
forbear (and am wiſhed by others alſo
to it) and that is to vindicate him from
the unjuſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>perſions of a late <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
as though he had adviſed the King to
ſign the Bill for the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi>
death, and afforded ſome diſtinction
between his <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſonal</hi> and <hi>politique</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
A matter altogether falſe, as
the Lord Primate himſelf had declared
in his life time, adding, that there was
ſomething in the Preſſes to juſtifie him
againſt that preſumptuous <hi>Obſervator.</hi>
                  </q>
This is the ſubſtance of the charge, in
the delivery whereof I think the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
might have made a better <hi>Panegyrick,</hi>
had he been quite ſilent, and not awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe inquiries, which are ſo little
advantagious to the memory of that
learned Prelate. Howſoever, if his zeal
had not eaten up his underſtanding, he
ſhould have gone upon good grounds,
and not have charged that on the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi>
which he finds not in him.
Where finds he in the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that
the <hi>Lord Primate adviſed the King to ſign
the Bill for the Earl of</hi> Straffords <hi>death?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
I dare be bold to ſay it, and if
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> can find no body elſe upon whom to
Father it, the Calumny (if ſuch it were)
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:114885:152"/>
muſt reſt at his own dores as the Broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it. The <hi>Obſervator</hi> only ſaith, that he
was one of thoſe four Biſhops ſent to the
King by the Parliament <hi>to inform his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and bring him to yeeld unto the Bill.</hi>
That the Primate had couceived a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt him, <hi>for abrogating of the
Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed in the
Church of Ireland,</hi> Anno, 1615. <hi>and
that the Kings conſcience was not like to
be well informed, when men ſo intereſſed
were deſigned unto the managing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of it.</hi> All this might be, and
yet for all this it might not be, that the
<hi>Lord Primate adviſed the King to ſign the
Bill.</hi> So that in brief, the Preacher firſt
raiſed this Calmny againſt the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
and then Calumniates the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi>
to make it good, <hi>audacter ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare
neceſſe eſt ut aliquid haereat,</hi>
charge but the <hi>Obſervator</hi> home, the
<hi>preſumptuous Obſervator</hi> (ſo the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
called him) and that will be ſufficient
proof to make good the Calumny.
Leſſe reaſon is there in the next, the
ſecond part of the charge, though none
in this, there being no ſuch thing in
the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> as the <hi>diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Kings perſonal and politique
Conſcience;</hi> The Preacher muſt look
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:114885:153"/>
for that elſewhere, if he mean to find it.
The <hi>Preſumptuous Obſertator</hi> was not ſo
preſumptuous as to write things which
till that time he never heard of, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
had never heard of them at all, if as
well he as others had not been awakened
by the Preacher to a further ſearch. And
now upon a further ſearch, I can tell the
Preacher where he may eaſily ſatisfie
himſelf, if his ſtomack ſerve him. Let
him but rake a <hi>Walk</hi> in the ſecond part of
<hi>Dodonas Grove,</hi> he ſhall find it there.
And if not ſatisfied with that, I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him to ſome perſons of worth and
honour, from whom he may inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more fully in all particulars. But as
it had been better for him had he not
ſtartled this inquiry in a publique audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for which he could not find juſt
grounds in the Obſervations; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that he will do that reverend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and himſelf ſome right, if he ſuffer
it to die with the party moſt concerned
in it, without reviving it again by his

giving us a full Copy of the Dukes

charge againſt that Earl, which before
we had not. Now I would fain learn of
him, whether this cenſure thus expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
were true, or falſe, whether it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſo in his own <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or in the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of others. If if be falſe, why was it
put in the firſt; if true, why is it left o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
in the ſecond. If ſo they ſeemed in his
own <hi>ſenſe,</hi> why doth he not declare
how, and by whom his <hi>ſenſe</hi> was altered
in that point? but if it were the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
others, I would know the reaſon why
he ſhould ſuppreſſe it in this place,
where it relates only to a private perſon,
and ſtand unto it in all points concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Epiſcopacie, the Clergy, and the
Convocation, which ſtill ſtand under the
ſame tearms of reproach &amp; obloquy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did, How ſo? becauſe ſaith he, he
ſpeaks the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of others and not his own,
and paſſing as the words of others, they
ſhall remain in evidence to ſucceding
times, againſt all thoſe concerned in it,
though it be proved how much they are
calumniated and abuſed in thoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
paſſages. Yet deals he better with
theſe great perſons, than he doth with
Mr. Attorney <hi>Noye;</hi> whom (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the vindication of him,
by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> which he is not able
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:114885:155"/>
to refute,) he leaves ſtill under the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>prating</hi> and <hi>bawling,</hi> giving him
the odious Title of a <hi>Projector,</hi> a
ſubtile <hi>Enginier,</hi> a man of <hi>cinicall Ruſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
with others of like nature, unworthy
appellations for ſo brave a man. <hi>But kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
goeth by favour,</hi> as the ſaying is, and
our Author loves to write (none more)
with <hi>reſpect of perſons,</hi> and to make Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
do the drugery of his own deſpight,
though his Preface (if it could) would
perſwade the contrary. The next thing
which occurs, but not ſo eaſily redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to any of the former heads relates
to the ſttory of that horrible Paricide, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by <hi>John Felton,</hi> on the perſon of the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Concerning which our
Author had told us in his Hiſtory, that the
ſaid <hi>Felton had ſtiched a paper in his hat,
wherin he declared his only motive to the fact
was, the late Remonſtrance of the Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Duke, &amp; that he could not ſacrifice
his life in a nobler cauſe, than by delivering
his Country from ſo great an enemy.</hi> To
which the <hi>Obſervator</hi> anſwereth, firſt in
the way of poſition, not that there were
no papers found ſtitched in his Hat, as the
Pamphleter faſly charged on him, Fol.
45. but that there were <hi>no ſuch papers
foundin his hat or elſewhere about him,</hi> as
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114885:156"/>
the Hiſtorian mentions, And 2ly. In
the way of explication, that the firſt to
whom that particular motive was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
was one Dr. <hi>Hutchenſon,</hi> ſent
by the King (upon the firſt hearing of
the News,) to ſift it out of him. Againſt
this laſt the Pamphleter hath nothing
to ſay. For taking it upon his word,
(which we need not do) that Captain
<hi>Harvey</hi> ſignified as much, in his Letter
dated the ſame day, Fol. 13. yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not in my <hi>Logick,</hi> nor in no mans
elſe (but his that thinks himſelf an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed)
that that vile Murtherer did
firſt communicate it unto him, before
the Doctor by working on his conſcience
had firſt got it out of him. But this is
like the reſt of our Authors Arguments,
viz. Captain <hi>Harvy,</hi> being one of thoſe
to whoſe cuſtody he was committed,
did ſignifie it on the ſame day to his
friends at <hi>London, Ergo</hi> it was not firſt
confeſſed to Doctor <hi>Hutchenſon.</hi> But
Captain <hi>Harveys</hi> Letter ſaith more than
this. <hi>Felton</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>told me he was to
be prayed for next day in London,</hi> therefore
(for one of theſe Concluſions muſt needs
follow on it) either <hi>Felton</hi> had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to him, that the late <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi>
did induce him to kill the Duke;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:114885:156"/>
or that it was affirmed to be ſo, in the
<hi>papers which were stitched in his hat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the matter of thoſe <hi>papers;</hi>
That which they are produced for, is to
prove this point, namely, that his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>motive to the Fact, was the</hi> late Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
<hi>of the Commons againſt the Duke.</hi>
And if they prove not this, as I think
they doe not, they prove nothing againſt
the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> nor to the purpoſe of our
Author. Now the firſt paper had theſe
words, as the Pamphleter telleth us, <hi>viz.
I would have no man commend me for doing
it, but rather diſcommend themſelves: for if
God had not taken away their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s for their
ſins, he had not gone ſo long unpuniſhed.</hi>
The ſecond Paper had theſe words, <hi>viz.
The man is cowardly baſe in mine opinion,
and deſerves neither the fame of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or Souldier, that is unwilling to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his life, for the honour of God, his King,
and Country.</hi> To both theſe he ſubſcribes
his name, and Copies of both theſe were
ſent the ſame day by Captain <hi>Harvy</hi> to his
friends in <hi>London,</hi> but neither of them do
declare, that his <hi>only motive to the fact,
was the</hi> late Remonſtrance of <hi>the Commons
againſt the Duke.</hi> The man might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſet on, and his diſcontents made
uſe of to this barbarous murder, by ſome
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:114885:157"/>
of thoſe who wiſhed well to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
(I deny not that) and it may
be believed the rather, becauſe the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the wretch being cut in braſſe,
and expoſed to ſale, were caught up gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
by that party, and being the Copies
of theſe Letters were printed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it, it is more probable that our
Author might have them thence, than
from the Letters of the Captain; but that
he was induced to it by the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi>
is more than any man of common ſenſe
can collect from thoſe papers; and
therefore very ill brought in with
ſo much confidence and oſtentation,
to prove that <hi>poſitively,</hi> which by no <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi>
Inference can be gathered from
them. If ever man were <hi>Animal Rationale
Riſibile,</hi> that is to ſay, a Creature ridiculous
for his reaſoning, it muſt needs be this.
But certainly, our Author could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſo much out, in his rational and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive
faculties, had he not wiſhed well
unto the man, and approved the Fact.
He had not elſe accounted it an <hi>exploit</hi> of
<hi>glory,</hi> or put that gloſſe upon the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Wretch, that he had ſtitched
thoſe Papers into the lining of his Hat,
for fear, leſt the <hi>Suppoſition of private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
would infame and blemiſh the glory of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:114885:157"/>
the exploit;</hi> nor had he told us, that it
<hi>pleaſed the Common man too well, and that
in vulgar ſenſe, it rather paſſed for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of a Malefactor, and an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of that Juſtice diſpenſed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which they thought was denied on earth,</hi>
Fol. 91. Never did man ſo advocate for
a willfull murder, or render a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo obnoxious to it, and ſo guilty of
it; there being little difference, if any,
between the rejoycing at ſuch facts, when
done, and conſenting to them; <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
ſpeaking of the Murder of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
hath reſolved it ſo, <hi>viz. Quid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
utrum velim fieri, an gaudeam
factum?</hi> He that applaudes a Murder
acted, rendreth himſelf an Acceſſary to
it, before the fact. We have not done
with <hi>Felton</hi> yet, for our Author told us
that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His bodie was from thence conveyed to</hi>
Portſmouth, <hi>and there hung in chains, but
by ſome ſtole and conveyed away Gibbet and
all.</hi> The contrary being proved by the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,</hi>
and the thing too plain to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
he hath ſince rectified his Hiſtory,
as to this parricular, not on the credit of
the <hi>Obſervator</hi> (no, take heed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that) but
becauſe told ſo <hi>by his betters.</hi> Yet ſtill he
muſt be ſtanding on his juſtification, and as
long as he hath any common <hi>Fame,</hi> or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:114885:158"/>
                  <hi>confident Report</hi> (be it never ſo erroneous)
to pretend unto, he conceives that <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for him,</hi> Fol. 14. Upon this ground,
the honour of the Counteſs of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
ſhall be called in queſtion;
and an affront falſly reported to be done
to publique Juſtice, ſhall paſſe into his
Annals as a matter of truth. He could
not elſe inſtruct Poſterity, or the preſent
age, how to defame the honour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or commit the like <hi>Rapes</hi> upon the
Law, without fear of impunitie, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch <hi>ſuperfaetations of Fame</hi> (in his
<hi>Canting Language</hi>) ſhould not paſſe for
truths, or otherwiſe be <hi>wondred</hi> at as no
grounds for Hiſtory. If no ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
follow on it, we muſt not thank
the Hiſtory, but the <hi>Obſervations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, our Author had told
us in his Hiſtory, <q>That there was an
old ſculking Statute long ſince out of
uſe, though not out of force, which
enjoyned all Subjects, who had not ſome
ſpecial privilege, to appear at the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of every King, <hi>ad Arma Gerenda,
to bear Armes,</hi> not to be made Knights
as was vulgarly ſuppoſed.</q> In this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
there are two things chiefly faulted
by the Obſervator; firſt his reproaching
of that Law, by the name of an <hi>old Skul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Statute,</hi> which lay not under the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:114885:158"/>
Rubbiſh of Antiquity, but was printed
and expoſed to open view, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needed no ſuch progging and bolting
out, as is elſewhere ſpoken of; And 2ly.
his Gloſſe upon it, as if it only ſignified
the <hi>hearing of Arms,</hi> and not receiving
the Order of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> as had been
<hi>vulgarly ſuppoſed,</hi> the contrary whereof
was undeniably, and convincingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> He hath now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rectified the firſt expreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſeems
to ſtand ſtill upon his laſt. The firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
rectified thus, <hi>viz. By the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law there was veſted in the Kings of
this Realm, a power to Summon (by their
Writs out of the Chancery) all perſons poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
a Knights Fee, and who had no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
privilege to the contrary, to appear at
their Coronation, &amp;c.</hi> Fol. 115. So then,
the antient Common Law, explained
and moderated for the eaſe of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by the Statute of King <hi>Edward</hi> 2. is
freed from the reproachfull name of an
old <hi>Skulking Statute;</hi> we have got that
by it, The <hi>Obſervator</hi> being juſtified in
our Authors Pamphlet, for ſo much of
his diſcourſe as concerns that point. And
to the reſt of that Diſcourſe, proving
that all thoſe who were maſters of ſuch
an eſtate as the Statute mentioneth,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:114885:159"/>
were by the ſame bound to <hi>be made
Knights,</hi> or to receive the <hi>Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
and not ſimply to <hi>bear Arms,</hi> or
to <hi>receive a Sword and Surcoat</hi> out
of the Kings wardrobe, as the Author
would have had it in his firſt Edition; he
comes up ſo cloſe, as could be ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from him. For firſt he telleth us
in the Text of his new Edition, that ſuch
as appeared at the Coronation, were to
<hi>receive a ſword and Surcoat</hi> (he ſtill ſtands
to that) <hi>as the Enſignes of Knighthood:</hi>
and therefore queſtionleſs to receive the
Order of Knighthood alſo, if the King ſo
pleaſed: And 2ly, he confeſſeth in his
Comment on it out of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi>
that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. fined all the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of <hi>England</hi> five Marks a man, for not
diſtraining every one having 15 <hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
to be made Knights, as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
adding withall, that he had
read of the like Precept of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Firſt, <hi>Fol.</hi> 20. So then, the Subjects
were not called together to the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>ad militiae a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ma gerenda,</hi> to bear
Arms only, but to receive the Order of
Knighthood; we have got that too.</p>
               <p>But all this while the King is like to
get nothing by it, if our Author might
be ſuffered to expound the Law; againſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:114885:159"/>
which he oppoſeth only the Authoritie
of Sir <hi>Edward Coke;</hi> A learned Lawyer I
confeſs, but not to be put in equal Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with the Law it ſelf. Well, what
ſaith he? Now (ſaith he) <hi>tempora mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur,</hi>
the times are changed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Yeoman purchaſeth lands in Knights
Service, and yet (<hi>non debet</hi>) ought not,
for want of Gentry, to be a Knight: and a
little after, the Fine to the mark, which
is chiefly aimed at, <hi>Fol.</hi> 20. And in
theſe words, taking the Citation as I find
it, I obſerve theſe things, 1. That Sir
<hi>Edward Cokes Non debet</hi> cannot bind the
King, who may as well make <hi>Leathern
Knights</hi> as <hi>Leathern Lords,</hi> (as our Author
phraſeth it elſewhere) the Sword of
Knighthood taking away the blemiſhes
of Vulgar birth, and ſtating the receiver
of it, in the rank and capacitie of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
Were it not thus, the Door of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be ſhut againſt well <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and neither honour gained in War,
nor eminencies in Learning, nor fidelity
in Service, nor any other Conſideration
in the way of merit, would render any
perſon capable of the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
for <hi>want of Gentry,</hi> or being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only from a Houſe of Yeomanrie.
2ly, I obſerve, that though he would not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:114885:160"/>
have ſuch petſons honoured with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Knighthood, (leſt elſe perhaps that
honourable Order might grow Deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
were it made too common) yet he
confeſſeth, that they were to <hi>Fine</hi> for it
(if I underſtand his meaning rightly) at
the Kings pleaſure. 3ly. I obſerve how
lamely and imperfectly the Pamphleter
hath delivered the laſt words of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
which makes me apt enough to
think, that he intended to ſay ſomewhat
to the Kings advantage, if he had been
ſuffered to ſpeak out. And 4ly, if Sir
<hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſhould reſolve the Contrary,
and give ſentence in this Caſe againſt the
King, yet I conceive it would have been
reverſible by a <hi>Writ of error;</hi> that learned
Lawyer, having been a principal Stickler
for the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> in the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and therfore not unwilling to
lay ſuch grounds, whereby the King
might be forced to caſt himſelf on the
Alms of his people.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Surcoat,</hi> affirmed
to be delivered by the <hi>Lord High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi>
out of the Kings <hi>Wardrobe,</hi> to
ſuch as were ſummoned to appear; he
ſtill ſtands to that, not thinking it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Condition to yield the cauſe,
if not found againſt him by the Jury; the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:114885:160"/>
point to be made good is this, that ſuch as
were ſummoned to the Coronation, <hi>were
to have every man of them a</hi> Sword and a
Surcoat <hi>delivered to him out of the Kings
Wardrobe by the Lord High Chamberlain,
if the Kings ſervice ſo required;</hi> which he
proves by theſe Infallible witneſſes. Gent.
of the Jury, ſtand together, &amp; hear your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
The firſt witneſs is an <hi>eminent
Antiquary,</hi> than whom none can be fitter
to give Teſtimony to the point in hand;
but he alas is <hi>long ſince dead,</hi> and it were
pity to raiſe him from the Duſt of the
Grave, (as we have done the <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ricus
Parliamentorum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Pym,</hi> in
another caſe) for fear he put the Coutt
into a greater fright, than when the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Aſſizes</hi> was at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Such a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
we had once before in the Caſe of
the late <hi>Convocation,</hi> a <hi>credible and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſon,</hi> as the Pamphletet told us;
but nameleſs he, for blameleſs he ſhall be,
quoth the gallant <hi>Sydney;</hi> and here we
have <hi>an eminent Antiquary,</hi> but the man
is <hi>dead, dead as a door-nail,</hi> quoth the
Pamphleter in another place. A name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
witneſs there, a dead witneſs here,
let them go together. The next witneſs
is old <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter, who, though
dead, yet ſpeaketh,</hi> who tells us, <q>That
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:114885:161"/>
King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. ſent forth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
that all ſuch perſons, who
had poſſeſſions valued at a Knights Fee,
ſhould appear at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> &amp;c.</q> what
to do, he tells you preſently, <q>
                     <hi>admiſſuri
ſinguli ornatum militarem ex Regia
Garderoba,</hi> to receive military accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements
out of the Kings Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
<hi>Fol.</hi> 20.</q> This witneſs ſpeaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but he ſpeaks not home. The point in
<hi>Iſſue,</hi> is particularly of a <hi>Sword and a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,</hi>
the witneſs ſpeaks in general, of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
militaris</hi> only; but whether it were
a <hi>Sword,</hi> a <hi>Surcoat,</hi> or a pair of Spurs, or
whatſoever elſe it was, that he telleth
us not. So the firſt witneſs ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the ſecond nothing to the
purpoſe, the Pamphleter deſires to be
<hi>Non-ſuited,</hi> and ſo let him be. He tels the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> Fol. 36. that <hi>his Arguments
are nothing</hi> ad rem, <hi>and beſides the Cuſhion.</hi>
But whatſoever his arguments were, I
hope theſe Anſwers are not only <hi>ad rem,</hi>
but <hi>ad Rhombum,</hi> and <hi>Rhomboidem</hi> alſo, and
ſo I hope the Pamphleter will find them
upon examination.</p>
               <p>In the great Feaſt at <hi>Welbeck</hi> there is
no ſuch difference, but may be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
That the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>
entertained the King at <hi>VVelbeck,</hi> is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:114885:161"/>
granted by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and that it
was the moſt magnificent entertainment
which had been given the King in his
way toward <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhall be granted
alſo; Which notwithſtanding, it was
truly ſaid by the Obſervator, that <hi>the
Magnificent Feaſt ſo much talked of, was</hi>
not made at <hi>VVelbeck,</hi> but <hi>at Balſover
Caſtle;</hi> nor this year, but the year next
after, and not made to the King only, but
to the King and Queen. In the firſt of
which two entertainments, the Earl had
far exceeded all the reſt of the Lords, but
in the ſecond exceeded himſelf, the firſt
Feaſt eſtimated at 6000 l. to our Author
at <hi>York,</hi> but eſtimated on the unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Superfaetations of Fame,</hi> which, like
a Snow-ball, groweth by rowling, <hi>creſcit
eundo,</hi> ſaith the Poet: or like the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,</hi>
makes moſt noiſe when it is fartheſt
from the neſt, where the Birds are hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Obſervator took it on the
place it ſelf, when the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ths of men
were filled with the talk, and their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
not well cleared from the <hi>Surque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries</hi>
of that Mighty Feaſt; by whom it
was generally affirmed, that the laſt years
entertainment (though both magnificent
and Auguſt in our Authors language) held
no Compariſon with this. So that the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:114885:162"/>
one Feaſt being great, and the other grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is in the right, and our
Author was not much in the wrong.</p>
               <p>More in the wrong he doth confeſs
in the great entertainment given to the
City by the King, affirmed before
to have been made at the <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
but now acknowledged upon the
reading of the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> to have

a great and terrible fight near <hi>Roſtock,</hi>
which I can find in no place but my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
brains. He tells us in his Hiſtory,
That <hi>Tilly condacted a numerous Army of
thirty three thouſand foot, and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe for the relief of</hi> Roſtock <hi>then
beſieged by the King of</hi> Sweden; <hi>That the
King alarmed herewith drawes out of his

foot, and ſix hundred horſe;</hi> that in
concluſion of the battle <hi>Tilly</hi> was put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worſt, and his Army routed; and
that finally upon this Victory he <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſtormed the Town,</hi> and carried it,
<hi>Hist. Fol.</hi> 112. The <hi>Obſervator</hi> finding no
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:114885:163"/>
ſuch rout given to <hi>Tilly</hi> near <hi>Roſtock</hi>
Anno 1630. where our Author pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it, conceived it might be
meant of the battell near <hi>Lipſique,
Anno</hi> 1631. and made his obſervations
accordingly. And upon this he might
have reſted, had the Pamphleter pleaſed,
who in his introduction to the Feaſt at
<hi>Welbeck</hi> advertiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mentioneth a Battel at <hi>Lipſique,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before, but where he knows not,
only conjectures that he had a good
will to take him to task for a miſplacing
a battel, he ſuppoſes at <hi>Roſtock,</hi> but
upon better conſideration, he found his
errour to be his own, and not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and therefore cut out the Leafe
containing the 101, 102 pages, wherin
his miſtake lay, leaving that Paragraph
tyed head and heels together</q> Fol.
21. Did ever man ſo lay about him in a
matter of nothing, for ſuch is both his fight
near <hi>Roſtock,</hi> and this long <hi>prattle</hi> which
he makes of the Obſervator. For firſt,
the <hi>Leaſe which contained the</hi> 101 and
102 <hi>pages,</hi> was never cut out; 2ly
there is no ſuch incoherence in any of
the Paragraphs there, as if <hi>head and heels
were laid together;</hi> 3ly. the Leaf which
was cut out, contained 107 and 108 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and was cut out, not in regard of any
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:114885:163"/>
thing there ſpoken of our Authors
battel, but the miſplacing the train of
Captives, and the rear of the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
maſque, occaſioned by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the Printers only: 4ly. That,
in the leaf containing pages 101, 102.
The Author might have found mention
of the battell of <hi>Lipſique,</hi> which he ſaith
he knows not where to find, ſaying,
that he, the <hi>Obſervator, mentioneth a battel</hi>
at <hi>Lipſique ſpoken of before, but where he
knows not,</hi> one evident argument, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he looked but careleſly after
it, or was not very willing to find it.</p>
               <p>And to ſay truth, it had been better
for him, to have paſſed it by, for then he
had been only chargeable with ſome
<hi>prudent omiſſions</hi> (as we know who was)
whereas by ſpeaking in his Hiſtory of a
battel of <hi>Roſtock,</hi> and ſeeming offended to
be taxed for miſplacing of it, he layeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
open to the aſſaults of his adverſaries.
I have conſulted diligently, the Hiſtory
of the <hi>Sweediſh</hi> war in <hi>Germany</hi> till the
death of that King, writen in Latin by
<hi>Cluverut,</hi> together with that tranſlated

(on whoſe authority the Pamphleter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth
in another place,) but can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in either of them, either of any
ſuch ſeige or of any ſuch battell, or of any
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:114885:164"/>
ſuch ſtorming of that Town as my Author
ſpeaks of. All that I find concerning
<hi>Rostock,</hi> ſhall be ſummed up thus, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that having ſollicited, and practiſed
the people of <hi>Roſtock</hi> to declare for him
in that War, he was peaceably received
into it; that having left no Gariſon in it,
it was ſurprized by the <hi>Imperials,</hi> and
ſtrongly fortified; that the King having
recovered all the Dukedom of <hi>Mecklen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
except the Towns of <hi>Roſtock</hi> and
<hi>Wiſmer,</hi> and not willing to waſte time in
beſieging either, he fortified <hi>Anclam,</hi> to
bridle the Gariſons of thoſe Towns, and
ſecure the Country; and finally, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the great Battel of <hi>Lipſique,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>Tod,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, laid ſiege to
<hi>Roſtock</hi> and reduced it, the Town not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwiſe ſtormed than by want of
victuals. Next for the engagement of the
Armies, I find that <hi>Tilly</hi> having muſtered
up his united forces, and finding them to
conſiſt of 34000. fighting men, drew thrice
toward the King; firſt as he lay intrenched
between <hi>Landſperge</hi> and <hi>Franckford</hi> on
the <hi>Oder,</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
2ly, as he lay intrenched near <hi>Werben,</hi>
not far from the Territory of <hi>Magdeburg.</hi>
And 3dly, in his Retreat by <hi>Tangermond</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:114885:164"/>
to his faſter Holds: that there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
between the Armies at all in
the two firſt times, and only ſome light
Skirmiſhes in the third, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diſadvantage unto either ſide; the
Armies never engaging, till the Battel of
<hi>Lipſique,</hi> in which <hi>Tilly</hi> received that
diſmal rout, which opened the Kings paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
into <hi>Franconia</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
Beſides which, it is more than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that if <hi>Tilly</hi> had received any ſuch
rout, as our Author ſpeaks of, he could
not have proceeded, as he did, to the
ſack of <hi>Magdeburg;</hi> nor would he King
have ſuffered him to recruit again after
ſuch a rout, wherein he had taken 16.
Canons, 30 Enſigns, and 32 Cornets of
Horſe, and ſcattered the whole Imperial
Army, opening thereby a way to relieve
that City, which <hi>Tilly</hi> had beſieged for
declaring in his Behalf, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provocation. So that I muſt behold
this Siege, this Battel, and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orming
the Town upon it, as matters to be found
only in the Pamphleters dreams; not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to be excuſed, but that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<hi>writing the Hiſtory of the reign of King</hi>
Charles, intends only to juſtifie <hi>ſuch
Things and Actions, as have reference to
the 16 years whereof he treateth in that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:114885:165"/>

               </p>
               <p>Our Author had told us in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that <hi>preſently</hi> on the Diſcovery of Mr.
Atturney <hi>Noyes Deſign,</hi> 
                  <q>he iſſued writs
to all the Counties in the Realm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
that every County ſhould for
defence of the Kingdom, againſt a day
prefix'd, provide Ships of ſo many Tun,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> To this the Obſervator anſwereth,
That in the firſt year of the payment of
Shipmoney, the Writs were not iſſued to
all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
tells us, but only to the Maritime
Counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that in the next year,
not before, the like writs iſſued out to all
the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1636. What ſaith the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to this? Firſt he acknowledgeth his
error, and hath rectified it in the laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but adds withall, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
gives him two for one: in ſaying
firſt, <hi>that the Ship writs were directed in the
firſt year to the Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ime Counties,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was to the <hi>Port towns only;</hi> and 2ly, in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:114885:165"/>
ſaying that the Ship writs were directed
to all the Counties, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſaith he, it was 1635. Fol. 25. For
the firſt of theſe, he offereth no proof but
his <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> and of what authority that
is, we have ſeen already. He telleth
us poſitively in his Preface, that <hi>for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Record he hath not conſulted the very
Originals, but hath conformed himſelf to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies;</hi>
and having been ſo often cozened
in the falſe Copies of <hi>Journals</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rts,</hi>
I can ſee no armour of proof about
him, to keep his credulity from the
wounds made by falſe Records. But 2ly,
taking it for true, as perhaps it is, that
the firſt Writs were directed to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime</hi>
or <hi>Port towns,</hi> only; yet being the
<hi>Maritime</hi> or <hi>Port towns,</hi> ſtand in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Counties,</hi> it is not very much out
of the way, to ſay that the firſt Writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
were directed to the <hi>Maritime Counties:</hi>
Not ſo much, I am ſure, as to ſay they
were directed to the <hi>Mediterraneans</hi> or
<hi>Highlanders,</hi> in our Authors <hi>canting,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
by ſuch a <hi>Fictio Juris</hi> as our common
Lawyers call <hi>an action of Trover,</hi> a Port
Town may be ſaid to be in the Midland
Countries. For the ſecond he offereth
us ſome proof, telling us <hi>thoſe writs were
iſſued out</hi> Anno 1635. <hi>as a conſequent of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:114885:166"/>
the opinion of the Judges in that Novemb.</hi>
But will the Pamphleter ſtand to this,
will he ſtand to any thing? If ſo, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he is gone again. The Opinion
delivered by the Judges, was grounded
on a letter ſent unto them from the King,
with the Caſe incloſed; which letter bears
date the 2d. of <hi>February</hi> in the 12th year
of his Majeſties reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. and
is ſo dated by our Author, Fol. 143. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
therefore that this Letter led the
way unto their Opinion, it is impoſſible
to any common apprehenſion, that the
Judges ſhould deliver their Opinions
14 moneths before the letter came to
them, that is to ſay, in the moneth of
<hi>Novemb.</hi> Anno 1635. and this I take to
be a <hi>Subter</hi> or a <hi>Super-annuating</hi> in his
<hi>Temporalties,</hi> and that too in ſuch <hi>things</hi>
and <hi>Actions</hi> as <hi>relate to the Hiſtory of King
Charles,</hi> and not in things extrinſecal, as
the Battel of <hi>Roſtock,</hi> or in things taken
<hi>in on the By,</hi> as the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the ingenuitie of the man, and
his equitie too, The Obſervator had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him of ſome other miſtakes about
this buſineſs; as firſt, his making the
Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> Admiral of the
firſt years Fleet, whereas it was the Earl
of <hi>Lindſey;</hi> And 2ly, in affirming, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:114885:166"/>
the King upon the Archbiſhops intreaty,
had granted the Clergy an exemption
from that general payment, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
there was no ſuch matter. The firſt
of theſe he hath rectifyed in the Hiſtory,
and confeſſed in the Pamphlet; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
he hath rectifyed without any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
either of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
information, or his own miſtake:
And finally (ſo indulgent is he to his
own dear ſelf) ranking it amongſt the
errors aſcribed by him to the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi>
for making the firſt writ to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the Maritime Counties, whereas
ſaith he, it was to the Maritime or Port
Towns only, he reckoneth it not amongſt
his own, in ſaying that they were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to all the Counties of the Kingdom,
the <hi>Mediterraneans</hi> and <hi>Highlanders</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt. Rather than ſo, Ships

hath indeed rectified his own errour by

2ly. finds he nothing faulty in the Story
of the <hi>Obſervator?</hi> Yes, He firſt finds
fault with him for ſaying, that the King
intending a Parliament in that Kingdom,
appointed the Earl of <hi>Niddiſdale</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
therein, and furniſhed him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
for paſſing of an Act of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Abby-lands and lands of Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks;
whereas (ſaith he) he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated
<q>with the Earl of <hi>Anandale,</hi>
for ſummoning a Parliament (not for
revoking of Church and other lands
formerly inveſted in the Crown) but

this aſſuredly thwarts with nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> the <hi>Obſervator</hi>
no where ſaying, that the Parliament
was to be ſummoned, <hi>for revoking of
Church and other lands formerly inveſted in
the Crown;</hi> but that the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi>
or Earl of <hi>Nidiſdale</hi> (call him which you
will) was <hi>furniſhed with inſtructions for
paſſing an Act,</hi> to the purpoſe above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And <hi>furniſhed</hi> he might be, with
ſuch ſecret <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> though there
was nothing to that purpoſe in the Writ
of Summons, by which that Parliament
was called, or in the Commiſſion it ſelf,
by which he was appointed and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to preſide therein. Much leſſe doth
that thwart any thing in the <hi>Obſervator,</hi>
which the Pamphleter gives us in the
cloſe, when the Scotch Lords and <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
were brought Face to Face before the
King, and when upon ſome Bugwords
ſpoken by the Scots, <hi>his Majeſtie told
them, and not before, he would make them

               <p>Concerning the election of the <hi>Lords of

there appeareth ſome difference between
the <hi>Obſervator;</hi> and the Hiſtorian; to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie

in his anſwer, <hi>that his Informer being a

(as he thinks,) more credible in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

about it, we may ſeek elſewhere. But
of theſe nameleſs and dead witneſſes,
we may ſpeak ſo lovely, that wee need
not put our ſelves unto the trouble of a

This is the Pamphleters <hi>Bill of Lading,</hi>
wherewith he fraughts the ſmall Bark
of the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> conſiſting more in

whether any of them may be charged on

to the Readers Judgement.</p>
               <p>In the expoſtulation there is nothing
which requireth an Anſwer. But a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
againſt the Obſervator, for want of
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yea <hi>Moral principles,</hi> in the
courſe and way of his proceedings, with
which had he been furniſhed in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

and this he doth the rather inſiſt
upon, becauſe of thoſe many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:114885:171"/>
which the Obſervator had of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with him, meeting together not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a hundred times in the ſame Shop, but
ten times after the Coming out of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
and thereupon it is concluded that
it was not the information of the <hi>Author,</hi>
but ſome <hi>precious quarrel</hi> rather, which
was deſired, Fol. 44, 45. To Anſwer
firſt unto the laſt, the <hi>Obſervator</hi> doth
proteſt in his own behalf, that he had no
deſire or thought of ſuch <hi>precious quarrels,</hi>
as the Author (conſcious to himſelf of
his own impatiencies) doth accuſe him
of, and that he aimed at nothing elſe in
thoſe <hi>Obſervations,</hi> than the <hi>Illuſtration
of the Story, and Rectifying ſome miſtakes
in the courſe thereof,</hi> as the title promiſeth.
How often they have met in the ſame
ſhop, I am not able to ſay, the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
telling me, that he never changed
words with him above thrice, and then
took ſuch a ſcant ſurvey of his Stature,
Countenance, and habit, that he might
meet him, a <hi>hundred times</hi> ſince, as the
Author ſayes he did <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
with other Company, without taking
any notice of him. Nor doth the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
pleaſe himſelf in theſe paper quarrels,
or would have took the leaſt part of the
pains he did, if he had found himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:114885:172"/>

Mr. <hi>Braſgirdle</hi> was Incumbent, reſolved
to make ſome preſent advantage by it, and
to that end Articled againſt <hi>Braſgirdle</hi> in

                  </gap>,
in which he charged <hi>Gunter,</hi> for ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that he would ſpit in his face when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he met him, and ſwearing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that he had ſpit in his Face accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
as alſo that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
meeting with <hi>Gunter</hi> at a time, when
the ſaid <hi>Braſgirdle</hi> had preached at a
General Meeting of the Clergy, took
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114885:174"/>
the ſaid <hi>Gunter</hi> to dinner with him,
and placed him at the head of the board,
above all the Miniſters, where the ſaid
<hi>Gunter</hi> ſpent the greateſt part of the
Meal in railing at and againſt the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
to the great ſcandal and offence
of all the Company. And to this
Charge or Recrimination the Proofes
came ſo home, that though <hi>Gunter</hi> did
deny the Fact, as to his ſpitting in the
Miniſters Face, yet it was proved ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
that he had ſworn he would and
did it, as before is ſaid. The cauſe being
pleaded on both ſides, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

declared, that he would proceed then,
as at other times, <hi>ſecundum allegata

and Evidences which had been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that it had been proved that the

Divinitie</hi> alſo, and had lived 20. years
and upwards, in the place of his preſent
dwelling, without any diſcredit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
that there was no Proof made of
<hi>Gunters</hi> being a Captain, and he had reaſon
to believe that he was no Gent. that he
was confident no Gent. in <hi>England</hi> would
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:114885:174"/>
either ſpit in the face of a Miniſter, or
find no other way to ſhift off the ſhame
and puniſhment, but by telling a lie;
and finally that the <hi>Official</hi> had deſerved
to be cenſured, for placing ſuch a <hi>Jack-Gentleman</hi>
as this, above all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at the publique meeting of a Clergy.
Theſe were the words then ſpoken by
that Reverend Prelate, of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man, and not in any ſuch general
terms as our Author hath preſented them
in both Editions. And for the further
proof of this, I ſhall give theſe reaſons:
Firſt, that although he deſire not to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
himſelf; yet he hath too much in
him of the blood of the antient Gentry,
to lay any ſuch diſparagement, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon them: And 2ly. That no
ſuch thing was articled or inſiſted on by
the Houſe of Commons in their impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

being many months in ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,
and liberty given to all manner

would certainly have pitched on this,
as a matter of moſt general concernment
to them, if any proof could poſſibly have
been produced to make good the charge.

I ſhall give him both the
names and words of ſome of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to juſtifie all that was ſaid of them
by the Obſervator. And firſt we will
begin with <hi>Calvin,</hi> the father and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Sect, and he tells us thus,
<hi>Illud toties a Chryſostomo repetitum repudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri

trahit; <hi>quo inſinuat deminum porrecta
tantum manu expectare an ſuo auxilio juva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri

of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> cap. 3. <q>Thoſe words
(ſaith he) ſo often repeated by <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:114885:176"/>
viz. <hi>That God draws none but ſuch
as are willing to go,</hi> are to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
By which he intimates that God
expecteth only with an outſtretched
and ready arm, whether we be willing
to accept of his help or not</q> In which,
though <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not expreſs clearly
that good Fathers meaning, yet he plainly
doth ſhew his own, inſinuating that God
draws men forcibly and againſt their own
will to his Heavenly Kingdome. <hi>Gomarus</hi>
one of later date, and a chief Stickler in
theſe controverſies, comes up more fully
to the words and deſire of the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For putting the queſtion in this
manner <hi>An gratia haec detur</hi> vi irreſiſtibili,
<hi>id eſt, effiicaci operatione Dei, ita ut voluntas
ejus qui regeneratur, facultatem non habeat
illi reſistendi,</hi> he anſwereth preſently,
<hi>Credo &amp; profiteor ita eſſe.</hi> 
                  <q>The queſtion
is whether the grace of God be given in
an irreſiſtable manner, that is to ſay,
with ſuch an <hi>efficacious</hi> operation, that
the will of him who is to be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
hath not rhe power to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and then the anſwer follows
thus,</q> 
                  <hi>I believe and profeſſe it to be ſo,</hi>

in our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> conſidering that

muſt we grant it to be ſo in Spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> in

have affirmed as much, aſcribing no

than they aſcribe unto him in
his <hi>Generation,</hi> to the life of Nature, or
in his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the dead to the
life eternal. For thus ſay they, <hi>Sicut ad

tell me whether the <hi>rigid ſort of Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
do not hold and teach, <hi>that a man is
drawn forcibly, and irreſiſtably with the
Cords of Grace in the work of converſion,
without contributing any thing to, or towards
his own Eternity.</hi> Nay <hi>Dontelock</hi> goeth
further yet, and is ſo far from aſcribing
any thing to man, in order to his own
ſalvation, that he counts all his beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
which tend that way, to be
vain and fruitleſſe, and to conduce
more to his hurt than benefit, before
Faith and the Spirit of Regeneration by
irreſiſtable operations, (So I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

a ſtrong faith, not a <hi>ſaving hope</hi> which
can raiſe the dead, though newly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

our Author could receive this <hi>credible
information</hi> from the Son of <hi>Baro,</hi> without
pretending to a greater power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miracles, than ever was granted to

                  <hi>Information,</hi> or elſe it might remain as a

               <p>Tis true indeed, the words of the
Doctors Sermon, as it came out yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in print (<hi>viz. Monday June</hi> 16.)
ſeems at firſt ſight, to differ ſomewhat
from the paſſage before recited, as it
was ſent to me in writing: But firſt
the Reader is to know, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
comes not to our Hands, as it
came from his Mouth, it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
in the Title, that it hath not
only been <hi>revized,</hi> but <hi>enlarged</hi> alſo; of
which Enlargements, that of <hi>Dodonas
Grove</hi> may perhaps be one. 2ly. If if be
not ſo, yet the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> as well as the
Rainger of that Forreſt ſtands charged
with this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord Primate
had coined a diſtinction, between the
Kings <hi>perſonal and political Conſcience.</hi> For
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:114885:178"/>
having eaſed his Stomach on the Rainger

he addeth, that <hi>there was a preſump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uous
Obſervator, who had of late more ridic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
and malitiouſly abuſed him in it.</hi> Out
of which Premiſes it cannot otherwiſe
be concluded, but that the <hi>diſtinction of a
perſonal and political Conſcience</hi> muſt be
found in the Obſervations alſo, and ſo
found there, as to be charged on the
Lord Primate by the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> And if
the Preacher can find this in the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
the <hi>Obſervator</hi> was too blame, and
the Preacher hath made the alteration to
a very good purpoſe. But if it be not ſo,
as indeed it is not, where lieth the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>
or <hi>ridiculouſneſſe</hi> which the Pulpit
rang of? Not in impoſing on the Lord
Primate the pretended <hi>diſtinction</hi> above
mentioned; for that hath found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Father, and was perhaps begotten
under ſome ſhady Oake in <hi>Dodonas Grove,</hi>
in which the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is not ſo much as
verderer, and hardly hunteth in the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieus;
but for conceiving that the L. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
gave this <hi>pretended distinction</hi> (for
let it be but <hi>pretended</hi> ſtill I diſpute not
that) <hi>as if the root of it was in revenge for
the Earls ſuppreſſing the Articles of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Serm. Pag. 95. Admit it to be ſo
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:114885:179"/>
conceived and ſaid by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi>
how doth the Preacher goe about to
prove the contrary? Why certainly by a
moſt unavoidable Argument, declaring
thus; that <hi>both are of like falſhood, as hath
been already apparent in an Anſwer to him.
Ibid.</hi> This is juſt <hi>Mulus Mulum fricat</hi>
(one galled Horſe rubbeth another) in
the ancient Proverb. The Pamphleter
juſtifieth himſelf on the <hi>Certificate</hi> of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Bernard</hi> and his Brother <hi>Pullein;</hi>
Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> juſtifieth himſelf on the
anſwer of the learned Pamphleter, which
is now before us. The falſhood of that
one thing which is touched on by the
<hi>Obſervator,</hi> not being made apparent in
the Pamphleters Anſwer, and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, the <hi>pretended diſtinction</hi> which
he wots of, the Pamphleter makes no

                  </gap> at all, as finding no ground for
it in the Obſervations. But <hi>Bernardus
non vidit omnia,</hi> as the ſaying is. And
though he be not ſuch an <hi>ill-looking fellow</hi>
as the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is made to be by his
friend the Pamphleter; yet having loſt
himſelf in a <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al Forrest,</hi> he may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
miſtake wood for trees, as well as
another; Only I could have wiſhed he
had forborn that paſſage in the cloſe of all,
where he relates, That when upon a <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:114885:179"/>
of the Lord Primates <hi>death,</hi> this
buſineſſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him; <hi>the King with an Oath
proteſted the innocency of the</hi> Lord Primate
<hi>in it;</hi> or elſe that he had given us the
name of that <hi>perſon of quality,</hi> which was
an <hi>Earwitneſſe</hi> to the words, for I can
tell him, and will tell him, if he put me
to it, that there are <hi>perſons</hi> of another
manner of <hi>quality</hi> than thoſe whom he
pretends unto, who heard the contrary
from the Kings own mouth, and will not
ſpare to give teſtimony to the truth in
that particular when required of them.
But I forbear to preſſe it further, and
could have wiſhed the Preacher had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me not to ſay ſo much. I leave
him at this time, with <hi>non tali auxilio,</hi>
