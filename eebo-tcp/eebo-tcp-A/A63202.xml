            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lord, if he had not that Right, it can be no Riot accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Information. My Lord, upon his Adjourning Mr. Sheriff <hi>North</hi> was Choſen: My Lord, if that Adjournment was not according to Law, Mr. Sheriff <hi>North</hi> never was Sheriff of <hi>London</hi>; Then, my Lord, here is the Caſe in this Queſtion of Title, for Mr. <hi>North</hi> doth come in queſtion, whether he be a legal Sheriff of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>I think, my Lord, this is a common Caſe in our Books, That if in caſe a Sheriff be concerned in point of Title, this is a principal Challenge, becauſe that he is intereſted in that Title, he is no perſon by Law to return a Jury. I don't doubt but your Lordſhip will do that which is right, and according to Law. My Lord, I ſay, where a Sheriff is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in point of Title, he is no perſon by Law to return a Jury, and this Queſtion will appear plainly upon this Information; for if in caſe this was not a lawful Adjournment by Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> this is not a lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.—Gentlemen, my Lord, I know, will hear me, if you have but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; I always ſpeak and ſtand up for my Clients, as I ought to do. If you pleaſe to let me have your liberty, I have my Lords. If a Sheriff be concerned in point of Title, it is a principal Challenge, and the Sheriff ought not to return the Jury, but the <hi>Coroner:</hi> And my Lord much more in this Caſe, for that the very Title to the Office of Sheriff is here in Queſtion, and therefore he is no perſon fit to return this Jury, my Lord. We deſire your Lordſhips Opinion.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49826:4"/>
afterwards the Defendents, <hi>Pilkington</hi> and <hi>Shute,</hi> did continue this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and took a Poll, and ſo they would make this a Riot in the continuance of it. My Lord, we do ſay this, That the Election of Mr. <hi>North</hi> upon this Point doth come in queſtion; and, my Lord, we do ſay, That if that prove not a legal Adjournment, then Mr. <hi>North</hi> is not legally Choſen.</p>

               <p>Certainly if they be impannelled by perſons that are not Sheriffs, that is a good Challenge, that is admitted by every body; now we have made a Challenge, and that is a good cauſe of Challenge certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if that were the cauſe. But now, my Lord, I muſt confeſs what your Lordſhip ſays, it is a difficult matter to challenge any Array, becauſe they are arrayed by a perſon that hath an intereſt, or ſome ſuch thing, that is a Challenge of the Array, but that is not the matter in this caſe. It cannot be denied, If theſe perſons were not Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> that that is a good Cauſe. I take the Reſult of the Challenge to be this: Say we, The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal queſtion of this Information, the Riot, will depend upon this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether there were a regular Adjournment or not? There, ſay we, begins the queſtion of the Riot. If ſo be that my Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> that was, had power to adjourn the Court, and it be admitted a regular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, certainly the Riot would follow, and what follows then? Then comes on a Queſtion, and it is immediately conſequent upon it, that theſe Gentlemen be actual Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> they being actually choſen upon this Adjournment, they are actually Sheriffs: But if really my Lord Mayor had no power to adjourn, and that power was in the Sheriffs, that they were actually taking the Poll, and the Poll was for Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillon.</hi> Then the Queſtion is, If ſo be the Adjournment by my Lord Mayor were not a good Adjournment, then the Poll was a regular Poll taken by the Sheriffs, then conſequently thoſe that were elected upon that were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, and then it is a right Challenge. Theſe Gentlemen, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, they are Sheriffs <hi>de facto,</hi> but we know very well there may be Sheriffs <hi>de facto,</hi> and there may be other Sheriffs <hi>de jure,</hi> theſe things are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. If ſo be that Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> be duly elected, they are She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs <hi>de jure,</hi> but they want the Formality, for they are not ſworn, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return a Jury. On the other ſide, the Sheriffs are Sheriffs <hi>de facto,</hi> but not legally choſen, and the Riot will depend upon that Queſtion, of the other perſons that are Sheriffs <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure.</hi> This we ſuggeſt in this, Whether your Lordſhip will receive this Challenge, or whether your Lordſhip will proceed firſt to the tryal of the Cauſe, and let this follow. My Lord, might not there have beeen ſomething in this caſe upon the Roll at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> might there not have been a ſurmiſe to this purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49826:4"/>
there is ſuch a queſtion upon the Roll; for it appears that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall was for the Election of Sheriffs, and that it was adjourn'd by the Mayor: And what followed? Might there not be ſuch a ſurmiſe, that the <hi>Venire facias</hi> ſhould not go to the Sheriffs, but to the Coroner? Might there not have been ſuch a thing?</p>

               <p>My ſpeech is but bad, let me know what objection is made, and if I can but retain it in my memory, I don't queſtion but to give you ſatisfaction. If the King had brought an Information againſt Mr. Sheriff <hi>North,</hi> and charged him with a crime, there is no manner of queſtion that the King ſhould have challenged as he was a Sheriff, and ſent the <hi>Venire</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, or other Officer; here he is not accuſed, nor to be acquitted of any crime. Gentlemen, I put you upon this, if ſo be the Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> ſhould get a great deal of money (but I never underſtood that he got by it) if you prove that he hath got any conſiderable matter by the Office, it would be ſomething in the caſe, that he ſhould be greedy of the Office. But look ye, on the other ſide, if there be nothing in it one way or another, that there is profit accruing to him by the Office, what can the Law ſay? But here was the queſtion between, indeed and in truth as you do open it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mayor, Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> I think, and the Sheriffs that then were, that was the queſtion between them. Now what is this in point of Law, that the Sheriffs muſt be challenged? They muſt be challenged, becauſe it is return'd by theſe Sheriffs: You can't, ſay the Sheriffs do favour—the King.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We trouble your Lordſhip about a Queſtion very unneceſſary: The Sheriff is not concerned in this Queſtion, neither can the Conſequences affect the Sheriff any way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, If I don't ſhew that he is concerned, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Mr. Solicitor ſays, it is another matter. If this had been upon a common Riot, and not related to the Election of Sheriffs, it would have been harder againſt us. I only offer a word or two, and ſubmit to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This Information doth take notice of the Election of Sheriffs, and of an irregularity in diſturbing the late Lord Mayor about adjourning the Poll; I do believe my Lord, it will not be denied but that in this Cauſe a Rriot or no Riot will depend upon the Poll, or the Mayors adjourning. If that be ſo, that which your Lordſhip is pleaſed to urge, That the Sheriff gets nothing, yet that he hath aſſumed the Office <hi>de facto,</hi> appears by the Return, that is very plain, my Lord, he hath aſſumed it, and did exerciſe it. If it appear to be legal or illegal upon the Adjournment by the Mayor, then it muſt have one of theſe two Conſequences, my Lord, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, till the Shrievalty had been agreed, it would have done very well for Mr. Attorney to let this Riot alone, unleſs he would have made it a common Riot; if he would have been pleaſed to ſtay till the Law had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd who had been the right Sheriffs, then <hi>Proceſs</hi> would have gone for the King. And my Lord, there is another thing under favour, if Mr. Attorney had been pleaſed to proſecute for the King; then ſurely, my Lord, there was a way to lay it ſo that the <hi>Proceſs</hi> ſhould be returned by perſons unintereſted, and not by the Sheriff whoſe Election is in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie: I don't argue out of the Record, but by the Record it ſelf. If in caſe it doth appear ſtill to be under conſideration; if that be ſo, I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, becauſe that right of Election of Sheriffs is undetermined, that therefore he might have made the <hi>Proceſs</hi> to the Coroner, if he would have made it before, but it ſhould not be heard before the Election of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49826:5"/>
Sheriffs, becauſe it will be a Riot, or not a Riot upon that.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>If you pleaſe, my Lord, I will anſwer what hath been ſaid. Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> did firſt urge according to the Rules of Law, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that appears upon the Record to be the thing in queſtion; that if the Sheriff be intereſted in that matter, that that is a good cauſe of Challenge, that is a good Rule, and the Law is ſo; but that is nothing to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, my Lord, here upon the Record there is nothing in queſtion but a Fine for the King, nothing to be recovered: Where Lands are in queſtion, as in an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> if the Sheriff be intereſted in that Land, in that caſe that is a good Challenge; but here appears nothing by the Record, here is nothing in queſtion but a Fine for the King; ſo that certainly that Caſe in point of Law, is nothing to the purpoſe. Then they ſay, it appears in the Record by Recital, and in the Information, for that is the ſubſtance of all they ſay: It doth appear there, as it is ſaid, that the Mayor did adjourn the Court, and ſo the queſtion of the Riot will very much ſtand upon the validity of that adjournment. But it doth not wholly ſtand upon that, for there are many outragious actions, aſſaults of the Mayor, throwing off his hat, great clamors, thruſting and preſſing many of the Aldermen; nay, bruiſing them, ſo that this Riot, notwithſtanding the Adjournment, be that as it will, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the upſhot of the Cauſe, to be a Riot notwithſtanding that queſtion. But in the ſecond place, the queſtion of Mr. <hi>North</hi>'s being a Sheriff or not a Sheriff, no ways depends upon this Adjournment, no pretence of the Title depends upon that, ſo my Lord, they have ſuggeſted a thing that is forreign to the Record; it depends purely that upon a Cuſtom of the City for my Lord Mayor to elect, not upon the power of my Lord Mayor's Adjournment; for after that they proceeded on with the former choice of Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi>; ſo that whether that Adjournment be a good Adjournment, or no good Adjournment, his Title will depend upon that, whether at the ſecond meeting or no Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> and the other Gentleman be well choſen, and Mr. <hi>North</hi> not well choſen, ſo that his Title doth not depend upon this Queſtion one way or other. But, my Lord, that which makes this as frivolous a thing as ever was urged in a Court of Law, my Lord, that it ſhould have been upon Rule before any Direction to the Sheriff or Coroner, if they would have had <hi>Proceſs</hi>; they have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted matter of Fact wholly out of the Record, matters have been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that it might have been tryed before it came to Direction; now there appears nothing in the Record to bring a Challenge to try the Matter; nay, as they themſelves ſay, it is to try the Merits of the whole Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Information depends upon that Queſtion, Whether the Mayor may adjourn. It is a great Uſurpation upon the Government of this City, as they have done in other things to the King. My Lord Mayor is the Supreme Magiſtrate here, and the Sheriffs have nothing to do in this Point, and therefore I pray it may be over-ruled, and that the Jury may be ſworn.</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of</hi> June, <hi>Sir</hi> John Moor <hi>then Mayor adjourn'd the Court till the Tueſday following by Proclamation. That after the ſaid Adjournment, my Lord Mayor made Proclamation for all Perſons to depart; and that the Defendants intending to diſturb the Peace of the King after the Adjournment aforeſaid, did unlawfully, with many Perſons unknown, meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Riotouſly aſſault the Lord Mayor. And after the Adjournment by Proclamation, two of the Defendants,</hi> Pilkington <hi>and</hi> Shute, <hi>by colour of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49826:6"/>
their Office as Sheriffs of this City, and the reſt of the Defendants did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Poll, and unlawfully affirm to the People, That Sir</hi> John Moor <hi>had no Power to Adjourn them. And that they continued this great Tumult three hours, to the Terror of the King's Subjects, and the evil Example of others, and against the Peace of our Soveraign Lord the King. To this the Defendants have pleaded</hi> Not Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>This Information, my Lord, is brought for ſetling the Peace in this City, and to ſhew before you all who is the Supream Magiſtrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King in this City: For that, Gentlemen, you ſee, is grown a great Queſtion, Whether my Lord Mayor is not only in the Hall, but in his Chair the Supream Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I muſt acquaint you, That my Lord Mayor in all times, even before the City had the Election of him, was the King's Lieutenant, and the Supream Magiſtrate in the City, and no Publick Aſſemblies could ever meet together without his Summons, he was the great and chief Directer, and this I believe in all your Obſervations that are of the Jury. I can make it evident, That this hath been the conſtant frame of this Government in the City: For the Sheriffs, Gentlemen, they are no Corporation Officers, they are County Officers, as in all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and they are the King's Officers for the execution of the King's Writs, and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King's Peace; but the Government of the Corporation is in the Mayor, and not in the Sheriffs. Gentlemen, The Queſtion now ariſing here, is about the Election of Sheriffs; it's true, there was very diſorderly Tumultuous Proceedings; my Lord Mayor he comes and doth appoint an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day for them, and diſcharges them at that time. We will make appear to you, that it was always his Right in all times, both to Summon a Common Hall, and diſſipate it, and appoint them another day, or to Diſſolve them, as the Mayor did ſee cauſe. The Mayor having according to the ancient manner Adjourned this Court, the Sheriffs they proceed, do not only refuſe to obey, but they proceed, and make Proclamation, That it is not in the Power of the Mayor, taking upon them that which never any Sheriffs did in any time, they make Proclamation contrary to what the Mayor had done, and continue the Poll, and proceed and Proclaim the Mayor had uſurped that power which was theirs, though afterwards they transferr'd the Supream Power to the Livery-men: But I think no age will ſuffer that the Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ower ſhould be in the Livery-men, that are expreſly appointed to act by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council, which is indeed the Repreſentative of the whole City. But this, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntlemen, being done by the Sheriffs, having Uſurped the Power of the Mayor, they did proceed in a riotous manner; when the Mayor attempted to go out of the Hall, they ſtruck him, ſtruck his Hat off, and preſſed ſeveral of the Aldermen, the Evidence will make out in what an Outragious manner it was carried on. If the others had made Oppoſition, how ſoon had all been in Confuſion upon this Uſurpation, that the Sheriffs had ſet up for themſelves, that they are the Delegates of the People, and muſt appear to be the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the City of <hi>London</hi>; I think the Citizens themſelves will never endure, that thoſe that are but County-Officers, ſhould ever invade the Government of the Corporation. Gentlemen, We will ſhew you the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of this, and you have nothing to enquire after, but whether they are Guilty of the Riot, or no.</p>

               <p>My Lord, We will call our Witneſſes, and prove our Caſe by theſe Steps. For the Queſtion, That whether or no the Defendants in the Information were Guilty of a Riot, in continuing the Aſſembly after my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49826:7"/>
Lord Mayor had adjourn'd them, we will prove it by theſe ſteps, that it is in the Power of the Lord Mayor to call a Common Hall, and adjourning the Common Hall: That my Lord when the Common Hall was Aſſembled for the purpoſe of Electing Sheriffs, that he did Adjourn the Common Hall; and that contrary to his Adjournment the Sheriffs continued it, declaring my Lord Mayor had no Right ſo to do. And that afterwards my Lord Mayor commanded them to depart, and they continued their Aſſembly there in a very Riotous manner: And as my Lord Mayor came down, they offered Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies to his Perſon, and they continued the Aſſembly there in a Riotous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and commended the Sheriffs that did aſſert their Right, following them in a Riotous manner into <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> crying out in a factious manner, <hi>God bleſs the Proteſtant Sheriffs.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We would call our Witneſſes, but for the ſake of the Gentlemen of the Jury; and that the thing in queſtion may be more intelligible, I beg leave to acquaint your Lordſhip with the Methods that have always been obſerved in the Elections of this City. My Lord, We will make it appear, and I think it will not be doubted by any man that knows the City of <hi>London,</hi> That Common-Halls are always Summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Intimation of the Mayor; for the Mayor himſelf at any time when he finds an occaſion either for the Aſſembling of a Common-Councel, or the Aſſembling a Common-Hall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iſſues forth Precepts, (they are words that you Gentlemen do underſtand very well) to Summon a Common-Hall, or Common-Councel, as he thinks fit: It is very true, though they do uſually make Summons for <hi>Midſommer-Day,</hi> yet <hi>Midſommer-Day</hi> being a publick and notorious Day appointed for the Choice of ſome particular Officers, they are not ſo exact in the Summons for that Day; for they do preſume that every body takes notice of the Buſineſs of that Day: But whereas in the Record there is only notice taken concerning the Election of Sheriffs on <hi>Midſommer-Day,</hi> it is notoriouſly known to all Gentlemen that are Inhabitants in <hi>London.</hi> There is alſo on that day a Choice of Chamberlain and Auditors of the <hi>Bridg-houſe,</hi> and Chamber Accounts, and ſo down to Ale-Conners; and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of <hi>London, quâ</hi> Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> in theſe Elections, are no more in the Caſe, than any private man is; That as ſoon as the Election of theſe Officers is diſpatched, (for I my ſelf have had the Honour to ſerve the City ſome time, and know their Methods very well, therefore I take the liberty to explain it to ſome of theſe Gentlemen that are Foreigners.) My Lord, I ſay, as ſoon as ever this is done, an Account is given to the Mayor and Aldermen, and the Mayor orders the Diſſolving the Aſſembly: And, my Lord, it was frequent, before people were ſo ambitious to come into the Office of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, as they have been within two or three years laſt paſt; till which time it was not known that People were fond of the Office; for they uſed <hi>to go a Birding,</hi> as they call it, to get in Perſons that would Fine off from the Office, rather than undergo the burden of it; and when that was done, then the uſual Method was to call another Common-Hall for the Election of another: But never made application to Mr. Sheriff to let them have a Common-Hall, but the common way was to go to my <hi>Lord Mayor's</hi> Houſe, to know his Pleaſure, and he of himſelf appoints a Common-Hall at ſuch time as he prefixes, and then intimates the purpoſe of their meeting, and orders the Sword-bearer, or other Officer that is Attendant upon his Perſon in his Houſe, to ſend forth Precepts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and there may be ſometimes but one Sheriff at a Common-Hall: I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49826:7"/>
have known it ſometimes when there hath been never a Sheriff, and yet they have not thought they have wanted a Judge, of that Aſſembly; but, my Lord, when all the matter is over, and perſons are declared to be choſen into this or that, or the other Office, in the Common Hall, then an Officer of the City; not an Officer of the Sheriffs, but an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer which is called by the name of the <hi>Common Cryer</hi>; he makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation upon the Huſtings, where my Lord Mayor is Judge, for all Gentlemen to depart for that time, and to give their attendance there at another Summons. And now, my Lord, to make the thing a little more intelligible, there is a difference between the Choice of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Officers and the Corporation Officers; For at the Election of City Officers, the <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> the <hi>Common Cryer,</hi> and Town Clerk, are the Officers that attend and manage the Common Hall, where my Lord Mayor is looked upon to be the Superintendent; but at the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parliament men, the Writ is directed to the Sheriff, and they interpoſe in all the management, and then the <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cryer</hi> have nothing to do, but at ſuch times the <hi>Secondaries of the Compter,</hi> which are Deputies to the Sheriffs, they come and manage the whole Affair. This I tell you, becauſe I have been pretty well acquainted with the Methods of the City. I do very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I had the Honour to ſerve the City of <hi>London</hi> at that time Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> was Lord Mayor, and there was a great occaſion to try a perſon about the Aſſaſſination of Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and the Queſtion was, Whether they ſhould proceed to a Poll or not, becauſe they were to go to the <hi>Seſſions-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> in order to the trying of that perſon. That worthy Gentleman being then in the Chair, I had the Honour to ſit by him; ordered the Court to be adjourned for a day or two, becauſe they were to go to the <hi>Seſſions.</hi> There was no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Opinion when Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> was <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> nor there was no ſuch thing then, but now the Caſe was altered, for Sir <hi>J. Moor</hi> was <hi>Lord Mayor.</hi> Now, my Lord, Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> like a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, endeavouring to preſerve the Priviledges of the Chair, there happened a Controverſie amongſt the Members of the Common Hall, whereby the publick Peace of the Kingdom might have been very much injured, as well as the Peace of the City much diſturbed. To prevent which, Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> with the advice of his worthy Brethren the Aldermen, came upon the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and found they were all in an uproar, and not cool enough for any Debate; for they were wound up to that height of Fury or Madneſs, that they had not a good word to beſtow upon their Magiſtrates, nor upon him whom their chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate did repreſent. For we muſt tell you, when they cried, <hi>Pray God bleſs the King,</hi> as is uſual for the Officer upon ſuch Occaſions; many cryed, No, <hi>God bleſs the Sheriffs,</hi> the Proteſtant Sheriffs. Whereupon my Lord Mayor for preſervation of the Peace adjourned the Common Hall, and required the Members to depart and come down off the <hi>Huſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>; the Rabble, for by the way a great many of theſe perſons in this <hi>Information,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and the reſt of them, were not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very men, nor concerned in the Election one way or other, but came there on purpoſe to foment and to raiſe up the ſpirits and malignant diſpoſitions of a ſort of people that are Enemies to the Government; they came to foment Quarrels, and not maintain Peace. My Lord, when <hi>my Lord Mayor</hi> came off the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49826:8"/>
came upon him, had him down upon his Knees, and his Hat off, and if ſome Gentlemen had not come in, they had trod him under feet; ſuch an Indignity was then done to the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who, I think I may ſay, deſerved as well from the Government of this City, as any Gentleman that ever preſided in that Office, that before had not been heard. My Lord, We will call our Witneſſes, to prove the manner of the Elections to be as I have opened it, and to prove the matter in the Information.—Call the <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> and <hi>Mr. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi> the <hi>Common Cryer</hi> and the <hi>Sword-bearer.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I have been almoſt 25 Years an Attorney, I always took it that the Serjeant of the Chamber had order to go down to the Clerks or Beadles of the Companies, to ſummon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall by ſuch a day.</p>

I remember particularly when Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> was Lord Mayor, it was about the Choice of <hi>Mr. Bethel,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> and there was a great diſturbance in the Hall; then I came into the Court, and after I had made my Report, I offer'd to give the Paper to the Recorder that then was: Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> he told me that the people wou'd not hear him, and therefore he wou'd not take the Paper. Upon that Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> ſaid to me, Prethee, do thou ſpeak to them, they will hear thee if they will hear any body; for the Hall was in a great uproar, and they call'd to throw me off the Huſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and then I made Anſwer to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>; Sir, It is not the duty of my Office, and when I do any thing that is not my Office, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49826:9"/>
ſhall expect particular Directions. Then, ſaith he, You muſt tell them, I muſt Adjourn them till <hi>Munday,</hi> becauſe I go to the <hi>Old Baily</hi> to try the Aſſaſſinates of <hi>Arnold.</hi> Thereupon the Hall was Adjourned, and Proclamation made to depart; and my Lord Mayor attempting to go, was beat back twice or thrice, but at laſt they let him and the Aldermen go, and kept the Sheriffs and me till Evening. At laſt Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> came up to me, <hi>Mr. Papillon</hi> ſays I, I am glad to ſee you, you will hear Reaſon, ſays he, why do not you go on with the Poll? I told him, my Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or had Adjourned the Hall: Says he, I did not hear it before; but now you tell me ſo, I will go out of the Hall: Says I, Sir, you will do very well to tell the Hall ſo; which he did, and ſome went away; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adjournments were made by the direction of my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, in all your time till this, was there no Uproar? Did ever any Sheriff undertake to Control the Mayor in the buſineſs of putting Queſtions, or taking Votes?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord Mayor's, and the City of <hi>Londons</hi>; I have nothing to do with the Sheriffs, for when there is a Writ comes for the Choice of Parliament men, directed to the Sheriffs, I never do it, but <hi>Mr. Secondary.</hi>

               <p>The firſt Diſpute about Sheriffs, ſince I was Common Serjeant, was about <hi>Mr. Jenks,</hi> and that Poll was taken by the direction of the Lord Mayor, by the Town Clerk and my ſelf; and our Books ſay, If there be a Diſpute in the Common Hall, it muſt be decided as in the Common Council.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Com. Serj.</speaker>
               <p>The Sheriffs did not meddle in the matter.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Peter King.</speaker>
               <p>I have been at a Court of Common Hall 28 years, my Lord, and have been concerned, I never looked upon the Sheriffs to have any concern there. And I do very well remember, Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> I do remember and know; they did always in ancient times take advice of the Officers by, and they never did eſteem themſelves in thoſe days, to be any more concerned than as the beſt Officers to be preferred before the reſt: When my Lord ſays, Come up, they come in order, the Maſters and Wardens of the Companies.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was there never any difference about the Votes?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. King.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>When there was a Queſtion made to know who had the moſt, who decided it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. King,</speaker>
               <p>They generally asked one another, What do you think, and what do you think? I ſpeak for 20 years together ſince the King came in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I hope in God there hath been a King in <hi>England</hi> for 20 years, though perhaps ſome of the Sheriffs that were then in Debate, would have had none.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Thomſon,</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King,</hi> I only deſire to know this of you, becauſe I know you know Queſtions; I deſire, my Lord, to know whether he ſpeaks it to be a matter of Right, or his Opinion; for we know Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Opinion will go a great way in this matter. Do you ſpeak it as a thing of Right, or as your Conceptions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. King,</speaker>
               <p>Sir, it would be a thing very confident in me to determine of the Right, but only as I always eſteem'd it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>King,</hi> I would ask you this Queſtion; Pray do you tell your belief upon the Obſervation that you have made from time to time of the Practice there?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. King,</speaker>
               <p>An hundred and a hundred Common Halls I believe I have been at.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. King,</speaker>

               <p>The Officers ask one another, who they think has moſt? that doth not give them the Juriſdiction, that they chuſe Officers without the Lord Mayor or Sheriffs: but, for ought that I ſee, theſe Officers have had more to do about the Choice than the Sheriffs have.

               <p>Firſt of all, when they put any Queſtion for any Officer in the Common Hall, the uſual way of putting the Queſtion is, <hi>As many of you as would have ſuch a man to be ſuch an Officer, hold up your hands:</hi> And if the Election be clear, Proclamation is made preſently: If not, the Common Serjeant asks, <hi>Who they think hath the Majority?</hi> Which being declared, they acquieſce.

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</speaker>
               <p>He did diſſolve the Hall, and ſo hath every Lord Mayor ſince. My Lord, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, I perceive this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes a Queſtion, whether ever there was an Adjournment of a Common Hall before ſuch a time as the Election of Sheriffs was over. I will give you an Anſwer to that Queſtion, and a very fair one, and a plain one: I ſay, till the time of <hi>Bethel,</hi> in <hi>Sir Robert Clayton</hi>'s Mayoralty, there was never ſuch a thing as a Poll for Sheriffs.</p>

               <p>My Lord, they have laid in the Information, That the Sheriffs are duly Elected for one year next following, from the Eve of St. <hi>Michael</hi>; now prove your Election to be for that year you have laid in your Information.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Thomſon,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, they have certainly in Fact miſtaken their Information. My Lord, They do declare that the Common Hall was held, according to Cuſtom, For the Election of Sheriffs, to hold that Office from the Eve of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> for the year next enſuing: Now, my Lord, that is not ſo in Fact, nor never was, for the Election is for a year to commence on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Day. They take on the Eve the Office upon them, but they do abſolutely exerciſe the Office for a Year from that time, from the Eve. Now, my Lord, we ſay, that Day is excluded; we are ſure it is a Common Caſe, it is known very well; as in a Leaſe, the <hi>Habendum</hi> from any Date, the Day of the Date is no part of that Leaſe, it is excluſive and no part of the Term, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Lord, if they do not prove it as they have laid it, we hope they will be non-ſuited.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Weſton,</hi> Pray will you tell my Lord and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what Directions you had from my Lord Mayor, and how he was uſed when he came out of the Hall?</p>

               <p>My <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> ſent me, my Lord, to the Sheriffs under the <hi>Lumbard-houſe</hi> twice to come up to the Council-Chamber, and they told me: One told me, he was upon the King's Buſineſs; and the other ſaid, he could not come; and about half an hour after, my Lord, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff <hi>Pilkington</hi> came up to my Lord Mayor into the Council-Chamber, and then immediately came down to the Court of Huſtings, and Mr. Common Cryer by my Lord Mayor's order, did Adjourn the Court from <hi>Saturday</hi> till <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, and as we were coming out of the Hall, when Mr. Common Cryer had Adjourn'd the Court, and ſaid, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> a great part of the Hall hiſs'd; and but that there were ſo many honeſt Gentlemen about my Lord, I was afraid my Lord would have come to ſome miſchief; but coming to go into the Porch-yard, I ſaw his Hat off, and I went to catch his Hat, and caught one of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers by the head, that was knocked down, or fell down, that held up

his Train. My Lord, the Sword was at that diſtance, farther then it is between your Honour, and where I ſtand, and crouded far away, and when my Lord came out into the Yard; Gentlemen, ſays he, I deſire you would go home to your Lodgings, and commanded them in the <hi>King's Name</hi> to depart: and ſays he to me, Pray go you back, and let the Sheriffs know, and tell them I have Adjourn'd the Court to <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> Upon my Lord's Command I went back to let the Sheriffs know that my Lord had Adjourned the Court till <hi>Tueſday.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, if your Lordſhip pleaſes, I would deſire to know what account any of them can give of the opinion they had of the King, to be ſure they had a great opinion of his Repreſentative: But my Lord Mayor I find was ſo extraordinary civil, that to this Rabble he muſt not only pull off his Hat, but fling his Hat on the ground to them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Thomſon,</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Weſton,</speaker>
               <p>Now I deſired them to keep back; my Lord Mayor's Friends did preſs back as much as they could to preſerve my Lord Mayor; they preſt more forward, as the other kept back, and I deſired them to forbear; nay, commanded them in the <hi>King's Name,</hi> and upon their Peril and took my Cane to ſtrike at ſome of them.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He did ſo. Do you think a Magiſtrate is to be crouded and preſt upon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Weſton,</speaker>
               <p>I ſtruck at them, and ſaid, Gentlemen, keep back, and entreated them and commanded them, and all would not do.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was not in the Hall when Proclamation was made, but I heard them cry out, No <hi>God bleſs the King</hi>; and I heard them cry out, <hi>Down with the Sword; No Lord Mayor, no King.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I hope that will not much prevail in this place, but I hope it doth juſtifie my Lord Mayor, for endeavouring to diſperſe the Rabble that came together to that height when the King was <hi>prayed for,</hi> to cry out, <hi>No King, No Lord Mayor.</hi> And we don't give this in Evidence againſt any one perſon, for it was done in a tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but they were ſo fond of this man, as that they reſcued him from him; and to fix it upon them, we will prove they were every one of them concerned in the Riot.—Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> What account can you give of this matter?</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I am Councel for the Defendants, and my Lord, the queſtion is under favour, Whether theſe perſons taken for Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, whether they be guility of this Riot, as it is laid in the Information. We are now upon as ſpecial Caſe, and the queſtion is, Whether guilty, or not guilty. My Lord, in the firſt place for the Cries, what the Cry was, hath been too often mentioned; for thoſe Cries there is nothing at all fixt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49826:20"/>
upon any perſon that is Defendant; all that is charged upon us, is, That we were in the Hall it ſeems, and becauſe there was this noiſe heard, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt be guilty. In this crowd where we are, I hear hiſſing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at to'ther end of the Hall, which of us are concerned in it, is a hard matter to judge; it is a hard matter, and it were very well, and it had been very happy, if ſome of thoſe perſons, had been apprehended for their hiſſing. I won't ſay, Gentlemen, that either one party or to'ther in the Conteſt made the noiſe of hiſſing, but there is nothing of it fixt upon any of us. Our Caſe is this, my Lord, with favour, when we have ſtated our Caſe and proved it, we are very innocent, and not guilty of the Riot. In ſome meaſure it hath been ſtated on the other ſide. They ſay in the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that the Lord Mayor called a Common-Hall; we don't diſpute that matter, we agree it, that the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> is the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant but to make ſuch and inference, That becauſe the Lord Mayor is the King's Lieutenant in the City of <hi>London,</hi> that he muſt execute all the Offices in the City, is of no credit in the world; ſo that they are miſtaken in that. Men are bounded in their Offices. The Lord Mayor does not execute all the Offices in the City though he be Lord Mayor. The queſtion between us is this, Whether the Sheriffs, in this caſe did more than their Office as Sheriffs of the City of <hi>London.</hi> There is a ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty due to the Lord Mayor. Another thing we agree with them, we agree it is in the Lord Mayor only to call theſe Com-mon-Halls, and as Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Jefferies,</hi> that hath been in a good Office in the City, he agrees it himſelf, and it is apparent, there are ſome fixt days for Election; but yet though there be fixt days for Election, yet there muſt be that Formality of a Summons from the Lord Mayor to the City to meet in order to the Election of Sheriffs for the City of <hi>London</hi> and other Officers, that we do agree that my Lord Mayor hath the Power of calling Common-Halls, and he is the proper Officer. We agree alſo, Gentlemen, that when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done, for there is nothing in vain in nature, and there is nothing in Government that ſhould be in vain, when the buſineſs is done, my Lord Mayor is to bid the Company <hi>Fare them well,</hi> which you may call diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Common-Hall; we agree that to be commonly and uſually done by my Lord Mayor. But herein we differ, which we are to try, the right of the Office of Sheriffs being the queſtion, it is a queſtion of right, and I don't ſee the Government is concerned one way or other.</p>

               <p>Upon my word I do ſee it, and ſurely you muſt be blind, or elſe you would ſee it too, when a company is got together, no <hi>God ſave the King, No King, no Lord Mayor.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I thought I had opened it plainly, I ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great many people, I deſire, my Lord, this may be very well heard. I thought I had ſaid very well, from all theſe Noiſes and Cries we are all innocent, we juſtifie nothing of it, only we would have been glad if they had apprehended any man that made that noiſe; it had been a very happy thing if one of them, or all of them had been Defendants to be tryed. My Clients are Defendants, they are innocent and unconcern'd, it is a Crime committed by ſome where theſe Gentlemen were by, but they are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; we hear hiſsing at t'other end of the Room, it was an ill thing, and of a Treaſonable complexion; but for theſe Gentlemen they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The Queſtion between the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of the City, is a Queſtion of Right between the Mayor and Sheriffs, Whether it be the Prerogative of the Mayor, or the Right of the Sheriffs? and I ſay,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49826:20"/>
under correction again, this Queſtion, Whether the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> may adjourn the Common-Hall to a certain day, is a queſtion of Right Whether he can do it or the Sheriffs; And I don't ſee what conſequence it can have upon the Government. The Lord Mayor is the King's Deputy, the Sheriffs they are the King's Officers, and the Queſtion is, Whether it be in the Lord Mayor or the Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to adjourn it? They are very good Subjects, I am ſure this very Year they are ſo; therefore I wonder at theſe Gentlemen of the King's Counſel, that will meddle with the Government, and ſay the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is concerned in this; I appeal to any man if there be any more concern in this. I ſay this, here was a Common-Hall call'd, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Cuſtome in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and here is a ſingle Queſtion, Whether theſe Sheriffs did any more than their duty; whether they were guilty of a Riot in continuing this Poll. Gentlemen, this is the method we ſhall take. Firſt of all, it is not proved, that ever the Lord Mayor before this time did ever attempt to adjourn a Common-Hall to any certain time; all the Witneſſes that were call'd, that pretend to be knowing in the Cuſtomes of <hi>London,</hi> the Common Serjeant himſelf, he does not pretend that it was adjourn'd to a day.</p>

               <p>I ſpake to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and he takes it ſo hainouſly at my hand that Facts ſignifie nothing; I do again ſay it, The fact ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing. For I tell you again as Law, it is not denied the Lord Mayor may call, he may diſſolve; then I ſay by Law, without Fact, by Cuſtom, he that can both call and diſſolve, may adjourn to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time. Do not Judges of Aſſize in all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> do it, when a Cauſe is appointed to be tryed in ſuch a County ſuch a day, and it may be it is tryed 3 daies after; and yet I pray find me the Statute or Commiſſion, or find me one thing or another beſides the very Law it ſelf, that doth give them leave to adjourn from time to time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is a mighty difference, but I am only upon fact, theſe Gentlemen will agree it was never practiced before Sir
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49826:21"/>
                  <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s time, what the conſequence in Law will be, that is in your Lordſhips Breaſt, I am now ſpeaking upon the Evidence that this hath not been practiced. What the Law is, for that we are to have your Judgment, which I humbly crave, I will be judged by Gentlemen that are my <hi>Seniors</hi> and better read in this matter; but, my Lord, a man may have a power of calling and diſſolving, and not of adjourning, it may be ſo. But, my Lord, admitting it to be ſo for this time, yet, my Lord, whether we are guilty of a Riot, take the Circumſtances of our Caſe. Whether the Right of adjourning be in the Sheriffs, yea, or nay, it is a queſtion of Right, and I had rather apply my ſelf to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than to the Jury. If there were a Queſtion of Right between the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs, it may be admitted by our Councel that it was his Right to adjourn the Court, and probably the Sheriffs might be in the wrong, and the Lord Mayor in the right. The Lord Mayor adjourns the Court, and they continue it, they go on with the Poll, and go on with the execution of their Office as they apprehended, if they were ſtill for their Right, I hope your Lordſhip will not make this a Riot. <hi>My Lord,</hi> for the Circumſtances that followed, the noiſe that was made, which I don't love to mention, if, I ſay, they were guilty of this, I am ſilent; but if they did no more, as I hear no more proved upon them, then continuing the Poll, then, I ſay, it will be very hard to make them guilty of the Riot. And another thing is this, <hi>my Lord,</hi> we all know, if there were a thouſand Electors, any man knows, that when there is a queſtion upon an Election, it is impoſſible ſuch a thing ſhall be carried on but there will be reviling, ill language, and the like; and to turn all theſe things to a Riot, a thing ſo common from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Elections to this time, if there be diviſion and polling, there will be ſomething you may turn to a Riot. But I ſay this, they have not inſtanced in any one Defendant, that he was guilty of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act that amounted to a Riot in it ſelf, they have not inſtanced in one. They ſay of Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> That he was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Sheriffs, that they did inſiſt upon the Rights of the City, he took it to be the Right of the Sheriffs; <hi>And,</hi> ſaies one of them, <hi>I will ſtand upon it, Bethell</hi> that had been Sheriff. Now we will call our Witneſſes, we will prove what hath been the conſtant practice in the City, we will prove the methods of adjournment; and, <hi>my Lord,</hi> this is to be ſaid which your Lordſhip will obſerve, That the Sheriffs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the Court to the very ſame time with my Lord Mayor; ſo that it was no more than to bring the matter to an iſſue in this caſe.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Fr. Winnington.</speaker>
               <p>Spare me a word in this caſe, <hi>my Lord.</hi> There is no Evidence produced againſt <hi>Trenchard,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Jekyl</hi> the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor againſt <hi>Bifield,</hi> nor <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of theſe there is no queſtion but they are as if they were out of the Information, I muſt beg leave for a word or two as to thoſe Defendants, that they have offered ſome Evidence againſt. The queſtion is now before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Whether they are guilty of a Riot or no? <hi>My Lord,</hi> for ought I ſee, it will ſtand upon a nicety of Judgment; yet if there be not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough, Gentlemen, to make the Defendants guilty of a Riot, then it will clear the Defendants. My Lord, as to thoſe words, that really were words that ought to be inquired into, who they were that ſpoke them in relation to his Majeſty; I think it was a very ill thing of thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49826:21"/>
men that ſaw them, that they would not neglect all manner of buſineſs to ſeize them, I think it was a duty to fix upon them: but, <hi>my Lord,</hi> there is no Evidence to put it upon any of the Defendants. <hi>My Lord,</hi> that being pared off, now the queſtion is, That the meeting together was lawful, that is agreed; then when they came together, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I do think that if we do rely upon the Evidence, it will be a mighty hard thing to make this a Riot, ſetting aſide thoſe villainous words that were ſpoken, which cannot relate to the Defendants. Suppoſe, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that among the Electors, the whole Common-Hall of the City, there doth a diſpute ariſe before the Election is over concerning the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sheriffs or the Lord Mayor, ſome men are of one opinion, ſome are of another; and their Evidence, Mr. <hi>Peter King</hi> and another, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys, I asked the queſtion ſeveral times, <hi>Did the Lord Mayor of</hi> London, <hi>ever interpoſe or concern himſelf in adjourning the Hall, till the Election was quite finiſhed?</hi> and they ſaid <hi>No</hi>; Then, my Lord, I muſt ſay it as to theſe particular Defendants, in ſuch a concourſe of People as was met there, it is as ſlender a proof of a Riot as ever was, and intimates that the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> they that happen not to be the greater number, they that loſe the Election, may be found guilty of a Riot in chuſing other Officers as well as in the buſineſs of Sheriffs; which being ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a point, I think it will be a very ſevere expoſition, my Lord, to make this a Riot. But now for the Matter, we will call to your Lordſhip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witneſſes, men that have been Magiſtrates in the City, that it was alwaies looked upon, that my Lord Mayor, as he is the Principal Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he gives notice for Common-Halls; and when the ſeveral Electors are met, and the buſineſs is over, he directs them to go home, and diſſolves them; but my Lord Mayor meddles not in every little adminiſtration of the Election of Officers, but leaves them to inferiour Officers, the Sheriffs and others, that is their duty, my Lord, with ſubmiſſion, they Poll them and ſend them home during the Election, therefore by Law they do this; for, my Lord, the Cuſtome of a City, and the Cuſtome of a Place, is the Law of the place; and if the Cuſtome of the place hath been, that the Sheriffs have been the perſons that have managed it, it is their Right; but the Common Serjeant he ſaies he hath the ſole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; Then if it be as Mr. Common Serjeant ſaies, if that muſt go, upon my word, Gentlemen, your Priviledges are reduced to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle compaſs.—</p>

               <p>They did conferr one with another who they took to have the moſt Voices, and ſo reported it, not that he did claim any thing in his own right, but as an Officer of the City. Now it is plain, and I think there is no inconveniency falls upon it, if an Officer acquaints my Lord Mayor, according to the beſt of our Judgment we think ſuch a man hath the moſt Voices, that does not give him a right for him to make an Officer, not at all.</p>

               <p>I ſay what he ſaid in his Evidence, but one of the Attornies ſwears that they have all equal power, I wonder then who ſhould make an end of the buſineſs. My Lord, we will call to your Lordſhip Ancient Citizens, that have been frequent at Elections, to give you an account that the Sheriffs always had the management, that my Lord Mayor never concerned himſelf, till he had notice it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49826:22"/>
and if that be ſo, and the practice hath been ſo, then I don't ſee under favour my Lord, how they will make this a Riot; that is the Caſe.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have never heard this matter hath been in queſtion till of late, ſo I cannot declare much upon my own knowledge how the truth of fact is or ſhould be, I can only ſay this, what the practice hath been. When I came to the Chair I did endeavour to know my duty and to do it. The firſt time I had occaſion to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this matter was in the year of my Mayoralty, I did then acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cuſtom Summon a Common-Hall, when I had ſummon'd it, there was a perſon preſented to the Hall I had drank to; the Hall did refuſe him, and there was a great noiſe and hubbub upon it, and we found a way to accomodate that matter, and left them to chuſe two Sheriffs for themſelves. I retired into this Court together with my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Mr. Recorder, that was then, We ſent for the Sheriffs up to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter, they told us that they could not agree the thing, there was 4 Perſons in Nomination, but they had granted a Poll. After this we went down into the Hall, of that Mr. Common Serjeant hath given ſome account, and Mr. Serjeant <hi>Jefferies,</hi> I ſhall to the beſt of my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry give the beſt account I can of it, I ſhall only tell you what I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be my duty, I do not determine what the practice was, but what I underſtood to be my duty. When we came down into the Common-Hall to declare how the matter ſtood, and that a Poll was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon and granted, we would have adjourned the Court to a longer time, but the people cryed out to go to the Poll preſently. I was, as you have been told by Mr. Common Serjeant, to go to the Tryal of one <hi>Giles</hi> upon the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Arnold,</hi> to the <hi>Old Baily.</hi> I did twice or thrice attempt to get down out of the Hall through the crowd, and was repulſt, the croud was ſo great I could not get through, but was fain to retire back again to the <hi>Hustings</hi> as I remember two or three times. There might be ſome ſuch diſcourſe as Mr. Common Serjeant hath ſaid, but thus far I can remember, that I did both by my ſelf and the Common Serjeant ſignify to them the buſineſs I was about, and ſo many Aldermen as made up a Bench together with Mr. Recorder to manage that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt go, and that I would leave the Sheriffs to manage the Poll, which I thought was their duty.</p>

I left behind the Sheriffs and the Common Serjeant; how long they ſtayed I can't tell, I can upon my own knowledge give no account of them. I was not conſulted to the beſt of my knowledge afterwards, nor did give any particular directions for adjournment. I did not do it for this reaſon, I did not look upon it to be in my power: if I had ſuch a power, I did not underſtand it.</p>

My Lord, about 22 years ago, I did obſerve the practice to be this, when I was call'd into this Office of Sheriff, I took it as a thing for granted, that it was the Sheriffs Office to manage the Common Hall, that I did, as my Lord Mayor's was to have a Sword born before him; I have received it by tradition from all before me, and my own experience. My Lord, I remember when we came to chuſe Sheriffs upon Midſomer day, after the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been there, my Lord Mayor ſaid to me and my Brother Sheriff, Gentlemen, look to your Office; we accordingly went to it and choſe two Sheriffs, one Gentleman that had been drank to by my Lord Mayor, I think
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49826:24"/>
it was Alderman <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

After once that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen withdrew to go to the Council Chamber, they ſaid to us, Now Gentlemen, look to your Office.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49826:27"/>
there is a Mayor to be choſen, and the Citizens have a Priviledge to move their Mayor or continue him, now if it were in the power of the Mayor, and there ſhould happen a queſtion who they were for in a great Number of Electors, if it were in his power to adjourn from time to time, he muſt continue Mayor.</p>

               <p>It is plain he may do it for all your Objection. You know it was agreed by all ſides that Sir <hi>Samuel Starling</hi> the Lord Mayor, had well diſſolved the Aſſembly, that is, in point of Law, and they could not ſay the Aſſembly was in being, yet afterwards there was an Action brought againſt him, and there they laid how that maliciouſly, and to the intent that he who was choſen into the place of <hi>Bridge-maſter</hi> to which he was duly Elected, ſhould be ſet aſide, he goes and diſſolves the Aſſembly, and denied to grant him a Poll, which they ought to have had, yet for all that the Aſſembly was well diſſolved.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I will give your Lordſhip an account of that whole Days proceedings; we came to the Hall, and after Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> Sir. <hi>George Jefferies</hi> had attempted to ſpeak to the Hall, for they were in ſuch a tumult they would not ſuffer him to ſpeak, my Lord Mayor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, there was a very great clamour and noiſe, but at laſt the Queſtion was put, and I came up with the Sheriffs hither and acquainted my Lord, that Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> and Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> had the moſt hands, and that there was a Poll demanded between Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> then the diſpute lay as between <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Nicholſon</hi> and Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> I acquainted my Lord Mayor that was, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> ſaid he would not go down to make Declaration they would not hear him; upon that Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> took a Paper and gave it me, with theſe very words, (it is the greateſt tumult I was ever in in all my life, and I have ſome reaſon to remember it) prethee ſays he, do thou make Declaration to them, for if they will hear any body they will hear thee: Sir, ſays I, becauſe it is not the Duty of my Office I deſire your particular direction; then, ſays he, tell them I muſt Adjourn it till <hi>Munday</hi> becauſe I muſt go to the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> to try the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinats of <hi>Arnold,</hi> whereupon the Hall was Adjourn'd, and in a great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and my Lord Mayor attempting to go out, he was beat back twice or three times, he ſpake ſomething to them, and they went away, leaving me and the Sheriffs upon the Huſtings, and there they kept us Priſoners till ſix or ſeven a Clock at night. On <hi>Munday</hi> when we came to Poll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by his direction, I went to his Houſe and he gave me direction to go with the Sheriffs to Adjourn it, afterwards there was a Court of Aldermen purpoſely call'd, and upon their direction I took the Poll and kept it, and and every Adjournment was made by his particular direction to me.</p>

I remember the coming up, and I remember that Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> was not willing to go down there was ſuch a hubbub, I remember that very well. The particular words I ſaid to him I cannot charge my memory with; we had diſcourſe. I remember the Adjournment, and we diſcourſt of the Adjournment below, we made Proclamation, but the noiſe was ſo great they could not hear, and upon my attempting to go out I was beaten back twice or thrice, and then we were fain to let them know the buſineſs we went about as well as we could, and then they let me go, and I left the Sheriffs with them to agree of the manner and methods of Polling. There were ſeveral Adjournments made afterwards, I can't charge my ſelf with it, I might be particularly conſulted, but for the particular times of Adjournment, I did not think my ſelf concerned in point of reputation, if I thought I had been blameable I ſhould have concerned my ſelf to have given more particular directions.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> tells you this, my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Will. Gulſton.</hi> were in treaty about buying theſe Lands that very Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, ſays Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> about Noon, afterwards my Lord went to the <hi>Hay-Market</hi> and ſtaid there till evening, and my Lord and Sir <hi>Will.</hi> were together again at Night. My Lord, this caſe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your Lordſhips directions. It is very plain that my Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath the ſummoning the Common-Hall and when the buſineſs is done he hath the diſcharging them. My Lord, if it be true what Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and others ſay, they tell you that in all their time, their opinion is ſo, that it belonged to the Sheriffs and not to the Lord Mayor, what may be the conſequence lies in your Lordſhips opinion. Now for the conſequence of it, if it were no more than a matter of opinion and right, and the Sheriffs inſiſt upon it, Are theſe Defendants and the Sheriffs guilty of theſe outrages? For there is nothing proved upon them. This don't make them guilty of any thing more than a bare continuing the Poll. Therefore, my Lord, I muſt ſubmit to your direction how far the Jury will find us or any of us guilty of a Riot in this caſe.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we agree they did continue the Poll, and the Defendants did apprehend it was lawful for them ſo to do, if the Jury ſhould think they did miſapprehend what was the ancient uſage of the City, if your Lordſhip ſhould be of Opinion that by Law the Lord Mayor ought to do it, yet I do ſay, it being ſo probable a Caſe, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon it will not make it a Riot: Your Lordſhip will be pleaſed I hope to take notice of it, if they find the Mayor hath power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ it.</p>

               <p>If men do lawfully meet together, if by chance they fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears, and commit many miſdemeanours, this can never be a Riot.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49826:30"/>
themſelves do not contradict it, that my Lord Mayor is the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of this City, both for calling all your Aſſemblies and for diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, they won't pretend againſt this, but indeed they make a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether my Lord Mayor can adjourn or no. Neceſſity of Affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it ſome times, if there be ſuch a Tumult, ſuch an interruption, that they cannot proceed orderly, or if the matter be ſo long that they can't determine it in one Day, there is a neceſſity that there muſt be an adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another time, and they give you no inſtances, Gentlemen, that ever the Sheriffs in any Age did attempt it, never any Sheriff made an adjournment of his own accord. Mr. <hi>Love</hi> he gives no inſtance of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, he only tells you of his Supremacy at that time when my Lord Mayor had nothing to do with it, and Gentlemen, at that time you muſt remember when he was Elected, the Law was otherwiſe when Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was elected, then the Sheriffs were the Tribunes of the People, and they had ſhut my Lord Mayor quite out of their <hi>Common-hall,</hi> and declared that he had no power to diſſolve or adjourn them. The next inſtance is that of Sir <hi>Robert Claytons,</hi> and how do they make that out? Sir <hi>Robert Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſwears only upon his Memory, and what is that? he remembers juſt nothing. He does think the common Serjeant does ſpeak Truth in ſome things, but he can't remember other things. But we prove not only an Adjournment from <hi>Saturday</hi> to <hi>Monday,</hi> but other adjournments by ſpecial direction from Sr <hi>Robert Clayton.</hi> So that whatever Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did fancy of the Authority of Sheriffs, to tell my Lord Mayor he had nothing to do therewith, yet that my Lord Mayor certainly is the chief Magiſtrate, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all along to this preſent time, till within theſe Two or Three years, and when ever there was an adjournment we have proved it to you that it was by my Lord Mayor. So that it is nothing like the Caſe, put by the Gentlemen on the other ſide, there was never any ſhadow of pretence for right. Whoever knows <hi>London</hi> muſt know the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> are not Officers of this Corporation as Sheriffs, but they are the Kings Officers of the County granted to be choſen by the Citizens: They are in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes Judges, for chooſing Parliament men, but in no Corporation Act whatſoever: So that Gentlemen, you ſee there is no pretence for that: But admit there were, what is it like the Caſe when a Man ſaies claim to a Wood and he ſends Three or Four Perſons, or half a Dozen Perſons to cut it down? yet, Mr. <hi>Wallop,</hi> notwithſtanding your Authority, thô that be not a Riot, it is a Rout, where you will ſend ſuch a Number to raiſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the Kings People, and they will continue together after they are commanded to depart by a Magiſtrate. But it is a different thing where men will concern themſelves in a matter of publick Government, as if any Man ſhould pretend he hath the Kings Commiſſion to take your Lordſhip off the Bench.</p>
               <p>So that here is quite a different thing, this relates immediately to the Government, here's the publick Peace of the City is in danger, and if my Lord Mayor had been a Perſon of great Spirit, and had preſently raiſed others to have ſuppreſt this Riot, then the City had been in a fine Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by theſe People that would have no <hi>God bleſs the King,</hi> but God bleſs the Sheriffs. There is no pretence of right can juſtifie ſuch a thing. Now, my Lord, for a Riot, this muſt be acknowledged to be, for many to meet together to do an unlawful thing is a Riot.</p>

               <p>And do it, I put in that too Sir. The meeting here is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49826:30"/>
lawful, and it is as certain that my Lord Mayor hath power to Adjourn, that is a conſequence of Law, if the Adjournment be neceſſary, and he is the only Judge of Adjournment, and when he hath Adjourn'd, I do ſay the continuing Perſons together to do that, which if they had ſummon'd them to do had been unlawful, is as much an unlawful thing and a Riot as that. I would fain know if the Sheriffs had ſummon'd all the Citizens together to meet to chooſe Sheriffs, or any others, would any man Queſtion but this is an unlawful Act, a ſubverſion of the ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City, the Uſurping an Authority in the City contrary to the Kings Grant and the Charter. And after they are Adjourn'd, if they will make Proclamation and order the People to ſtay and go on with the Poll, is not that the ſame thing in point of Law? Surely no man almoſt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe but will ſay it is the ſame thing. In the caſe that Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> puts, if there be any diſorders committed precedent to the Magiſtrates diſolving the Society; that will not amount to a Riot, but if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate comes and makes Proclamation for them to depart and they ſtay after, it makes a Riot, if they continue ſtill together, it is rout and an unlawful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. But they ſay there is no Proof that theſe Gentlemen that are in the Information are guilty of the Riot; they are all parties to the Riot, the very being there and giving countenance to it is an unlawful thing. Pray Gentlemen, If Ten men ſhould go to rob a Houſe, and one ſtands off at a diſtance, is not the Tenth man guilty of the burglary? If there be a many perſons together, and Three only do an unlawful Act, and the others give protection, for number is always a protection, are not all theſe Gentlemen guilty? And therefore, Gentlemen, it is hoped you will ſettle the City by deſtroying this pretence, which hath been fluttering in the Air, but hath no ground for it.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an Information againſt ſeveral for a Riot, and it ſets forth that there was a Common-Hall that was call'd by the Lord Mayor for chooſing ſeveral Officers, and that afterwards the Lord Mayor did diſſolve that Aſſembly, and yet notwithſtanding the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, (ſo many as by and by I ſhall name to you that they have given evidence againſt,) they kept together and committed a Riot, it is ſaid ſo particularly in the Information. For the matter in fact that hath been alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated between them, the Queſtion is, whether the Lord Mayor for the time being hath power in himſelf to call an Aſſembly and to diſſolve it, and truly as to this point, even the Council for the Defendants, did one while grant it, but another while did bring Witneſs that did know nothing of the matter, I muſt needs ſay. But for ought I ſee, even until this very time, the Lord Mayor did call the Aſſembly, and he did Diſſolve it, and that they did ſeem to grant even at the beginning of the cauſe. But then they make a diſtinction, but he could not Adjourn it to a certain time. That was a very weak thing, to ſay, that if the Lord Mayor may call and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Hall, that he cannot Adjourn it to a convenient hour, Suppoſe now the buſineſs to be done was not diſpatched ſooner than this time a Night, ſo that upon the matter they muſt be either Adjourn'd till to Morrow or kept in the Hall all Night, does any man think that that Magiſtrate that hath power to call and diſſolve, hath not power to Adjourn? There is no Man doubts of it in Fact or Law, and that it was ſo, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> did that very thing; if there had been no precedent it had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49826:31"/>
been all one. But they make a great deal of buſineſs of it, how that the Sheriffs were the men and that the Lord Mayor was no body, and that ſhews it was ſomewhat of the Common-wealths ſeed that was like to grow up among the good Corn.<note rend="inter">
                     <stage>Here the People hum'd and interrupted my Lord.</stage>
                  </note>— Pray Gentlemen, that is a very undecent thing, you put an indignity upon the King, for you ought not to do it if you knew your Duty, pray Gentlemen, forbear it, it does not become a Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>I will tell you, when things were topſie-turvie I can't tell what was done, and I would be loth to have it raked up now. They might as well (as I perceive they have at another time ſaid) have ſaid, that the power of Diſſolving and Adjourning might have been in the Livery-men, all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, every body, and ſo then if they had been together by the Ears, I don't know who muſt have parted them, that is the truth of it. But I think their own Council are very well ſatisfied both in Fact and Law, that the Lord Mayor for the time being, hath this power of Calling and Diſſolving and Adjourning the Aſſembly. Then there is another thing that is to be conſidered, and that is this, the Defendants they ſay, we did miſtake the Law, it was only a miſtake of the Law and nothing elſe, and we did do all to a good intent, and therefore it muſt not be a Riot. To give you ſome ſatisfaction in that, Firſt, I muſt tell you that a man muſt not excuſe himſelf of a crime by ſaying he was Ignorant of the Law, for if ſo be that turn to an excuſe, it is impoſſible to convict any man, if ſo be he muſt be excuſed becauſe he did not know the Law, then no man will be found guilty. But if it appear that the Defendants did verily believe that the Law was for them that may be conſidered in another place, if ſo be that they were really Ignorant, the fine, it may be, may be the leſs, but it won't excuſe them from all. But truly, in the next place, you muſt conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no theſe Gentlemen were Ignorant, or whether or no they did not in a tumultuary way make a Riot to ſet up a Magiſtracy by the power of the People. For I muſt tell you, I have not heard by the Defendants and I will appeal to your memory, I have not heard before this time that ever the Sheriffs did quarrel with the Mayor, or continue a Common-Hall after the Mayor had Adjourn'd it. As for theſe Gentlemen they could not be Ignorant of it, becauſe the daily practice before their Eyes was for the Mayor to do it. But this was a new notion got into their heads, tho it was otherwiſe before it muſt be ſo now, and one ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would have no Tory Mayor to be Mayor, thus the King ſhould have ſomething to do to ſupport the Mayor by his power for ought I know. Now Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, for the parties that are accuſed to be in it, there is <hi>T. Pilkington, Samuel Shute, Henry Corniſh,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Player, Slingsby Bethel, Francis Jenks, John Deagle, Richard Freeman, Richard Goodenough, Robert Key, John Wickham, Samuel Swinnock</hi> and <hi>John Jekyl</hi> the Elder, ſome Witneſſes are to ſome, and others to others, but ſome of them have ſeven or eight Witneſſes. There is <hi>Pilkington</hi> and <hi>Shute</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> theſe had a great many Witneſſes againſt them, others have two. Firſt, for the Sheriffs and Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> that had been Sheriff but two years before, they kept them together after my Lord Mayor was gone, and to ſee what People they were, No, not God bleſs the King, no, no, but the Proteſtant Sheriffs; ſo that in truth the King muſt be put out of his Throne, to put
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49826:31"/>
theſe two Sheriffs in it. It is not proved that either of theſe did ſay ſo, nor the others neither, but they were thoſe that clung to them, and they would help them, and they would ſet them to rights, and I know not what, and there is no other way to know in this caſe what they were, but by theſe they kept company with, and it may be, I would be loth to ſay ill, it may be it was in order to Dethrone the King as far as they could; for my Lord Mayor, when truly he had Adjourn'd the Hall and was going home he had like to be trod under foot himſelf, his Hat was down, and that was the great reſpect they gave to his Majeſties Lieutenant in the City. It is true it cannot be ſaid who it was, but thoſe were the People that would have no God ſave the King, and thoſe the Mayor had nothing to do with. The Sheriffs they would go on to Poll, and caſt up their Books and would make a diſquiſition who had moſt hands and the like, three hours after my Lord Mayor was gone, there were ſo many that did countenance and foment this ſort of proceedings. There is a ſhrewd Act that was made ſince his Majeſty came in, that the villany of ſome men might be ſtopt, thirteenth, fourteenth of the King, that for words in ſome caſes makes High Treaſons, it is well his Majeſty does not take any ſevere proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but I can't tell you, I would not have men preſume upon it. It can't be ſaid you or you ſaid ſo, yet they kept them together, they were they that kept all this Rabble three hours together; the Lord Mayor does Adjourn the Court, and they muſt have ſome time to be gone, and thereupon would perſwade us they could not get away in three hours, they ask for a Poll, and caſt up the ſcrutiny, and I know not what. There are ſome, and that is my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> how theſe two ſhould come there I know not, they had nothing to do here, and therefore I doubt it will be worſe upon them than upon the reſt, for they had nothing to do here, they muſt come to ſet the Citizens together by the ears. My Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> he ſays, and hath called ſome Witneſſes, that he had buſineſs with Sir <hi>Will. Gulſton,</hi> about the ſale of <hi>Corsfield</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but I do not ſee any of his Witneſſes that do ſay he came to ſpeak with Sir <hi>Will. Gulſton</hi> here, he came here to ſee how the Poll went. But, look you Gentlemen, he hath given ſome ſort of evidence, and the Council did open it very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the evidence did not come fully. If you think he did only come upon real occaſions to Sir <hi>Will. Gulſton,</hi> only to ſpeak to him about that buſineſs, and concern'd himſelf no otherwiſe, then you will do well to find him not guilty, if you do not, you muſt find him likewiſe as well as the reſt, for <hi>Goodenough</hi> he was here to promote the matter. There is one and truly he ſaid, that for his part, as the reſt would have no God bleſs the King, ſo truly he would have no Tory Mayor. And all this Flame I muſt tell you took Fire from this Spark, that the Sheriffs might do what they thought fit about chooſing Officers. Gentlemen, it hath been a long Tryal, and it may be I have not taken it well, my memory is bad and I am but weak, I don't Queſtion but your memories are better than mine, conſider your verdict and find ſo many as you ſhall think fit.</p>
