            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

houſe of <hi>Lorrayn</hi> vnder the title of a <hi>Holy

&amp; to trouble the quiet eſtate of this

began to take roote in the depth of mens

of lawes: <hi>Religion</hi> on both parts crept into
credite in mens conſciences, whence the
licencious libertie of warres had almoſt
expelled it: <hi>Nobilitie</hi> grewe into familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
&amp; gaue ouer partialities and factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
The <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons</hi> after ſo many miſchiefes and
calamities, began to enioye the fruites of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18510:3"/>
their labours, and through ſuch good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as the King had taken, were in poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
ſpeedely to bee freed from the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
and inſolencie of the Souldier. To be
brief, the miſeries and calamities incident
to warres grewe into obliuion, and were
almoſt buried vnder the commodities of
peace, which was mightily proſecuted and
daylie cheriſhed through the Kings wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to whom nothing was in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
as the continuaunce and
eſtabliſhing of the ſame. For if on either
ſide there remained any ſcarre of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
miſeries, which the peace (that yet
had not beene of ſo long continuaunce or
force as the warre) could not cleerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
the King, who had both noted the
miſchiefe and founde out the remedie,
through that dayly care that he tooke for
the affayres of his Realme, was ſurely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
ſuch a path as would not onely haue
ended the calamities of this Realme, but
alſo in ſhort tyme haue reſtored her to
her auncient dignitie, proſperitie, and
brightneſſe. But this neceſſarie path that
ſhould haue led al things to wealth, quiet,
and eaſe, is now broken vp and diſturbed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18510:3"/>
by the houſe of <hi>Lorrayn,</hi> who are vtterly
vnpatient and not able to abide the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie
and peace of this Realme, as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſame repugnant to their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which they knowe them ſelues vtterly
vnable to compaſſe by the proſperitie, but
rather through the confuſion, ruine and
ſubertion of this eſtate.</p>
            <p>It is needleſſe here to rehearſe ſuch their
purpoſes as by the effects are ſufficiently
diſcouered: For it may be euidently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to all men what the pretences and
practiſes of thoſe of that houſe haue bene
as alſo what meanes they haue from time
to time vſed, eſpecially ſince the raigne of
<hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, for the contriuing of
their deuiſes: which, to be brief, do te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to
the extinguiſhing of the houſe of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
and intruding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues into the place
thereof. And for the eaſier atteyning to
ſuch their drifts and enterpriſes, how they
haue ſought to ſet deuiſion in the Realm,
to nouriſh troubles, to weaken the power
of the Nobilitie by the loſſe and ſhedding
of their bloud, to abaſe vnder ſundry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
the credite &amp; auctoritie of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
In the meane time themſelues to take
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18510:4"/>
weapon in hand, to gayne partakers, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe
all that ſtand in their way, and
finally ſo farre as in them lieth, to encroch
the ſtrength and power of this Realm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own hands. This courſe haue they
euer ſince the raigne of <hi>Frances</hi> the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
taken, ſtill gathering ground by little and
litle and employing euery occaſion. They
layd to the Princes of the bloud that they
had practized againſt the perſon of the
young Prince, and vnder pretence thereof
procured the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding and detaining
of the chiefe Princes of the bloud, ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
the reſt from about his Maieſtie, &amp;
bringing into miſlike the moſt auncient
and faithfull officers of the Crowne, yea
euen then, had not God preuented them,
they had ſet foote vpon the very throte of
this eſtate. This being moſt manifeſt, can
not be attributed other then to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicious
practizes: For at that time no
Prince in <hi>Fraunce</hi> openly did profeſſe any
other then the Catholicke Romiſh Relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
neither was there any ſuch queſtion
of controuerſie in Religion, which as yet
was not much ſpoken of in this Realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
No, the quarrell which the houſe of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18510:4"/>
then had and yet hath againſt the
houſe of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> tended vnder ſhadow of
the King to raigne, vntill fitter oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the whiles, vnder his auctoritie and by
his power to rid their hands of the chiefe
Princes of the bloud, who were any ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
blockes in their way, and of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Crowne, as thoſe that could
not brooke their vſurped auctoritie.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe and ſuch like beginnings we
are to iudge of their actions enſuing: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to theſe originalles muſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the effectes, that ſince they haue
endeuoured to diſguize to the ende di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly
to procure them fauour, as ſoone
after they did, &amp; ſtil they endeuour to do:
but the nature of water is neuer better
knowne then at the Spring while it is yet
pure and vnmingled, as likewiſe all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
actions are naturally diſcerned at
their firſt beginnings, before the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
that wee finde haue gathered any
ſleights, and learned to vſe any cloked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation.
This alſo was the reaſon that
moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, immediatly vpon the deceaſe
of King <hi>Francis,</hi> vnder whoſe name they
ruled, becauſe he had married the Scottiſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18510:5"/>
Queene their niece, finding themſelues
thereby excluded from all meanes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
to alter their former prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
For when they perceyued that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
eſtates lawfully ſummoned and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
did call them to accoumpt for their
adminiſtrations and dealings, they began
to cloke their ambition with the vayle of
earneſt zeale to the Catholick Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They, who but fower daies before
had put the <hi>Germain</hi> Princes in ſuch hope
of ioyning with them in the confeſsion of
<hi>Auſbourg,</hi> beginning with the murder of
many perſons of all ſortes, ages and kinds
at <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> did violate the lawes and infringe
the peace and publicke tranquilitie of the
Realme, for the continuaunce whereof,
the ſaid general eſtates had found it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to graunt the exercize of both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and to the ſame end had publiſhed
a ſolemne edict verefied in all the Courtes
of Parliament: which could not bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to force, feare, or other vnlawfull
purſuite, but onely to the ſole conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the benefite &amp; tranquilitie of this
eſtate: With armes during the Kings mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie
they ſeazed vpon his perſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18510:5"/>
with the Queene his mother, who in
wiſedome had conſented to the ſayed edict,
and through iuſt feare of their forces, was
compelled (not without manifold reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the aide of the Princes of the bloud
againſt their tyrannie) to yeeld and in the
ende to auctorize them for her patrons.
All this they did to the ende to entangle
the Princes youth in mallice, hatred and
warres againſt his owne bloud, therby to
weaken the Realme, and to lay it open to
their inuaſions, &amp; to drawe to themſelues
both the auctoritie and force, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
they brought to paſſe) ſo liuing and
raigning in and among armes, which, as
opportunitie ſhould ſerue, they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
to their owne pretences. This foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
did they lay ſo firme, that for the
ſpace of theſe 25. yeres this Realme hath
flowed with ciuill warres, vnder the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
whereof they haue exercized their
mallice, ſatiſfied their reuenging affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and laboured their ambition with the
price of the King and his eſtate, yea, euen
with the price (through their accurſed &amp;
execrable counſayles) of the honour of the
French nation, vnto whom are imputed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18510:6"/>
al the miſchiefes and calamities that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the counſayle of this fatall houſe of
<hi>Lorrayne</hi> hath beene contriued, vntill the
King now raigning by his wiſedome fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
out that the zeale of Religion by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
as a ſhield, was but a pretence: that
the true ſpirite of Religion, whereof him
ſelfe hath more apprehenſion and feeling
then they, doth not perſwade or counſaile
the violation of publick lawes, the breach
of oath, or the tainting of a whole eſtate
with bloud and murder: ſo that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that vndoubtedly it was but a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
to climbe higher: for the preuenting
whereof it was requiſite to ende the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of his Realme by an equal and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
peace conuenient for the preſent
time, referring to God (who only raigneth
in the conſciences) all operation in the
hearts of his ſubiects, for the reuniting &amp;
bringing them all to one Religion.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this peace being made, not by
force, but of the Kings meere motion and
free conſent, which alſo in reſpect thereof
he would haue called <hi>his peace:</hi> this famely
could not brooke it, as men that could
neuer finde any peace in peace, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18510:6"/>
did continually croſſe it by al meanes
and ſubtilties poſsible, yea, they procured
their partakers by all kinde of iniuries,
violences and wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfull attempts to driue
the profeſſors of the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into diſpaire
and impatiencie, &amp; to force them to take
armes, whereby the King might iuſtly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
warre againſt them. Againe, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide they ſollicited the ſayd profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Religion to ioyne with them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
the benefite of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and promiſing them libertie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
vnder whatſoeuer cautions or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
that they could deſire, leauing no
deuice or pollicie vnpractiſed, that might
returne this eſtate into trouble, as kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
that the quiet and peace of the land
fighteth againſt &amp; ouerthroweth all their
deuiſes and purpoſes. Finally, finding the
King more and more reſolued to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
peace, and the profeſſors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
crauing nothing more hartely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Eſpecially my Lord the Duke of <hi>Anieowe</hi>
deceaſed, and the King without iſſue, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by an imagination, which cannot ſpring

but a ſhort time, they reſolued to riſe in
armes and to ſeaze vpon their Maieſties
perſons (had they not beene diſcouered)
togither with the moſt part of the Realm,
ſo to bee the better prouided againſt the
time of their imagined alteration: Alſo
for the drawing of the greater number of
partakers to this conſpiracie, they haue
publiſhed ſundrie titles and pretences, as

            </p>
            <p>All theſe things haue they promiſed to
bring to paſſe before they ceaſe, and yet
how they haue accompliſhed it, I leaue to
all mens conſideration. The true cauſe yet
remaineth vnſpoken of, &amp; is the ſame that
only hath already produced ſome effects.
Viz. <hi>To be armed to the end to preſcribe lawes
to the King vnder colour of rooting out of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes:
and to make away the chiefe Princes of
the blood, and ſuch as are their principall ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingblockes:
that is, thoſe that profeſſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
wherein they were borne and bread vp, ſo
the eaſelier to attaine to the reſt,</hi> and this hath
the King very well marked, euen from the
beginning of their broyles hetherto: For
in ſundry his Letters to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi>
he hath confeſſed, that he knoweth
well enough that this their zeale of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is but a pretence: &amp; that their drifts
do tend againſt his own perſon, his houſe,
and eſtate.</p>
            <p>And in the meane time, becauſe vnder
this pretence they had abuſed many of his
ſubiects, he requireth the ſaid king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:18510:8"/>
to haue pacience, vntil he might eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
diſcipher the colors from the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the pretences from the purpoſes,
aſſuring him that hee findeth the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
directly againſt him ſelfe, and ſo the
offence to appertaine properly vnto him.
Moreouer, vpon the ſame iudgement and
foreſight his Maieſtie hath by his expreſſe
Letters, commaunded al gouernours and
Lieutenants generall, in their Prouinces
and perticuler chardges, to aſſaile their
troopes, and hath proclaimed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them Rebels, Traytors, perturbers of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace, and enemies to the Eſtate:
Vpon the verfication of theſe his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
commaundements in all the Courts
of Parliament, there haue enſued many
decrees, yea ſome haue bene executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that the like meſſages haue bin ſent
to all Princes allied and confederat to the
Crowne, with expreſſe commaundement
to his Maieſties Embaſſadours, to direct
their ſpeeches conformably thereunto,
Viz. That his Maieſtie findeth by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
as well paſt as preſent, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
by the demeanurs and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
aforeſayde, that the inſurrection of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18510:8"/>
thoſe of this houſe, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
their pretences, is one of the fruits
of their firſt attempts, that is, of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie
to roote out the houſe of <hi>France,</hi>
whereof none neede to plead ignoraunce
that liſt but to looke backe vnto, and call
to minde their behauiours theſe 25. yeres
and more, and at once to conſider well
of the ſame.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time alſo that his Maieſtie
proclaymed them Rebels, he reuiued the
publication of his Edict of pacification
throughout all partes of his Realme, as a
teſtimony to al, but chiefly to thoſe of the
Religion, that hee in no wiſe ment to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the demaunds of theſe men, but
did rather condemne them, for that they
ſought to aboliſh the ſayde Religion by
force of armes, his Maieſtie knowing that
to be no meet or lawfull meane, as alſo by
ſundry letters he aſſured the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi>
that he would do nothing preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
either to the ſayed Edict or him, whoſe
cauſe he acknowledged to be his owne.</p>
            <p>All the premiſſes notwithſtanding, it ſo
fell out, that vpon a ſudden a peace was
concluded with thoſe of this famely and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18510:9"/>
league, wherof proceeded an Edict, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the former Edict of pacification, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly
confirmed, &amp; ſo ſolemnly ſworne
vnto by their Maieſties: the Princes of his
blood: all the Courtes of Parliament: and
the chiefe Lords &amp; officers of the crowne,
which alſo had bene ſo freſhly reiterated
and again confirmed, was now vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked,
all exerciſe of religion vnder paine
of death prohibited: all profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
condemned within the tearme of ſixe
months to depart the realme: the townes
for aſſurance, which likewiſe of his owne
accord, and for diuers conſiderations con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning
the welth and quiet of his eſtate,
he had proroged to thoſe of the ſaid reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they ſhould now ſpeedely haba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don,
to the ende to buy peace at the hands of
the ſayed Rebels &amp; traitors, ſo proclaymed
and acknowledged by his Maieſtie, with
the hinderance of his neereſt kinſemen:
and, which is worſe, the weapons commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the hands of thoſe men, to the end
to put the ſame in execution, a matter vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
repugnant to all lawes, which doe
meerly forbid the execution of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to be committed to the aduerſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18510:9"/>
nay more, that he ſhal not aſsiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
notwithſtanding it were to maintaine
the execution of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Hereupon therefore doth the King of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> deſire all good Frenche men in
<hi>France</hi> to conſider what cauſe he hath, to
to lament. In their publike proteſtations,
the conſpirators oppoſed themſelues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
againſt him, and yet he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the ende
to ſatiſfie the Kings minde, and to auoyde
all occaſion of the peoples oppreſsion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
peaceable, and neuer would arme
himſelfe, although he ſee them in armes
round about him. He ſee the Kings mind
enclined to peace, and that euil and ruine
which they openly procured him, might
haue mooued him by all meanes to croſſe
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; yet for the benefite of the realme
he offered to the king ſome entrie to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
by the declaration which expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he publiſhed, yea ſuch as he truſteth all
Chriſtiandome will allowe of, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt
barbarous nation would haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eapted of.</p>
            <p>They ſpake of the rooting out of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and the Chriſtian authors fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it with generall Counſels: he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18510:10"/>
himſelfe to a counſayle, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelfe to be ready to be enſtructed
therby and to yeeld thereto. They craued
reformation and alteration in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of eſtate: ſuch controuerſies and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferents
are by the auncient ſtatutes of the
land to bee determined by the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
to the aſſembly whereof, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it ſhould pleaſe the King to ſummon
them, hee offered to referre, and ſubmit
himſelfe. They requeſted that the King of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> and the profeſſors of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſhould immediatly habandon and
depart the Townes of aſſurance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Kings prorogation of the
tenour of the ſame to them graunted: for
the eſchuing of al miſtruſt he offered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea, which is more,
to diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe and to render into
the Kings handes, both he and the Lorde
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> al gouernments that they
holde within this Realme, conditionally,
that the others might doe the like, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch inequalitie as all men
may eaſely perceiue: for it is not meete to
make ſtraungers equall with the houſhold
children. Moreouer, if there were any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18510:10"/>
controuerſie, the deciſion whereof
might touch or any way concerne him, for
the exempting of the King (whoſe perſon
would be too deare a price to this Realm)
from all daunger and care therof, the ſayd
King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> beſought his Maieſtie
not to miſlike the determining of any
ſuch quarrell, either by his power againſt
theirs, either els, for the preuenting of
publicke calamitie, by his perſon againſt
the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> or by more to more,
as he ſhould think good, within the realm
or without, in whatſoeuer place of free
acceſſe: adding moreouer that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
could conceiue any more conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
remedie for the pacifying of the eſtate of
the Realme, the ſayed King of <hi>Nauarre</hi>
woulde gladly yeelde thereto and not to
ſpare his life therein, moſt humbly withal
beſeeching his Maieſtie ſo farre to honor
him as to let him vnderſtande the ſame.
Howbeit, nothing reſpecting all theſe his
ſo reaſonable offers, thei haue in the mean
time proceeded to a treaty of peace, to
the great preiudice of the eſtate and houſe
of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> yea, of the King himſelfe. A
peace, to ſpeake indifferently, vnwoorthy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18510:11"/>
any ſuch title, as beeing to bee rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
a ſummons of warre, yea, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
God of his great mercie doe preuent
it, ſuch a warre as will be an entry into the
ruine and ſubuertion of the whole eſtate.
A peace made with ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers for the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the home borne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: with
Traytors for the ſpoyle of the obedient
Subiects: with conſpirators, to the end to
commit to their hands the ſworde againſt
himſelfe, to abuſe at their pleaſures. A
peace that hath not ſo much as the taſt of
any thing appertayning to peace; A black
peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A wofull and funerall peace, and of
an vnfortunate aſpect: A peace which the
King ſigned not but with a quaking and
ſhiuering hand: A peace whereto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his bloud and Peers of this Realm,
yea, the moſt Catholicke, haue refuſed to
ſweare, as being the decree of their deaths
and the ſmall ouerthrowe of the eſtate,
which moreouer procureth no comforte
either to the Countrey or Townes, but
hath filled all the good Frenchmen of this
Realme with horror, and reioyced onely
thoſe that nouriſh them ſelues and feede
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their deaths. A peace to ſay the troth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18510:11"/>
which the ſayd Lord King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
not to be imputed vnto the
King, a courteous and iuſt Prince, from
whoſe nature the ſame is too odious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Queene his mother, who in al
her indeuours haue ſought no other but
the tranquilitie of the Realme: but partly
to the daſtardlineſſe of ſome of the Kings
Counſayle, and partly to the trecherie of
other ſome, who are either ſeruants or of
kindred and alliaunce with thoſe of this
league, who alſo, as it is ſufficiently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
in the beginning leſſened and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the miſchiefe, propounding it vnto
him to be eaſely appeaſed, leaſt he ſhould
haue prouided remedies neceſſary there
againſt. But afterward euen at once when
they ſee the power of the league waxe
great, did ſo enlarge it to his view that he
was eaſely perſwaded that himſelfe might
ſoone be by them oppreſſed if ſpeedily he
ſatiſfied not their mindes: and for ſuch
perſons it is well knowne that a number
of them which vnder colour of her ſeruice
accompanied the Queene, did aduertiſe
thoſe of the league of her chiefe ſecretes:
ſome h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld their conuenticles ſo ſoone as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18510:12"/>
they came foorth of his Chamber, what
counſayle they ſhoulde giue him: other
ſome to the end to aſtoniſh him, diſciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto him ſuch armies to the ſuccours
of the league, as neuer appeared, nor had
any other ſubſtance then ayre. Theſe were
the counſailes whereby the King was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from vſing his neereſt kindred, who
would not haue ſpared the ſhedding of
their bloud for his quiet, and who had
both will and oportunitie, and now for
recompence are ſold to the ſtraunger, and
ſo farre as may be, payment is made with
their bloud and liues. Vpon theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayles
hath hee refuſed the offers of his
princely Neighbours, the loyall confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of the Crowne, while by meanes of
the league the Spaniſh coyne trotted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
out <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and found entrie into
the Townes, into the Counſayle, yea, into
the priuieſt parte thereof. Finally, and all
men knowe it, the King was deluded by
thoſe to whom be had as great occaſion
to commit himſelfe, if benefites receiued
might amend mens mindes. And the ſayd
Lorde King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> fully aſſureth him
ſelfe that though by their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and

violence they haue bene able to arme his
armes againſt him, yet at the leaſt his
ſobbes, ſighes, deſires and vowes ſhal fight
in his quarrell, which he hath well founde
&amp; cannot poſsibly forget to be his owne.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lord King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hopeth
that the moſt parte of men of iudgement
in this Realm, eſpecially ſuch as haue had
neereſt familiaritie with their actions or
beene intangled therein, haue beene able
to enter into conſideration of the depth
of the entents of thoſe of the league, and
therefore he wil ſo farre aſſure himſelfe of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they will not ſo blemiſh their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
as to beare armes againſt the houſe
of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> vnder the ſhadow of this edict,
as alſo they ſhould proceede too farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their own knowledge if they ſhould
but thinke to haue taken them vnder the
ſaid pretences, yea, were it for the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of this league alleadged diuers
pretences, as they dealt in one ſo it is like
they doe and will doe in the reſt.</p>
            <p>Of this Common wealth whereof they
made ſo great boaſt and which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
ſundry, euen of the Nobilitie, ſuch
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18510:13"/>
as were fartheſt from ambition, and leaſt
partakers of the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe times,
in this edict there is no worde of it, euen
the firſt day thereof they gaue it ouer.</p>
            <p>Concerning the diſcharge of the third
eſtate which they promiſed, in this treatie
there is no mention thereof, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
by this peace it hath begun to bee
ſurcharged and more and more brought
into ruyne. For, where in their declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they promiſed that their Souldiers
ſhould liue in order and pay all men, it is
well knowne that during all the troubles
of this Realme there haue beene none
more vnruly or diſordered in all ſortes, as
likewiſe that which they proteſted that
they would not attempt againſt the kings
Townes, or therein place any Garriſon
without the conſent or liking of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
hath beene no whit better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
by ſuch as haue ſeazed vpon the
ſame. For in ſome by force, in others that
voluntarily receiued them, vnder colour
of good meaning they haue built Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles
and brought in Garriſons.</p>
            <p>The Nobilitie haue had no better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends:
for in this treaty whom haue they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18510:13"/>
prouided for but themſelues, or thoſe of
their houſe? either whom haue they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the dignities wherof they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to be vnworthely depriued? To
bee briefe, all their doings haue ſtretched
only to the parting &amp; deuiding of France
to thoſe of their famely according to their
platforme layd for the atchieuing thereof
in time to come, cauſing by this peace the
gouernement of ſundry Townes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce
and Prouinces both vpon the
frontiers and in the hart of the Realme to
bee committed to them, wherevpon the
Nobilitie of this Realme is to conſider
what aduauncement they maye expect at
their hands when 24. Princes of <hi>Lorrayne</hi>
muſt be contented and ſatiſfied before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them may by their meanes attaine
to any dignitie.</p>
            <p>As for the due promotions vnto Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
functions and dignities, they haue
in this Edict had no more reſpect (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the Biſhoprick of <hi>Authum,</hi> wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the D. of <hi>Mayne</hi> hath by force pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
his Sonne in Law) then to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues,

notwithſtanding, that ſeeking to take a

pretence for Religion, the ſame ſhoulde
haue bene a principall article and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
recommendation. But contrariwiſe,
entring into information of their liues, it
will bee found that they haue ranſomed
the Prieſts &amp; clergie, prophaned the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
embeſeled the Chalices &amp; Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
with all other the Churche goods, all
haue bene to them Wars, euen in making
their peace. To the ende to be paide their
expences, folowing the ſteppes of the late
Cardinal of <hi>Lorrayn</hi> their vnkle, they haue
propounded and extorted a promeſſe to
alienate Rentes to the value of 100000.
Crownes, and to procure the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
thereto. Prouided alwayes, that the
ſaid coyne may be employed in the reem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing
of them: Beſides it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to all
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in any matter touching the three
Eſtates, without inſtance or purſuit they
diſcharged themſelues at the beginning
of the Parley of this peace.</p>
            <p>Touching the great fauour about the
King, whereof they complaine of ſome
gentlemen whome they tearme in their

whom alſo they ſay they wil abaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

their amitie, that they haue gone about
to buy the ſame by remitting into their
hands the townes of their gouernments,
which by Warres they had ſeaſed vpon &amp;
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away: but to their great ſhame thoſe

            <p>With the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> whome
they had brought into the field vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe
of procuring him that right which
they perſwaded him he might pretend to
the Crowne, they haue played the ſame
partes according to their vſuall maner,
which is to drawe euery mans intereſt
into their owne particular profite: For
hauyng hym once entangled among
them, they made ſo ſmale accompt of his
imagined right, that comming to parley
with the Queene, they were euen aſhamed
to open their mouthes therein: But in
cace there were any greeuous queſtion, or
any difficult or thorny point, they vſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18510:15"/>
him as an inſtrument. <hi>It was my Lord the
Cordinall that motioned it,</hi> and ſo reſerued
them ſelues ſtil to mollefie matters, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
parties, and to wreſt all the thanks
and profit of the treatie vnto themſelues.</p>
            <p>In the meane time one principal point,
whereupon they layde the foundation of
the Catholique Romiſh Religion, was to
prouide that the King ſhould name a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
that profeſſed the ſame, and vnder
that pretence (as alſo vnder the former
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the comon wealth) they drew
to their faction many of the Nobilitie,
which thought they had bene in earneſt,
but their pretence was onely to atchieue
that point which by this peace they haue
obtayned, which was the ſame onely that
they were ſo earneſt for, viz. to ſeaſe vpon
the Frontiers and Kayes of the Realme,
which had bene kept, euen from the late
<hi>Monſier,</hi> alſo vnder ſhadowe of Religion
to haue weapon in hand, ſo to become ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
of the counſayles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to preſcribe
Lawes to the king during his life: to make
away the Princes of his blood, and loyall
ſeruants of the houſe of <hi>France,</hi> and after
his deceaſe, which they imagine to bee at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18510:15"/>
hand, viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to vſurpe this poore eſtate.</p>
            <p>To thinke they either can, or doe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them ſelues able to compaſſe the
rooting out of Religion, the proofe that
for theſe 25. yeeres or more they haue
made is quite repugnaunt thereto. Our
Kings haue not ſpared them ſelues either
by pollicies of peace or rigors of Warres.
The authors of this league haue employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both force and craft. The name <hi>League</hi>
hath nothing encreaſed their meanes:
hath not bred vp any new ſouldiers in the
Realme, neither hath made them greater
Captaines then afore they were, ſtill it is
<hi>Fraunce</hi> part whereof, yea the beſt part wil
not helpe to ſpoyle and deſtroy <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
It is euen the houſe of <hi>Fraunce</hi> which the
houſe of <hi>Lorrayn</hi> doth aſſayle, for their
pretences are ſufficiently reuealed to all
men. This it is that will ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the K. of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> with the auncient officers of the
Crowne, with the Princes of the blood.
with the wiſhes of the King, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſighes
and ſobbes of all good Frenchmen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of Religion, and ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
&amp; weaken the enemy. Beſides that
it is no longer to any purpoſe herein, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18510:16"/>
againſt the ould Albigeois, to imagine the
publication of a croyſade, for there is not
one Towne of <hi>France</hi> that conſenteth to
this partie. There is no member, no part
of the body, no there is not ſcarce any
one ſynew but complaineth hereof. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it <hi>Fraunce</hi> onely that hath proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
this reformation in Religion, but it
hath bene a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon motion in all Eſtates
and nations of our <hi>Europe:</hi> Hole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
haue ſequeſtred them ſelues from
the Pope. Empires haue bene more then
halfe touched, ſcarce is there any eſtate,
but haue ſtirred herein (as all men know
and doe graunt) and feeling it can plainly
find out and eſchue their owne ruine by
that of their neighbours.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, there is no Prince in
<hi>Europe</hi> of whatſoeuer Religion, but thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it ſtraunge to pretend the excluding
of a Prince without audience or teaching,
no other treſpaſſe againſt the lawes of the
Countrey committed, from an eſtate or
ſucceſsion vnto him due. But in Hiſtories
it is euident, what the effects of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
or enuious paſsion can compaſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vpon the leaſt occaſion to the vrging
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18510:16"/>
of an hereſie, as for example. <hi>Philipp</hi> the
fayre was denounced an heretick for that
he would not hold this Realm in homage
of the Pope, and ſo was cut off from the
Church: but ſuch Popes both before and
ſince as haue pretended more modeſtie,
and were not led by the like paſsion haue
held an other opinion and otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
it. A counſayle muſt order all, and
who ſo eſchueth a counſaile, eſchueth the
light, and refuſeth reaſon, as ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſeeke darkneſſe, and to vſe the title
of Religion in vaine.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, ſuch is the miſchief,
the King our Soueraigne, partly through
the violence and conſpiracie of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and partly by the mallice and collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſome of his Counſailors hath bene
forced and brought to conclude a peace,
whereof vndoubtedly, without ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
will enſue his owne ouerthrowe,
the deſtruction of the houſe of <hi>Fraunce</hi>
and the ſubuertion of this eſtate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> as firſt Prince of
the bloud &amp; chiefe Peere of this Realme,

as well of the one as of the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
vnited for the preſeruation of this
eſtate, doe proteſt and declare as enſueth.</p>
            <p>Firſt that their entent neither is, neither
euer was other then to ſee the King well
ſerued and duetifully obeyed of all men,
euery one in his place according to his
calling and eſtate, and themſelues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an example to all, which was to bee
ſeene in theſe late dealings. Namely, that
their deſire te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth only to ſee the Realme
peaceable and quiet, as it was in a good

broyles, and to the ſame end haue withall

            <p>Alſo becauſe heretofore there haue bin
ſundry meanes propounded vnto the
King, whether for deciding the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies

hath the peeminence: the ſayd King
of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> doth moſt humbly deſire his
Maieſtie to call to minde the aforeſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
conteyned in his declaration, bearing
date the 10. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1585. which he ſent
to his Maieſtie, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſigned with his

or there be to him any other motion
made for the contentation of his Maieſtie

            <p>But perticulerly, becauſe theſe of the

               <hi>December</hi> laſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. it peaſed him

the prorogation theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>of at the humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
to him made in the behalfe of his

that ſince by meere force of armes and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

not onely to leaue to them ſuch as
they haue ſeazed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo hath giuen
them others, yea more then in two yeeres
Wars with proſperous ſucceſſe they could

All which notwithſtanding, the ſayd Lord

and for the defence of the Eſtate, as alſo
they are aſſured (which encreaſeth their

proceeded ſo farre as to ſeaze vppon his

            <p>They pray the Queene the Kings Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

to the Kings her children diſplayed them
for ſuch as they are. But chiefly that ſhee,
who hath wonne to her ſelfe the name of

            <p>The ſaid Lo. K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> Lord Prince

Generally, all eſtates and degrees of this
Realme that it tendeth to the ſubuertion

            <p>Concerning Religion, the ſayd Lordes

            <p>They doe exhort each one particulerly
according to his habilitie and calling, in

do declare &amp; acknowledge them

ſuch as the King hath alreadie declared

with the Kings commaundements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>Howbeit, for aſmuch as diuers there are

            <p>Further, in aſmuch as the ſayde Lorde

ſuch as may bee more conuenient to the

            <p>MY Maiſters, vnto you I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
for matters now in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as vnto thoſe whoſe particuler pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſsion
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to prouide that the Church
encurre or ſuffer no detriment. You haue
conſidered theſe late broyles of thoſe of
the houſe of <hi>Guyze</hi> founded vpon many
and very diuers pretences, but finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and al formed into one: namely, to
reſtore the Catholick Church to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and to that ende, to roote out me
and all other whom they pretende to bee
heretickes: To which purpoſe, ſuch hath
beene their force and violence, there haue
enſued an edict almoſt to their mindes.
Now I will not doubt but through your
wiſedomes you doe knowe that they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
an other matter then they ſpeake of.
That is, vnder the ſhadowe of Religion to
haue weapon in hande wherewith to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the chiefe of the houſe of <hi>Fraunce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and ſo to prepare the way to the vſurping
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18510:25"/>
of this eſtate. But I pray you euen in theſe
matters of Religion iudge whether they
or I haue opened the better waye to reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
the Church and to take awaye the
ſciſme which ſo long haue troubled vs.</p>
            <p>I haue bene brought vp in a Religion
which I think holy and true, neither need
there any teſtimonie whether in hart I do
profeſſe the ſame. For otherwiſe I could
haue eſchued ſo many miſchiefes as I haue
beene forced to ſuffer, wherein naturally
man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue no great delight I could
otherwiſe alſo haue purchaſed the Kings
fauour, and loue of his people, which next
after Gods fauour I accompt moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and requiſite for me. The caſe being
ſuch, it is ouer hard and ſo I ſuppoſe your
ſelues will thinke, to deſire that without
any other forme or order I ſhould forſake
my Religion &amp; force both my conſcience
and ſoule: yea, if I ſhould bee ſo wretched
as in ſuch ſort to offend, your ſelues might
iuſtly miſtruſt me in all other matters. Me
that ſhoulde ſayle in that which in the
iudgement of my owne ſoule I thinke to
be my duetie to God, a matter that reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
none can require at my hands. This
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18510:25"/>
is it that as I thinke I haue voluntarily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and which daylie I doe ſtill offer:
Namely, to bee inſtructed in a free &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Counſell, wherein the controuerſies
of religion may be thorowly dobated and
decided, &amp; ſo to yeeld to whatſoeuer ſhall
be determined. A way, as your ſelues are
not ignorant, at all times practiſed in the
Church in like caſes, and that by the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Kings and Emperours in the world:
A way, whereunto you my Maiſters haue
often counſayled the Kings predeceſſors,
and whereby you haue alwaies bene able
to maintaine the priuiledges and rightes
of the French Church againſt many vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations:
To bee briefe, ſuch a waye as the
Church in her greateſt force neuer refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for reducing into her boſome euen
meane perſons, yea, ſometimes one man
onely. And therfore much leſſe ought ſhe
now to reiect or flee from the ſame, now I
ſay, when it ſtandeth vpon millions of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
vpon whole Tounes and large Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
vpon an infinite number of qualified
perſons, euen of the chiefe Princes of the
blood &amp; neereſt to the Crowne, who can
not eaſely bee forced, neither rooted out
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18510:26"/>
without ſubuertion of the eſtate, and yet
being by reaſon perſwaded to chaunge,
may be a cauſe of firme peace in this land,
of a ſtedfaſt revnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholick church,
with the foreiudgement of their perſons
and of a more happy worlde, not to this
Realme only, which were an ineſtimable
gayne, but alſo to all Chriſtendome and
Europe, which neceſſarily muſt haue ſome
feeling of the miſeries and calamities of
ſo puiſſant an eſtate. This my Maiſters, is
the offer that I haue made to the King my
Lord, which now I doe repeate vnto you,
and whereof I call you to witneſſe among
all to whom it may appertaine, to the end
it may be manifeſt both to thoſe that now
liue and to the poſteritie, that I was not
the cauſe of diſquiet in this eſtate, either
any hinderance that the Church was not
reduced into her former vnion, peace and
tranquilitie.</p>
            <p>Where as it is obiected againſt me that
I am an hereticke, you are to ſhewe vnto
the world &amp; of you haue I learned it, that
there is great difference betwixt hereſie
and error. That al that hold an hereſie are
not neuertheleſſe heretickes. That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18510:26"/>
are they who doe proceede either
vpon ambition or obſtinacie, wherof nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can haue place in me whom no man
euer went about to teach, and whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe
they haue by all meanes ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
to caſt of, alleadging no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then a ſtrong ambition. Beſides that
I haue renounced the large path to that
greatneſſe that by the Catholicke Romiſh
Religion lay open vnto me, and haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the contrary way, viz. the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
and contempt, conſtantly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
in that which vſually is called and
I doe accompt reformed.</p>
            <p>But admit it were ſo. It is againſt error
and hereſie that the Church calleth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes,
and conſultations are houlden to
cure the diſeaſed, the Surgeon vſeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iron nor fire, but where his plaiſters
are to weake. It it an euident argument
of paſsion, when they begin conuerſion
with ſubuerſion, and inſtruction with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
With rooting out and Warre,
when they ſhould begin with brotherly
admonition and gentleneſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither is is enough to alledge the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Counſaile of Trent, wherein
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18510:27"/>
was condemned the religion which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
and they tearme Hereſie: you all my
my Maſters doe knowe what maner of
Counſaile that was, neither did you euer
allowe thereof, yea, there againſt haue the
whole Eſtate, Cleargie and Parliaments of
this Realme often proteſted. You knowe
alſo that in caſe it had beene lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and holden, yet had that bene no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
to the ſummoning of an other. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſith it concerneth the ſaluation
and reeſtabliſhment of ſuch perſons and

holden at <hi>Baſill,</hi> it was ordeined that
from ten yere to ten yere there ſhould be
a Counſaile holden, to the ende to cut off
ſuch errors as might ſpring in the church.
Much more needfull then were it for the
rooting out ſuch as alreadie are growne
vp.</p>
            <p>Iudge now therfore my Maiſters which
of vs is in the right, whether of vs in this
caſe is moſt to bee reſpected, either who
propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth

vpon whoſe behauiours they can take no
hold. I neither haue nor doe deſire but to
haue my cauſe heard: by a Counſaile to be
taught the beſt way: to doe better if I be
better inſtructed. Which then will you
iudge moſt right, either what neede the
whole Realme to bee kindled herewith?
For who doubteth whether you will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
chooſe, either ciuill Warre or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile?
either the ſubuertion of the one half
of this eſtate by the other, or rather the
reunion of both partes of this Realme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one, which vndoubtedly wil be of great
conſequence to all Chriſtiandome.</p>
            <p>Now therfore, I doe finally declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you that I craue and am ready to yeeld
to a Counſaile: that I am readie to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>To be briefe, it is a manifeſt iniurie to
this law which is called the true light, to
beleue that it can not light or leade men,
yea which is worſe, to perſwade that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Some will ſhewe you that there ſhall

            <p>Bookes are ſufficiently furniſhed with
replications therevpon: the olde and new
Teſtament are full of the great errors of
Gods people: It was the Chuch and the
Counſaile of Hieruſalem that condemned
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles: It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church that condemned her ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
And S. <hi>Paule</hi> telleth vs that Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt

darke, &amp; the Church an aſſembly of men,
the Church therefore is a miſty and darck
body, and hath no light in it but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
and is no farther, then it gathereth light
at Gods worde, thence therefore take it.
The Church may at euery ſtraine ſtumble,
and therfore we ſee our forefathers from
worlde to worlde grone after reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore alſo did the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
of <hi>Baſill</hi> decree, that from 10. yeres
to 10. yeres a Counſaile ſhould be called,
to the ende to cut of ſuch errors as might
ſpring vp in the Church.</p>
            <p>But ſome will reply and ſay, they haue
already holden one Counſaile againſt the
doctrine now in queſtion. Admit it be ſo,
yet were it to ſoone to giue ouer well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The auncient fathers were not ſo ſone
weary againſt thoſe of their time, againſt
the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who were heard in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
with all libertie, yet being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in three counſailes they were not
debarred the forth. But if we may be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of reiterating the ſelfe ſame remedies,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18510:32"/>
how much rather of retourning to warre
which ſo often hath bene practiſed in
vaine: to warre, whoſe beſt ſucceſſe is
more daungerous and hurtfull then euen
the worſt of any Counſayle: or how much
more expedient were it to call an other
Counſaile, rather then to hazard a battel:
to loſe a conference to ſome purpoſe, or
to ſhed ſo much blood in vaine.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that vpon the very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
nowe in queſtion, there haue bene
two Counſailes holden. The firſt through
the diligence of the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
at <hi>Constance,</hi> where contrarie to publike
faith the diſputers of the one parte, <hi>Iohn
Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burned
quick, and then followed a decree, that
there was no faith to be kept with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
a monſtrous decree, and the cauſe of
all diſorder and exceſſe ſince fallen out in
Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>The other at <hi>Trent</hi> in the chiefe heate of
the French troubles, where by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the former decree coulde bee
no ſafe appearance. Where alſo your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
might not bee heard in their
Chriſtian propoſitions for the quietneſſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18510:33"/>
of the Church. And where they proteſted
nullitie againſt the actes of the Counſaile
which ſince all your Courts of Parliament
haue confirmed and reiected the ſaid acts,
yea euen <hi>Sorbonne</hi> it ſelf, notwithſtanding
whatſoeuer inſtance the Pope hath from
time to time made. Thinke therefore ſir,
whether they haue cauſe to alleadge the
fore iudgements of theſe Counſailes: and
iudge whether theſe two Counſailes may
debarys of al hope of goodneſſe or fruite
that might ſpring out of one free &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Counſaile, called vnder your auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The difficultie reſteth onely vpon one
poinct, and that is that the Pope of late
daies hath encroched to himſelfe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of calling of Counſailes, which
before belonged to the Emperours: for
by al hiſtories it appeareth that thei haue
ſummoned the moſt famous. And now
becauſe he feareth the reformation of the
abuſes of the Popes Court, and eſpecially
the queſtion ſo often harped at. viz. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pope be aboue or vnder the Counſaile,</hi>
whereof there are contrarie decrees, it is
manifeſt that he will ſo fair as in him lieth

which haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but nouriſhed and encreaſed
