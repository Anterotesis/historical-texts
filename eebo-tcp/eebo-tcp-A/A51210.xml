            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN idle Member in a Common-wealth (as a droan in the Bee-live) is either actually caſt out by Juſtice, or at leaſt ſuffereth a divorce from the generall affection. By this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive have I been incited (in this little Treatiſe) to caſt my mite into the common Treaſury, and by the ſame may you be moved to approve my wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, wherein, as each of you hath particular intereſt, ſo will your demeanor prove you either a Bee or a droan. Neither may we account him a droan on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſitteth ſtill and is idle, but him alſo (and worſe) that is busie in hindring commodity. I have here made you a propoſition, which hath long hung in the Balance to be determined, on the one ſide every man of diſcretion caſting in a voice for the work; on the other ſide, divers (without ground) belching out imprudent contradictions. The Balance hath yet of this ſide been little ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by reaſon the vertues of the other have been ſilent. But may verity preſent her ſelfe, it is hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the averſe will forſake their vanity. You may
<pb facs="tcp:60084:7"/>
behold in this glaſſe your own Countrey <hi>(Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that bred you) complaining of wrong by her own childrens overſight. Nay you may truly ſee your ſelves and your children refuſing and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread of comfort, that (as a good mother) ſhe is willing and ready to give you. Let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you therefore, to beſtow the looking on it, but let it be with an honeſt heart, and an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating cenſure, and then will you acknowledge that the Book ſpeaks truth, and that both <hi>England</hi> and your ſelves do ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And let me thus a little reaſon with you.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to you to queſtion cuſtomes that are evill? whether doth your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den yield you more fruit by digging and dreſſing it, or by letting it alone to bear fruit of it ſelf? Or why ſhould you love a deſert more then a garden? or prefer the comfortleſſe Wilderneſſe of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> to the pleaſant fruitfull fields of <hi>Canaan?</hi> and what are Commons and Encloſures with us but the very like? whether is it a better ſpectacle without your doors to ſee a confuſed Common fruitleſſe, naked, and deſolate, or fields and vales of plenty, ſtoring your houſes and countrey with food and wealth? Or whether is it better for you to confeſſe, I have no peculiar property in it, nor can I ſell or diſpoſe of it at my need; or the grant of my Tenement being expired, I am excluded; Or to ſay this is mine, I can let, ſell, or diſpoſe it at my pleaſure, and ſo aſſure me a certain means and eſtate (out of nothing) wherein others have not to do? Doth not every man covet to have his own alone? Would any man admit of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
<pb facs="tcp:60084:7"/>
in his houſe, his horſe, his oxe, or his wife, if he could ſhun it? And why is it otherwiſe in land? But ſuppoſe you will ſay, you are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, and become one body, and ſo do uſe your Common as an inſeparable ſpouſe, to be your helper: why are you then ſo cuckolded by Forreigners and ſtrangers, and your Common uſed before your face, even as commonly as by your ſelves? or indeed, (while you make it a common proſtitute to every luſt) how can you help it? were it not better therefore and more ſecure to take her home to your chamber, and keep her with a guard where ſhe cannot be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? which you may do by diſtinguiſhing each ones part properly to himſelf. But you will ſay, If our Commons ſhould be divided, there will not be enough to content us. But heark ye, I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip hath a hundred Acres of Common; if this ſhould be ſtretcht into four hundred Acres, I truſt you will confeſſe it were much better: obſerve then in the Treatiſe, and you ſhall finde it probable enough, that one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred improved is much more profitable then four hundred in Common; where is the cauſe of your complaint then? or how is it that you are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen? can you have more content in one then in four? Or perhaps you will ſay, We ſhall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about parting it, one will think another hath too much, and he too little; ones part will be too good, anothers too bad, anothers too neer, and his too far off, &amp;c. But I will accomodate to your capacity a tale that may lead you to the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this doubt.

A certain man dying left behinde him divers ſons, to whom he bequeathed his Garden, (being his whole eſtate) to hold in common amongſt them all, ſhortly after an Artiſt by his skill had found that there was hidden in this garden a treaſure of good value, and calling the brothers together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with it, and told them, it might ſuffice to raiſe their low eſtates to good fortunes, perſwading them to go in hand for the finding of it; one of them being more witty (or wicked) then the reſt, had preſently this crochet in his pate: quoth he, None of you all can dig or break the land without my conſent; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I may have my own demand in the ſhare, you ſhall have no treaſure there; the reſt were not ſo ſtupid, but they had alſo preſently got hold of the ſame ſhadow, and every one would have the greateſt ſhare, or elſe, forſooth, his land ſhould not be broken; and thus they ſtoutly fac't it out, till at length they wiſely concluded, that in regard they could not agree about the partition, they would let all alone, and there ſhould it rot ere they would fall out about it; and accordingly fools they lived, and died beggers; now I pray what would you have done in this caſe? I dare anſwer for you, that you would rather have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any part then to have loſt the whole. Even the ſame caſe is now before you. Let us ſee your wiſdome, and how well you will conſtrue ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. And to get the treaſure each one take his part as neer and as conveniently it may be alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60084:8"/>
Let me yet go a little further.</p>
            <p>How often are you put to hard and chargeable ſhifts for fodder for your cattle in long winters? yea, and ſometimes ſtarve them out-right? and how fully will that want be repaired by this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
            <p>How fearfull and deſperate is your want of bread upon the leaſt defect of a full Harveſt, wherein you muſt either be a prey to the ſharking engroſſer, and mercileſſe hoarder, or tackle up to the Maritine parts for forreign muſty corn, to ſave your lives? whereby you alſo exhauſt your Countrey of much money to your further miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nay ſhould our ſins of commiſſion, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Gods gifts pull down the failing but of one Crop, what ſhould, or what could you do to be relieved? Verily, methinks you ſhould ſo far rue your childrens cryes, and tears of the poor for bread, as it ſhould bid you ceaſe your triviall arguments, and haſten the prevention of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. Thus may <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dream we be an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in want, and you a <hi>Joſeph</hi> to provide for the ſeven years famine. Thus may our honour, our wealth, our Nation be ſecured, and worthily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and what ſhould let?</p>

            <p>Do but ferry over then to the next ſhore, and <note place="margin">The Low Countries.</note> behold the little Bee, whoſe thighs were empty, and fortunes leave within your childes memory; now by her admirable induſtry and cheerfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſo abounding in proviſions, as makes her wonderfull to the world, and her wealth unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;

ſhe hath ſo fully argued the happineſſe of encloſure, which ſhe hath of late years effected, that ſhe now imparteth of her ſtore to us, that might more amply have it of our own, if we would but practiſe her skill, and imitate her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>But a fault muſt be known ere it can be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if when you have here read your errour with the many miſchiefs, loſſes, and detriments that you have long ſuffered, and ſee the much good promiſed, whereof every encloſure is a ſure warrant; I know you will be wiſe, and may concluſions accord with my propoſitions on your behalfe, ſo great will be your comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in it, as you will ſeriouſly repent for paſt neglects; but let the charmer charm never ſo loud, the deafadder will not hear. As my ſelf in ſuch caſe have heard one ſay (being confuted upon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this ſubject) (whoſe ſhame I ſhew you) that might encloſure prove never ſo happy to his Prince, his Countrey, or his own particular, he would not conſent. But let him go, if he had no more grace towards his Prince and Countrey, nor wit for himſelfe, we ſhall be ſure to finde him a weak oppoſer; and I doubt not but the fooliſh ſtubbornneſſe of a few ſuch will give the more luſtre, and commendation to thoſe many, whom judgement and diſcretion will direct aright. I will not feed you longer with promiſes, I know you long to ſee your profit, and will no longer be idle, and as your coherence herein will highly pleaſe God, and multiply his

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a right and proper ſpeech of a Roman Biſhop touching this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <note place="margin">Innocent 4.</note> when he termed it <hi>verè hortus deliciarum, verè puteus inexhauſtus.</hi> A very Garden of delights, and a very Well that cannot be exhauſted. And that expreſt with ſuch confidence, that to each Attribute he gave a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>varè,</hi> thereby concluding that his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was grounded on ſure and evident reaſon.</p>
            <p>To ſearch the foundation of which Attributes, we ſhall finde it to be the <hi>Eden-</hi>like bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Almighties hand in his firſt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who vouchſafed it ſo flouriſhing a ſight, and garden-like condition, that therein it ſurpaſſeth

others, and ſtands a Mirror to the worlds Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, looking over her walls to behold it.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure and plenty by this ſpeech inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, iſſue from the vertue of the former Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>Horius.</hi> For the nature of a Garden is to be the Nurcery of Plenty as well as of Delights; and as a Garden of all other improvements hath the preheminence in either; ſo in this denomination of <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>verè Hortus,</hi> it might be further concluded, a <hi>verè puteus inexhauſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it having pleaſed God to put us into this Garden, what may we conceive he requireth of our part to be performed? To dream of the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Age,</hi> and feed on the Poets, <hi>Sponte ſuâ Tell us?</hi> To carouſe the <hi>Nectar,</hi> and not plant the Vine? No, as <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Eden,</hi> ſo are we by that all-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor placed in this Garden, <hi>To keep it and dreſſe it,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 25.</note> for the comfort, encreaſe, and preſervation of his people committed unto it, which indeed hath formerly been ſo well performed, that our Garden hath not only feaſted her own family abundantly at home, but (to her honour and profit) relieved the wants of her neighbour-friends abroad, ſo ſtrengthening and ſtoring her ſelfe with life and wealth, that (when ſhe enjoyed peace in her own houſe) as the Imperiall Lady of <hi>Europe's</hi> bounds, ſhe ruled the Nations with an high hand; and not the proudeſt ſuitor enamoured of her beauty, nor the cruelleſt foe envying her fortunes, could ever execute the leaſt attempt on her worth; witneſſe the late happy atonement of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whoſe hands conjoyned, made ſo ſtrong the arm
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60084:11"/>
of this Empire, that it hath alwayes ſince (as in like caſe before) broken in peeces the higheſt head of power and practice that urg'd her to ſtrike.</p>
            <p>But time producing alternities, and the many peacefull yeers of our Dread <hi>Caeſars</hi> Protection, begetting ſuch multitudes of ſouls in the Tribes of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as former ages never ſaw: It now behoveth us to ſurvey and ſearch the angles of our Garden, and ſo to dreſſe the deſert and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe borders of it, that our increaſed charge be not unprovided for, nor by our neglect the family famiſhed, that ſo late was the wonder of plenty to others: In which deſignement we ſhall finde thoſe unbleſſed lands, the <hi>Waſtes</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grounds</hi> of this Kingdom, extending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſo large a portion of our Garden, that they are both a blemiſh in the beauty of it, and the reaſon of want and weakneſſe in our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied charge; and could the preſent abuſe of them be diſcovered to the utmoſt, and the fruit of their improvement foreſhewed, no member (I preſume) of this State <hi>(niſi mentis inops,</hi> or <hi>Reipublicae inimicus)</hi> but would grieve at the one, and with the utmoſt <hi>poſſe</hi> of his abilities labour the other.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as the ſtate of them is of moſt men meerly unconſidered; of ſome, ſomewhat underſtood, &amp; yet but in an imperiect apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of few or none at large or according to their certain condition: I have preſumed (in zeal to my Countrey) to collect the reaſons that may lead
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60084:12"/>
us to ſome perfect underſtanding of them; hoping that when the well featur'd portraicture of their reformed body ſhall be more apparent to the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious view of our <hi>Imperiall Gardiner,</hi> and his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall Family;</hi> it may pleaſe God to quicken it with the breath of life, and a perfect creation, to the reliefe, power, and honour of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But to omit relation of the ſeverall natures of theſe Lands throughout <hi>England</hi> particularly, (which vain tediouſneſſe (if not impoſſibility) may excuſe,) I will chiefly incircle my reports of <hi>Waſtes (ad ſuum eſſe)</hi> within the limits of the County of <hi>Somerſet</hi> (my native ſoil) and ſome neighbouring parts, where mine eye and eare ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been moſt converſant in obſervations of this ſubject, I can preſume of a true and ſincere account of the ſtate of thoſe <hi>Waſtes.</hi> And yet ſhall I not be ſo punctually immured within the confines of that Countrey, but that I may uſe of this diſcourſe, the Mathematicians promiſe of their yeerly Almanacks: That it is calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> but may ſerve indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently through all <hi>England.</hi> And though I cut my pattern by the <hi>Waſtes</hi> of thoſe parts only, yet may it pleaſe the Reader (obſervant of other whereſoever) to make uſe of theſe aſſertions: I am well aſſured he ſhall in ſome or moſt patts finde them concurring with his own opinion, or gain reaſon of encouragement to the work in queſtion, beyond that which former paſſages have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60084:12"/>
There hath been a long obſerved rule with us, <hi>That people are no where more penurious then ſuch as border on Common Lands:</hi> And this poverty we may finde thrown down upon us by three main hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>Gods diſpleaſure,</hi> which indeed is the reaſon of the reſt, and hath in it all diſprofits, for how can we expect his bleſſing on that which our own wilfull idleneſſe makes hatefull to him? or why ſhould he bleſſe thoſe that wittingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the curſe of ſin in their dwellings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond of <hi>our own blindneſſe,</hi> That while penury ſteales upon us we are ſo <hi>oculis capti,</hi> as not to ſee by what means it comes: but thus indeed we are deceived. The ſurmiſed benefit which Commoners depend on to proceed from theſe deſerts falling ſhort of their hopes, they ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly in the vain opinion thereof; for they ſuppoſe theſe profits a great part and member of their living, according to which computation, they hoiſe ſail into an higher Gale of expence then their Ship can endure, and while they dream of <hi>Midas</hi> his thrift, they ſtarve in the deluſions of their deceiving accounts, and the <hi>Eve-</hi>like help which they imagine their Commons are to their Encloſures, betrayeth all into the hands of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60084:13"/>
beggery, as hereafter will further appeare.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>The third of <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> and this indeed is ſo conſequent, that for this reſpect only, we may well enough preſume that <hi>Waſtes</hi> are more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous then beneficiall to the Republique. For our poorer people bordering on theſe Lands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it to be a ſufficient Trade of living to be only a Borderer: and ſo many Stratagems (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) have they to get thrift here, that to ſeeke other myſteries of gaining, were to incur the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſweat, and a laborious life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Here (ſay they) we can keep a horſe or a cow (if we have any,) or if our eſtate will not reach to ſuch a one, yet can we compaſs a gooſe or a ſwine, that in a yeer may yield us many a penny (God wot.)</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Here can we get a furze, a ferne, a green buſh, or a dried cowſharn, to keep our ſelves cloſe by the fire in a cold ſeaſon, when your City-trades will not allow you no ſuch eaſe, nor yield you fuell without your money.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Here can we get wit by practiſing to beguile the ſilly Woodcock and his feathered fellows by tricks and traps of our own painfull framing, the profit whereof ſhall ſometimes keep us playing till our next wants enforce a new ſupply.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Nay, whereas ſome ſuppoſe us to be poor, idle, and of no credit, we can be truſted with the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Finally, if our iſſue and poſterity amount to a whole ſcore in a family, or how many ſoever, we have for them all as good an inheritance in theſe Lands, as he that hath an hundred Cattell of his own to put in them, for a good ten acre Tenement: And why may not we in time (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſuch good helps as theſe) increaſe to a good ſtock alſo, and keep as many Cattell as ſome others? And think you that we can adviſe our ſelves no better, then to turn off our children to fooliſh (ſweating) trades, whereby they ſhall loſe this inheritance, and ſo choiſe and eaſie a means to get wealth? Or can any living wit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a better courſe for theſe Commons, by which ſuch an infinite number of numbers be now ſo wel maintained and kept in action? No, 'twill coſt more hot water to alter our cuſtome, then can be made with all the ſpice in the great Carricke, I warrant you. As for incloſure (which ſome talke of) the very rumor thereof will ſo impoveriſh

the poore borderers, that before you go about it, you ſhall ſcarce finde one of five of them worth a Duck-egge.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Waſtes</hi> of this Country (by which we take our aim) are in their naturall eſſence of two ſorts.
viz, <hi>Uplandiſh,</hi> and <hi>Mariſh.</hi>

            <p>The principall benefits of the uplandiſh <hi>Waſtes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Of the firſt.</note> are reaped in the breeding and feeding (or you may ſay ſtarving) of <hi>Horſes, Neat</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> and in cutting up <hi>Furze, Fernes, Heath, Buſhments,</hi> and ſuch like for fuell.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. Horſe.</note>As for the keeping of the horſes on theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Waſtes,</hi> it is thus: He that breedeth a Colt,  aſſigneth him on theſe Commons to labour for his living, yet ſo far is he from ſweating in this work, that though he travels the whole day for a courſe Sallet, he can hardly keep warmth enough to prevent death: And ſometimes extremity of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60084:14"/>
weather or other caſualties robbeth the poor man of the ſumme and ſervice, which he hoped his Colt (at time of growth) would have yeelded to his purſe and affairs. And then (having skored on his own back the reckoning of a peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-expenſe) his little back is ſunk, and His poor eſtate ſhipwrackt. But the diſadvantage that this ill husbandry is to the great State of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a danger ſo fearful, that it craveth the beſt reſolution for remedy; for whereas our breed of horſe ſhould be (for the ſervice and ſafety of our State) large, ſtrong, and able, theſe Commoners raiſing their Colts in this manner (by cold and famine) bring them to ſo unworthy and unſerviceable a proportion, as they utterly diſappoint the State of all expectation this way; and beſide, do ſo couzen their private maſter of his right, that whereas three well-bred horſes might perform his ſervice and husbandry, he muſt keepe five or ſix of theſe in continuall diet for thoſe uſes, which is a <hi>Boſome-wolfe</hi> ſo gnawing his low eſtate, that his means are tranſacted from his own and his families maintenance to the feeding of a feeble, hungry, unprofitable Teem.</p>

            <p>Now (to proceed in the promiſed probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) if we compare the barrenneſſe of Common, with the benefit of Encloſure. or the worth of this, with the unworthineſſe of the other, or will be judg'd by the many experiments which late yeers have made, we may well conclude, that the <note place="margin">A fourth part improved as good as the whole.</note> fourth part of theſe <hi>Waſtes</hi> encloſed, travelled, and husbanded (if not much leſſe) will fully coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail all benefit now received of them.</p>
            <p>Let us admit then, that in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> are <hi>Two Millions</hi> of Acres of ſuch Lands, whereof the fourth part anſwecing the preſent profit, there remaineth fifteen hundred thouſand Acres gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which to be employed to Tillage, will yeeld yeerly fifteen hundred thouſand quarters of corn, worth fifteen hundred thouſand pounds, all cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved to the Common-wealth. <note place="margin">Profit.</note>

As by the earths increaſe then, man is relieved, let us alſo conjecture what number of people may be maintained and preſerved by improvement of theſe Lands.</p>
            <p>The judgement of our Parliament hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that four Acres of Land is competent for the reliefe of a Cottagers charge, as may appear by the Act that tolerateth the poor man to erect him a Cottage, in caſe he procure four Acres of Land to be laid unto it for that purpoſe. Now the leaſt charge he can have, is himſelfe and his wife (for ſeldome any man lives alone) ſo as albeit moſt Cottagers have a charge of children, that pay double or treble this proportion: Two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be maintained by four Acres is the leaſt <note place="margin">750000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be maintained.</note> we can aſſigne, by which computation only the fifteen hundred thouſand Acres gained as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, will maintain ſeven hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons more then now they do.</p>
            <p>For the better credit of theſe conjectures, we may conſider that though ſome Countreys have not their ſuitable proportion to make up this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Acres, yet will others ſo far exceed, that the account in the generall cannot fail: nay, we ſhall aſſuredly finde it will far exceed; for many Counties of this Kingdom, witneſſe their many vaſt and ſpacious Deſerts, are able to ſhew you particularly two hundred thouſand Acres of theſe <hi>Waſtes,</hi> if not much more.</p>
            <p>As for the conjectures of the fruit of Tillage and value of Granes, though ſome Acres or ſome ſorts may fall ſhort, others ſurmounting will make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60084:18"/>
the ſuppoſition hold. And for the pre-ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed multitude of people that be thus maintained, the account alſo hath ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t credit in grounding on the judgement of the great and higheſt Court of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Some will here ſay, Is it poſſible or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that all theſe Lands ſhould be tilled: But I anſwer, that whether in Tillage or paſture (being improved, and mans love afforded them in their continuall manurance) they will be alike in each beneficiall for private and common wealth.</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion may be, by what means theſe Lands may be improved, as ſeeming natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally barren, and not apt to fructifie? to which I reply alſo, that who well conſidereth them in their particular natures, ſhall in the moſt part finde that God in his provident Creation, hath appointed helps to mans induſtry for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; for out of their own bowels (or not far diſtant) moſt commonly is to be had <hi>Marle, Chalk, Sand, Lime, Soile, Water-courſes</hi> and ſuch like to be miniſtred: or ſhould theſe happen to faile ſomewhere, yet by removing the lets only ſhall we finde a ſufficient alteration to content us. The experiments whereof have been ſuch in all places as have produced very happy effects, and the land from little or no worth, recovered to a perfect goodneſſe, and made comparable to the beſt worth of ancient encloſures, as example would make a large diſcourſe, if it were needfull. But to aſſure you of ſatisfaction in this point, I will refer you to be judged by your own eye as you travell.</p>

You ſhall often ſee the Waſtes confining with  encloſures in one and the ſame Levell, and the ſoile of one and the other (in the quality and ſeat of nature) not diſtinguiſhable, but by reaſon of private husbandry, ſuch is the diſparity, that the one ſheweth the heaps of plenty, in a comely aſpect, the other gulfes of want and penury in a deformed viſage: yea, you ſhall alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Encloſures, though on moſt barren and fruitleſſe ſituations (by the good husbands dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) ſo bleſſed, as they exceed (in fructifying) the beſt natures of the un-reſpected Waſtes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Hence will alſo be occaſioned a great encreaſe <note place="margin">Tillage.</note> of <hi>Tillage:</hi> For men finding in theſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments an abundant proviſion of the beſt feeding for their Cattel, will diſpoſe more of their <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-grounds</hi> to tillage, which they muſt now of neceſſity depaſt: And whereas many arables (through want of ſoyle and maintenance) do now fail in their naturall ſtrength, and bring forth a ſmall encreaſe, the abundance of Hay yeerly drawn out of theſe encloſures, will ſo inlarge the poor mans Muck-hill (his <hi>Philoſophers ſtone)</hi> that <note place="margin">Soil and Compaſt.</note> all his labours (in caſting out this, and loading in his harveſt) would be turned to gold; and the fruits of Tillage hereby encreaſed in no ſmall meaſure. And indeed ſo mutually will both theſe kinde of lands accord in helping each other in matters of this nature, as they will even emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſtrive to outdo each other in ſtoring the Commonwealth with their abundant fruits.</p>
            <p>We may alſo conjecture, what number of people may be ſuſtained by a generall improvement of theſe lands through the Nation; wherein I think we ſhall not much erre to ſuppoſe all <hi>Mariſh waſtes</hi> to be of this nature. It is moſt certain, that in this preſent ſtate of confuſion (though ſome perhaps may gain ſomewhat) the great loſſes thereby ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in the generall, depriveth the Republike of all received benefits; by which we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60084:24"/>
that theſe lands improved may be wholly gained. Now the vertue of ſuch lands encloſed with us is ſuch, that four Acres will ſufficiently feed and keepe two Kine in Winter and Summer, whoſe profit in all reſpects will be at leaſt 10 <hi>li. per annum;</hi> and for three poor people a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance. Let us admit then, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> hath a Million of theſe Acres, (but we ſhall finde much more) it followeth that their yeerly benefit to the Republike, will be two millions and a halfe in value, and ſeven hundred and fifty thouſand perſons may be fed by the <note place="margin">750000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons relieved.</note> ſame; and this number added to the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the like number to be relieved by the <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>Upland-Waſtes,</hi> we finde that the general improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Waſtes</hi> of this Nation will ſuffice to maintain fifteen hundred thouſand people more then now they do, and encreaſe the worth of this <note place="margin">1500000.</note> Nation yeerly four Millions; And is not here <note place="margin">4 Millions yeerly gained.</note> 
               <hi>Bread for the Poor, and advancement of the Engliſh Nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will you now aske me why Commons ſhould be encloſed? Or ſhall I aske you why they are not?</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, We have not people enough to make uſe of this great encreaſe; ſurely if God continue his bleſſing of generation upon us, we may have in ſhort time, and in the mean time, can we not ſpare our overplus to others abroad that want it, get their money and commodities for it, and ſave our own, that we now export to buy theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And touching imployment for the poor (wherewith this Land ſo infinitely aboundeth) <note place="margin">Imployment for the poor.</note> ſuch means thereof would be for them in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurance of each ſort of theſe <hi>Waſtes</hi> encloſed, (as by <hi>Diking, Hedging, Fencing, Setting, Sowing, Reaping, Gleaning, Mowing, Making hay,</hi> and what not? which is all <hi>Bread for the Poor)</hi> that from the noyſome and deboiſt courſes of <hi>Begging, Filching, Robbing, Roguing, Murthering,</hi> and whatſoever other Villainies their unexerciſed brains and hands undertake, they would (even gladly) be reclaimed and refined to loyall and laudable courſes, as well for their own contenting reliefe, as the unſpeakable comfort and honour of the whole State, who now (as a wretched and needy mother) is enforced to make continuall Maſſacres of them, for thoſe miſdoings which even their want of bread urgeth them to commit. And ſhould we ſearch the bottome of our fault or fortune in this overſight, we may fear that a greater contempt would be laid to our charge, then our beſt Oratory would be able to excuſe. For albeit, God hath commanded man to <hi>encreaſe and multiply,</hi> and to fill the earth, ordaining Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony free and lawfull to all: we (ſuppoſing he hath not given enough to feed us) though not by our command verbally (yet by our act really) ſtop that iſſue of his bleſſing by preventing the poor of needfull habitations (whereby indeed their encreaſe is much hindred) and by this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſo great a portion of the earth which he hath given us to be alſo filled, what do we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60084:25"/>
then repugne his Commandement, while we ſuffer it to be unhabitable and deſolate? And whereas God hath of late times brought us into other lands, whereby his Goſpel and glory may be the further ſpread, and our own arme the more ſtrengthened; how much more able might we be to accompliſh thoſe happy Plantations by the increaſe of people, wealth and proviſions, which the improvement of the Lands would yield us?</p>
            <p>The credit of this deſigne having ſtirred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall diſputations for it, howſoever unadviſed oppoſers cannot but fail in the main, they have yet founded themſelves on ſome imaginary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſſwade the work, amongſt which, two only (as I have obſerved) moſt valid, (beleeving <note place="margin">2 Objections.</note> that ſome particular ſatisfaction may be required) I thought fit not to paſſe by unexamined. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, that it will be an injury to mens rights, who being now at liberty to entercommon <hi>ſanz nombre,</hi> and over all, ſhall hereby be curbed and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a certain meaſure. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other is a clamour counterfeited with commiſeration, that by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure the poor will be undone, ſtarve, periſh, &amp;c.</p>
