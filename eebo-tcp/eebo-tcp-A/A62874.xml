            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing by special Providence brought hither upon some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of mine own, and finding many persons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
perswasions scrupling the taking of the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
now beginning to be urged, by reason of their unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with it through the long disuse of it; by various
conferences I convinced sundry of them, that the end and matter
of the oath was not such as they imagined: Whereupon some
persons tender of the publique peace, and the liberties of those
doubting persons, who still remained unsatisfied, earnestly pressed
me to draw up something in writing, tending to the
elucidation of this doubt: which I was unwilling to do, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from mine own Books and Collections, and hoping to have
staid here less time then I am now necessitated to do: yet the
instant pressure hath drawn from me this writing, though short
and indigested, it being conceived useful in this juncture of time,
wherein if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith,
I joy and rejoyce with you all, as being studious not how to have
dominion over your faith, but to be a helper of your joy. For which
and I crave your prayers, who am,</p>

that nothing was, is, or shall be ment or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

         <div type="consideration">
            <head>The OATH of SUPREMACY briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and the lawfulness of taking it asserted.</head>
            <p>IT is questioned, whether the Oath of the Kings being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Supreme Governour in all causes, according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> may be lawfully taken? To which I answer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively,
and thus argue,</p>
            <p>If it may not be lawfully taken, it is either because no Oath may be
taken, or no promissory Oath, or no promissory Oath to a King, or
the matter of this Oath is not to be acknowledged or promised.</p>
            <p>But none of these make it unlawful. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consequence is proved, because there is a sufficient enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of things that seem to prohibit the taking of it: if not, let
what else may make it unlawful be named. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by
parts, in confirming these six propositions.</p>
            <p>I. That some swearing is lawful.</p>
            <p>II. That promissory Oaths may be lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36043:4"/>
III. That to swear to a King or Governour may be lawful.</p>
            <p>IV. That the King is Supreme Governour over all persons in his
Dominions.</p>
            <p>V. That he is Governour in Ecclesiastical causes.</p>
            <p>VI. That the Iurisdictions, Preeminences, and Priviledges meant
in that Oath may be lawfully acknowledge and defended.</p>
            <p>The first is proved thus.</p>
            <p>I. That which is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> in it's whole kind evil, may be
lawful: But swearing is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> or in its whole kind evil.</p>
            <p>Therefore some swearing may be lawful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is manifest of it self. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus proved.</p>
            <p>That is not wholly evil about the use of which some directions are
given by God. God doth not give directions about the use of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
witchcraft, idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are in their whole kind evil.
But God giveth directions about the use of swearing, as in the third
commandment (which is undoubtedly moral) <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2. where he
saith, <hi>And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgement,
and in righteousness. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That which is approved by God, is lawful. But some swearing
is approved by God. <hi>Psal. 63. 11. Every one that sweareth by God
shall glory. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is of it self manifest, the <hi>minor</hi> the text evidenceth,
sith the swearing by God is made part of glorying in God, or of the
swearers glory.</p>
            <p>3. If it were unlawful to use any Oath, then it were unlawful to
put any Oath on any. But this is not to be said. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consequence is manifest, sith we cannot lawfully urge any to
that which is of it self sinful: Now that it is lawful to put an Oath on

society. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is plain, it agreeing with the law of nature and nations,
which is of necessary use for the benefit of humane society, which
laws God the author of nature hath imprinted in all, and indeed hath
made all his laws for men one towards another subservient thereto.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is plain from the words of the Author to the Hebrews,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 16. An <hi>Oath to men is an end of strife,</hi> which is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
use for humane benefit.</p>
            <p>6. That which hath been counted by all nations as a Sacred thing,
a principal part of the acknowledgement and worship of God, is not
unlawful of it self.</p>
            <p>But so hath some swearing been counted. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> minor <hi>is proved by Gods own words,</hi> Deut. 10. 20. <hi>Thou shalt

            <p>The second [<hi>That promissory Oaths may be lawful</hi>] is thus proved.</p>
            <p>1. That is not altogether of it self evil or unlawful, which God
makes a bond of the soul to be kept and performed to the Lord.</p>

But some promissory Oaths God makes a bond of the soul to be
kept and performed to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> Some promissory Othes may be lawful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is proved, because that which is altogether unlawful
cannot bind the soul to God, nor is to be kept and performed to the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> minor <hi>is proved from</hi> Numb. 30. 2. If a man vow a vow unto
the Lord, or swear an Oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break
or profane his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his
mouth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 33. Again ye have heard that it hath been said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt perform unto
the Lord thine Oathes, <hi>where a promissory Oath is made a bond to

            </p>
            <p>2. If holy men afore the Law, under the Law, in Gospel times
have put promissory Oaths on others, then they are not altogether
unlawful. This is proved by the same reason by which the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence

               <hi>Ergo.</hi> Some promissory Oaths are lawful.</p>
            <p>The third Proposition [<hi>That to swear to a King or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is lawful</hi>] is proved,</p>
            <p>1. From approved examples, which prove either a duty,
or at least lawfulness of the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:36043:7"/>
That which hath been practised by holy men without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
is lawful.</p>
            <p>But swearing to Kings and Governours Allegiance and
Obedience hath been practised by holy men. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> minor <hi>is proved by instances of the people to</hi> David,
2 Sam. 5. 3. So all the elders came to the king to Hebron, and king
David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and
they anointed David king over Israel, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 3. Then
came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord, and
they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of
the Lord by Samuel. <hi>A Covenant before the Lord
was an Oath, but the people of</hi> Israel, <hi>a holy people made a
covenant before the Lord with</hi> David <hi>their king, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they entred into an Oath of Allegiance and due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The other is more plain,</hi> 2 King. 11. 4. And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
year Jehojada sent and fet the rulers over hundreds with
the captains and the guard, and brought them to him in the
house of the Lord, and made a covenant with them, and took
an Oath of them in the house of the Lord, and shewed them the
kings son, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. And Jehojada made a covenant between
the Lord and the king, and the people, that they should be the
Lords people: between the king also and the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
23. 3. And all the congregation made a covenant with the king
in the hosue of God: and he said unto them, Behold the kings
son shall reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of David,
<hi>vers.</hi> 6. Then Jehojada made a covenant between him and all
the people, and between the king, that they should be the Lords
people. <hi>These are express examples of swearing Allegiance
to Kings, which is consonant to what our Lord Christ
teacheth, that we should</hi> render to Caesar the things that are
Caesars, as to God the things that are Gods, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21.
<hi>Besides we finde</hi> David <hi>swearing to</hi> Saul, 1 Sam. 24. 22. <hi>the
people conceiving themselves bound by</hi> Sauls <hi>adjuration,</hi>
1 Sam, 14. 24, 28. Shimei <hi>was bound by the Oath which</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:36043:7"/>
Solomon <hi>imposed on him, where</hi> Solomon <hi>speaks thus to
him,</hi> Why hast thou not kept the Oath of the Lord, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
that I have charged thee with? Abrahams <hi>servant
sware obedience to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and counted himself bound to
keep it,</hi> Gen. 24. 2, 3. <hi>Then arose</hi> Ezra, <hi>and made the</hi> chief
Priests, the Levites, and all Israel to swear, that they should do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this word, and they sware, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 5. Nehemiah
made them swear by God, saying, ye shall not give your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or
for your selves, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 25.</p>
            <p>2. From Gods dealing with <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that kept not the
Oath made to the King of <hi>Babylon, Ezek.</hi> 17. 18, 19. where
God doth not except against the Oath, but the breaking
of it calling it <hi>his Oath, which he had despised,</hi> and <hi>his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that he had broken;</hi> whence I argue,</p>
            <p>That which God calls his Oath, the despising of which
he avengeth, may be lawfully taken.</p>
            <p>But an Oath of subjection even to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
God calls his Oath, the despising of which he avengeth,
therefore some Oath of subjection to a King, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>3. From the words of <hi>Solomon, Eccles. 8. 2. I counsel thee to
keep the kings commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of
God. The Oath of God</hi> seemeth to be an Oath by God to the
king, being made the reason of keeping the kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Oath of <hi>Shemei, 1 King.</hi> 2. 43. is termed <hi>the
Oath of the Lord, Zedechiah's</hi> Oath to the King of <hi>Babylon,
Gods Oath and Covenant, Ezek. 17. 19. Prov.</hi> 2. 17. the
wives covenant with her husband, is called <hi>the covenant of
her God;</hi> whence I argue,</p>
            <p>That which is Gods Oath, and is urged as the reason of
keeping the Kings command is lawful.</p>
            <p>But an Oath of subjection to a King is Gods Oath, and
urged as the reason of keeping his commandment, as the
Text shews, therefore it is lawful. If by <hi>the Oath of God</hi> be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36043:8"/>
meant, not a particular Oath to a King, but the general Oath
or Covenant to obey God (which seems not so likely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the special reason of keeping the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment)
yet thus also the argument holds: If it be lawful
to make a general Oath to God of keeping his Laws, and
this be one of Gods Laws to keep the Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that the particular Oath of subjection to the
King is comprehended in the general Oath of keeping Gods
commands, a particular Oath of obedience to the King is
not unlawful.</p>
            <p>4. That is lawful which is of necessary use for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good.</p>
            <p>But some swearing to a King or other Governors is of
necessary use for the publique good, therefore it is lawful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is confirmed in proving the <hi>major</hi> of the fifth
argument of the first proposition, The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by
experience, even <hi>Jehojada</hi> and <hi>David</hi> conceived so, and the
reason is, because the common peace and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be kept but by good correspondence between
Prince and people: therefore if mutual Oaths tend thereto,
as often they do, they are of necessary use for the publique
good.</p>
            <p>The grand objection is from the words of our Saviour,
<hi>Math. 5. 34, 35, 36, 37. But I say unto you, Swear not all, neither
by heaven for it is Gods throne: nor by the earth, for it is his
footstool: neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great
king. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst
not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be
yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatsover is more then these cometh of
evil:</hi> and of the Apostles, <hi>Jam. 5. 12. But above all things
my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth,
neither by any other Oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay,
nay; lest ye fall into condemnation:</hi> which words do seem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and fully to forbid any swearing at all, excluding
some sorts of Oaths by name, and the rest by General
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36043:8"/>
terms, with prescription that our <hi>communication be yea, yea,
nay, nay,</hi> and determination, that <hi>what is more then these
cometh of evil, or the evil one,</hi> which made some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
and later godly persons conclude all Oaths of any sort
prohibited now to Christians, though they were not to the
Jews. But the reasons foregiven are so cogent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that we must of necessity finde out a limitation of the
speeches, as we do, and rightly, for the next words of our
Saviour following, <hi>vers.</hi> 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. which are as full in
shew for not resisting of evil, but offering our selves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
further injury, and permitting more dammage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
vain casting away our estates, contrary to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in our necessary defence, to that necessary moderate
providence, which belongs to every man, that due respect
which each is to have to the rules of mercy, bounty, and
our own imployment and family, so that without good
caution we shall make Christs precept in stead of being
useful to become pernicious.</p>
            <p>That we may then consider how to understand our Lords
precept about swearing, we are to take this as certain, that
Christs precept forbids somewhat which the Pharisaical
teachers allowed, though they forbad perjury; now one
thing seems to be forbidden by our Lord Christ, to wit,
the making of such distinction of Oaths as the Pharisees
did, and accordingly used them, which seems to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in two things.</p>
            <p>1. In conceiving they might use Oaths by some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as if in such use there were no relation to God, and
so no profaning of his name, or taking it in vain. The
reason of this seems to be Christs and <hi>James</hi> his instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
onely in such sorts of Oaths as were by creatures, and
the refutation of their conceit, by shewing, that all refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to God, as the Oath by the heaven, was by God, sith
it was his throne; by the earth, sith it is his footstool; by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
sith it was his city; by the head sith he makes the
hair white or black.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36043:9"/>
2. That some of these Oaths made them debtors to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what they sware and not other, which appears from
Christs own charge upon them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22. where he terms them <hi>fools and blinde guides</hi> for such
decision, concluding that all those Oaths had respect to God,
and did binde. And accordingly Christ is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as forbidding simply all Oaths, but such differencing
of Oaths in their meaning and obligation, as the Pharisees,
and other Jews, either superstitiously or otherwise errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
used, yet I do not conceive this is all. For the words,
<hi>Swear not at all, neither by heaven nor earth, nor any
other Oath,</hi> but prescribing <hi>yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> censuring more
to be from evil, or the evil one, seems to forbid all Oaths in
some cases or manner, which some conceive as if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
a promissory Oath universally, or a vow with an Oath:
But these opinions stand not with the second Proposition
before proved, nor do I finde any thing in the text leading
to them. And therefore I conceive, that the prohibition is of
that frequent, vain, light, profane, unnecessary, customary pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssionate
swearing, or in secular matters of no importance,
without any dread of an Oath, or consideration of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, upon a provocation to anger, as <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi>
25. 21. or deceifully as those, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4. all who take Gods
name in vain, which I gather from the text.</p>
            <p>1. In that he prescribeth their <hi>yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> to be in
their <hi>speech</hi> or <hi>communication,</hi> which seems to be meant of
their familiar speech one with another, in their answers to
each other.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Because</hi> James <hi>saying,</hi> Let your yea be yea, and your nay
nay, <hi>doth exlude inconstancy and lightness, and prescribes
such considerateness as that they need not unsay what they
have said, that to use the Apostles speech,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 18. Our
words may not be yea, and nay, <hi>off and on, but</hi> yea and Amen,
<hi>that is, firm and ratified, so as that deeds answer to words,
as becomes men, that consider what they say, and still say</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36043:9"/>
that taught the good knowledge of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 5, 22.
Removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the
groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made:
for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it, 2 <hi>King.</hi>
18. 4. Appointed the courses of the Priests and Levites, with the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be given to the Priests and the Levites, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 2, 4.
Josiah purged the land of Idols, repaired the Lords house, gathered all
the people to hear the Law read, and to make them to stand to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
he made before the Lord, to walk after the Lord. <hi>And in the
doing of these things the Kings are said to do that which was right in
the eyes of the Lord, and to walk before the Lord with a perfect
heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. On the contrary, the not removing the high places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Idols, and neglecting the setting up of Gods true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service, is charged upon some of the Kings as their sin,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 14. and 22. 43. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 9. and 15. 4.</p>
            <p>3. God gives a special charge to the King to <hi>have a copy of the
Law, and to read therein, that he may learn to fear the Lord, and to
keep all the words of the Law, Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19. and therefore when
<hi>Jehojada</hi> crowned King <hi>Jehoash</hi> he gave <hi>him the testimony, 2 King.</hi>
11. 12. that he might be minded, that he was, as a King, to know
and to see to the keeping of the whole Law.</p>
            <p>4. The open practice of Idolatry is imputed to the want <hi>of a King
in Israel, Judg.</hi> 17. 5, 6. and 18. 1. which proves, that the King in
<hi>Israel</hi> ought to restrain from Idolatry, and not to permit every man
to do what was right in his own eyes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or</hi> is manifest, because the Office of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi>
was no ceremonial function, as the Priests, but moral, and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
use, and therefore belongs to other Kings as well as the
Kings of <hi>Israel;</hi> nor doth the Gospel deprive them, or any other
of their State and Authority, by their becoming Christians: for
then suppose King <hi>Agrippa</hi> had become a Christian, he must have
ceased to be a King, and have had his Kingly power diminished:
but as the Apostle resolves concerning servants and persons of other
conditions, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 24. Brethren, let every man wherein he is called
therein abide with God,</hi> that is, his Christian calling doth
not bind him to leave the state and condition of life in which
he was, nor diminish his Authority which he had when he
was called to be a Christian, as not consisting with Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
so is it true concerning Kings and other Magistrates,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36043:10"/>
they have greater obligation to God, and the Lord Christ, no less
Authority and power as Kings by their Christianity: but they may
abide in their Office, and exercise the lawful Authority they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be said, The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were types of Christ,
and therefore their Power and Authority did cease in things Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Ecclesiastical, when Christ was come.</p>
            <p>1. But to the contrary, this is said without proof, and so is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as easily as it is alledged.</p>
            <p>2. It is true, Christ is often termed <hi>David,</hi> and it is said, <hi>he shall
sit on Davids throne, Luk.</hi> 1. 32, 33. But this power of reforming
Religion was not appropriate to <hi>David,</hi> or the race of the Kings of
<hi>Judah,</hi> but belonged also to the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> (who were not
types of Christ) who are charged with the permission or promoting
of Idolatry, as their sin, as on <hi>Jeroboam, Ahab,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Jehu</hi> is in
some measure rewarded for the partial Reformation he made,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 28, 29, 30. and therefore it belonged not to the Kings
of <hi>Israel</hi> to reform Religion, onely as types of Christ, but even as
Kings.</p>
            <p>2. This is proved, and the Proposition it self. That is to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the King, which was with approbation ascribed to Kings out
of the Church.</p>
            <p>But the Government in things and Causes spiritual or belonging
to Religion, is ascribed with approbation to Kings out of the
Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is proved, because what of this kind is with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ascribed to Kings out of the Church, is to be taken as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Kings as Kings, and not as typical Kings or Rulers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by instances.</p>
            <p>The first of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> of whom we read <hi>that the Lord
stirred up his spirit to make a Proclamation for building of Gods house,</hi>
2. <hi>Chron. 36. 22, 23. Ezra.</hi> 1. 1, 2. in doing this he is called <hi>Gods
shepherd, Isa</hi> 44. 28. and <hi>anointed</hi> by God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 1. and the same
was continued by Decrees of <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 6. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
and <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 7. 13, 21, 23, 26. now these things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the building of Gods house, furthering his service, were spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, and therefore Government in spiritual things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Religion, is ascribed to Kings out of the Church.</p>
            <p>To these may be added the Decree of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> against
them that <hi>should speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36043:10"/>
Meshach and Abednego. Dan.</hi> 3. 29. and of <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6. 26.
<hi>That in every Dominion of his Kingdom, men tremble and, fear before
the God of Daniel,</hi> which are undoubtedly about spiritual Causes or
Matters of Religion: and the King of <hi>Nineveh his Proclamation by
the Decree of the King and his nobles, that all should fast covered with
sackcloth, and cry mightily to God, Jonah</hi> 3. 7, 8. which is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by God, in that he defer'd his judgement thereupon: in all
which Government in matters of Religion was exercised and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>3. That which agrees to other Rulers besides Kings, agrees
much more to Kings,</p>
            <p>But to Govern in Causes spiritual or things of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Governours below Kings, therefore much more to
Kings.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>major</hi> is proved from the title given to the King, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 13. where he is called the <hi>Supreme</hi> or <hi>Excelling,</hi> and of those that
<hi>are in Authority</hi> or <hi>Excelling, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. the King is reckoned
as chief; therefore if inferiour Governours are to Govern in
matters of Religion, much more Kings. Now that they are to do so,
appears by the practice of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who being not King, nor
Priest, but Governour under the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> reformed the Priests,
excluding aliens from the Priests chambers, giving the Levites their
portion, and chiefly by restraining the profanation of the Sabbath,
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 15, 22. reckoning it among the works for which
he would have God remember him. <hi>Jacob</hi> reforms his houshold by
requiring them to put away the strange gods that were among them,
and bury them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2, 4. Parents are required to bring up
their children in <hi>the nurture,</hi> in Greek <hi>discipline</hi> or government and
<hi>admonition of the Lord, Ephes.</hi> 5. 4. Servants <hi>are to be obedient to
their masters as to Christ,</hi> Vers. 5. <hi>As the servants of Christ doing the
will of God from the heart,</hi> Vers. 6. <hi>With good will doing service as to
the Lord and not to men:</hi> therefore Parents and Masters have Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in matters of Religion, much more the Father and Master
of the Common-wealth, having a more ample Authority.</p>
            <p>4. This is further confirmed in that the Apostle where he speaks
of the Powers, he saith without limitation, that <hi>Rulers are not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to good works but to evil: wilt thou not be afraid of the power? do
that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same, he is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil, Rom.</hi>
13. 3. 4. Kings and Governours sent by them are for <hi>the punishment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36043:11"/>
of evil doers,</hi> and <hi>for the praise of them that do well,</hi> without limitation
and distinction of Civil and Spiritual things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. Now
where the Law doth not distinguish, neither are we, and therefore
are to understand the Governing in the text to be in Religious
things as well as Civil.</p>
            <p>5. Which is further confirmed from the Titles given to them:
they are termed <hi>gods, Psal. 82. 1, 6. John 10. 34, 35. Ministers of
God,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. <hi>That judge not for man but for the Lord, 2 Chron.</hi>
19. 9. therefore they are to be ministers in a Political way, and to
judge in things of the Lord.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Paul</hi> did not refuse to apologize for himself about the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Jews against him for his profession and preaching of
Christian Religion, but did justifie himself before <hi>Felix, Festus</hi> and
king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and appealed to <hi>Caesar, Act.</hi> 23. 29. and 24. 5, 6, 8,
10. and 25. 8, 11, 19, 21, and 26. 2, 3. therefore he denied not,
but acknowledged the Kings Government, even in the things and
Causes that concern Christian Religion, and consequently we may
in like manner acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>give thanks for Kings and all that are
in authority</hi> or <hi>excellency, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
in all godliness and honesty, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. therefore he supposeth that
Kings have some Government in matters of godliness, as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and therefore are Governours In Causes Spiritual, or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>8. From the absurdities which follow if this be not granted.</p>
            <p>1. If the King be not Governour in Ecclesiastical things and
Causes, then his Kingly power is of no use in matters of Religion,
for if he have no Government in them he is to be a looker on, and
in effect a meer cipher in respect of such things; But this is not to
be said, sith matters of Religion do as much concern him to Govern
in, as any causes, all experience shewing that no Government can
be well ordered without some regard had to Religion.</p>
            <p>2. All the actions which Kings have been commended for by
godly persons were unjustifiable: the pulling down of Idols, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
the importation and vending of Popes pardons, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
ware, the causing the holy Bible to be translated, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
to be read, proclaimnig fasts, and days of thanksgiving, with
many of the like acts of Kingly Authority have been unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>3. Kings should have no way of expressing their zeal for Gods
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36043:11"/>
worship and true Religion more then other men, if they were not
Governours in spiritual things and Causes, nor be more accountable
to God for neglect thereof, then other men, nor this sin of theirs of
more guilt then the like sin of others, which are all absurd.</p>
            <p>4. All the holy Martyrs who have owned their authority, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it when they suffered under it, all those who have petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
for Reformation of Religion to Kings, have giventhanks to
God for it, have advised that it should be sought from them, should
be censured as foolish, if not sinfully countenancing an unrighteous
usurpation, and the best Christian Kings who have done most for the
settling the affairs of the Church censured <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> busie in
other mens matters, and the like is to be said of Parliaments,
and so all matters of Religion must be left wholly to Bishops, the
evil and miserable effects of which are discernible in the Records of
former and later times, to be intolerable; as it fell out in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
by <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, of <hi>Stephen
Langton</hi> in King <hi>Johns</hi> days, the persecution in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days
by Bishops, whose disowning the Kings Supremacy and asserting the
Popes, occasioned the making and the imposing of this Oath.</p>
            <p>5. Those Titles which have been given them for their care in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the things of the Church, that they were nursing fathers
and nursing mothers to it, according to <hi>Isaiahs</hi> prophecy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.
29. should be recalled: all the exhortations and charges given to
them by preachers to take care of the Church of God, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
they should be no longer minded, that they are to be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of both tables of the Law; in a word, it should be their virtue
to be as <hi>Gallio</hi> was, that <hi>cared for none of these things, Acts</hi> 18. 17.
which are all absurd.</p>
            <p>Against this many things are objected.</p>
            <p>1. That to acknowledge the King the onely Supreme Governour
is to make him God.</p>
            <p>To this I answer: Not so, sith he is acknowledged Governour
in his Dominions, and Supreme therein under God, and the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
term [<hi>onely</hi>] excludes foraign jurisdiction of the Pope and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes and States, (which by the Oath is renounced) not
Gods Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2 If Kings are Governours in all causes, then they may
appoint what Religion, and worship of God they please, and it is
evil to disobey or gainsay what they impose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:36043:12"/>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Though in temporal things they be Governours, yet
are they to Govern according to Laws. So in Spiritual and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
things they are to Govern according to the Laws of Christ,
and such rules as agree with them, and not in either, in a meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
way after their own will: nor are we necessitated to obey or
own what they require, if inconsistent with the laws of Christ, and
such rules as agree with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. If Kings be Governours in all Causes over all persons,
then may they dissolve Churches and their Government, and mould
and order them as they will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So far as Church constitution, Government, and ordering
is by Christs appointment, or such example which hath the force of
an institution of Christ, it may not be altered by a King; But in such
things as are left to humane prudence, and there is a concernment
of the weal publique; Kings have authority to order them so, as that
they tend to the real good and advantage of the Churches of Christ,
and the glory of God, which is the highest and ultimate end of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. This will make the use of Synods, and Assemblies of
Pastors to determine things of Religion, and to order government
unnecessary, sith the determination of all will lye in the Kings
breast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though Statute-laws require the Kings assent, and the
Government is to be exercised in his name, by his Commission, yet
are not debates in Parliament, and passing bills by both Houses, nor
consultations with judges, nor their decisions of cases unnecessary:
The like is to be said of the use of Synods and Assemblies of Pastors
and learned men, though the calling of them, and validity of their
Canons, that is rules, in respect of the imposing them on others
with civil penalties, require the Kings concurrence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. This hath occasioned great evils in so much that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
hath been raised against godly persons as Heretiques and
Schismatiques, when Princes have been misled; so as to burn, banish,
imprison, and otherwise to afflict persons, judged by Prelates and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true this hath fallen out, when Princes ignorant of
the true Religion, corrupted in their education, perverted by sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and ungodly guides in their judgements have yielded too much
to the misinformation of others, and so have been unhappy in the
abuse of their Government to the great hurt in life, liberty, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of innocent persons: And the like hath been in mal-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36043:12"/>
of civil affairs, through the like causes: yet the power and
authority in neither is to be denied for some abuse: for that would
introduce a worse evil of Anarchy and mischievous confusions. On
the other side when Princes have been good, and have used such good
Counsellours, as <hi>Jehojada</hi> was to <hi>Joash;</hi> their Government in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath been of great advantage to the Church of Christ. And,
as things have stood in <hi>England,</hi> it was the means under God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Popery was expelled, and the Protestant Reformation was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 6. By allowing so much power in Ecclesiastical things,
Religion is often changed with the King, and thereby peoples minds
are at much uncertainty what Religion to be of, which tends to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Atheisme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So it fell out in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet the power of
the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> in matters of Religion was not for this cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
And the like happens upon change of teachers, as in the
Churches of <hi>Galatia:</hi> and <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. foretels the like
would be in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yet is not therefore the use and
Government of Pastors to be denied, but more diligence to be in
using such holy means as prayer for Kings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. &amp;c.
which by Gods blessing may prevent these evils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 7. No man is to Govern in that whereof he is no sit
Judge, nor is any man a fit Judge but he that is skilful in the things
he judgeth: which seldom happened to Kings in matters of Religion,
and therefore Government therein is ill ascribed to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As a King may be fit to Govern in Temporal Causes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
is required skill in the laws of the Land, of which perhaps
he hath little or no knowledge, not so much as a Judge
is to have, who passeth sentence) if he choose and use them
that are skilful and upright therein: so it may be in Ecclesiastical
Causes, if he choose and use the help of them that are skilful
and faithful in Religion. But in this thing there is need of
the greatest circumspection, vigilancy and wariness, on the one side
by reason of the cunning and diligence of seducers, and the violence
of spirit in profane persons against the most holy and harmless
Christians, and on the other side by reason of the weakness in the
faith of many upright souls, whose consciences are very tender, and
their wounds hardly cured: of whom our Lord Christ was very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. and gentle toward them, as <hi>the great Shepherd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36043:13"/>
of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, Heb.</hi> 13.
20. as was foretold, <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. 11. and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> requires
much indulgence to be given them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 8. The acknowledgement of this Supremacy of the King
hath been opposed by sundry godly Protestants, who have in their
writings excepted against it, as <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Century</hi> writers of
<hi>Magdeburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Tis true, they excepted against the Title <hi>of head of the
Church</hi> given to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, as <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> and
such like persons misreported it, as if it gave to the King an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable
authentique power, to determine of faith, and worship of
God: but when those learned Protestants better understood what
was meant by it, they withdrew their exceptions, as Doctor <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old</hi>
shews in his <hi>Conference with Hart in the Tower,</hi> chap. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 9. Many godly persons are offended with the taking, and
defending the Lawfulness of the taking of this Oath, as fearing it
many tend to the taking away those Liberties of their consciences in
Religion, which are dearer to them then their lives: and being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of those who take it, least they betray those Liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is to be considered by those conscientious persons, who
make this objection, that the takers, and defenders of the taking of
this Oath do apprehend, that the imposing this Oath was for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Popes jurisdiction, and other Forreign power, as the
admonition of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> here prefixed shews, and
therefore there is nothing done by such takers or defenders
in prejudice of their brethrens Liberties, or imposition on
the consciences of others: But they that have taken it, or
conceive they may take it, if imposed, do it, as being satisfied in
their consciences by the foregoing arguments, or such like, that they
do but what they may do lawfully without offence, and hope that it
will fall out as it did in the business of the Altar of <hi>Ed, Josh.</hi> 22. that
a right intelligence of their fact will prevent any breach between
them and others, and unite them more closely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 10. This acknowledgement of the Kings Supremacy in
Causes Ecclesiastical hath been but of late, not before King <hi>Henry</hi>
the eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth.</p>
            <p>Answer. <hi>The Title</hi> of head of the Church of England,
(<hi>now altered into Supreme Governout over all persons)
though it were not assumed by the Kings of</hi> England <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:36043:13"/>
Henry <hi>the eighth, yet the power of Supreme Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Causes Ecclesiastical, as saith Bishop</hi> Bramhal <hi>in
his</hi> answer to Militiere, <hi>pag.</hi> 111. The ancient Kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
ever exercised, not onely before the Reformation, but
before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, as appeared by the Acts of their
great Councils, by their Statutes, and Articles of the Clergy,
by so many Laws of provision against the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi>
conferring Ecclesiastical dignities and benefices upon Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
by so many sharp oppositions against the exactions and
usurpations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by so many Laws concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Patronage of Bishopricks, and investitures of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
by so many examples of Churchmen punished by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate. This power, though not this name, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperors of old assumed to themselves, to Convocate
Synods, to preside in Synods, to confirm Synods, to establish
Ecclesiastical Laws, to receive appeals, to nominate Bishops,
to eject Bishops, to suppress Heresies, to Compose Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
differences, in Councils, out of Councils, by themselves,
by their Delegates. All which is as clear in the History of the
Church, as if it were written with a beam of the Sun.</p>
            <p>The sixth Proposition is <hi>[The Jurisdictions, Preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Priviledges, and Authorities in that Oath may be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defended]</hi> The jurisdictions, &amp;c. meant I conceive
to be expressed a little before the form of the Oath in the
Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 1. Of which the <hi>Queens admonition</hi>
saith, <hi>No other Authority is challenged, than that was challenged
and lately used by King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, and</hi> Edward <hi>the
sixth, that is, under God, to have the Soveraignty and Rule
over all manner of persons, born within her Realms, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Countreys, of what estate either Ecclesiastical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
soever they be, so as no other foreign power shall or ought
to have any superiority over them.</hi> What was used in the
days of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, appears
by the book of <hi>Acts and Monumens and Statutes</hi> in their days,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36043:14"/>
to wit, the rejecting the Popes jurisdiction, appointing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors,
judging and deposing some Bishops, commands to
take down Images, causing Divine service to be in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
tongue, the Bible in the <hi>English</hi> tongue to be in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
with many other things of the like kinde. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to defend them is [<hi>to Our power</hi>] whether by opposing
the bringers in of a Forreign power, especially the Popes
or by aiding the King in the right use of this Authority,
neither is the power granted which may not be lawfully
used or exercised, nor is the abuse of it required to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
With this explication, the Proposition is thus
proved.</p>
            <p>That we may lawfully swear to assist and defend, which
may lawfully be exercised, and may be of necessary use.</p>
            <p>This Proposition needs not any further proof being of it
self manifest.</p>
            <p>But all the Jurisdictions, Priviledges, Preeminences and
Authorities meant in the Oath according to the Queens
explication in her Admonition, ratified in the proviso of the
Statute 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> may be lawfully exercised, and may be of
necessary use, as appears by the recital of them and their
use before specified: therefore we may lawfully swear to
assist and defend them.</p>
            <p>The Objection that is made against this is, that these Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions,
Preeminences, Priviledges, and Authorities were
the same that were taken from the Pope and given to the
King, and thereby Papal power was conferred on him.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, <hi>The power (saith</hi> Hart <hi>Conference with</hi>
Rainold, chap. 1. division 2.) <hi>which we mean to the Pope
by this title of the Supreme Head is, that the Government of the
whole Church throughout the world doth depend of him: in
him doth lie the power of judging and determining all causes
of faith, of ruling Councils as President, and ratifying their
Decrees; of ordering and confirming Bishops and Pastours; of
deciding Causes brought him by Appeals from all the Coasts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36043:14"/>
the earth, of reconciling any that are excommunicate, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating,
suspending or inflicting other censures and
penalties on any that offend, yea, on Princes and Nations; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all things of the like sort, for Governing of the Church, even
whatsoever toucheth either preaching of Doctrine or practising
of Discipline in the Church of Christ.</hi> Now this immense pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as too heavy for the shoulders of a mortal man, and as
not belonging to the Kingly Office at all in many parts of
it, is disclaimed by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as is before shewed,
and not meant to be acknowledged in the Oath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saith Dr. <hi>John Rainold Confer. with Hart,</hi> chap. 10.
<hi>that which we take from the Pope we give not to any mortal
creature,</hi> and having by the reading of Dr. <hi>Nowels reproof of
Dormans proof</hi> of <hi>certain Articles</hi> convinced <hi>Hart</hi> the Jesuite,
that no more is meant by it then what <hi>August.</hi> saith <hi>Epist.</hi> 50.
<hi>that Kings do serve Gods as Kings, if in their own Realm they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
good things, and forbid evil, not onely concerning the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
state of men, but the Religion of God also:</hi> thus much
he did subscribe to. Out of all which I infer, that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
presumptuously and unjustly made by <hi>Mounsier de la
Militiere</hi> the crime of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which God
chastised by the late Tragedy, that <hi>the Authority which God
gave the King in Temporal matters was used by him for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Spiritual,</hi> in his tempting Epistle to his Majesty that
now is, whom the Lord preserve and direct in the manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of this power of so great concernment to so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of precious souls as are within his Dominions. <hi>Amen.</hi>
