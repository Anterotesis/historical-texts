            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The true Cauſes of the Commitment of
<hi>Mr. Clement Walker</hi> to the Tower.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſpread up and downe in the City, as many other lies are very
induſtriouſly (for there is no trade ſo quick at this time) that
Maſter <hi>Clement Walker</hi> is committed for writing a Book againſt
Colonell <hi>Fines,</hi> a lie as loud as any in that Book, though there
will appeare to be as many there, as there are leaves and many
more. The truth is this, he was never queſtioned for any thing
concerning Colonell <hi>Fines,</hi> that being by Order of the Houſe of Commons, and
direction of my Lord Generall thereupon, referred to a Councell of Warre: But
in his Book he had laid an aſpertion upon a Peere for carrying in and out things
ſecretly into the Iland of <hi>Lundy,</hi> the myſteries whereof muſt not bee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
for Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fines</hi> he did never once ſend to that Iland all the
while hee was Governour of <hi>Briſtoll:</hi> The Lords upon this; to vindicate the
honour of that Lord (whoſe the Iland was) did order the Gentleman Uſher
to bring <hi>Walker</hi> before them, to declare what the myſteries were that hee
ſpake of, and what hee knew to bee carried in and out of that Iland: Hee
attending one day, and there being not time to heare him for other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the next day hee rode out of the Towne; Whereupon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
Uſher receiving a check from the Lords, hee ſent the Meſſenger
Maſter <hi>Baker</hi> after him, who over-tooke him and brought him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
This put the angry Gentleman into ſuch a fury (who they ſay once
ſtab'd his Wife as ſhee ſate at Table with him) that hee called that Lord
(by whoſe meanes hee thought it was done) baſe beggerly Lord, and
this was depoſed by <hi>Baker</hi> who brought him up: Yet there being but one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this, and he denying it, the Lords proceeded not upon it; but deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him what were the words he ſpake: who anſwered, that he ſaid, that
Lord did proſecute him maliciouſly. This he charged the Lord with ſitting in
the Houſe, and upon this he was cenſured, that Lord having withdrawne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
The Lords, before they went to give their cenſure, calling for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and peruſing them to ſee what had been formerly done in the like caſes.
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> being afterward called into the Houſe (a day or two intervening
that he had ſufficient time to adviſe of it) and the judgement read unto him,
when he was asked, whether he would ſubmit to the Juſtice of the Houſe; hee
anſwered, noe, for that it was againſt the liberty of the Subject, becauſe there
was no originall Writ or Record before them; and becauſe he was a Commoner
of <hi>England,</hi> and a Committee in the County; and therefore ought not to bee
judged by the Lords, unleſſe he was firſt heard in the Houſe of Commons. This
when it was in the caſe of one of their Members, and that ſitting in their Houſe,
openly at their Barre, was ſuch a derogation to the priviledge of Parliament, and
ſubverſion of the power of Judicature in the higheſt Court of the Kingdome,
that the Lords commanded the Clerk preſently to ſet downe the words, and
committed this Gentleman to the Tower, ordering that they would proceed
further upon this, as that which ſtruck at the root of the power and priviledge
of the Lords Houſe. That this is the truth, and not thoſe lies which are
ſpread abroad, will appeare in the Journall Book to any that ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it.</p>
