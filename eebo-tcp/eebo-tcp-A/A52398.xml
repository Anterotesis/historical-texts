            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ROwland Owen</hi> saith,
that Mr. <hi>Reymer</hi>
about Six Years
since, being the Duke of
<hi>Norfolks</hi> Butler, ordered
him to carry the things
out, the Lodgings being
open, he saw Mr. <hi>Germain</hi>
in Bed with the Dutchess
of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> the Dutchess
leapt out of the Bed, and
put on a Morning Gown,
and <hi>German</hi> hid himself in
Bed, this was between five
and six of the Clock in the
Evening, about a fortnight
before <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Day;
he did not tell the Duke,
he is sure it was <hi>Germaine,</hi>
he saw him often, twice
or thrice a day, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
door of the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were shut, but he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it with a Key he
had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45641:5"/>
               <hi>MArgaret Ellwood</hi>
saith, she had a
Company to see
the Lodgings at <hi>Windsor,</hi>
in the first Year of King
<hi>James,</hi> about three or four
of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
a Woman told her
my Lady was not there,
but she opening the door,
saw my Lady upon the
Stools in an ill Posture,
Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s Breeches
were down, he pulled them
up, and laid his hand on
his Sword, saying, God
Damn you for a Whore,
how have you the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to come here? my
Lady bid him kick me
down, he scattered some
concerns, that is, Mans
Nature on the Boards. She
saw no Nakedness but her
Knee, or a little above;
another time after, she
found <hi>Germaine</hi>'s Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
and Ruffles in my
Ladies Bed; my Ladies
Woman said, there was
<hi>Germain</hi>'s Name upon
them. Another time she
saw Mr. <hi>Cornwall</hi> let Mr.
<hi>Germaine</hi> out of my Ladies
Closet; She saw <hi>Germains</hi>
Leggs within hers when
she came the first time
into the Room, and his
Breeches were about his
heels: The first time was
in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> time,
Mrs. <hi>Knifton</hi> told her, it
was <hi>Germains</hi> Linnen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THOMAS Hudson</hi>
saith, That the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
being at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> he
was Butler at <hi>Windsor,</hi>
when <hi>Germaine,</hi> the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess,
and <hi>Cornwall</hi> went
to Play, <hi>Germaine</hi> sent his
Footman for clean Linnen,
which he brought next
Morning. Mrs. <hi>Gwyn</hi> said
to the Dutchess, the Dogg
would have layn with me,
but she would not lye with
the Dogg where the Deer
lay'd, for she knew my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45641:5"/>
Lady Dutchess would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of him; after that,
he saw a Shirt and Waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat
in the Closet, which
my Ladies Woman, and
<hi>Ann Burton</hi> took away.
My Lord being absent,
we murmured amongst
our Selves, that my Lord
was wrong'd, I told my
Lord, whereupon my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Cragg</hi> had me to Lord
<hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Lodgings,
and threatned me, that
he would prefer me to his
Brother <hi>Richards,</hi> who
turned me off in <hi>Germany;</hi>
this was he thinks in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
or <hi>September,</hi> 1685
Mrs. <hi>Gwyn</hi> spoke this in
the Green-Room, and he
was in a Closet hard by,
and the Door open, and
so heard it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANN Burton</hi> saith,
She was Servant
to the Duke and
Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> when
the Duke was gone to
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> she was at
<hi>Windsor;</hi> and my Lady
went to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi>
when my Lady
came home, after Supper,
she was in great haste to
go to Bed, when she was
Undrest, she said she would
Lock us out, because she
would not be disturbed
before Eleven a Clock the
next Morning, though the
King or Queen should
come: <hi>Hudson</hi> told her,
<hi>Germaine</hi> was still in the
House, whereupon we laid
Chairs on the Back-stairs,
that we might hear him
if he came down; the
Chairs were not removed
next Morning, when <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi>
Man came with the
Linnen, he said, his Master
was there. My Lady or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a Fire to be made in
my Lords Room, where,
when she was come, Mrs.
<hi>Nelly Gwynn</hi> came in, and
asked her, how she liked
her Nights Rest, and being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45641:6"/>
asked for <hi>Germaine,</hi> she
said, she knew nothing of
him. My Lady complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her Hair being out
of Order, <hi>Nelly</hi> answered,
it was a hot Night with
her, enough to put her
Hair out of Powder and
Curl too: Presently after
<hi>Cornwell</hi> came in and ask'd
for <hi>Germaine,</hi> and my Lady
saying, she knew nothing
of him, <hi>Nelly Gwynn</hi> said,
I question not but he will
come out by and by like
a drowned Ratt; with that
whilst I was cleaning the
Dining Room, Mrs. <hi>Kifton</hi>
called me, and shewed me
in the Closet, <hi>Germaines</hi>
Shirt and Wastcoat; and
afterwards, making my
Ladies Bed, saw there were
two Prints had laid, the
Shirt and Wastcoat were
sent by the Duke to the
Lord <hi>Peterboroug,</hi> she saith
she is a single Woman, and
was never Marryed, this
was about <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Tide
about six Years since,
she supposes the Bed was
stained both by a Man and
Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SImon Varelst</hi> saith,
that he was at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>
to draw the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Picture
about six Years since, and
had the Dukes Closet to
put his Pictures in; when
he had done, and had been
at home two or three days,
<hi>German</hi> came to him much
concerned, and said, you
can do the Dutchess an
extraordinary kindness, &amp;
will oblige the Lord and
Lady <hi>Peterborough</hi> in the
highest degree; then he
shewed me a Letter from
the Dutchess to me, and
read it to me, before that
he told me there was a
Shirt and Waiscoat, and
they are known to be his.
He said, I desire you to
save the Dutchess Honour,
I desire that you will be so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45641:6"/>
much a Gentleman, as to
own them to be yours,
and that you left them
there. I answered, I was
much concerned there
should be such a trouble,
but I desired to be excused,
I could not do it without
prejudice. He told me,
the Lord and Lady <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
had discoursed the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> upon it,
and if it were but my
Linnen, their discourse had
wrought so much on him,
that if there came but any
Evidence to assist them,
he would leave off the
Pursuit: I refusing still,
he offered me a Purse of
Gold, and told me, I should
have my Fortune by it,
but I still refusing Mr.
<hi>Germaine,</hi> he went away
very much discontented,
my own Wife being in
the next Room, over-heard
the discourse between <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
and me, and told
it, and spoke of it, else I
had not been here now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THOMAS Foster</hi>
saith, that he was
Coachman to
Mr. <hi>Germaine,</hi> and carried
the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
often, about two Years
since in his Coach, and
brought her home, and the
Footmen have had four
Half-Crowns given them,
and <hi>Martin</hi> a <hi>Dutchman</hi>
his helper, called it Hush-Money.
It was by Night
against a Light, that he
saw her Face in the Coach,
it was about Seven or
Eight of the Clock at
Night, about this Time a
Year he hath seen her Face
once in the Day-time, she
looking out of a Sash-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
two Stories high in
<hi>Germain</hi>'s House in <hi>Park-Street,</hi>
he knows her Face
well enough; he hath
seen her before, and since
she was Married.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45641:7"/>
               <hi>EDieth Sawbridge</hi>
saith, that the <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following, this
unhappy Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Dutchess of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Sturton</hi> came
into her Chamber, and
she telling her what had
happened at <hi>Windsor,</hi>
Mrs. <hi>Sturton</hi> replied, this
was nothing but what she
expected before now; the
Witness replied, that if she
the Witness had been as
near the Dutchess as the
said Mrs. <hi>Sturton,</hi> she
would have prevented all
this, to which Mrs. <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
said, would you have
had me whipt at the Carts-Arss;
The Discourse we
had, was, that Mrs. <hi>Knif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
told her, when I came
from <hi>London,</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi>
Night, that she told me
she was glad I was come,
for she expected her
Throat to be cut every
Night since my Lord
Duke went to <hi>Fortsmouth,</hi>
I askt her the Reason of
her Fear, she answered,
<hi>Germain</hi> had said with my
Lady Dutchess ever since
my Lord Duke went to
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> that when he
came Home, he would
hear of it, and he would
kick her for a Bawd; and
if she should tell my Lord,
<hi>Germain</hi> would cut her
Throat: I bid her have a
Care what she said, for
these were dangerous
Words, how can you
prove this, she said, it was
very true, the Witness as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her (Mrs. <hi>Knifton</hi>)
how she knew this, she
said, <hi>Germain</hi> instead of

               <hi>I MARY,</hi> Dutchess of

that the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Charge of Adultery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Honourable
House of Peers, was and is
generally Insufficient, and
such as I humbly conceive,
I am not bound by Law to
give answer unto; yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my own Innocency, and
that I am not guilty of the
pretended Crimes, (this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
being shewed to
me) I shall and do under the
Matters and Qualifications
hereafter Mentioned, answer,
and say, hereby affirming
that having been married to
his Grace the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
for near Fifteen Years,
he never did (till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Charge given against
me) in the least pretend or
intimate unto me that I had
injured his Bed, but did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Treat me with great
Kindness and respect: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year 1685, at his
Request and Desire, I did
go with him from <hi>London</hi> to
<hi>France,</hi> and there continued
with him some Time, where
his Grace being under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition,
and continuing so
for some Time, he shewed so
great Affection to me, and
put so great Trust and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in me, that all such
things as were administred
to him, in Order to his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
he did not, non would
receive any of them, but
what came from my Hands,
and did with great Care at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him; and being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
he told me, his Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
required him to go for
<hi>England,</hi> but he would return
to me in <hi>France</hi> in some short
Time, and bring me home
for <hi>England;</hi> and at his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with me, he shewed
great Affection to me, with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45641:8"/>
Tears in his Eyes, said, he
had a Thousand Pardons to
ask me, desiring my Patience,
and that I should return into
<hi>England</hi> to him in some short
Time; and after his Graces
return into <hi>England,</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Notice from me, that
my Lodgings was inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
and desiring his Leave
to change the same, he wrote

that God forbid he should

and left me to my
Liberty therein; before his
Parting with me in <hi>France,</hi>
as a Testimony of his Love
and Affection to me, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
400 Pounds Yearly to
be paid me out of his own
Estate, by Quarterly Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
over and above the
seperate Maintenance settled
upon me by my Father, upon
my Marriage with him, and
that after his Arrival in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he made several Visits
to my Mother, the Countess
of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and with
great Observance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
asked her Blessing, and
told her, that he had left me
well and safe in <hi>France,</hi> and
then said, his own Debts
were pressing upon him, that
if her Daughter (meaning
my Self,) would consent
that the Mannor of <hi>Drayton</hi>
and other Estates should be
settled on him, and his Heirs,
he should thereby be made a
happy Man; and I coming
into <hi>England,</hi> his Grace ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put off House-keeping

St. <hi>James</hi>'s for about Two
Years; and in Suing him for
<hi>Alimony,</hi> the said Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

advised, that by the Laws of
the Land, a Husband Suing a
Divorce for the Adultery of
his Wife, he ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any sentence of Divorce
if he be proved guilty of the
same.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, the Respondent
doth aver, and is ready to
prove, that the Duke her
Husband, was, and is guilty
of the Adultery, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the course of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
for this Ten years last

am not guilty of the Crime

God, if she did not know
whether his Daughter was
an Adulteress? Her answer
was, as she hoped to see God
in Heaven, the Dutchess was
as Vertuous as any woman

saith, that what she then
said is true, and if she should

pretend to say any other, she
should wrong her self, she
