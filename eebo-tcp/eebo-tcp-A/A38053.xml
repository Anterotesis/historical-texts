         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>liament, have duely conſidered the
Meſſage received from Your Majeſty
concerning Your purpoſe of going into
<hi>Ireland</hi> in your own Perſon, to proſecute
the War there with the bodies of Your Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
leavied, tranſported, and maintained at their
charge; which you are pleaſed to propound to us, not
as a matter wherein your Majeſty deſires the advice of
Your Parliament, but as already firmly reſolved on,
and forthwith to be put in execution, by granting out
Commiſſions for the leavying of 2000 Foot, and 200
Horſe, for a Guard for Your Perſon when You ſhall
come into that Kingdom; Wherin we cannot chooſe
but with all reverence and humility to Your Majeſty,
obſerve, That You have declined Your great Councel,
the Parliament, and varied from the uſuall courſe of
Your Royall Predeceſſors, that a buſineſſe of ſo great
importance, concerning the peace and ſafety of all
Your Subjects, and wherein they have a ſpeciall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
by Your Majeſties promiſes, and by thoſe great
ſums which they have disburſed; and for which they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65118:3"/>
ſtand engaged, ſhould bee concluded and undertaken
without their advice: Whereupon we hold it our duty
to declare, That if at this time Your Majeſty ſhall go
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> You will very much endanger the ſafety
of Your Royall Perſon and Kingdom, and of all other
States profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and make way to that cruell and bloudy deſigne
of the Papiſts every where, to root out and deſtroy
the Reformed Religion, as the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> have in a
great part already effected in that Kingdome, and in
all likely-hood would quickly bee attempted in other
places, if the conſideration of the ſtrength and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> did not
much hinder and diſcourage the execution of any
ſuch deſigne: And that We may manifeſt unto Your
Majeſty the danger and miſery which ſuch a journey
and enterprize would procure, We preſent to Your
Majeſty the Reaſons of this Our humble Opinion and
Advice.</p>
            <p>I. Your Royall Perſon will be ſubj<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct, not only
to the caſualty of War, but to ſecret practiſes and
conſpiracies, eſpecially your Majeſty continuing your
profeſſion to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion in that
Kingdome, which the Papiſts are generally bound by
their vow to extirpate.</p>
            <p>II. It will exceedingly encourage the Rebels,
who do generally profeſſe and declare, That Your
Majeſty doth favour and allow their proceedings, and
this Inſurrection was undertaken by the warrant of
your Commiſſion; and it will make good their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65118:3"/>
of great advantage by Your Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at this time of ſo much diſtraction in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whereby they may hope we ſhall be diſabled to
ſupply the War there, eſpecially there appearing leſſe
neceſſity of Your Majeſties journey at this time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the manifold ſucceſſes which God hath given
againſt them.</p>
            <p>III. It will much hinder and impaire the meanes
whereby this Warre is to bee ſupported, and increaſe
the charge of it, and in both theſe reſpects, make it
more inſupportable to Your Subjects; And this wee
can confidently affirme, becauſe many of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
who have already ſubſcribed, do upon the
knowledge of Your Majeſties intentions, declare
their reſolutions not to pay in their money, and others
very willing to have ſubſcribed, do now profeſſe the
contrary.</p>
            <p>IV. Your Majeſties abſence muſt neceſſarily very
much interrupt the proceedings of Parliament, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Your Subjects of the benefit of thoſe further Acts
of Grace, and Iuſtice, which we ſhall humbly expect
from Your Majeſty, for the eſtabliſhing of perfect V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and mutuall confidence betwixt Your Majeſty,
and Your People, and procuring and confirming the
proſperity and happineſſe of both.</p>
            <p>V. It will exceedingly encreaſe the jealouſies and
feares of Your People, and render the doubts of Your
Subjects, more probable of ſome force intended by
ſome evill Counſels neer Your Majeſty, in oppoſition
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65118:4"/>
to the Parliament, and favour of the malignant party
of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>VI. It will bereave Your Parliament of that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
whereby they were induced to undertake this
War upon Your Majeſties promiſe, that it ſhould be
mannaged by their advice, which cannot be done of
Your Majeſty contrary to their Counſel, ſhall undertake
to Order and Govern it in Your own Perſon.</p>
            <p>Vpon which, and divers other, Reaſons, we have
reſolved, by the full and concurring agreement of both
Houſes, That we cannot with the duty which belongs
to us, conſent to any levies, or raiſing of Souldiers to
be made by Your Majeſty, for this Your intended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to the payment of any Army,
or Souldiers there; but ſuch as ſhall be employed and
governed according to our advice and direction; and
that if ſuch Levie, ſhall be made by any ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Your Majeſty, not agreed to by both Houſes of
Parliament, we ſhall be forced to interpret the ſame to
be raiſed to the terror of Your People, and diſturbance
of the publike Peace, and hold our ſelves bound by the
Laws of the Kingdom, to apply the authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to ſuppreſſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>And we do further, moſt humbly declare, That
if Your Majeſty ſhall by ill Counſell bee perſwaded
to go, contrary to this advice of Your Parliament
(which we hope Your Majeſty will not:) We do not
in that caſe hold our Selves bound to ſubmit to any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65118:4"/>
Commiſſioners which your Majeſty ſhall chuſe, but
do reſolve to preſerve and governe the Kingdome by
the counſel &amp; advice of your Parliament, for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and your Poſterity, according to our Allegiance,
and the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>Wherefore We humbly pray, and adviſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to deſiſt from this your intended paſſage into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and from all preparation of Men and Armes
tending thereunto, and to leave the mannaging of that
Warre to your Majeſties Parliament, according to
your Majeſties promiſe made unto us, and your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Commiſſion, granted under your great Seale of
<hi>England,</hi> by advice of both Houſes; In proſecution
whereof, by Gods bleſſing, We have made a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
entrance by many defeats of the Rebels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are much weakened, and diſheartned, and
have no probable meanes of ſubſiſtence if our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
ſhall not be interrupted by this interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your Majeſties journey, but that we may hope
upon goods grounds, that within a ſhort time, without
hazzard of your Majeſties Perſon, and ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
confuſion to your Kingdoms, which muſt needs
enſue, if You ſhould proceed in this Reſolution, We
ſhall bee enabled fully to Vindicate Your Majeſties
Right and Authority in that Kingdome, and puniſh
thoſe horrible and outragious cruelties which have
been committed in the murthering, and ſpoyling ſo
many of Your Subjects, and bring that Realme to ſuch
a condition, as may be much for the advantage of
Your Majeſty and this Crown, the honour of Your
Government, and contentment of Your People; for
the better and more ſpeedy effecting whereof, we do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65118:5"/>
againe renew our humble deſires of your return to
your Parliament; And that you will pleaſe to reject all
Counſels, and Apprehenſions which may any way
derogate from the faithfulneſſe, and allegiance, which
in truth and ſincerity, we have alwayes borne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to your Majeſty, and ſhall ever make good
to the uttermoſt, with our lives and fortunes.</p>
