            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all sortes of humane
writers, there is none that
haue done more profit, or
deserued greater prayse,
then they who haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to faithfull records
of Histories, eyther the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of mighty states,
or the liues and actes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
men: for by describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the order and passages
of these two, and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
hath followed what counsailes, they haue set foorth
vnto vs, not onely precepts, but liuely patterns, both for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
directions and for affayres of state: whereby in shorte
time young men may be instructed, and ould men more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
furnished with experience then the longest age of man
can affoorde. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth that <hi>L. Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
when he went from Rome to make warre against <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
was altogether vnskilfull in Militarie seruices:
yet in the time of his Nauigation he so exercised himselfe
what with conference, and what with reading of histories,
that when hee came into Asia, by the iudgement and
confession of that great King, hee was preferred before all
the commaunders that were before him. Heerevppon
when <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> did deliberate of anye weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter, hee would especiallye take aduise of men
<pb facs="tcp:4090:4"/>
skilfull in histories, and not without good cause: for if
(as <hi>Afranius</hi> saith) experience hath begot Wisedome,
and Memory as a mother hath brought it foorth; who are
to be better accompted then they whose memory is as it
were a rich storehouse, of the experiences not of one age
or Country, but of all times and of all nations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no great maruaile that <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who after the death
of her husband <hi>Odonatus</hi> tooke vpon her the state, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insulted vpon the Romaines, but held the Arabians, the
Saricenes, the Armenians, and other fierce and intractible
people, in such obedience, that although shee were both a
woman and a Barbarian, yet they neuer stirred against her:
for she had perfectly red the Romaine history in Greeke,
and also had herselfe abridged the Alexandrian and all the
Orientall histories, whereby she attained the highest pitch
both of Wisedome and authority: for examples are of
greater force to stir vnto vertue, then bare preceptes, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>Cicero</hi> said that nothing could be taught well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
example. Therfore the Lacaedemoians (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
did vse vpon feastiuall dayes to present vnto theyr Sons
certayne drunken slaues whom they called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that by
view of the vice they might learne to auoyde it, and <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menias</hi>
the Thebane, would shew to his Schollers musitians
of all sortes good and bad, instructing them to followe the
one and not the other. And this is that which the <hi>Apologily</hi>
telleth of a certaine Country woman, who being hard fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
and fearing least shee should bring foorth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
like her selfe, got many faire and beautifull Pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which shee did dayly and steedfastly beholde: the
meaning whereof it, that by setting before vs the actes and
liues of excellent men, it is the readiest way to fashion our
qualities according to the same.</p>
            <p>Heereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> doeth rightly call history the witnesse
of times, the light of truth, the life of memory, and the
<pb facs="tcp:4090:4"/>
messenger of antiquity. Heereby wee are armed against
all the rage and rashnesse of Fortune: and heereby wee
may seeme (in regarde of the knowledge of thinges)
to haue trauelled in all Countryes, to haue liued in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to haue been conuersant in all affayres. Neyther is
that the least benefit of history, that it preserueth eternally,
both the glory of good men, and shame of euill. Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
doe deny, that glory is to be desired: for vertue
(say they) is a reward vnto it selfe, and must not be respected
for the vaine and titulare blastes of glory: yet in wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these things, they affect that especially, which they
especially depraue. And indeed there is no man hath so
horny hartstringes, (as <hi>Persius</hi> speaketh) who is not tickled
with some pleasure of praise: againe there is no man of so
flinty a forehead, who is not touched with some feare of
infamy and shame. Doe we thinke that the valiant souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thinketh no toyle too tough, but boldly aduentureth the
hazard of all happes, because he is weary of his life? death
commeth by nature to all men alike, onely with difference of
memory with posterity.</p>
            <p>And I would thinke that Citties at the first were build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
lawes made, and many thinges inuented for the vse of
men, chiefly for desire of glory: which humour except the
old gouernours of common wealths, had thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they would neuer haue fostered it as they did, with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes,
statues, trophies and triumphes, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is but temporary and short; but in histories of
worth it is onely perpetual. This <hi>Cicero</hi> perceiuing he dealt
with <hi>Luceius</hi> to commit his actions to the monuments of his
writings: and <hi>Plinie</hi> the yonger did wish that he might bee
mentioned in the histories of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> because he
did foresee that they should neuer decay.</p>
            <p>But these are such as are not led away with a lust, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to flatter or to deface, whereby the creadite of historie
is quite ouerthrowne. Yet the endeuour to curry fauour
<pb facs="tcp:4090:5"/>
is more easily disliked, as bearing with it an open note of
seruility, and therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> when he heard <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi>
read many things that he had written of him farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
truth, as he was sayling the floud <hi>Hidaspis,</hi> he threw
the booke into the Riuer, and sayd that hee was almost
mooued to send <hi>Aristobulus</hi> after for his seruile dealing:
but enuious carping carieth a counterfeite shew of liberty,
and thereby findeth the better acceptance.</p>
            <p>And since I am entred into this point, it may seeme
not impertinent to write of the stile of a history, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
what continuance, and what meane is to be vsed
in all matter; what thinges are to bee suppressed, what
lightly touched, and what to be treated at large: how crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
may be won, and suspition avoyded: what is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the order of times, and discription of places and
other such circumstances of weight; what liberty a writer
may vse in framing speeches, and in declaring the causes,
counsailes and euentes of thinges done: how farre he must
bend himselfe to profit: and when and how he may play
vpon pleasure, but this were too large a field to enter into:
therefore least I should run into the fault of the <hi>Mindians,</hi>
who made their gates wider then their towne, I will here
close vp; onely wishing that all our English histories were
drawne out of the drosse of rude and barbarous Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:
that by pleasure in reading them, the
profit in knowing them, myght
more easily bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned.</p>

Prince, king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had
his fortunate gift of a long &amp; prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
raigne ouer this realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
much strengthned and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by natures supply of seuen good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
sonnes. <hi>Edward</hi> his eldest sonne,
prince of Wales, commonly called
the Blacke Prince: <hi>William</hi> of Hatfield: <hi>Lyonel,</hi> Duke of
Clarence: <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster: <hi>Edmund</hi> of
Langley, Duke of Yorke: <hi>Thomas</hi> of Woodstocke, Duke of
Gloucester: and <hi>William</hi> of Windsore. These sonnes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life of their renowmed Father, were such ornaments
and such stayes to his estate, as it seemed no greater could be
annexed thereunto. For neither armies, nor strong holdes
are so great defences to a prince, as the multitude of children:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4090:6"/>
Fortes may decay, and forces decrease, and both decline and
fall away, eyther by varietie of fortune, or inconstancie of
mens desires: but a mans owne bloud cleaueth close vnto
him; not so much in the blisses of prosperitie, which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
imparted to others, as in the crosses of calamity, which
touch none so neere, as those that are neerest by nature. But
in succeeding times they became in their ofspring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie
of diuision and discord, to the vtter ruine of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and great wast and weakning of the whole Realme:

hardly stoope to termes of soueraigntie, but vpon euery of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of occasion wil aspire to indure, rather no equall then any
superiour, and for the most part, the hatred of those that are
neerest in kinde, is most dispitefull &amp; deadly if it once breake
forth. The feare of this humor caused <hi>Remulus,</hi> to embrewe
the foundations of the Cittie and Empire of Rome, with the
bloud of his brother <hi>Remus.</hi> According to which example,
the tyrants of Turkie, those butchers of Sathan, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

none do wrong vnder him: for by mainteining, or wincking
at the vices of his officers, he maketh them his owne, and shal
surely be charged therewith when first occasion doth serue
against him. At the last, vpon instant importunity of both
houses, the king did consent, that a commission should goe
forth to certaine noble men, giuing them authority to heare
and determine all matters which were obiected against the
L. Chancellour: and then was a Subsidie graunted, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the money should be expended by the Lords,

claime to the duchy of Britaine, should be sold to the French

king had giuen him in Ireland: this was likewise assented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
vpon condition, that before Easter then next ensuing, the
duke should depart into Ireland, and there remaine: at so
high a price did they value the riddance of him out of the
realme.</p>
            <p>The charge of the Subsidie money was committed to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
earle of Arundell, Commissioners for the earle of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,

their proceeding, the king kept all off, in places farre distant:
either to manifest thereby the dissent of his minde, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
the griefe which his neerenesse would increase. And
now was the Chancellour left vnto himselfe, to answere to
those demeanures, wherein he made the kings blinde fauour
his priuiledge and protection, supposing neuer to see the
same either altered or ouer-ruled. In the end, being conuict
of many crimes and abuses, he was deposed from his office,
his goods were confiscated to the kings Exchequer, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was adiudged woorthy of death: Yet was execution
submitted to the kings pleasure, and vnder sureties he was

Bishop of Duresme, another of the Kings dainties, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
also from being Lord Treasorer of England, he was
a man of little depth, either in learning or wisedome, but
one that had the Arte of seeming, in making the best shewe
of whatsoeuer he spake or did: and rising from meane estate
to so high a pitch of honour, hee exercised the more exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely
his ryote, auarice and ambition, not able to moderate
the lustes and desires which former want had kindled.</p>
            <p>When this businesse was blowne ouer, the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againe to London, and did presently receiue the Earle
of Suffolke, with the Duke of Ireland, and the Archbishop
of Yorke, to greater grace and familiaritie then at any time
before. These <hi>Triumuirs</hi> did not cease to stirre vp the Kings
stomake against those Noble men, whose speciall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
had made matter of fame and regarde: partly for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
which they had receiued, partly vpon malicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
to see the other so fauoured, and themselues so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and that their priuate choller and ambition might
beare some shewe of publike respect, they suggested vnto
the King, that he was but halfe, yea not halfe a King in his
owne Realme, but rather the shadow and picture of a King:
for if we respect (sayd they) matters of state, you beare the
sword, but they sway it, you haue the shewe, but they the
authority of a Prince, vsing your name as a colour and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to their proceedings, and your person as a cypher,
to make them great, and be your selfe nothing. Looke to the
dutie of your subiectes, and it is at their deuotion: so that
you can neither commaunde nor demaunde any thing, but
with such exceptions and limitations as they please to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
come now to your priuate actions: your liberalitie (the
greatest vertue in a prince) is restrained, your expences mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
and your affections confined, to frowne and fauour as
they doe prescribe. What Ward is so much vnder gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Gardian? Wherein will they next, or can they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4090:10"/>
more abridge you? Except they should take from you the
place, as they haue done the power of a Prince: and in this
we thinke, they may iusty be feared, hauing so great might
ioyned with so great aspiring mindes. For power is neuer
safe when it doth exceede: &amp; ambition is like the Crocodile,
which groweth so long as he liueth; or like the Iuie, which
fastning on the foote of the tallest Tower, by small, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
rising, at length will climbe aboue the toppe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
growne from a sparke to a flame, from a twigge to a

such ouer-ruling of Princes haue proceeded to their
ouerthrowing, and such cutting them short hath turned to
cutting them off, their mindes are suspicious, their power
daungerous, and therefore the opportunitie must bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
            <p>The Kings owne weaknesse made him apprehensiue, and
framed his mind to a vaine, and needlesse feare: but chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was moued at the remoouing of his Chauncellour and
Treasorer out of their offices, and of the Duke of Ireland out
of the Realme, supposing it a restraint to his princely power,
that he might not absolutly and in things giue or forgiue as
his pleasure serued. When these pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ible perswasions, that (although he was naturally of no

               </gap>direct courses, partly vpon negligence
to search out the truth, partly vpon delight to bee flattered
and smothly vsed, neither did they long deferre their deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
and first it was appointed, that the Duke of Gloucester
and certaine others of that part, should be inuited to a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
within London, &amp; there suddainely surprised and made
away. Sir <hi>Nicholas Brambre,</hi> who the yere before had beene
Mayor of London, and in whome abundance of wealth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the want of honest qualities, was a busie agent in this
butcherly businesse: but <hi>Richard Extone</hi> the Mayor of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4090:11"/>
Cittie that yeare, discouered the practise by whome the
Duke was warned both to auoide the present perill, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be warie of the like.</p>
            <p>The yeare next following, <hi>Richared</hi> Earle of Arundel, and
<hi>Thomas Mowbraye</hi> Earle of Notingham, had the conduct
of a Nauie committed to their charge: in this viage they
tooke aboue a hundred sayle of the enemies ships, fraughted
with Wines, and well appointed for fight: they also relieued
and fortified Brest, and tooke two fortes which the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had raised against it. The Earles so behaued themselues
in this seruice, that they grew to a verie great estimation,
both for curtesie among their Souldiers, and for courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their enemies; &amp; their actions were the more famous,
by reason of the infortunate insufficiencie of other Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
by whose either rashnesse or cowardise many good
Souldiers were dayly defeated, and euery yeare made noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
by one losse or other. Yet notwithstanding all their
good labour and lucke, they were at there turne, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the King, with great straungnes, both of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and speech. Who was so vnable to dissemble his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight,
that he could hardly deferre it, vntill the heate of the
honour and loue which they had wonne, were somewhat
abated. So much are men more inclinable to reuenge dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
then rewarde desert: for it is troublesome to bee
gratefull, and many times chargeable: but reuenge is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and preferred before gaine.</p>
            <p>About the same time, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Ireland forsooke
the companie of his lawfull wife, whose mother Lady <hi>Isabel</hi>
was daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in steede of her
he tooke vnto him a base Bohemian, a Tauerners daughter.
The King little regarded this indignitie done vnto his cosin,
and in so great confusion of the state, let it passe vnreproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as ouershadowed with greater vices, but the Duke of
Gloucester her vncle, tooke it in high disdaine, as iniurious
to the royall bloud, and did attend vpon occasion to worke
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4090:11"/>
reuenge, this was not secrete from the Duke of Irelande,
who likewise bent al his deuises to bring the Duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester
to his ouerthrow. The Duke of Gloucester did prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this enmitie, openly and manlike: the Duke of Ireland
closely, and therefore the more daungerously. The Duke of
Gloucester was greater in bloud, the Duke of Ireland in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
he being Vncle to the King, this bearing himselfe as
the Kings fellow. The Duke of Gloucester pretended for the
state, the Duke of Ireland for the King: and much priuate
mallice did passe vnder these publike shewes: but in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of such equall powers, there is many times final diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in harme.</p>
            <p>And now was Easter past, the tearme affigned to Duke
<hi>Robert Veere</hi> for his departure into Ireland: and least his
stay might breede some stirre within the Realme, hee still
busied himselfe in preparation for his iournie, and at last (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were long) made a solemne shew ofsetting forth.
The King went in great state to accompanie him to his ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
and the Earle of Suffolke, with Iustice <hi>Trisiliane,</hi> and
the residue of that faction, either for fauour followed, or for
feare durst not stay hehinde. So they passed together into
Wales, and (whether vpon leuitie the Kings mind changed,
or whether it was so contriued at the first to drawe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
more seperate from the Lords) there the Dukes ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
was at an ende. Then they entred into counsell, which
way the Lords might best be suppressed: many deuises were
deepely debated, all pleased without respect either of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of disgrace: but few stoode with likelyhoode of euent
to their desires, and therefore none was finally concluded.
After long time thus friuolously spent, they left Wales, and
came to the Castle of Notingham, where the King caused
the high Shirifes of all the Shires in the Realme to be called
before him, and demaunded of them, what strength they
could make on his part against the Lordes, if neede shoulde
require: their answere was, that the common people did so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4090:12"/>
fauour the Lords, and were so well resolued of their loue &amp;
loyaltie towards the King, that it was not in their power to
rayse any great power against them. Then they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
that no Knights nor burgesses should afterwards
bee chosen to any Parliament, but those whome it pleased
the King to appoint; whereto they said, that it was a harde
matter in those times of Iealousie and suspition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bereaue
the people of their auncient libertie in choosing Knightes
and Burgesses for the Parliament, some few other matters
being either vnreasonably required, or obtained to small
end, the Sherifs were licensed to depart. Then were assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

<hi>Iohn Blake,</hi> a Counceller at the Law, by direction of Iustice
<hi>Trisilian,</hi> whilest the King made his stay in Wales: to the
which the Iustices afore-named, some in discharge of their

            <p>To the first, that they did derogate from the prerogatiue

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:4090:13"/>
To the second and third: that they are to be punished by

            <p>To the fourth and fifth: that they are worthy to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

            <p>To the seuenth: that the king may at his pleasure dissolue
the Parliament, and whosoeuer shall afterwards proceed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the kings minde, as in a Parliament, he is worthy to be

            <p>To the eighth: that they can not, and whosoeuer doeth
the contrary, he deserueth to be punished as a traitour.</p>
            <p>To the ninth: that aswell the motioner as also the bringer
of the sayd statute to the Parliament, are worthy to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as traitours.</p>
            <p>To the tenth, they answered: that the said iudgement see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to them erronious and reuocable in euery part. <hi>In wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whereof, the iustices aforesayd, with</hi> Iohn Locktone, <hi>the
kings sergeant at law, haue subscribed and set their seales to these
present, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When these bloody sentences of death and treason, were
vnder generall &amp; large termes thus fastened vpon the lords,
the king supposed his attempts against them, whether by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
or by couler of law sufficiently warranted: but his
power both wayes, as it was terrible against weake resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
so against such mighty defendants it was of small
force to effect that which he so much affected. Yet he did
not omit his best indeuour: and first, accounting the lordes
as condemned persons, he made diuision of their lands and
goods among those that he fauououred. Then he waged
souldiers to be in a treadinesse for his assistance, and sent the
earle of Northumberland to arrest the earle of Arundell, at
his castle in Reygate, where he then lay. But the earle of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell,
either vpon aduertisement, or suspition of the kings
minde, band<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d himselfe so strong, that when the earle of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4090:13"/>
Northumberland came vnto him, he dissembled his intent,
and left his purpose vnperformed. Thus were these procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the king, as now in counsell, so afterwards in euent,
not much vnlike that which the Fable telleth of a certaine
hunter, who first solde the skinne of the beare, and then went
about to take her: but when he came within the forrest, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by vnskilfulnesse or misaduenture, he not onely missed
his pray, but fell himselfe into danger of the beast.</p>
            <p>The duke of Gloucester hauing secret intelligence of the
kings displeasure and of his drift, sent the bishop of London
to perswade the king to entertaine a more fauourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him: making faith to the bishop with a solemne
oath, that he neuer entended any thing to the preiudice of
the king, either in person or state. The Bishop not vnskilfull
to ioyne profitable perswasion with honest, declared to the
king that his displeasure against the Lords was not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded

               </gap> some of their actions: how
desirous they were of his grace and fauour: how faithfull and
forward they promised to persist in all dutifull seruice: how
honourable this agreement would be to the king: how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the realme: and how daungerous to both, these
troubles might encrease. The king seemed to giue good
eare &amp; credit to the bishops speech: but <hi>Michael Delapoole,</hi>
a turbulent man, and against quiet counsell obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
standing then by the king, soone stiffened his minde
against all impression of friendship. Heereupon contention
did arise betweene the Bishop and the Earle, and brake
forth violently into heat of words. The Earle applied to the
Lordes those obiections wherewith great men are vsually
charged: sparing no spight of speech, and vsing all arte to
aggrauate matters against them. The bishop replied that
the Earle was thus fiercely bent, not vpon his owne necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor loue to the king: but onely to satisfie his bloody and
ambitious humour, wherein he was so immoderate, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4090:14"/>
then the lords should not be destroyed, he would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
them with the ruines of the state, for tumults might
in deed be raised by men of little courage, but must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with the hazzard, and ended with the losse of the most
valiant: that neither his counsell in this matter was to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
being the principall firebrand of the disturbance,
not his complaints against any man to be any thing regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
being himselfe a condemned person, and one that held
both his life and honour at the pleasure of the king. At these
words the king was exceedingly wroth, and charged the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
with menacing &amp; threats to auoid his presence. When
the duke of Glocester had knowledge heereof, he signified
the daunger to the earles of Arundell, Warwicke, and Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,
aduising them to take armes, and vnite themselues for
their common defence: for in so doubtfull and suspected
peace, open warre was the onely hope of safety. These three
Earles were the chiefest strength to the side, but the Duke
bare the most stroke, because he was most bolde, and his
greatnesse almost obscured the names of the rest. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, the king thinking separate dealing the onely way
to weaken a confederacy, endeuoured to preuent the lordes
in ioyning of their forces: and to that end he sent a strength
of men with charge, either to set vpon the earle of Arundell
where he did lie, or to intercept him in his passage towardes
the Duke. But the Earle had traueiled all the night before
their comming, and so happily escaped to Haringey parke,
where he found the Duke and the other Earles with a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
company, as well to make attempt, as to stand vpon
resistance.</p>
            <p>When the king heard hereof, he was disturbed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
in minde, being now in choise either to relent or to
resist, whereof he much disdained the one, and distrusted the
other. His followers also were diuided in counsell: some
fretting at the disgrace, and some fainting at the daunger.
The Archbishop of York perswaded the king, that occasion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4090:14"/>
was now offered to shew himselfe a King indeed, if he would
muster a royall armie, and by maine might beat downe
the boldnesse of this presumption. NIHIL DICTV FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CILIVS,
sayd another: <hi>This is more readily deuised, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> done:</hi>
the army against vs is mighty, and the commanders are great
men, both for courage and skill, and greatly fauoured of the
common people: whereby that which is accompted so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
pay, may chaunce to prooue a desperate debt. Therefore
it were better with some yeelding to enter into conditions
of quiet, then by standing vpon high points of honour to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the issue of a battaile, wherein the King cannot winne
without his weakning, not loose without daunger of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.
There was then in presence, a certaine olde Knight,
called Sir <hi>Hugh Linne,</hi> a good Souldier, but a very mad-cap,
&amp; one that liued chiefely vpon the liberalitie of noble men;
by vaine iestes affecting the grace of a pleasant conceite: of
him the King demaunded in mirth, what he thought best to
be done? Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> swore, swownes, and snayles, let vs set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and kill euery man and mothers childe; and so we
shall make riddaunce of the best friendes you haue in the
Realme, this giddie answere more weighed with the King,
then if it had beene spoken in graue and sober sport: and thus
it often happeneth, that wisedome is the more sweetly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
when it is tempored with folly, and earnest is the lesse
offensiue, if it bee deliuered in iest. In the end, the deuise of
raysing armes was laide aside, not as displeasing (being so
agreable to former proceedings) but as despayring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
thereby; and the Archbishop of Canterburie, with the
Bishop of Ely being Lord Chaunceller, were sent vnto the
Lordes, to vnderstand the cause of their assemblie: answere
was made, that it was for the safetie of themselues; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King; and the ouerthrow of them which sought
the ouerthrow of both. At the last it was concluded by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of the Bishops, that the Lordes should come before
the King at Westminster, vpon promise of his protection, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4090:15"/>
there haue audience concerning their griefes: the Bishop of
Ely also making priuat faith, that he would discouer any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that he could discrie, a little before the time they should
come, the Bishoppe of Ely sent word, of an awaite that was
purposed to be layed for them, at a place called the Mewes,
neere London; aduising the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either to make stay, or to come
prepared: but rather to make stay, least further prouocation
might make reconcilement more hard, hereupon they came
not at the time appointed, and the King maruailing at their
failance, enquired the cause of the Bishop of Ely: who aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Lords found want of true meaning, &amp; that
they neither did, nor durst repose assuraunce in the Kings
word, which they saw to bee vsed as a meanes to entrape
them, the King made the matter verie strange vnto him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
with an oath that hee was free from deceite, both in
consent and knowledge: and in a great rage, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Sherifes of London to goe to the place, and slay all
those whome they found there in a waite. Whether this was
but a countenance of his, or whether he was not priuie to the
practise, it is not assuredly knowne, and in deede, the matter
was not false, but the place mistaken: for Sir <hi>Thomas Triuet,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Nicholas Brambre</hi> had assembled many armed men
at Westminster, with direction to assault the Lordes at their
best aduantage: but perceiuing their deceite to be discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they dissolued the companie, and sent them secretely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to London.</p>
            <p>Then the Lordes, vpon new faith for their securitie, came
to the King at Westminster, and yet in faith they brought se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
with them, such troupes of men, as in a place where
they were so entirely fauoured, was able to defend them, in
any suddaine tumult or daunger: the King vpon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
entred into Westminster Hall, apparelled in his royall
robes: and when he was placed in his seate, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himselfe to maiestie and state, the Bishop of Ely Lord
Chaunceller, made a long Oration to the Lordes in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4090:15"/>
Kings name. Wherein he declared, the heinousnesse of their
offence, the greatnesse of their perill, how easie a matter it
had beene for the King to haue leuied a power sufficient to
distroy them; and yet for the generall spare of his subiectes
bloud, and in particular fauour to the Duke and other Lords,
he made choyse to encounter and ouercome them, rather by
friendship then by force: and therefore was willing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pardon their ryote, but also to heare their griefes, and in
a peaceable and quiet manner to redresse them. The Lordes
alleaged for causes of their taking armes, first the necessitie
of their owne defence! secondly, the loue both of the King
and of the Realme, whose fame and fortune did dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
by meanes of certaine traytors, who liued onely by the
dishonours of the one, and decayes of the other, those whom
they challenged for traytors, were <hi>Robert Veere</hi> Duke of
Ireland, <hi>Alexander Neuill</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, <hi>Michaell
Delapoole</hi> Earle of Suffolke, <hi>Robert Trisiliane</hi> Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Sir <hi>Nichol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Brambre,</hi> and certaine others, somewhat
secreter, but nothing better: and to iustifie this appeale, they
threw downe their gloues, and offered themselues to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
by combate. The king replied, that often times the causes
of actions being good, yet, if the meanes want moderation
and iudgement, the euents proue pernicious: and therefore,
though these complaints were true, yet were these courses
not tollerable, which did beare an open face of rebellion, and
by licentiousnesse of the multitude, might soone haue sorted
to such an end: for it is more easie to raise the people, then
to rule them: whose furie once stirred, will commonly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
some wayes. But (sayd he) since we haue broken
this broile, we will not by combatting giue occasion of a
new: but at the next parliament (which he appointed should
begin the third day of February then next ensuing) as well
you,<note place="margin">Crastino puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis.</note> as they, shall be present, and iustice indifferently done
vnto all. In the meane time, he tooke all parties into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
that none should endanger or endammage another:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4090:16"/>
desiring the Lordes to beare in minde, that as princes must
not rule without limitation, so subiectes must vse a meane in
their libertie. Then he caused the duke and the Earles, which
all this time kneeled before him, to arise, and went with them
into his priuate Chamber, where they talked a while, and
drunke familiarly together, &amp; afterwards, with a most friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
farwell he licenced them to depart. They of the contrarie
faction were not present at this meeting, and if they had, it
was thought, that the presence of the King should little haue
protected them.</p>
            <p>This act of the King was diuers waies taken: some iudged
him fearefull: others moderate, rather in sparing the bloud
of his subiectes. The Lordes were verie ioyfull of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
and fauour, which as by base or bad meanes they would
not seeke, so being well gotten, they did highly esteeme. Yet
they thought it the safest course, not to seperate themselues,
suspecting the mutabilitie of the King, and the malice of
their enemies, of whome they knewe neither where they
were, nor what they did entend: and being men of great
wealth, and great power, and greatly bent to hurtfull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they were feared not without a cause: for the Duke of
Ireland, either by setting on, or sufferance of the King, was
all this time mustering of Souldiours out of Cheshire and
Wales, where hee gathered an armie both for number, and
goodnesse of men sufficient, if another had beene generall,
to haue maintained the side.</p>
            <p>When the Lordes were aduertised hereof, they deuided
themselues, &amp; beset all the waies by which the Duke should
passe to London; determining to encounter him, before he
did increase his power, and countenance his actions with
the puissance or name of the King. At the last he was met by
the Earle of Derby, at a place called Babbelake neere to
Burforde: and there the Earle put his men in array, resoluing
with great boldnesse to hazard the battaile, his Souldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
were ful of courage and hart, disliking nothing more then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4090:16"/>
delay, as a loosing of time, and a hinderance to the victorie:
but the Duke, being a man not fit for action, yet mutinous,
and more apt to stirre strife, then able to stint it: vpon newes
of an enemie would presently haue fled. There was then in
the armie as a principall Commaunder, one Sir <hi>Thomas Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineux,</hi>
Constable of Cheshire, a man of great wealth, and
of good proofe in seruice, vpon whose leading all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
did depend: he perswaded the Duke, that this was but a
part of the forces that were against them, and led onely by
the Earle of Derby, a man of no speciall name (at that time)
among the Lordes, and if they could not beare through that
resistance, it was but in vaine to attempt any great atchiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by armes. Hereupon the Duke stayed his steps, but his
faint spirits were mooued by this speech, rather to desire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
then to hope it: his souldiers also were dul, silent, &amp; sad,
and such as were readier to interpret, then execute the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
commandement. So they ioyned battell, but scarse
ten ounces of bloud was lost on both sides, before the duke
of Ireland set spurres to his horse, and forsooke the field.
His souldiers seeing this, threw away their vnfortunate wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
more for indignation then for feare, ruffling their
rancks, and yeelding to the Earle the honour of the field.
Sir <hi>Thomas Molineux</hi> in flying away, was forced to take a
Riuer which was neere, and as he was comming foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
a certaine Knight whose name was Sir <hi>Thomas Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi>
pulled off his helmet, and stabbed him into the braines
with his dagger. The rest submitted themselues to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the victorours, making them lords ouer their life,
and death: but their yeelding was no sooner offered, then
it was accepted, the Earle presently commaunding that
none should be harmed, but those that did make resistance,
or beare armour: the Souldiours also being willing to
shew fauour towardes their countreymen, as ledde into
this action, partly vpon simplicitie, partly to accompany
these which came vpon feare. Then the Gentlemen were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4090:17"/>
still reteined in the Earles company, the common soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were dispoiled of their armour onely, and so returned
againe to their peaceable businesse at home. And this was
the first acte whereby reputation did rise to the side, and the
greatnes began, whereunto the Earle afterwards attained.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Ireland, at the beginning of his flight, was
desirous to haue passed the riuer which ranne by: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to a bridge, he found the same broken: from thence
he posted to another bridge, which he found guarded with
Archers. At the last, his fearefulnesse being feared away (as
nothing maketh men more desperate vpon a doubtfull dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then feare of that which is certaine) he aduentured to
take the streame; in the midst wherof, he forsooke his horse,
and swam to the other side, and so by benefit of the night e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped,
and fled into Scotland: and shortly afterpassed the
seas into Flanders, and from thence traueiled into France:
where the continuall gall of his griefe soone brought his loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
life to an end. His horse was taken with his brest-plate,
his helmet and his gauntlets, whereupon it was generally
supposed that he was drowned; and (as in great vncerteine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
it often happeneth) some affirmed that they sawe his
death, which men either glad to heare, or not curious to
search, did easily beleeue: whether this were thus contriued
of purpose, or fell so out by chance, it was a great meanes of
his escape, by staying the pursute after him, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
had bene made. His coach also was taken, and certaine
of the Kings letters found, wherein he desired the Duke to
come to London with all the power and speede hee could
make, and he would be ready to die in his defence; so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
was he in matters of gouernment, that to pleasure a
few, he regarded not the discontentment of all the rest.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Suffolke, vpon this accident, shaued his
beard, and in base and disguised attire fled to Calice, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for feare, or for shame, neuer after returned into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
he was a cruell spoiler, and a carelesse spender, in war
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4090:17"/>
contemptible, in peace in supportable, an enemie to all cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
of others and in his owne conceite obstinatly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
of a good wit, and ready speach, both which hee abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to the cunning commending of himselfe, and crafty de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prauing
of others: he was lesse loued but better heard of
the King then the Duke of Ireland: the more hurtful man
&amp; the more hateful: the Duke beeing charged with no great
fault: but onely the Kings excessiue fauour; in their course
of good and bad fortune, both of them were famous alike.
Also the Archbishop of Yorke, Iustice Trisiliane, and others
of that faction, ran euery man, like connies to their couerte:
Yea the king betooke himselfe to the Tower of London, and
there made prouision for his winter aboade; hauing all his
courses now crossed, first rashnesse in taking armes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by cowardise in maintaining them.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Darby signified this successe to his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
by letters, yet without any vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting or enlarging tearms:
his speaches also were moderate, rather exstenuating his fact
then extolling it: but by stopping his fame, it much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when men esteemed his high thoughtes by his lowely
wordes, and his conceite in great exploites, by his contempt
of this. Then the Lords met, and marched together towards
London, whether they came vpon <hi>S. Stephens</hi> day, hauing
almost forty thousand men in their armie, &amp; first they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselues in battaile array, in the fieldes neare vnto
the Tower, within the viewe of the King: afterwardes, they
tooke vp their lodging in the suburbes, the Maior and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
of the citty came forth, and gaue liberall allowance,
of victuall to the souldiers, offering vnto the Lordes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
within the Citty, but they did not accept it.</p>
            <p>Now this discord seemed to draw to a dangerous distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the common-wealth; the vanquished parte being ful
of malice, and the conquerors of presumption: the one wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
power, the other right to command and rule. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of Canterbury, and certaine others of the neutrality,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4090:18"/>
fearing the sequele, perswaded the king to come to a treaty
with the lordes: but he made shewe of very light regarde of
all these dealings; let them stay (saide hee) vntill they haue
wearied themselues with maintaining this multitude, and
then I will talke further with them. When the lordes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the drift of his deuise they beset the thames, &amp; all other
passages, and protested that they woulde not departe vntill
they had talked with him to his face. The king hauing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strength to resist, nor scope to scape, conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to that end desired the lordes to come to him into the
Tower: but they refused that place of meeting, vpon feare of
false measure, vntill the king permitted them to search as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
and come as strongly as they thought it meete. So
they came vnto the King well guarded, and after a fewe
colde kindnesses, and strange salutations, they laide before
him, his proceedings against them at Nottingham; his letters
which he sent to the duke of Ireland contrary to his worde,
for the raysing of armes against them: his agreement with
the French King, for the yeelding vp of Callice and other
strong holdes which he possessed in those parts: with diuers
other pointes of dishonourable dealing and negligent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.
What should the King then haue said or done?
all these matters were so euident and so euill, that there was
no place left either for deniall or defence. Therefore inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously,
first with silence and patience, afterwardes with
teares he confessed his errors. And certainely the stiffe sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
of the lordes relented more to these luke warme drops
then they would haue done to his cannon shot.</p>
            <p>Then it was agreed, that the next day the King shoulde
meet with them at westminster, and there treat further, both
of these, and other necessarie affaires of the realme. So the
Duke, and the rest of the lords departed except the earle of
Darby, who stayed supper with the king, and all that time
stayed him in his promised purpose: but when hee was also
gone, some of the secrete counsailers, or corrupters rather,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4090:18"/>
and abusers of the King, whistled him in the eare, that his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Westminster was neither seemely nor safe, and would
cause not onely to his person present danger and contempt,
but also both abasement and abridgement to his authority
afterwards. The Kings minde was soone changed; but the
Lords being now stirred, and feeling the Kings hand weake
to gouerne the bridle, became the more vehement, and
sent him worde, that if hee did ieofaile with them, and not
come according to appointment, they would chuse another
King, who shoulde haue his nobility in better regard. This
peremptorie message so terrified the King, that he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
went to Westminster, but suffered the Lords to doe there
euen what they woulde. So they caused him much against
his liking, to remooue out of the courte, <hi>Alexander Neuill,</hi>
Archbishop of Yorke, <hi>Iohn Foorde,</hi> Bishop of Durisme, Frier
<hi>Thomas Rushoke,</hi> Bishop of Chichester, the kings Confessor:
Likewise they remoued the Lord <hi>Souch,</hi> the Lord <hi>Haring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>

Diuers other were either put to death, or banished, and,

the Duke of Gloucester and him: whereby he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
a fauourable opinion among those of the contrarie
part, hauing caused the death of no man, but onely in the
fielde. Then was an oath exacted of the King, to stand to the
gouernment of the Lordes: and also an oath was taken of all
the Subiects within the Realme, to be true and faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King. The king in taking this oath of the Lordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed
his inward conceite by his open countenance, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4090:19"/>
pleasantly on those he fauoured, and angerly on those
whome hee hated; by which vntimely discouery, hee made
them more heedefull, and himselfe more hatefull: which
were occasions afterwarde, both to preuente the reuenge,
which he much desired, and to procure the mischiefs which
hee little feared. Lastly, a subsidie was graunted: and to the
King comming as it were to a capitulation with the lordes,
hee to haue the name of a King, and they the authority and
maiesty, the contention for that time ceased.</p>
            <p>All this was done in the xj. yeere of the kings reigne, he
being yet vnder age,<note place="margin">1389</note> and in gouernement of others. But the
yeere following, he beganne to take vpon him more liberty
and rule: and vpon extreame disdaine, that both his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and his power were by the Lords thus restrained, he did
euer after beare a hard minde against them. And first he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
them in the Councell chamber, and there deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
of what yeeres they tooke him to be: they answered,
that he was somewhat aboue one and twenty: then (sayd
he) I am of lawfull age to haue the regiment in mine owne
hand, and therefore you doe me wrong to holde me still vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
gouernement, as though the condition of a king were
harder then of a subiect. This the Lords were neither willing
to grant, nor able to denie, and therefore they either kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or spake little to the purpose. Well (sayd the king)
since I am no longer an Infant, I heere renounce your rule,
and take vpon me such free administration of the Realme,
as the Kings thereof, my predecessours heeretofore haue
lawfully vsed. Then presently he began his Phaetons flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and commaunded the Bishop of Elie being L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
to resigne his seale; which the king receiued, and put
vp, and therewith departed out of the chamber: but soone
after he returned againe, and deliuered the same to <hi>William
Wickham</hi> bishop of Winchester, constituting him L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
thereby. Many other officers he likewise deposed,
and placed new in their roome; partly to manifest his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4090:20"/>
and partly to satisfie his displeasure. Also he remooued
the Duke of Gloucester, the Earle of Warwicke, and many
others from his Priuy councell, and tooke those in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which more regarded the humour of the King, but lesse
his honour.</p>
            <p>Soone after, it was suggested to the King, that the Duke
of Gloucester was gathering of forces against him; but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
examination there was found not onely no trueth, but
no shew or colour of any such matter. The Duke would not
quietly haue disgested the raysing of these reportes: but the
King, whether vpon a generall delight, to be tickled in the
eares with such tales, or vpon particular desire to haue some
quarell against the Duke, charged him to silence.</p>
            <p>In the 13. yeare of the Raigne of King <hi>Richard,</hi> the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Genua desired his ayde,<note place="margin">1390.</note> against the Barbarians of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,
who with dayly incursions, infested and spoyled all the
Sea coasts &amp; Ilands of Italy, and Fraunce, which fronted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The King sent a choyse companie of Souldiers, yn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct of <hi>Henrie</hi> Earle of Derby; who behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in this charge with great integritie &amp; courage, inciting
his men, the good by prayse, the bad by example rather then
reproofe, as more ready to commend the vertues of the one,
then to vpbraide the vices of the other. And first hee passed
into Fraunce, and there ioyned himselfe to certaine French
forces, appointed likewise for this seruice: then with might
and minds vnited, they sayled together into Afrike. At their
arriuall, the Barbarians were ready in armes, to keepe them
from landing: but the Earle commaunded his Archers to
breake through and make passage, dispising the enemie,
whome he knew to be weake, and vnskilfull in seruice, and
not to haue that aduantage in place, which hee had in men:
the Frenchmen also sharply set in &amp; seconded the English:
and so whilest both companies contended, the one to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
a helpe, &amp; the other to seeme to neede no help, the
enemies were forced to flie, and leaue the shoare vnto the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4090:20"/>
Christians. In this conflict, three Dukes of the Barbarians
and aboue three hundred Souldiers were slaine, and in the
flight, fower Dukes were taken, and a great, yet vncertaine
number of common people. Then the Christians marched
directly towards Tunis, the head Cittie of that Countrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this
they besieged, &amp; in short time tooke, chiefely by the prowes
of the English souldiers, who first scaled the Wals, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thereon the Earles banner. When they were entred the
Towne, the Englishmen bent their endeuour, to the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their enemies, and beating downe of such as made
resistance, but the Frenchmen straight waies turned to their
lasciuious pleasures: so that there was presented a spectacle,
both pitiful and shamelesse: in one place butchering of men,
in another ryoting with women: here streames of bloud, &amp;
heapes of slaughtered bodies, hard by dissolute and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wantonnesses in some, all the miseries of a cruell warre,
and the loosenesse of a secure peace. Here were slaine and
taken aboue fower thousand Barbarians: the Kings brother
also was slaine: but the King himselfe fled into the Castle,
which was strongly scited, and well fortified and furnished
with men. The Christians laide siege to this Castle the space
of fiue weekes, during which time, they lost many of their
men, yet not by sword, but by sickenesse: the Barbarians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
were distressed with want of victuall, hauing but litle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,
and many vnprofitable mouthes to consume it: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they sent vnto the Christians, to desire peace, offering
them a great summe of money, to depart out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
this the Christians accepted, vpon condition, that they
might also freely carry with them, all their pray and priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and that the Barbarians should from thenceforth sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
from making spoyle, vpon any of the coastes of Italy,
or Fraunce. Thus had this voyage a prosperous and speedie
end: the onely seruice (as I suppose) which the English and
Frenchmen performed together, without iotte of iarre. And
yet the Earle abused not the fortune of this successe, to vaine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4090:21"/>
vaunting, or brauing in words, but moderately im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

encreased, without bit of enuie.</p>
            <p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth yeres of the reigne of King
<hi>Richard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1392</note> certaine causes of discontentment did grow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the King and the Londoners,<note place="margin">1393</note> which set the fauour
of the one, and the faith of the other, at great separation and
distance: One was, for that the King would haue borrowed
of them a thousand poundes: which they feeling much; and
fearing more the Kings daily exactions, did not onely deny,
but euill intreated a certaine Lumbard, who offered to lay
out the money.</p>
            <p>Another griefe was thus occasioned: One of the Bishop
of Salisburies seruants, named <hi>Romane,</hi> meeting in Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street
with a Bakers man, bearing horse-bread, tooke a loafe
out of his basket: and by rude demaund of the one, and
rough denial of the other, chollar so kindled betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
<hi>Romane</hi> brake the Bakers head. Heereupon the neighbors
came forth, and would haue arrested this Bishops lusty yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but he escaped, and fled to the Bishops house. The
Constable followed peaceably, and demaunded a quiet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery
of the offendour: but the Bishops men shut the gates
against him, that no man could come neere. Then much
people flocked together, threatening to breake open the
gates, and fire the house, vnlesse <hi>Romane</hi> were brought forth
vnto them: What (sayd they) are the Bishops men priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged?
or is his house a sanctuary? or will he protect those
whom he ought to punish? if we may be shuffled off in this
sort, not onely our streets, but our shoppes and our houses
shall neuer be free from violence and wrong. This we will
not endure: we can not: it standeth not vs in hand. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they approched the gates, and began to vse violence:
but the Maior and Shiriffes of the Citty, vpon aduerti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement
of this tumult, came amongst them, crying out, that it was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4090:21"/>
not courage, but out-rage which they shewed: wherby
they would procure, both daunger to themselues and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against the whole Citty; that although wrong had
beene receiued, yet they were not the men, nor this the
meanes to redresse the same: So partly by their perswasions,
partly by their presence and authoritie, they repressed the
riote, and sent euery man away, with streight charge to
keep the peace. Here was yet no great harme done, and the
quarrell might haue bene quieted without more adoe, had
not the Bishop stirred therein, and kindled the coales of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse
a fresh. For the Londoners at that time, were not
onely suspected secretly, but openly noted to bee fauourers
and followers of wickliffes opinions: for which cause, they
were much maliced of the Bishoppes; and many of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
interpreted, to proceed from another minde, and tend
to a worse ende, then was outwardly borne in countenance
and shew: and some matters of chaunce, were taken as done
of purpose. Therefore the Bishop of Salisburie called <hi>Iohn
Waltham,</hi> who was also treasurour of England, made a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
complaint of this attempt, to <hi>Thomas Arundle</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Yorke, and Lord Chauncellour; affirming, that if v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
euery light pretence, the citezens might be suffered in
this sorte to insult vpon the bishoppes, without punishment,
without reproofe and blame, they woulde bring into haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
not onely the dignity and state: but the libertie also of
the whole Church: did they not lately take vppon them the
punishment of adulteries, and other crimes appertaining to

               </gap>iasticall iurisdiction? maliciously alleaging, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and their officers, either beeing infamous for those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
themselues, did wincke at the same in others: or else by
couetous comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

breake open the doores vpon the Archbishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and interrupte his proceedings against <hi>Iohn Astone,</hi> an

and if this boldnesse be not beaten downe, our authority will
fall into open contempt and scorne, and bee made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
foote-ball, for euery base citizen to spurne at. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they went together to the King, and so incensed his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against the Londoners, (beeing prepared thereto
by former prouocations) that hee was in the minde to make
spoyle of the citty, and vtterly to destroy it. But beeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to some more moderation in reuenge, first hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and Shiriffes, and many of the chiefe citizens
to be apprehended, and committed to diuers seuerall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
then hee c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zed all the liberties of the citty into his
handes, and ordained, that no Mayor shoulde any more bee
elected, but that the King shoulde at his pleasure appointe
a Warden and gouernon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ouer the citty. This office was
first committed to Sir <hi>Edward Darlington,</hi> who for his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse
towardes the citizens, was shortly after remouoed,
and Sir <hi>Baldwine Radington</hi> placed in his roome. Also the
King was induced, or rather seduced by the Archbishop of
Yorke Lord Chauncellour, to remooue the Tearmes and
Courtes: to witte, the Chauncery, the Exchequer, the kings
bench, the hamper, and the common pleas, from London,
to bee kept at Yorke, where the same continued from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sommer,
in the yeare 1393. vntill Christmasse next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to the great hinderance and decay of the citty of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
At the last, the King vpon earnest intreaty of the Duke
of Lancaster, and the Duke of Gloucester, called the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners
before him at Windsore: where (hauing first terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them with the presence and shewe of a greate number
of armed men) hee caused all the priuiledges of the citty,
both olde and newe, to be brought forth, whereof he resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some, and restrained the rest: yet the Londoners were
not fully receiued to fauour; neither recouered they at that
time, either the person or dignity of their Mayor. Shortly
after, the King went to London: at whose comming, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4090:22"/>
changed all their griefe into gladnesse (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
forte is without measure in both) entertayning him
with such ioyfull triumphes and rich presentes, as if it had
beene the day of his coronation. They supposed with these
great curtesies and costs to haue satissied his displeasure; but
they sound themselues farre deceiued: for they were not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to their liberties againe, vntill they had made
fine, to pay vnto the King ten thousand poundes. Thus did
the Londoners manifest in themselues, a strange diuersity
of disposition, both licenciously to committe offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee, and
paciently to endure punnishment: hauing rashnesse and
rage so tempered with obedience, that they were easily
punnished, who coulde not possibly bee ruled. Yet fot
this cause, so soone as first occasion did serue against the
King, they shewed themselues, either his earnest enimies, or
faint friends.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> in the nineteene yeare of his reigne, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the seas to Calice: the French king also came downe
to Arde: betweene which two Townes, a place was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and tentes erected for both the kings to meete.
After large expenses on both fides, and great honour done
by the one king to the other: a surcease of armes was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
betweene them for thirtie yeares: and king <hi>Richard</hi>
tooke to wife Lady <hi>Isabell,</hi> the French Kings daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not aboue seuen or eight yeeres olde. The Duke of
Gloucester was so offended; both with this friendship, and
assinitie, that he lost all manner of patience: exclaiming,
that it was more meete to be in armes, then in amitie with
the French-men, who beeing inferiour to the English in
courage, did alwayes ouer-reach them in craft, and being
too weake for warre, did many times preuaile by peace:
that now they had got into their handes many Townes and
Holdes, appertaining to the crowne of England, they were
willing to conclude a peace, to exclude the King thereby
from his possessions: but whensoeuer occasion shoulde
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4090:23"/>
change for their aduantage, they would be then as ready to
start from the friendshippe, as at that present they were to
strike it: that the French Kings daughter, being but a child,
was very vnmeet for the marriage of King <hi>Richard,</hi> as well
for disparitie of age, as for that the King had no issue by
his first wife, and was not like to haue any by this, except
(perhappes) in his olde and withered yeeres. When the
Duke saw, that with these motiues he did nothing preuaile,
he suborned the Londoners, to make petition to the King,
that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g there was peace with France, he would release
them of the Subsidie which they had graunted to him in
regard of those war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es. This suite was instantly followed,
and much perplexed the King, vntill the Duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
declare to the people, that the King had beene at the
charge and dispense of three hundred thousand poundes
in his voyage into France, for the procuring of this peace:
whereupon they were pacified, and desisted from their
demaund.</p>
            <p>The yeere following, <hi>Guido</hi> Earle of <hi>S. Pauls,</hi> was sent
into England by <hi>Charles</hi> King of Fraunce,<note place="margin">1397</note> to visit and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in his name, King <hi>Richard,</hi> and Queene <hi>Isabell</hi> his
wife, the French Kings daughter. To this Earle, the King did
relate, with what feruencie the Duke of Gloucester con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to make disturbance of the peace betweene Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and France: how, because his minde was not therein
followed, hee mooued the people to seditious attempts,
bending himselfe wholly to maintaine discord and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t,
rather in his owne countrey, then not at all. He further
reported, what stiffe strifes in formert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es, the Duke had
stirred: which, howsoeuer they were done, yet as they
were declared, they sounded very odious and hard. When
the Earle heard this, he presently answered, that the Duke
was too daungerous a subiect to be permitted to liue: that
greatnesse was neuer safe, if it grow excess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue and bolde:
that the King must not affect the vaine commendation of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4090:23"/>
clemency, with his owne perill: and that it touched him,
both in honour to reuenge the disgraces which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and in policy to preuent the daungers which he had
cause to feare. These words of sharpened the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
that from thencefoorth he busied his braines in no
one thing more, then how to bring the Duke to his end.
Now he began to pry more narrowly into his demeanour:
to watch his words: to obserue actions: adn alwayes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them to the woorst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> framing himselfe to many vaine
and weedlesse feare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Often times he would complaine of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster, and the Duke of Yorke, how
fierce and violent he was in his speeches, and crosse to him
in all matters. The Dukes would make answere, that the
Duke of Gloucester their brother, was in deed, more hoat
and vehement then they did commend: yet his fiercenesse
was ioyned with faithfulnesse, and his crosnesse proceeded
from a care, least the Common-wealth should decrease ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in honour or in possessions: and therefore the King had
neither need to feare, nor cause to disslike.</p>
            <p>About that time, the Dukes of Lancaster and of Yorke
withdrewe themselues from the court, to their priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
the duke of Gloucester also went to ly at Plashey, neere
Chelmessorde in Essex: vpon aduantage of which seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the King stoode distracted in minde, betweene feare to
differ, and shame to auow the destruction of the Duke, least
he might happily bee disapointed by the one, or dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the other. Hereupon he entred into counsaile with
<hi>Iohn Holland,</hi> Earle of Huntington, his halfe brother: and
<hi>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> Earle of Notingham, howe the Duke of
Gloucester might be suppressed or oppressed rather, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clty
which was but wauering in the King, yea wanting by
nature, was soone confirmed by euill aduise: and being once
inclined to bloud, he did not faile, either of example of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> together into Essex,
as though it were to disporte themselues in hunting: when
they were in the middest of the Forrest, the Earle made stay,
and the King passed forth with a smal and vnsuspicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to the Duke, lying at Plashey: there he stayed dinner:
and then pretending occasion of present returne, he desired
the Duke to accompany him to London, the faire entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a Prince, is a most forceable commaunde: therefore
the Duke supposing that onely to bee intended in deede,
which was pretended in shewe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to horse-backe with
the King, taking such small attendance, as vpon the sudden

him to London. So they rode together, vsing much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
talke by the way, vntill they came neere the place of
await: then the King put his horse forwarde, and the Duke
comming behinde, was suddenly intercepted and stayed,
crying aloud, and calling to the King for his helpe: the King
continued his iourney, as though he had not heard, and the
Duke was violently carried to the Thames, and there ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in a vessell layed for the purpose, and from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
ouer to Calice.</p>
            <p>When the King came to London, he caused the Earle of
Warwicke also to be arrested and sent to prison, the same
day that hee had inuited him to dinner, and shewed good
countenance, and promised to be gracious Lord vnto him.
Vpon the like dissembled shewe, the Earle of Arundell, and
his sonne, and certaine others were arrested also, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to prison in the Ile of Wight.</p>
            <p>The common people, vpon the apprehending of these
three noble men, whome they chiefely, and almost onely
fauoured, were in a great confusion and tumult; and there
wanted but a head to drawe them to sedition: euery man
sorrowed, murmured, and threatned, and daring no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
stood waiting for one to leade them the way: all being
readie to followe that, which any one was loath to beginne.

The Duke of Lancaster and of Yorke gathered a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and came therewith to London, where they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
receiued by the citizens, although the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the contrarie: but this seemed to be done, rather
for garde to themselues, then regarde to any others.</p>
            <p>The king all this time, kept at a village called Helhame,
within foure miles of London, hauing aboute him a great
power of armed men, which he had gathered out of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire
and Wales: and to paci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

caused to be proclaimed, that the Lordes were not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
vpon olde displeasures, but for offences lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
for which they should be appealed by order of law,
and receiue open triall, in the Parliament next following:
the like message was sent to the Duke of Lancaster, and the
Duke of Yorke, lying at London: to whome the King made
faith, for the safetie of their persons, and indemnitie of their
goods, and that nothing should be attempted without their
priuitie and aduise: all this was as rashly belieued, as it was
craftely giuen out: whereupon the Dukes dissembled their
feares, and dissolued their forces, and remained in expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
what would ensue.</p>
            <p>A little before the feast of Saint Michael, the Parliament
began at London, wherein Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie,</hi> Sir <hi>William Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi>
and Sir <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Kings purpose. These were then in all the credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
with the King, and his chiefest Schoole-masters both
of crueltie and deceite: they were proude, arrogant, and
ambitious, and vppon confidence of the Kings fauour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemies to men of auncient Nobilitie; to the ende<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that being lately start vp, they might become more famous
by maintaining contention with great persons. And first,
by their importunate trauaile, all the Charters of pardon,
graunted by the King, were in this Perliament annulled
and reuoked. Then the prelates did constitute Sir <hi>Henrie
Percie</hi> their procurator, and departed the house, because
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4090:25"/>
they might not be present in iudgement of bloud. Lastly,
the Earle of Arundell, and the Earle of Warwicke were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned;
and for the same offences, for which they had bene
pardoned (namely for encroaching to themselues royall
power in iudging to death <hi>Simon Burlye, Iohn Berneis</hi> and
others, without the Kings consent) were condemned to be
hanged, drawne, and quarter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d: but the King so modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the seueritie of this sentence, that the Earle of Arundell
was onely he headed, and the Earle of Warwicke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to perpetuall imprisonment in the Ile of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of Gloucester, was so greatly fauoured, that
it was thought a point both of policie and peace, notto bring
him to his open answere, but to put him to death secreately:
so he was strangled vnder a fether bedde at Calice by the
Earle of Notingham, being then Earle Marshall: which
death, howsoeuer he deserued; yet dying as he did, not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
not heard, he died as guiltlesse.</p>
            <p>In this same Parliament, <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbishop
of Caunterburie was also accused, for executing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mision
against <hi>Michaell Delapoole,</hi> Earle of Suffolke: for
which cause, his temporalties were seazed; his lands and
goods forfeited, as well in vse, as in possession: and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was adiudged to exile, &amp; charged to depart the realme,
within sixe weekes then next ensuing. So hee went into
Fraunce, where afterwardes, he became a principall meane
of the reuolt which followed. Also the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was
exiled into the Ile of Gernsey: and Sir <hi>Reinolde Cobham</hi> was
condemned to death, not for entring into any attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, but because he was appointed by the Lords
to be one of his gouernours, and of his counsaile, in the 11.
yeare of his raigne:</p>
            <p>Now the King falsely supposing, that he was free from
all daungers, and that the humour against him, was cleane
purged and spent, conceiued more secreate contentment,
then he would openly bewraye; as more able to dissemble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4090:25"/>
his ioy, then conceale his feare: being so blinded and bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
with continuall custome of flatteries, that hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not, that the state of a Prince is neuer stablished by
cruelty and crafce. On the other side, the common people
were much dismayed, hauing nowe lost those whome they
accompted their onely helpes, and their onely hopes, both
for their priuate affaires, and for supporting the state: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these mishapes hapned vnto them, for maintaining a
cause of common dislike, the peoples stomacke was stirred
thereby to much hate and hearte-burning against the King.
And to make their deathes the more odious, the Earle of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell
was reputed a martyr, and pilgrimages were dayly
made to the place of his buriall: the rumour also was current,
but without either authour or grounde, that this his head was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously
fastened againe to his body: this whilest all men
affirmed, and no man knewe, the King caused the corpes
to bee taken vp, and viewed, ten daies after it was interred:
and finding the cause to be fabulous, hee caused the ground
to be paued where the Earle was layde, and all mention of
his buriall to be taken away, forbidding publickly and such
speaches of him afterwardes to bee vsed: but this restrainte
raysed the more: and they, who if it had beene lawefull,
woulde haue saide nothing, beeing once forbidden coulde
not forbeare to talke. It was also constantly reported, that
the King was much disquieted in his dreames with the
Earle, who did often seeme to appeare vnto him, in so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and truculent manner, that breaking his fearefull, sleepe
he would curse the time that euer he knew him.</p>
            <p>In the one and twenty yeare of the raigne of K. <hi>Richard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1398</note>
               <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Darby, was created Duke of Herforde: at

of Southrey, who was before Earle of Kent: Duke of Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who was before Earle of Huntington: and Duke of

(whose chiefest rulers had no higher title) was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
too great for a subiect to beare: the fourme of the
common-wealth, beeing framed by the victors, farre from
equallity of all, and yet the King excepted without eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of any. At the length King <hi>Edward</hi> the third created his
eldest Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of Cornewale, and made this
honour hereditary, conferring it vnto many: since which
time, diuerse princes of this lande, haue bene either put, or
kept, or hazarded from their estate, by men of that quallity
and degree. The King likewise created the Countesse of
Norfolke, Duchesse of Norfolke: the Earle of Sommerset,
Marquesse of Sommerset: the Lorde Spencer Earle of
Gloucester, the Lorde Neuill, Earle of Westmerland: the
Lorde Scroupe, Earle of Wiltshire: and the Lord Thomas
Darcy his steward, Earle of Worcester. Among these; hee
made diuision of a great parte of the landes of the Duke of
Gloucester, and of the Earles of Arundell and warwicke:
supposing by this double liberality, of honour and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
to haue purchased to himselfe most firme friendships,
but bought friendes for the most parte, are seldome, either
satisfied, or sure: and like certaine Rauens in Arabia, so long

doe make a horrible crie.</p>
            <p>Now the Duke of Hereford, raysed his desires, together
with his dignities, and either vpon disdaine, at the vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

both abused, and abased by them: or else (perhaps) vppon
desire, to manifest his owne sufficiencie in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowlement
and direction: being in familiar discourse with
<hi>Thomas Mowbraye</hi> Duke of Norfolke, he brake into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
how the King regarded not the noble princes of his
bloud, and Peeres of the Realme, and by extreamities vsed
to some, discouraged the rest from entermedling in any
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4090:26"/>
publique affaires: how in steade of these, hee was wholy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by certaine new-found and new-fangled fauorites,
vulgare in birth, corrupt in qualities, hauing no sufficiencie
either of conncell for peace, or of courage for warre; who
being of all men the most vnhonest, and the most vnable,
with hatefulnesse of the one, and contempt of the other,
were generally dispised in all the Realme: that hereby: Frst
the honour of the Kings person was much blemished, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
and vngracious adherentes, are alway the way to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and contempt: Secondly, the safetie of his state might
bee endaungered; for extraordinarie fauour to men appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of weake or bad desert, doeth breede insolencie in
them, and discontentment in others, too daungerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in a common-wealth: Thirdly, the dignitie of the
Realme was much empaired: whose fortune and valour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guided by the ill chaunce of such vnluckie leaders: stood
neuer in the like termes of doubt and distresse; so that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of peace, were tumultuous and vncertaine, and archiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of warre, were neuer brought to honourable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion:
that <hi>Alexander Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> would haue smoaked such
sellers of smoake; that Xerxes would haue pulled their skin
ouer their eares; and high time it was, that the King should
looke vnto them: for the nobilitie grew out of hart, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
out of hope, and all the people fell to a discontented
murmuring. And this he said, (as he said) not for any grudge,
but for griefe and goodwill: and therefore desired the Duke
who was one of the priuie councell, and well heard with
the King, to discouer vnto him these deformities and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that by repayring the one, hee might happily repell
the other.</p>
            <p>These wordes procured to the Duke of Hereforde, both
great offence, and great glorye: at the deliuerie whereof,
the Duke of Northfolke made shewe of good liking, and
promise of sincere dealing. And in deede, if they had bin
as faithfully reported by him, and by the King as friendlie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4090:27"/>
taken, as they were faithfully and friendlie meant, many
mischiefes might haue bene auoyded: but both of these did
faile: for the Duke of Norffolke, although in former times
he had taken parte with the Lordes, yet afterwardes, being
desirous be accompted, rather among the great men, then
the good, he made sale of his honour, to maintaine his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and continue himselfe in grace with the King; to which
he was altogether enthralled; insomuch, that the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Duke of Gloucester, and the execution of the
Earle of Arundell, was to his charge especially committed,
and supposing vpon this occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aon to make a free-hold of his
princes fauour, he grieuously aggrauated these speeches in
in reporting them, and yet cunningly to: with many lyes
intermixing some truethes, or making the trueth much
more then it was. Againe, the King not enduring the search
of his soares, did bend his minde, rather to punish the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
then examine the trueth of these reproofes: his eares
being so distemspered with continuance of flatterie, that he
accompted all sharpe that was sounde, and liked onely that,
which was presently pleasant, and afterwards hurtfull. Thus
we may dayly obserue, that no strange accident doth at any
time happen, but it is by some meanes foreshewed, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould:
but because these warnings are often-times eyther
not marked, or misconstrued, or els contemned, the euents
are accompted ineuitable, and the admonitions vaine.</p>
            <p>The King being in this sort touched by the one Duke,
and tickled by the other, was not resolued vpon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
what to doe: therefore he assembled his councell, and
called the two Dukes before him, and demaunded of the
Duke of Norfolke, if hee would openly auouch that which
he had suggested in secreate. The Duke seeing it was now
no time for him, either to shrinke or shuftle in his tale, with
a bolde and confident courage, repeated all that before hee
had reported. But the Duke of Hereforde could not bee
borne downe by countenance, where his cause was good:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4090:27"/>
and therefore after a short silence, whereby hee seemed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
amazed at the strangenesse of this matter, then abashed
at the guilt, he made low obeisance to the King, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both thanked and commended him, that hee had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hastie creadite, to matters of such tender touch, as his
griefe might haue borne out the blame of rashnesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
desiring him to continue yet a while, the respite of
his displeasure, and to reserue his iudgment free for indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
audience. Then he declared in order, what speech had
passed from him, vpon what occasion, and to what end: all
the rest he stoutely denyed, affirming that it was falsely
surmised by his aduersary, eyther vpon malice to picke a
quarrell, or vpon sycophancie to picke a thanke, and that
thereupon he was vntrue, vniuste, a forger of slaunderous
and seditious lies, whereby he treacherously indeuoured to
seduce the King to destroy the Nobility, and to raise distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
within the realme: and this he offered to proue vpon
him (if the King would permit) by the stroake of a speare,
and by dint of sword. The Duke of Norfolks stomacke not
vsed to beare scorne, could not disgest these tearmes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace:
whereupon hee stifly stood to his first imputation:
and for maintenance thereof, he accepted, and also desited
the combat. The King would some other wayes haue quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this contention, but the Dukes would agree to no other
kinde of agreement: and thereupon threw downe their
gloues one against the other, for gages. The King seeing
their obstinacy, graunted them the battell, and assigned the
place at the City of Couentry, in the moneth of August then
next insuing: where in the meane time, he caused a sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Theater, and lists royall to be prepared.</p>
            <p>At the day of combat, the two Dukes came, well banded
with Noblemen and Gentlemen of their linage. The Duke
of Aumerle, for that day hie constable, and the Duke of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
for the same time and action, high Marshall of England,
entred into the lists, with a great troope of men apparelled in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4090:28"/>
silke sendale, embroidred with siluer, euery man hauing a
tipped staffe to keepe the field in order. About the time of
prime, the Duke of Hereford came to the barriers of the lists,
mounted vpon a white courser, barbed with blew &amp; greene
veluet, embroidred gorgiously with Swans and Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ops of
Gold-smiths worke, anned at all points, &amp; his sword drawen
in his hand. The Constable and Marshall came to the barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and demaunded of him, who hee was. He answered: I
am <hi>Henry</hi> duke of Hereford, and am come to do my deuoire
against <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of Norfolke, as a traitour to
God, the King, the Realme, and me. Then he sware vpon
the Euangelists, that his quarrell was right, &amp; vpon that point
desired to enter the lists, then he put vp his sword, pulled
downe his beauier, made a crosse on his forehead, and with
speare in hand, entred into the lists, and there lighted from
his horse, &amp; sate downe in a charge of greene veluet, which
was set in a trauerse of greene &amp; blew veluet at the one end
of the listes: and so expected the comming of his enemic.
Soone after, King <hi>Richard</hi> entred the field with great pomp,
both in brauery and traine: he had in his company, the Earle
of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who came purposely out of Fraunce to see this
combat tried: he was attended with all the noble Peeres of
the Realme, and guarded with tenne thousand men in
armes, for feare of any sudden or intended tumult.</p>
            <p>When hee was placed on his stage, which was verie curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and richly set forth, a King at armes made proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the name of the King, and of the high Constable, and
of the Marshall, that no man except such as were appointed
to order and Marshall the fielde, shoulde touch any parte of
the listes, vpon paine of death. This proclamation beeing

Duke of Hereford, appellant, who is entred into the

Duke of Norfolke defendant, vpon paine to be accompted
false and recreant. The Duke of Norfolke was houering on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4090:28"/>
horsebacke at the entry of the listes, his horse being barbed
with crimson veluet, embroadered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itchly with lions of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and mulberie trees, and when he had made his oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Constable and Marshall, that his quarrell was iust
and true, he entred the fielde boldly, crying aloud God aide
him that hath the right, then hee lighted from his horse, and
satte downe in a chaire of Crimson veluet, curtained aboute
with red and white damaske, and placed at the other ende
of the listes. The Lord Marshall viewed both their speares,
to see that they were of equall length: the one speare he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
himselfe to the Duke of Hereford, and sent the other to
the Duke of Norfolke by a Knight, This done, a Herrald
proclaimed, that the trauerses and chaires of the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
should be remoued, commaunding them in the Kings
name, to mount on horsebacke, and adresse themselues to
the encounter, the Dukes were quickly horsed, and closed
their beauiers, and cast their speares into the restes. Then the
trumpetes sounded, and the Duke of Hereforde set forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his enimy, about fixe or seauen paces: but before the
Duke of Norfolke began to put forewarde, the King cast
downe his warder, and the Herralds cried, ho: then the King
caused the Dukes speares to be taken from them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them to forsake their horses, and returne againe to
their chaires: where they remained; aboue two long houres,
whilst the King deliberated with his counsaile what was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to be done. At last, the Herralds cryed silence: and Sir
<hi>Iohn Borcy</hi> a secretary of state with a loude voice, read the
sentence and determination of the King and his counsaile
out of a long roule: wherein was contained, that <hi>Henry</hi> of
Lancaster Duke of Hereford, appellant, and <hi>Thomas Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
Duke of Norfolke, defendant, had honourably appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that day within the lists royall, and declared themselues
valiant and hardy champions; being not onely ready, but
forward and desirous to darrein the battel: but because this
was a matter of great consequence &amp; import, the King with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4090:29"/>
the aduise of his Councell, thought it meet to take the same
into his owne hands: and thereupon had decreed, that <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
Duke of Hereford, because he had displeased the King,
and for diuers other considerations, should within 15. dayes
next following, depart out of the Realme, and not to returne
during the terme often yeeres, without the Kings especiall
licence, vpon paine of death,</p>
            <p>When this iudgement was heard, a confused noyse was
raysed among the people, some lamenting eyther the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serte,
or the iniurie of the Duke of Hereforde, whom they
exceedingly fauoured: others laughing at the conceite of
the King: first in causing, and afterwardes in frustrating so
great an expectation: wherein he seemed to doe not much
vnlike <hi>Caligula;</hi> who lying in Fraunce with a great armie
nere the sea shoare, gaue the signe of battell, set his men in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,
marched foorth as if it had bene to some great piece of
seruice, &amp; suddenly commanded them all together cockles.</p>
            <p>Then the Herralds cryed againe, ô yes: and the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
did reade on, how the King had likewise otdayned,
that <hi>Thomas Moubraie</hi> Duke of Northfolke, because he had
sowen sedition, by words whereof he could make no proofe,
should auoide the realme of England, and neuer returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
vpon paine of death: and that the King would take
the profites and reuenues of his landes, vntill he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
such summes of money as the Duke had taken vp, for
wages of the garison of Calice, which was still vnpaide: and
that the King prohibited, vpon paine of his grieuous displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that any man should make suite or entreatie to him, on
the behalfe of eyther of these two Dukes.</p>
            <p>These sentences being in this sort pronounced, the King
called the two exiles before him, and tooke of them an oth,
that they should not conuerse together in foraine regions,
nor one willingly come in place where the other was: fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(as it was like) least their common discontentment
should draw them, first to reconcilement, and afterward to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4090:29"/>

But againe to our purpose.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Norfolke, hauing now got a fall, where he
thought to take his rest, repented his enterprise, and vtterly
condemned his light conceite of the Kings lightnesse, and so
with extreame griefe and anguish of minde, he departed out
of the Realme into Almaine, and from thence trauelled to
Venice; where through violence of thought and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in short time he ended his dayes. This sentence of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
was giuen against him the same day of the yeere
wherein the Duke of Gloucester by his wicked meanes was
strangled to death at Calice.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Hereford tooke his leaue of the King at El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,

midst of his misery, retained still his reputation and honour;
shewing no signe of sorow or submines in his countenance,
nor letting fall any intemperate and vnseemely word. The
people as he departed, by heap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> flocked about him, some to
see, and some to salute him: lamenting his departure in such
sort, as though their onely light and delight did then forsake
them: not sparing to exclaime, that it was against the law of
armes, against the custome of the Realme, and against all
right whatsoeuer, that he should exiled, who had done his
honourable endeuour for the maintenance of his appeale.
This affection was the more exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e, for that the duke was
driuen into exile by occasion of his liberall speeches against
the most hateful persons in all Realme: &amp; being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noble man then aliue, of the popular faction, the loue was
wholly accumulated vpon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was before deuided
among the rest. And thus the Duke leauing England, tooke
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4090:30"/>
shipping, and passed the Seat to Galice, &amp; from thence went
into Fraunce: where hee was honourably entertained by
<hi>Charles</hi> the French King, and found such fauour, that hee
should haue taken to wife, the onely daughter of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke

fearing the sequel, if the fauor which was borne to the Duke
of Hereford within the Realme, should be strengthned with
so great affinitie in Fraunce, cast such stops in the way, that
the marriage did not proceede.</p>
            <p>This yeare the Lawrell trees withered, almost through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Realme, and afterwardes against all expectation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
life &amp; flourished againe. The same yeare, in Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse
holy-daies, a deepe ryuer which rumneth betweene
Snedlistorie and Hareswood, neere to Bedford, suddainely
stayed the streame: so that for three miles in length, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
was left drie, and no course of water did hinder passage
on foot. This was afterwards interpreted too presage, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt
of the people, &amp; the deuision which happened the yeare
following: to these wee may adde certaine other prodegies,
either forged in that fabulous age, or happening commonly
and of course, are then onely noted, when any notable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
doth ensue. When <hi>K. Richard</hi> brought his first wife
out of Beame, she had no sooner set foote within this land,
but such a tempest did forthwith arise as had not bene seene
many yeares before: whereby diuers ships within the hauen
were quashed to peeces, but especially, and first of all, the
ship wherin the Queene was casried, this was the rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
because such stiffe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ormes were likewise stirring:
when the King brought his second wife out of France: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
many ships perished, and a great part of the Kings fardage
was lost. At New castle vpon Tine, as two shipwrites were
squaring a piece of Timber, whersoeuer they hewed, bloud
issued forth in great aboundance. At one of the Kings p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
flies swarmed so thicke, that they obscured the ayre:
these fought together most fiercely, so that sackfuls lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eau
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4090:31"/>
vpon the ground; and this continued so long, that scarce the
third part of them (as it was thought) remained aliue, many
like accidents are recorded of that time; but I wil maintaine
neither the truth of them, nor what they did portend: being
a matter wherein most men are rather superstitious, then not
credulous, and doe oftentimes repute common occurrences
to be ominous, when any strange euent doth ensue. Yet as I
am loath to auouch any vaine and trifling matter, so dare I
not detract all truth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things anciently reported; although
done in an age wherein was some delight in lying; many do
suppose, that those things which are fatally allotted, though
they neuer be auoided, yet sometimes are foreshewen: not
so much that we may preuent them, as that wee shuold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
ourselues against them.</p>
            <p>In the two and twenty yeare of the raigne of K. <hi>Richard,
Iothn</hi> of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster died, and was buried, on
the north-side of the high alter, of the Cathedrall Church of
S. Paule in London, hee was a man aduised and warie in his
passages of life, liking better safe courses with reason, then
happy by chaunce: of his owne glory, he was neither negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
nor ambitiously careful: towards the King hee caried
himselfe in tearms honourable inough for a moderat prince,
and yet not so plausible as a vaine man would desire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
there neuer happened to him any extraordinary matter,
either in preiudice, or preferment. After his death, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of Lancaster did in right deuolue to the Duke of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde,
his eldest son: but the King (as the nature of man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable,
to hate those whome hee hath harmed) seazed all
the landes and goodes which appertained to the Duke of
Lancaster, into his owne handes; and determined to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the banishment of Duke <hi>Henry</hi> his sonne: reuoking the
letters patte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which were graunted to him at his departure:
whereby his generall atturneis were enabled to prosecute
his causes and sue liuerie of any inheritance; which during
his exile, might fall vnto him, his homage being respited for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4090:31"/>
a reasonable fine. The king supposed his estate more safe, by
the weaknesse and want of the Duke, whome he had nowe
in some iealousie and doubte? but these violent dealinges
were meanes rather to prouoake his mischiefes, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
them; for by iniurious suppressing of the Dukes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he greatly augmented the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of Yorke, the Kings onely vncle which
remained aliue, had hetherto moued his patience, to endure
many things against his liking: but nowe either in disdaine
of this indignity, or in distrust both of his owne safety, and of
the common tranquillity of the realme, hee retired himselfe
with the Duke of Aumerle his son, to his house at Langley:
supposing priuatnes to bee the best defence, both from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and blame, where neither the King had iudgement to
discerne, nor any about him had, either hearte or honesty to
admonish what was done amisse; where an honourable
fame was held suspected, and a good life more in hazard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a bad: protesting that none of these practises, were either
deuised by his counsaile, or done by his consent.</p>
            <p>At this time, the whole frame of the state was much sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and matters of great weight and moment, did hang by
a very slender thred. The King was plunged in pleasure and
sloath: after whose example, others also (as men doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conforme their mindes according to the princes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position)
gaue ouer themselues to dilicacie and ease: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
cowardise crepte in, and shipwracke was made, both of
manhood and glorie. The chiefest affaires of state, had bene
ordered for a long time, according to priuate respects, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the common-wealth lost both the fatte, and the fauour,
and seemed not at seasons and by degrees, but with a maine
course, and at once to ruinate and fall. The north parts were
many times canuased, and by small, yet often losses, almost
consumed by the Scots: who had there taken many townes
and castles, and defaced all the countrey with slaughter and
spoile. Likewise the south partes were often-times wasted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4090:32"/>
by the Frenchmen: and in Fraunce many strong holds were
lost. It was also constantly affirmed, that the King made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
to deliuer vnto the King of Fraunce, the possossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Callice, and of other townes which hee helde in those
parts; but the performance there of was resisted by the lords
whether this were true or surmised probably, as agreeable
to the Kings loose gouernment, I cannot certainely affirme.
As for Ireland, which in the time of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the third was
kept in order and awe, by acquainting the people with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and ciuility, and drawing them to delight in the plenty
and pleasures of well reclaymed countries; whereby it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the kings coffers, thirty thousand pounds euery yeare:
it was then suffered to runne into waste, and the people by
rudenesse became intractible: so that the houlding thereof
charged the King, with the yearely dispence of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
markes. Many succours had bene sent into these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
countries; but scatteringly, and dropping, and neuer so
many at once, as to furnish the warres fully. The King made
some expeditions in his owne person, with greate prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and charge: but beeing once out of credite, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
fell out well, was attributed to others; misfortunes were
inputed onely to him. If any thing were happily atchieued
by some of the nobility, it was by the Kings base hearted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites,
to whom millitary vertue was altogether vnpleasant
so extinuated, or depraued, or enuied, that it was seldome
rewarded, so much as with countenance and thankes: yea
sometimes it procured suspicion and danger; the King being
informed by a cunning kinde of enemies, commenders, that
to be a discreet and valiant commander in the fielde, was a
vertue peculiar to a Prince: and that it was a perillous point,
to haue the name of a man of priuate estate, famous for the
same in euery mans mouth. Hereupon, fewe sought to rise
by vertue and val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, the readier way was, to please the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
humour of the Prince. Likewise matters of peace, were
managed by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>men of weakest sufficiency, by whose counsell
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4090:32"/>
either ignorant or corrupt, the destruction of the best harted
nobility, was many times attempted, &amp; at the last wrought.
The profits and reuenues of the crowne were said to bee let
to farme, the King making himselfe landlord of this realme,
and challenged no great priuiledge by his reigne, but onely
a dissolute and vncontrouled life. Great summes of mony
were yearly, rather exacted from the subiects, then by them
voluntarily graunted: whereof no good did ensue, but the
maintenance of the Kings priuate delightes, &amp; the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his hatefull fauorites. To these he was somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his power liberall: for which cause, he was faine to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
begge, and extort in other places: but he purchased not
so much loue by the one, as hate by the other. Besides the
ordinary tearmes of tenthes and fiftenthes, which were m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ny times paid double in one yeare, diuers newe imposition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
were by him deuised &amp; put in vse: sometimes exacting xii. d.
of euery person throughout the realme: sometimes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
religious man and woman vi. s. viii. d. and of euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
priest asmuch, and of euerie lay person maried or sole,
xii. d. Vnder the fauourable tearme of beneuolence; hee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away from the people such heapes of money, as were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
answerable to that free and friendly name. He borrowed
in all places of the realme great summes of money vpon his
priuy seales, so that no man of worth could escape his loane:
but he seldome, and to few, returned payment againe.</p>
            <p>This present yeare, he sent certaine Bishops, and other
personages of honour, to all the shires &amp; corporations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the realme, to declare vnto the people the Kings heauie
displeasure against them, for that they had bin abetters and
complices of the Duke of Gloucester, and of the Earles of
Arundell and Warwicke: and that the King was minded to make a roade vppon them, as common enemies, excepte
they would acknowledge their offence, and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to his mercie and grace. Hereupon, all the men of
worth in euery shire and Towne corporate, made their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4090:33"/>
&amp; submission in writing vnder their scales;
&amp; afterwardes were faine to graunt vnto the King, such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
summes of money, to purchase againe his fauour, as
the land being already greatly impouerished, they were
hardly able to endure. Then were exacted of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strange &amp;
vnaccustomed oathes, which were put likewise in writing,
vnder their seales. They were also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to set their hands
and scales to blancke chartes; wherein the King might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
cause to be written what he would; so that all the
wealth of the realme was in a manner at his deuotion and
pleasure. These and such like violences, were far wide from
the moderate gouernement of <hi>K. Henrie</hi> the second: whoe
maintaining great warres, and obteyning a larger dominion,
then perteyned at any other time to this realme of England,
neuer demaunded subsidie of his subiectes: and yet his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
after his death, was founde to be nine hundred thousand
poundes, besides his Iewels, and his plate.</p>
            <p>In this sort the King bearing a heauie hand vpon his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and they againe a heauie hart against him, and being
withall a Prince weake in action, and not of valure suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to beare out his vices by might, the people at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
to reuolt, and rather to runne into the hazard of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous
rebellion, then to endure safetie ioyned with slauerie:
so they attended occasion, which shortly after was thus offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The King receiued letters of aduertisement out of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(which being priueledged from other venimous beasts
hath alwaies beene pestered with traytors) how the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Irish had cut in pieces his garrison, and slaine <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi>
Earle of Marsh, (who had beene declared heire
apparent to the Crowne) exercising all the crueltie in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of the country, which wrath and rage of victorie could
incite a Barbarous people to practise. This losse being great
in it selfe, the hard affection of the people did much augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
by report: wherupon the King deliberated, whether it were
requisite that hee should vnder-take the warre in person, or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4090:33"/>
commit it to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders of lower degree? Some perswaded
him, that wholly to subdue Ireland, stoode neither with pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
nor yet almost with possibilitie: for if it were fully and
quietly possessed, some gouernour might hap to growe to
that greatnesse, as to make himselfe absolute Lord thereof,
and therfore it was better to hold it certaine by weake ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
then suspected by mightie friendes, and yet by what
meanes should those bogges &amp; those woods bee ouercome,
which are more impregnable, then the walled Townes of
other countries? Then if the purpose were, onely to represse
the sauage people, the war was of no such weight, as should
draw the King to stand in the fielde: and therefore he might
stay in the west partes of England, and from thence make
shew of the princely puissance and state; neither venturing
his person without cause, and ready at hand if neede should
require. Others were of opinion, that to subdue and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Ireland, was a matter neither of difficultie nor daunger:
but both profitable and honourable to the King, and to God
very acceptable. For if credite might bee giuen to auncient
histories, this realme of England was once as insuperable
with bogs and woods, as Ireland was then: but the Romane
conquerors kept not their presidiarie Souldiers in idle gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
whereby many times the minde grew mutinous, and
the body diseased, and both vnable for the labour and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the field: but they held as well them, as the subdued.
Britaines continually exercised, either in building of townes
in places of best aduantage; or in making of high waies: else
in drayning and pauing of bogs: by which meanes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
was made fruitfull and habitable, and the people learned
the good maners, not rudely to repulse the flattering assaults
of pleasure; preferring subiection with plentie, before beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
and miserable libertie. That the same Romaines also
kept many larger countries in quiet obedience, (so long as
they were quiet among themselues) without either feare or
danger of any gouernours: first by deuiding them into smal
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4090:34"/>
prouinces: Secondly by constituting in euery prouince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
officers, as Lieutenants and procurators, whereof one
was able to restraine the other; the first hauing power ouer

the subdued Britaines, that being vnable to resist, &amp; the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
shrincking from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were constrained to desire
helpe of the Saxons: and so betweene their enimies &amp; their,
aides (being set as it were betwixt the beetle and the block)
they lost the possession of the best part of their land. That it
was a pittifull pollicy for assurance of peace, to lay all waste
as a wildernes, and to haue dominion ouer trees and beasts,
and not ouer men. That hereby the King did loose the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of a fruitfull countrie, &amp; the benefit of wealthy subiects,
which are the surest treasure that a Prince can haue. That
hereby also the maiesty of his estate was much impaired: for
(as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith) <hi>The honour of a king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in the multitude
of subiectes.</hi> That the country being vnfurnished of people,
was open to al opportunity of forraine enimies. That if none
of these respectes would moue: yet the King was bounde in
duty, to reduce those sauages to the true worshippe of God,

               </gap>usly
serue him.</p>
            <p>These reasons so weighed with the King, that he gathered
a mighty armie, determining to goe in person into Ireland,
&amp; to pacifie the country before his returne: but al his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was at the charge of the subi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts: and wheras in time of
sedition, a wise Prince will least grieue his people. As see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to stand in some sort at their curtesie, &amp; hauing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their bodies beside; the King in peace no stoarer for
war, was forced to offend, when hee should haue bene most
carefull to win fauour. So about Whitsontide, he set forth
on his voyage with many men, and fewe soldiours; being a
dissolute and vntrained company, and out of all compasse of
obedience, hee caried with him his whole treasure, and all
the goods and auncient Iewels appertaining to the crowne.
In his company went the Duke of Aumerle, and the Duke
of Exceter, and diuers other noble men, and many Bishops,
and the Abbot of Westminster. He also tooke with him the
sonnes of the Duke of Gloucester, and of the Duke of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;
whose fauourours he chiefly feared.</p>
            <p>When hee came to Bristowe, hee was put into suspicion,
(whether vpon some liklyhood, or meere mallice) that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Percy</hi> Earle of Northumberland and certaine others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
some disloyall enterprise against him: and for that
cause did not folow him into Ireland, but had fastned friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the king of Scots, vpon purpose to retire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
into his country, if their attempts should faile. Hereupon the
king sent message that the earle should forthwith come vnto
him with all the power that he could conueniently make.
The earle returned answere, that it was vnnecessary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that seruice, to draw men from such distant places;
for the Irish rebels were neither so many nor so mighty, but
the King had strength at hand sufficient to suppresse them:
that it was also daungerous to disfurnish the North-parts of
their forces, and to offer opportunity to the Scottish borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4090:35"/>
who were alwayes vncertaine friends in their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and assured enemies vpon aduantage. The King seeing
his commaundement in these termes both contemned and
controulled, would not stand to reason the matter with the
Earle, neither had he the reason to defer reuenge vntill hee
had full power to worke it: but presently in the violence of
his fury, caused the Earle and his confederates to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
traitors, and all their lands and goods to be seized to his
vse. The Earle tooke grieuously this disgrace, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to cure &amp; close vp his harme with the disturbance of the
common state. And thus the King hauing feathered these
arrowes against his owne brest, passed foorth in his iourney
into Ireland.</p>
            <p>This expedition at the first proceeded and succeeded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
well, and the king obtained many victories, euen
without battell, as leading his men to a slaughter rather then
to a fight: for the sauage Irish were not vnder one gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but were deuided into many partialities and factions,
and seldome did two or three parts ioyne their common
strenth and study together: so whilest one by one did fight,
all of them were either subdued or slaine. But these newes
little reioyced the common people, they lusted not to listen
thereto: their common talke was to recount their common
grieuances, to lay them together, &amp; aggrauate them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
euery man more abounding in complaints then
he did in miseries. Also the noblemen (the principall obiect
of cruelty) began to discourse both their priuate dangers, &amp;
the deformities of the state: and vpon opportunity of the
Kings absence, some of them did conspire to cut off that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which would not be confined, &amp; to cast it vpon some
other, who was most like to repaire that which <hi>K. Richard</hi>
had ruined: or if (sayde they) our power shall come short of
so good a purpose, yet will we sell him both our liues &amp; lands
with glory in the field, which with certainty in peace we can
not enioy. The onely man vpon whom all men resolued, was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4090:35"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> duke of Hereford (whom since the death of his father
they called duke of Lancaster) not at his own motion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but because he was generally esteemed meet: as being
of the royall bloud, and next by discent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> males to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the crowne: one that had made honorable proofe
of his vertues and valure: the onely man of note that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
aliue, of those that before had stood in armes against the
King, for the behoofe of the Common-wealth: for which
cause he was deeply touched at that time both in honor and
in state. This attempt pleased as possible to proue, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to be followed: whereupon they secretly dispatched
their letters to the Duke, solliciting his speedy returne into
England, &amp; declaring that aswel for the benefit of the realm,
as for their owne particular safety, they were forced to vse
force against King <hi>Richard:</hi> that if it would please him to
make the head, they would furnish him the body of an able
army, to expell the King from his vnfortunate gouernment,
and to settle the possession of the Crowne in him, who was
more apt and able to sustaine the same: that they would not
prouide him a base multitude only, &amp; they themselues helpe
in bare wishes &amp; aduise, but would also adioyne their hands
and thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> liues; so that the peril should be common to all, the
glory only his, if fortune fauored the enterprise. These letters
were conueyed by men crafty and bolde, yet of sure credit,
and inward in trust with the Duke: who passing into France,
first associated vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> late Archbishop
of Canterburie, &amp; at that time (whether deseruedly or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause) an exile in France: then they trauailed by seuerall
waies, and in counterfeit attire to Parris, where all met at the
house of one Clugney, where the Duke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soiourned, After
some courtesies of course, with welcome on the one side, &amp;
thankes on the other, and ioy of both: the Archbishop of
Canterburie hauing obtained of the Duke priuacie and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
made vnto him a solemne oration in these words, or to
this sence following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:4090:36"/>
We are sent vnto you (right high and noble Prince) from
the chiefe Lords and states of our land, not to seeke reuenge
against our King vpon priuate iniury and displeasure: nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a desperate discontentment to set the state on fire: nor
to procure the ambitious aduancement of any perticular per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son:
but to open vnto you the deformities and decaies of our
broken estate, and to desire your aide, in staying the ruinous
downfall of the same. The remembrance of the honourable
reputation that our countrie hath borne, and the noble actes
which it hath atchiued, doth nothing els, but make the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
more bitter vnto vs, wherinto it is new fallen. Our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
armes haue heretofore bene famous and memorable,
not onely within the bownds of our Ocean sea, and in the
Ilands adioyning vnto vs; but also in France, in Spaine, and
in other parts of Europe, yea in Asia and in Affricke, against
the infidels and Barbarians: so that all Christian Princes haue
bene either glad to imbrace our friendship, or loath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
vs to hostility. But nowe the rude Scots, whose spirits
we haue so many times broken, and brought on their knees,
doe scornfully insult vppon vs: the naked and fugitiue Irish,
haue shaken of our shackles, and glutted themselues vppon
vs, with massachres &amp; spoiles: with these we dayly fight, not
for glory, but to liue: insomuch as we are become a pitty to
our friends, and a verie ieast to our most base and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
enemies. In deed the King hath both sent and led great
armies into these countries, but in such sort, that they haue
much wasted the realme with their maintenance; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reuenged nor relieued it with their armes: and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
for all our diligent and discreete leaders (the verie si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
of the field) are either put to death, or banished, or els
lie buried in obscurity and disgrace: and the marshalling of
all affaires is committed (without any respect of sufficiency
or desert) to the counsaile &amp; conduct of those, who can best
apply themselues to the Kings youthfull delightes. Among
these, auncient nobility is accompted a vaine ieast, wealth,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4090:36"/>
and vertue are the ready meanes to bring to destruction.</p>
            <p>It grieues me to speake, but it helpeth not, to hide that
which euery man seeth: our auncestors liued in the highest
pitch and perfection of libertie; but we of seruilitie, being in
the nature, not of subiectes, but of abiectes, and flat slaues;
not to one intractable Prince onely, but to many proude &amp;
disdainefull fauorites; not alwaies the same, but euer new; &amp;
no sooner haue we satisfied some, but fresh hungrie masters
are straight waies set vpon vs, who haue more endamaged
vs by extortion and bribes, then the enemy hath done by the
sword. What vnusuall kindes of exactio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are dayly put in
practise? without either measure or end, and oftentimes with
out neede: or if any be, it proceedeth rather vpon ryotus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses,
then any necessary or honourable charge: and great
summes of money are pulled and pilled from good subiects,
to be throwne away amongst vnprofitable vnthriftes. And if
any man openeth his mouth against these extorted taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then either by feined imputation of capital crimes, or by
smal matters aggrauated, or else by open crueltie and force,
his life or libertie is forthwith hazarded. I were too tedious,
too odious, too friuolus to put you in mind of particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
as though your owne estate, &amp; the lamentable losse
of your vncle, &amp; other noble friends, could be forgotten: yea,
I suppose that there is no man of qualitie within the Realme,
who either in his owne person, or in his neere friends, doeth
not plainly perceiue, that no man enioyeth the safegard of
his goods, and suerty of his body; but rich men in the one, &amp;
great men in the other are continually endaungered. This
then is our case; but what is our remedy? we haue endured, &amp;
we haue entreated: but our pacience hath drawne on more
heauie burthens, and our complaints procured more bitter
blowes: by the one our liuings, and our liues by the other are
dayly deuoured. And therfore we are now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to shake
off our shoulders this importable yoke, and submit our selues
to the soueraigntie of some more moderate and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4090:37"/>
not so much for the griefe of our miseries which are past
nor for the paine of our present distresses, as for feare of such
daungers as are most like to ensue, for the King hath cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the chiefe of the nobilitie, and the commons hee hath
pared to the quicke, and still hee harrieth vs as a conquered
countrie: whereby we are layd bare to the hauocke of al our
enemies, &amp; vtterly disabled, not onely to recouer that which
is lost, but also to retaine euen that which is left. But to whom
should we complaine? what succour, whose ayde should we
desire? you are the onely man, who in right should, and in
wisedome can, and in goodnesse will (we hope) relieue vs.
For you are neerest to the King in bloud, and therfore ought
to haue the rule of that which his weakenesse cannot wielde.
Your yeares are wel stayed from the light conceits of youth,
and so spent, that all your actions haue made proofe of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in gouernment of greatest charge: nothing past, needeth
excuse, and feare is vaine for any thing to come. The paines
and perils which heretofore you haue vndertaken for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of your countrie, putteth vs also in good hope, that in
these extremities you will not forsake vs: wee are all as in a
ship that is ready to sinke, as in a house that is ready to fall, &amp;
doe most humbly craue and call for your helpe; now or else
neuer shew your selfe in fauour of your countrymen, to free vs, to free your selfe, to free the whole state from these daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and decayes, by taking into your hands the scepter and
diademe of the Realme, and reducing againe the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof to a princely freedome; in combining the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie
of one, with the libertie of all. Omit not this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
to set forth to the view of the world, as in a large field, &amp;
at free scope your vertue and courage, by relieuing misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wretches from their oppressors: which action hath beene
so highly honoured, that many heathen men for the same,
haue beene accompted as Gods. This we are constrained to
offer and entreate: this is both honorable for you to accept,
and easie to be performed: and so much the more, in that no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4090:37"/>
Prince, by any people haue bene desired with greater affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor shall be with more dutie obeyed.</p>
            <p>The Duke entertained this speach, with great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mind, shewing himselfe neither disturbed thereat, nor
excessiue in ioy. His aunswere concerning the King, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue
and wel tempered; rather lamenting his weakenes
then blaming his malice. Concerning himselfe hee spake so
modestly, that he seemed rather worthy of a kingdome, then
desirous. The life (quoth he) which hitherto I haue led, hath
alwaies bene free from ambitious attempts: and the stayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my yeares, hath now setled my mind from aspiring
thoughts: and experience of former dangers hath bred in me
a warie regard in such weightie proceedings, for to cast a
King out of state, is an enterprise not hastely to bee resolued
vpon, nor easily effected: but suppose that matter not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and perhaps not hard, yet the rarenesse of the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,
will make the action seeme iniurious to most men:
and he that shal attaine a kingdome vpon opinion of desert,
doth charge himselfe with great expectation, and how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
soeuer hee carried himselfe, shall neuer want his
deadly enuiers: besides this, in ciuill dissentions the faith of
the whole people is fleeting, and daunger is to bee doubted
from euery particular person: so that it is possible that al may
fall away, and impossible to beware of euery one. Therefore
I could rather wish, to spend the course of my yeares which
yet remaine, in this obscure, yet safe and certaine state, then
to thrust my selfe vpon the pikes of those perils, which being
once entred into, are daungerous to follow, &amp; deadly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake:
for in priuate attempts, a man may step and stope when
he please: but he that aymeth at a kingdome, hath no middle
course betwene the life of a Prince, &amp; the death of a traytor.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop hearing this, did as vainly persist in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning
the duke, as he vainly seemed vnwilling &amp; stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge.
The state (sayd he) wherein now you stand, is not so safe and
certaine as you doe conceiue. In deed, by reiecting our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4090:38"/>
you shal auoid certaine dignity, and therewith vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
&amp; contingent dangers; but you shal procure most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
destruction both to your selfe and vs. For this secret can
not be kept long secret from the king: and euen good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are nice in points of soueraignty, &amp; beare a nimble eare
to the touch of that string: and it more hurteth a subiect to
be esteemed worthy of the kingdome, then it will profit him
to haue refused the offer. What then will he do, who putteth
the chiefest surety of his reigne in the basenesse &amp; barenesse
of his subiects? whose head being possessed with eternall ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy,
maketh euery presumption a proofe, and euery light
surmise a strong suspition against them. Surely since the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
fauour &amp; loue which the people beareth you, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued
you of your liberty, this their generall desire will not
leaue your life vntouched. As for vs, if we either faint in our
intent, or faile in the enterprise, <hi>actum est:</hi> we shalbe as lambs
among lions: and no conquest can be so cruell as the Kings
reigne will be ouer vs. Certainely we haue gone too far, for
to go backe; and the time is past, when you for ambition, &amp;
we for enuy might seeme to attempt against the King: the
attainment of the kingdome must now be a sanctuary &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for vs both. The like examples are not rare (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme)
nor long since put in practise, nor far hence to be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
The kings of Denmarke and of Sweueland, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
banished by their subiects; oftentimes imprisoned &amp;
put to their fine: The princes of Germany, about an hundred

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:4090:38"/>
Kinges of Northumberland, were for their disorders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by their subiects. Since the victorie of the Normaines,
the Lords endeauoured to expell King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but
they were not able: yet were they able to depose King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the second, and to constitute his young sonne <hi>Edward</hi>
King in his steade: these are not all, and yet enough to cleare
this action of rarenesse in other countries; &amp; noueltie in our.
The difficulty indeede is somewhat, because the excellencie
is great: but they that are affraide of euery bush, shall neuer
take the bird: &amp; your selfe had once some triall hereof, when
without battaile, without bloud or blowes, you had the King
at such a lift, as he held his Crowne at your courtesie, euen at
that time when his grieuances were, neither for greatnes nor
continuance, so intollerable as now they are growne: and by
reason of his tender yeres, not out of al compasse, both of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for the fault, and of hope for an amendement. And as
concerning the lawfulnesse.</p>
            <p>Nay (said the Duke) where necessity doth enforce, it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
to vse speach, either of easinesse, or of lawfulnesse:
necessitie will beate thorow brasen Walles: and can be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by no lawes. I haue felt verie deeply my part in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and I would you knew with what griefe I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
your: for what other reward haue I receiued, of all my
trauailes and seruices, but the death of my vncle and dearest
friends, my owne banishment, the imprisonmeut of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and losse of my inheritance? and what haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to you, for your bloud so often shed in his vnfortunate
warres, but continuall tributes, scourges, gallowes, and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie?
I haue made sufficient proofe, both of pacience in my
owne miseries, and of pittie in your: remedy them hither to
I could not: If now I can, I will not refuse to sustain that part,
which yonr importunitie doth impose vpon me, if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
we shall recouer againe our libertie: if wee loose, our
state shall be no worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now it is: and since we must needs

our liues, or to dye for deserte: and although our liues were
safe, which in deede are not, yet to abandon the state, ane

sloath. It remaineth then, that we vse both secrecie and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie,
laying hold vpon the oportunitie which the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
hath now presented vnto vs: for in al enterprises which
neuer are commended before they bee atchieued, delayes
are daungerous; and more safe it is to be founde in action,
then in counsaile: for they that deliberate onely to rebell,
haue rebelled already.</p>
            <p>So the messengers departed into England, to declare the
Dukes acceptance, and to make preparation against his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall,
both of armour, and of subiection, and desire to obey.
Presently after their departure, the Duke signified to <hi>Charles</hi>

King suspecting no further fetch, sent letters of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

surmised any dangerous drift against King <hi>Richard,</hi> who not
long before, had taken his daughter to wife; in stead of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of safe-conducte, he would haue founde lettes to haue
kept him safe from disturbing his sonne in lawes estate.</p>
            <p>Assoone as the Duke was come into Brittaine, he waged
certaine souldiours, and presently departed to Calice, and so
committed to sea for England; giuing forth, that the onely
cause of his voyage, was to recouer the Duchie of Lancha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and the rest of his lawfull inheritance, which the King
wrongfully deteyned from him. In his companie was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Arundell</hi> the Archbishop of Canterburie, and <hi>Thomas</hi>
the sonne &amp; heire of <hi>Richard</hi> late earle of Arundell, who was
very yong, and had a little before escaped out of prison, and
fled into France to the Duke. The residue of his attendants
were very few, not exceeding the number of fifteen lances:
so that it is hard to esteeme whether it was greater maruaile,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4090:39"/>
either that he durst attempt, or that he did preuaile with so
smal a company: but his chiefest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence was in the fauour
&amp; assistance of the people within the realme. So he did beare
with England, yet not in a streight course, but floated along
the shoare, making head sometimes to one coast, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to another, to discouer what forces were in a readines,
either to resist or to receiue him.</p>
            <p>As he was in this sort houering on the seas, L. <hi>Edmund</hi>
duke of Yorke, the kings vncle, to whom the king had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the custody of the Realme during the time of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
called vnto him <hi>Edmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Stafford</hi> bishop of Chichester,
L. Ghancellour, &amp; <hi>W. Scroupe</hi> earle of Wiltshire, L. Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Realme, also, Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Bagot,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Russell,</hi> and certain others of the kings
Priuy councell; and entred into deliberation what was best
to be done. At the last it was concluded, deceitfully by some,
vnskilfully by others, and by all perniciously for the king; to
leaue the sea coasts, and to leaue London, the very walles &amp;
castle of the Realme, and to goe to <hi>S. Albons,</hi> there to gather
strength sufficient to encounter with the duke. It is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that the dukes side was not any wayes more furthered,
then by this dissembling and deceiuable dealing: for open
hostility and armes, may openly and by armes be resisted:
but priuy practises, as they are hardly espied, so are they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
auoided. And thus by this meanes the duke landed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the feast of <hi>Saiud Martin,</hi> without let or resistance, at
Rauenspur in Houldernesse, as most writers affirme.</p>
            <p>Presently after his ariual, there resorted to him Lord <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Pearcie</hi> Earle of Northumberland, and Lord <hi>Henry</hi> his son
Earle of Westmerland, Lorde <hi>Radulph Neuill,</hi> Lorde <hi>Rose,</hi>
Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> &amp; many other personages of honor, whose
company encreased reputation to the cause, and was a great
couutenance and strength to the Dukes further purposes.
And first they tooke of him an oath, that hee should neither
procure nor permit any bodily harme to be done vnto King
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4090:40"/>
               <hi>Richard;</hi> whereupon they bound themselues vpon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to prosecute all extremities against his mischieuous
counsailers. And this was one step further then that which
the Duke pretended at the first, when hee tooke shipping at
Callice, which was only the recouery of his inheritance: but
that was as yet not determined, nor treated, and of some per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>haps
not thought vpon; which afterwardes it did ensue: and
so was that place easily insinuated into by degrees, which
with maine and direct violence would hardlier haue bin ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Then the common people desperate vpon newe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and without head, head-long to matters of innouation,
flocked very fast to these noble men, the better sort for loue
to the common-wealth, some vpon a wanton lenetie, and
vaine desire of change, others in regard of their own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> distres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
and decayed estate, who setting their chiefe hopes and
deuises vppon a generall disturbance, were then most safe
when the common state was most vnsure. So betweene the
one and the other, the multitude did in short time increase
to the number of threescore thousand able soldiours.</p>
            <p>The Duke finding this fauour not onely to exceed his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
but euen aboue his wish, he thought it best to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the current whilst the streame was most strong, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
right well, that if fortune be followed, as the first doe fall
out, the rest will commonly succeede. Therefore cutting of
vnnecessary delaies, with al possible celerity hee hastned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
London: to the end that possessing himselfe thereof
as the chiefe place within the realme, both for strength and
store, he might there make the seat of the warre. In this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
no signe nor shew of hostility appeared, but all the way
as he passed, the men of chiefest quallity and power adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselues vnto him, some vpon heat of affection, some
for feare, others vpon hope of rewarde after victorie; euerie
one vpon causes dislike, with like ardent desire contending,
least any should seeme more foreward then they: In euerie
place also where he made stay, rich gifts and pleasant deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4090:40"/>
were presented vnto him, with large supply both of force
and prouision: far aboue his neede: and the common people
which for their greatnesse take no care of publique affaires,
and are in least daunger by reason of their basenes, with
shoutes and acclamations gaue their applause; extolling the
Duke, as the onely man of courage, and saluting him Kiug;
but spending many contumelious tearmes vppon King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
and deprauing him, as a simple and sluggish man, a
dastard, a meycocke, and one altogether vnworthy to beare
rule; shewing themselues as much without reason in rayling
vpon the one, as they were in flattering the other. Againe,
the Duke for his part was not negligent to vncouer the head
to bowe the body, to stretch forth the hand to euery meane
person, and to vse all other complements of popular beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
wherewith the mindes of the common multitude are
much delighted and drawen; taking that to bee courtesie,
which the seuerer sort accompt abasement. When h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> came
to the citty, he was there likewise very richly and royally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
with processions and pageantes, and diuers other
triumphant deuises &amp; shewes; the standings in all the streets,
where he passed were taken vp to behold him; and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
multitude, who otherwise could not, yet by their good
wordes, wishes, and wils, did testify vnto him their louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
neither did there appeare in any man at that time,
any memory of faith and alleagiance towards King <hi>Richard,</hi>
but (as in seditions it alwaies hapneth) as the most swayed all
did go.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie side, the Duke of Yorke with the rest of
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounsaile, fell to mustering of men at S. Albones, for the
King: but as the people out of diuers quarters were called
thither, many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> protested, that they would doe nothing
to the harme and preiudice of the Duke of Lancaster, who
they said was vniustly expelled, first from his country, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
from his inheritance. Then <hi>W. Scroupe</hi> Earle of
Wiltshire L. Treasorer, Sir <hi>I. Bush, Sir W. Bagot,</hi> and <hi>Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4090:41"/>
Greene,</hi> perceiuing the stiffe resolution of the people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke
the duke of Yorke, and the L. Chanceller, and fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Bristow; intending to passe the seas into Ireland to the
king. These foure were they vpon whom the common fame
went, that they had taken of the king his realm to farme: who
were so odious vnto the people, that their presence turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the harts of many subiects; yea it was thought, that more
for displeasure against them, then against the king, the reuolt
was made. For being the onely men of credit and authority
with the King, vnder false colour of obedience they wholly
gouerned both the realme &amp; him; to many mischiefs corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his mind, &amp; in many abusing his name, either against his
wil, or without his knowledge, insomuch as he was innocent
of much harme which passed vnder his commandement: but
the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the people could not endure that two or three
should rule al; not by reason they were sufficient, but because
they were in fauour: and the King in that he permitted them
whom he might haue bridled, or was ignorant of that which
he should haue knowen, by tolerating and wincking at their
faults, made them his owne, &amp; opened therby the way to his
destruction. So often times it falleth out to be as dangerous
to a prince to haue hurtfull and hatefull officers in place and
seruices of weight, as to be hurtfull and hatefull himselfe.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Yorke either amazed at this sodain change,
or fearing his aduenture if he should proceede in resistance,
gaue ouer the cause, and preferred present security, before
duty with daunger; giuing most men occasion to misdeeme
by his dealing, that he secretly fauored the dukes enterprise;
likewise all the other counsailers of that side, either openly
declared for the Duke or secretly wished him wel: &amp; aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
all priuate direction &amp; aduice, adioyned themselues
to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon course, presuming thereby of greater safety.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Henry</hi> in the meane time being at London, entred
into deliberation with his friends, what way were best to be
followed. At the last, hauing considered the forwardnesse of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4090:41"/>
the people, the greatnes of the perill whereinto they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
plunged, &amp; the kings irreconcilable nature, wherof he
made proofe against the duke of Gloucester, &amp; the earles of
Arundel &amp; of Warwicke: they finally resolued to expel him
from his dignity, &amp; to constitute duke <hi>Henry</hi> king in his sted:
and to that end open war was denounced against the King,
and against all his partakers, as enemies to the quiet and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenty
of the realme; and pardon also promised to all those
that would submit themselues to follow the present course,
otherwise to look for no fauour, but all extremities. None of
the nobility durst openly oppose himselfe to these designes:
some vnwilling to play all their state at a cast; kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
at liberty, to be directed by successe of further euent: others
consented coldly, and in tearmes of doubtfull construction,
with intent to interpret them afterwards, as occasion should
change: but the most parte did directly and resolutely enter
into the cause, and made their fortunes common with the
Duke, in daunger of the attempt, but not in honour: among
whome, the Duke standing vp, vsed speach to this purpose.</p>
            <p>I am returned here as you see, at your procurement, and
by your agreement haue entred into armes for the common
liberty: wee haue hitherto prosperously proceeded, but in
what tearmes we now stand, I am altogether vncertaine. A
priuate man I am loath to be accompted, being designed to
be King by you; and a Prince I cannot be esteemed, whilst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is in possession of the kingdome. Also your name is in
suspence, whether to be tearmed rebels or subiects, vntil you
haue made manifest that your allegeance was bound rather
to the state of the realme then the person of the Prince. Now
you are the men who haue both caused this doubtfulnes and
must cleare the same; your parts still remaineth to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
your vertue &amp; valure must adde strength to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this action. We haue already attempted so farre, that
all hope of pardon is extinct; so that if wee shoulde shrincke
back, &amp; breake of the enterprise, no mercy is to be expected
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4090:42"/>
but butchery and gibbets, and all extremities if wee driue of
&amp; delay the accomplishment thereof, we shall loose the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
which now is offred, and open to our enimies oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of aduantage. For the peoples bloud is vp now on our
side, and nothing is wanting but our owne diligence &amp; care:
let vs not therefore trifle out the time of doing, in talking &amp;
deliberating: it is best striking whilst the yron is hoate: let vs
set forth roundly, and possesse our selues with speed of al the
parts of the realme: and so we shall bee able either to keepe
out our concurrent, or els to entertaine him litle to his liking.
So troups of men were sent into euery quarter of the realme,
to secure them for making strength on the part of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard:</hi>
but the people in all places as men broken with many
burthens, did easily entertaine the first commer, and were
not curious to fide with the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. The Duke pursued those
of the Kings priuy counsaile, which fled away from the duke
of Yorke; bearing himselfe with great cheere and courage,
as confident in the cause, and secure of the euent. When he
came at Bristow he found the castle fortified against him; but
in short time he forced it, and tooke therein <hi>Sir Iohn Bushy,
Sir Henrie Greene, &amp; W. Scroupe, L. Treasurer,</hi> a ioyfull pray
to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people: who (fearing that if execution should
bee deferred, petitions for pardon might happen to preuaile,
and so their cruelties and iniuries should bee canswered with
the vaine title and commendation of elemency) did violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require them vnto death, no respite could be obteined, no
defence admitted, no answere heard: yea their humble and
submisse intreaty was interpreted to argue a weake &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
courage vpon a guilty conscience, which more incensed
the rage of the people, crying out that they were traitours,
bloud-suckers, theeues, and what other heinous tearmes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
fury did put into their mouthes: at which clamorous
and importunant instance, the day following they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.
Sir <hi>William Bagot</hi> came not with them to Bristowe,
but turned to Chester: and the pursuit being made after the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4090:42"/>
most, he alone escaped into Ireland. This execution, partly
because it pleased the people, and partly because it excluded
all hope of the Kings pardon, caused them to cleaue more
closely to the Duke; which greatly encreased, both his glory,
&amp; his hope; hauing officers of so long aide, &amp; need of so litle.</p>
            <p>In the meane time this newes of the Dukes arriuall and of
other occurrences, part true, part false, and part enlarged by
circumstance (as fame groweth in the going) was blowen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the King, being then entangled with other broyles in
Ireland, at the receipt whereof, hee caused th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nnes of the
Duke of Gloucester, and of the Duke of Lancaster to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
in the strong Castle Trim, which is in Ireland, &amp; for
dispatch to returne into England, left many matters vnfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and most of his prouision behind, hasting and shufling
vp, as present necessitie did enforce. So being both vnskilfull
and vnfortunate himselfe, &amp; de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oide of good direction; with
more haste then good hap he tooke shipping, with the Duke
of Aumerle, Exceter, &amp; Surrie, the Bishops of London, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,
and Caerliele, and many other men of qualitie: and
crossing the seas, landed at Milford hauen in Wales, in which
conntrimen he alwaies reposed his chiefest suretie &amp; trust,
but then he saw contrarie to his expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as wel there
as in all other places, the people by plumps flocked to the
Duke, &amp; fled from him: yea they that came with him began
for to wauer, no man encouraging them to be constant, but
many to reuolt. This suddaine chaunge not looked for, not
thought vpon, disturbed all the Kings deuises, &amp; made him
irresolute what hee should doe: on the one side hee saw his
cause and quarell to bee right, and his conscience (he saide)
cleare from any bad demerite: on the other side hee saw the
great strength of his enemies, and the whole power of the
realme bent against him: &amp; being more abashed of the one,
then emboldned by the other, he stoode perplexed in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
termes, either where to stay, or whether to stirre, hauing
neither skill nor resolution himselfe in cases of difficultie, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4090:43"/>
noxious to hurtfull and vnfaithfull counsaile. Some aduised
him to march forward, and pierce deeper into the land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his owne forces fell from him: affirming, that valure is
seconded by fortune: that this courage of his, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the constancie of his souldiours: and his presence put
the people in remembrance of their faith: that in all places
he should finde some, who for fauour, or for hire, or else
for duetie, would adheare vnto him: whereby hee should
soone gather strength sufficient to ioyne issue with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de. Others perswaded him to retire againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ireland, &amp; then if succour failed him in England, to wage
souldiours out of other countries. But the King being no man
of action in militarie affaires, reiected both the counsailes, as
neyther venturous enough with the one, nor warie enough
with the other: and taking a middle course (which in cases
of exremitie of all is the worst) he determined to make staye
in Wales, and there to attende to what head this humour
would rise.</p>
            <p>The Duke vpon aduertisement that the King was landed
in Wales, remoued with a strong armie from Bristowe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
Chester, vsing the first oportunitie against him, and
which in deede was the fittest, When <hi>L. Thomas Percie</hi> Earle
of Worcester, and steward of the Kings houshold, heard of
the Dukes approach, he brake forth into shewe of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
which before hee had conceiued against the King,
for proclayming his brother; the Earle of Northumberlande
traytour, and thereupon openly in the hall, in the presence of
the Kings seruants, he brake his white rodde, the ensigne of
his office, and forthwith departed to the Duke, willing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to shift for himselfe in time: by which acte he lost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
both with the haters &amp; fouourers of King <hi>Richard;</hi>
being accompted of the one a corrupter, of the other a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saker
and betrayer of the King. After this example, almost
all the rest, more fearefull then faithfull scattered themselues
euery one his way: and they who in the Kings flourishing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4090:43"/>
time, would haue contended to bee foremost, now in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
estate equally draw backe, and like swallowes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke
that house in the winter of fortunes boysterous blasts,
where they did nothing but feede &amp; foyle in the summer of
her sweete sunne-shine. And thus betweene faint souldiers
and false friends, the King was abandoned and forsaken, and
left almost vnto himselfe: looke on he might, but let it, hee
could not, as not of force to punish that, which he neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to preuent: his only remedy was pacience: (a cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort)
his only reuenge was complaint: (a weake weapon) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which two, his bitternesse did in this manner breake
from him.</p>
            <p>And doe these also (said he) forsake me? doth their faith &amp;
my fortune end together? wel, if I had forsaken them in time
I had not beene forsaken of others, who once loued me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and now are able to harme me more. But now I see the
blindnesse of my iudgement: I plainely see, that there is no
friendship in flatterie, nor treacherie in plaine truth: and I
would I had as much time to reforme this errour, as I am like
to haue to repent it, but they would not suffer me to be wise
when I might, and now they haue made me wretched they
runne from me: they could bee the causes, but they will not
be companions of my miseries: such attendants are Crowes
to a carcasse, which flocke together, not to defend, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
it, and no sooner haue they layd the bones bare, but
straight-wayes they are gone.</p>
            <p>Thus the King hauing lost both the feare and loue of his
subiects, disturbed and distracted in thoughts, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
councell or courage, remained still in Wales, as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at home, as an exile in his owne kingdome, not daring to
goe to London, nor any man desirous to come to him, shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still from place to place, and (as it fals out at men distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
&amp; amazed) fearing all things, but most disliking the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
The Duke continually pursued him with a mightie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
but the Kings companie was too small to doe any thing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4090:44"/>
by force, &amp; yet too great to remaine in secrete: neither were
they in any sort assured vnto him, but such as shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
retained a while; bands of small countenance, with
men fearefull of danger, &amp; carelesse of credite. At the length
he came to the Castle of Conweye; and there being vtterly
destitute both of helpe and hope, he stoode deuided in mind
what way to bend his course, all his followers weare more
ready to impugne the opinions of other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselues, as seeing better what to shunne then what to
follow: and as it alwaies chanceth in desperate causes, that
way was commonly preferred, wherof the opportunitie was
already past. Some aduised him, that it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to think,
rather of sauing his life, then recouering his estate. You see
(said they) how greatly &amp; how wholly your subiects are set
against you: it is but in vaine to looke for a suddaine change,
or without a chaunge to hope that your purposes may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
giue place for a time to the currant of this furie; let it
haue the full sway; and when it is at the highest pitch, it will
turne againe; and then you shall haue the tide as strong on
your side, as it is now against you. This motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the people, is violent and against nature: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as a stone forced vpward) is most stronge at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the further it passeth the more it weakneth, vntil at
last it returne to the naturall course againe. Therefore giue
a little space, for the bad to draw backe, for the good to put forward:
treasons preuaile on the suddaine: but good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes
gather forces by leasure. You haue example in your
noble progenitor King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, against whome the
Lords set vp <hi>Lewes</hi> the French kings sonne: conditions were
concluded, and faith was made that he should be their King:
but this purpose lasted not the pulling on: for before they had
possessed him of the kingdom, they ioyned togither in armes
against him, &amp; were as fierce to driue him out of the realme,
as they had beene found to draw him in. The like alteration
may you likewise not onely hope, but assuredly expect: for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4090:44"/>
the mindes of men are constant in nothing but inconstancie,
and perseuer onely in chaunge, in dislike of things present
they desire new, wherwith they rest not long contented, but
are many times glutted euen with the first sight. And indeed
how can they long endure the raigne of him, who attaining
the kingdome onely by their fauour and might, shall holde
the same in a manner, at their courtesie and will? for euerie
vnpleasant commaund, shall be deemed ingratitude: euerie
suit reiected, shal charge him with vnkindnesse: Yea if honor
be not offered, they will be discontented: and vppon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of displeasure, thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as able to displace him,
as they were to set him vp: therefore you may for a time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe into Ireland; or else passe the seas to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in lawe, the king of Fraunce: you may assure your selfe
of his assistance, to set vpon your side, and recouer your los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Times haue their turnes, and fortune her course too and
fro like the sea, &amp; magnanimitie is shewen by enduring, &amp;
not relinquishing when she doth crosse, onely loose no point
of courage, and keepe your person at large: reseruing your
selfe to that good hope, which neuer dieth whilst life endure.</p>
            <p>Others, who were enemies to all counsaile, whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were not authors, perswaded the King, that the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and commons of the realme had attempted so farre, that
they would rather dye, then desist; not so much for hatred to
you, as for feare to themselues; hauing so deadly increased
your displeasure against them. For it is a hard matter to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
and impossible to forget those iniuries and indignities
which they haue offered. And to omit what some princes
haue done, what all will promise to doe, they will soone find
fresh and bleeding examples what you are like to doe. The
Duke of Gloucester and the Earles of Arundell and of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke
did rise in armes against you, not to remoue you from
your crowne: but to remoue certaine persons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie;
an action more displeasing then preiudiciall vnto you:
at the last, a friendship was made, and charters of free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4090:45"/>
graunted vnto them: but what followed? was euer the
breach perfectly made vp? did displeasure dye? or was it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissembled? ah, it grieueth vs to thinke, how the present
want of their liues, hath fully reuenged their deathes: for
if they had liued, their countenance and authority woulde
easily haue staied these stirs; and the manner of their deaths
doth strike an obstinate persistance into all your enemies. As
for refuge to forren Princes, you shall surely receiue of them
entertainment and allowance, and yet may growe burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and at last perhaps faile: but it is very hard to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Prince into so dangerous a quarrell: and more harde by
that meanes to preuaile: or if you should, it is to bee feared
that the victorers will hold to themselues the benefit of their
conquest, and not yeeld it ouer vnto you. Few countries but
haue bin vnder pretence of ayde by forrenners subdued: and
this was the only cause which first drew the Saxons into this
land: who so assisted the Britaines against their enemies,
that themselues could not be resisted from possessing they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
kingdome. Yet we doe not altogither condemne the helpe
of straungers, in cases of extremity; but doe account it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
least to be trusted, and last of all to bee tried. What
then if first you should procure a treaty, to see in what terms
the people stand against you? It may be that vpon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
they will submit themselues vnto you, as heretofore
they haue done. Or if they wil needs deforce you from your
kingdome, yet if an honourable maintenance may bee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what shall you lose thereby? What shall you lack? You
haue no childe to be disinherited; the chiefest motiue which
maketh men so greedy to get, and so carefull to keepe. And
as for your selfe, you shall be remoued from a steepe &amp; sli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

seas, to a calme hauen; from daungerous trauaile to secure
rest: &amp; if there be no solace without safety, no felicity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
firmnesse; you shall find the priuate life not only more
sweete, but more high and happy then your princely state.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4090:45"/>
The tallest trees are weakest in the toppes; in widest fieldes are
greatest tempests; and enuy alwaies aimeth at loftiest marks: so
that to be placed on high, is a false felicity, and a true misery; in
shew a rule, but indeed a subiection to all the subiects; hauing
least stay to stand, and most danger in the fall: and therefore if
you come downe safely, you are therein priuileged aboue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other. But you shal lose (you will say) the credit &amp; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a King: so you shal the cares; and so you shall the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties.
The crown &amp; sceptar are things most weighty to weld:
if a Prince be good, he is laden with labour; if euill, with infamy
and reproch: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> either with perils: on euery side he is beset with
dangerous rocks, with deadly gulfes, &amp; continually tossed with
strong and sturdy tempests: so that to be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these feares,
is to be esteemed an escape, and not a losse. This did the stoick
Philosopher perecue, who seeing <hi>Dionysius</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, merily &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceited in the theater, beeing a little before expelled his
kingdom; greatly condemned the error of his people who had
banished him to such liberty, &amp; so preferred him by his punisli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These are the dreames of philosophers (you will say) who
vsually contemne and depraue honor, &amp; yet neuer lie from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
mens tables. Let passe then Philosophers: go to vaine
and sottish men. <hi>Seleuchus</hi> being a King was wont to say, that if
a man knew with what cares the diade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was clogged, he would
not take it vp, although it lay in the street. You will say perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
that like the boatman, he looked one way, and pulled
another; or like the lapwing, he cried most whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was furthest

had dispoiled of al Asia, he sent vnto them great thanks,
that they had rid him of infinit &amp; importable cares, and set him
at a moderate quiet: you will say that he made a vertue of his
necessity. Well then, we are some what neere your cace: &amp; they
that cannot frame their wils to this wisedome, let them thanke
their enimies for enforcing them to it. But what say you to <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who did voluntarily relinqusht, not a small and corner
kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, but the greatest empire that the world did euer beare
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4090:46"/>
and found so sweet contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in that exchange, that when he
was importuned by the senate, to resume his estate, hee vtterly
reiected their suite. But what need we trauell in externe histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for those examples, whereof we haue so large supply in our
owne? the ancient Saxon Kings; <hi>Kingilsus, Ina, Ceolulphus, Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,
Ethelredus, Ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>redus, Offa, Sebbi, &amp; Sigebertus</hi> did of their
owne accord laye downe their diadems and scepters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to solitary &amp; religious liues. Now many Princes
haue helde their estate with better fortune, but none did euer
with greater honor leaue it, then you should at this present: for
others haue aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned their rule, either for desire of ease, or for
auoidance of dangers, or vpon some sluggish and superstitious
deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but you for loue to your country, shall forbeare to seek
your vttermost remedy, in setting vp a most cruel war: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
much English bloud should be spilt, &amp; the realme depriued
of many worthy armies. Let others be repotted to forsake their
kingdoms, when they had no longer pleasure to hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but
your praise shall be for giuing ouer, when it is greatest benefit
vnto the people: and the more hope you haue to preuaile, if
you list to contend, the greater commendations will it be to
yeeld as being rather voluntary then by constraint.</p>
            <p>The king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the courage of the first, but this last cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
best agreed with his faint &amp; feeble spirit, more yeelding to
feare then forward in hope; apt by the one to despaire, vnable
by the other to holde out in any hard aduenture, preferring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abiect and base safety, before hazard with honour. Yet
were many ready to reply, that al speech of conditions &amp; yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was both dishonorable &amp; also dangerous: for euen in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
haps, said they, a noble nature wil not presently relinquish;
but first endeuor either by courage to repell the danger, or by
wisdome to decline it: and why should you so litle esteem your
glory and fame, as without battel, or blow striken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bind your
hands, &amp; yeeld vp your weapons, &amp; put your selfe vpon mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mercy: or if the honor of your noble house doth nothing
moue you, yet let danger &amp; despaire at least arme you to bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
for neither the duke nor his friends will be so confident
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4090:46"/>
as to thinke themselues safe, so long as you shall remaine (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in priuate state) aliue. Indeed you may assure your self
that faire words wil be giuen, &amp; large offers made: but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist in the courtesy of the conqueror: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will be thought vnlawfull to him that hath power. King
<hi>Edward</hi> the second was too heauy to be indured, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his own
sonne: and many haue vsed violence to themselues, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they would fall into the power of their concurrents: and do not
you expect more fauor or greater fortune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
let neuer that senselesnes possesse your mind, to imagine that a
prince may liue safely in priuate estate: for in this case there is
no meane betweene <hi>Caesar</hi> &amp; nothing, betweene the highest
honor &amp; the deadliest downfall. Therfore omit neither all nor
any one meanes vnassayed, to maintaine your side by armes:
no greater harme can happen at the hardest, then that which
willingly you run into: you can but die if you be vanquished, &amp;
die you shall if you do yeeld: but by the one you shall end your
life with glory, by the other, with shame &amp; perpetuall reproch.
And although you do now esteeme equally of both, yet when
you shall see your selfe pent in prison, in dayly feare and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
of a bloudy messenger; you shall then perceiue a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in death, and find the weaknesse and fault of the counsell
which you are about to follow. Many like speeches were with
great veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy often repeated, but the kings eares were stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
against all impression of manhood: and as he was vnable to
gouerne himselfe in his prosperous estate, so was he much lesse
sufficient to wind out of these intricate troubles. Therfore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
himselfe so straitly beset, that he could hardly either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
away, or shift any longer, he desired speech with <hi>Tho. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi>
archbish. of Cant. &amp; L. <hi>Hen. Percy</hi> earle of Northumb. of
whom, the one he had banished, the other he had proclaimed
traitor not long before. These two came vnto him, &amp; the king
vpon short co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, vnderstanding what stiffe stomacks they
bare against him, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent not to demand that which he saw
he could not obtaine: &amp; thereupon agreed that he would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
his estate, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> condition that an honorable liuing might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4090:47"/>
be assigned him, &amp; life promised to 8. such persons as he would
name: the greatest number whom aduersity did not alter. This
was then both readily &amp; faithfully promised by the Archbish.
and the earle, &amp; afterward solemnly ratified by the duke. The
king ceased not to intreat submisly, &amp; promise largely, and (as
the nature is of men perplexed with feare) aboue his ability, &amp;
without measure, the earle incouraged him, and declared that
the Duke before he had obtained any aide, secured by his oath
the safety of the kings person. Then the king desired to talke
with the duke, which was likewise promised; &amp; so the archbish.
&amp; the earle departed, &amp; the king remoued to the castle of Flint,
about 8. miles distant from Chester, to which place the Duke
came to him. Here the coutenances &amp; words of both were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by them that were present: the king seemed abiect &amp; base:
the duke neither iusulting nor relenting, but comforting and
promising friendly. The king repeated many benefits &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that he had shewed: how in former time he had spared
the dukes owne life, &amp; lately his sonnes: in regard where of he
desired him, with such submisnes as was agreeable rather with
his necessity then his honour: that he would shew some pitie,
where he had receiued such pleasure: and permit him to enioy
his life, with such priuate maintenance as was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for his
estate. The duke put h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m in good comfort, promising him as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly,
that he would prouide for his safety: for which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himselfe to be solemnly thanked, &amp; thought it not much
to haue it accounted a great benefit. Indeed from that time the
king was kept safe and sure enough, from hindring any of the
dukes purposes, neither could it so easily haue bene discerned
what had beue best for him to do, as that this which he did was
the very worst: for the same night he was brought by the duke
and his army to Chester, and from thence secretly conueyed to
the Tower of London, there to be kept safe vntill the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was appointed shortly after to be holden.</p>
            <p>Thus the King yeal ded himselfe, the 20. day of August, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 47. day after the Dukes arriuall: so that his iournyes
considered, from Houldernesse in the North to London: from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4090:47"/>
thence to Bristowe, &amp; so into Wales, &amp; backe againe to Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
a man shal not easily trauaile ouer the land in shorter time
then he conquered it. So frienly was fortune vnto him, that hee
eyther found or made a readie passage through al hinderances
and lets: &amp; it seemed that he needed onely, to open his armes,
to meete and receiue her, as she offered her selfe vnto him. All
the Kings treasure &amp; Iewels, with his horses, and all his fardage
came to the Dukes hands; and many that were in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
were afterwards also despoyled by the souldiours of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland
and Wales.</p>
            <p>Some writers affirme, that the King did not yeald himselfe,
but was forelaied &amp; taken, as he was secretly passing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Flint
to Chester: but the authoritie of others who liued in that time,
eyther in the plaine viewe, or certaine intelligence of these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
who for their place could not but knowe, and for their
professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not but deliuer the very truth, hath drawne me
to follow their report: which I find also receiued by some late
wrighters, of as great deapth in iudgement and choice, as any
(without exception) that this age hath brought forth.</p>
            <p>As the King was carried towards London, certaine citizens
conspired to lay themselues in a wait by the way, and sodainly
to slay him; partly for priuate grieuances, &amp; partly for the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
that he had vsed towards the whole citty: but the Maior v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
intelligence preuented the practise, and rode forth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient company, to conduct him safely vnto the
tower. Shortly after the duke came to Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in solemn estate,
and sent forth summons in the Kings name, for a Parlament to
be holden at Westminster, the last day of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in the same
yeare: in the meane time he deliberated with his kindred and
kind friends, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the order of his proceedings. The duke
of Yorke (who a litle before had bene gouernour of the realm
for the king &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the chiefest directer of the duke) thoght
it best that <hi>K. Richard</hi> should both voluntarily resigne, &amp; also
solemnly be deposed, by consent of all the states of the realme:
for resignation only would be imputed to feare, and depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but if both concurre, and his desire be combined with his
desart, being willing to forsake that which he is adiudged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to forgo; then shall it appeare, that he neither is expelled his
kingdom by meere constraint, nor leaueth it without iust cause

apparelled in his royall to be, the diademe on his head, and the
scepter in his hand; and was placed amongst them in a chaire
of estate. Neuer was prince so gorgeous, with lesse glory and
greater griefe: to whom it was not disgrace sufficient, to lose
both the honour and ornaments of a king, but he must openly
to his greater scorne, renounce the one, and deliuer the other,
After a little pause and expectation, the king arose from his
seat, and spake to the assembly these words, or the very like in
effect.</p>
            <p>I assure my selfe that some at this present, and many hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
will accompt my case lamentable; either that I hane deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this deiection, if it be iust; or if it be wrongfull, that I could
not auoide it. Indeede I doe confesse, that many times I haue
shewed my selfe both lesse prouident, and lesse painfull for the
benefite of the common-wealth, then I should, or might, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to doe hereafter; and haue in many actions, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
the satisfying of my owne particular humour, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4090:48"/>
vpon natural dulnesse or set malice; but partly by abuse of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
councellers, partly by errour of my youthfull iudgement.
And now the remembrance of these ouer-sights, is so vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to no man, as to my selfe: and the rather because I haue no
meanes left, either to recompence the iniuries which I haue
done, or to testifie to the world my reformed affections, which
experience and stayednesse of yeares had already corrected,
&amp; would dayly haue framed to more perfection. But whether
all the imputations wherewith I am charged be true, either in
substance, or in such qualitie as they are layd; or whether being
true, they be so heinous, as to inforce these extremities, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any other Prince, especially in the heate of youth, and in
the space of two and twentie yeares (the time of my vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
raigne) doth, not sometimes either for aduantage, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
displeasure, in as deepe maner grieue some particular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;
I will not now examine: it helpeth not to vse defence,
neither booteth it to make complaint: there is left no place
for the one, nor pitie for the other: and therefore I referre it
to the iudgement of God, and your lesse distempered consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>I accuse no man, I blame no fortune, I complaine of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
I haue no pleasure in such vaine and needlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
and if I listed to haue stood vpon tearmes, I know I haue
great fauourers abroad, and some friends (I hope) at home,
who would haue beene ready, yea forward on my behalfe, to
set vp a bloudy and doubtfull warre: but I esteeme not my
dignitie at so high a price, as the hazard of so great valure,
the spilling of so much English bloud, and the spoile and
waste of so flourishing a Realme, as thereby might haue bene
occasioned. Therefore that the Common-wealth may rather
rise by my fall, then I stand by the ruine thereof. I willingly
yeeld to your desires; and am heere come to dispossesse my
selfe of all publike authority and title, and to make it free and
lawfull for you to create for your King, <hi>Henric</hi> Duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster
my cousin germaine, whom I know to be as worthie to

take that place as I see you willing to giue it to him.</p>
            <p>Then he read openly and distinctly the forme of his cession,
wherein he did declare, that he had discharged his subiectes,
from their oathes of fealtie and homage, and all other oathes
whatsoeuer; and of his owne will &amp; free motion, did abdicate,
the title, dignitie, and aucthoritie of a King: and rendred vp the
possession of the Realme, with the vse and title thereof, and all
the rights thereunto appertaining. To this the King subscribed
and was sworne: and then hee deliuered with his owne hands
the Crowne, the Septer, and the Robe to the Duke of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
wishing vnto him more happinesse therewith then had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
happened vnto himselfe. Then he did constiture the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop

to intimate and declare this his resignation to all the states of

Lastly, he gaue all his riches and goods, to the summe of thee
hundred thousand pounds in coyne, besides his Iewels &amp; plate,
for satisfaction of the iniuryes that hee had done, desiring the
Duke, &amp; al the rest that were present seuerally by their names,
not altogether to forget that he had beene their King, nor yet
too much to thinke vpon the same; but to retaine of him amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
remembrance; and in recompence of the ease that hee

wherof he was so possessed, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theneforth he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it, before any preferment in the world. All this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
and done by the King, with voyce and countenance so
agreeable to his present beauinesse, that there was no man to
vnmindefull of humane instabilitie, which was not in some
measure moued thereat: insomuch as a fewe secrete teares
melted from the eyes of many that were present, in whose

Vpon Munday next following the Parlament began at
Westminster; and the Archbishop of Yorke and the Bishop
of Hereford (the Kings Atturneys for this purpose) declared
openly to the states there assembled, the Kings voluntarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation;
and demaunded whether they would assent and
agree therevnto? the Barons of the realme by seuerall and
particular consent, the commons with one generall voyce,
did expreslye accept and admit the same. Then it was
thought meet that certaine defects and misdemeanures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matters of gouernment, should be obiected against
the King: for which he should be adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dged as vnworthy, as
he seemed vnwilling to reteine the kingdome. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
certaine articles were engrossed, and openly read: in
which was conteyned, how vnprofitable the King had bin to
the realme; how vniust and grieuous to the subiectes; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
both to his honour, and to his oath. The chiefest of
which articles are these that follow.</p>
            <p>1 FIrst that King <hi>Richard</hi> did wastefully spend the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the realme, and had giuen the possessions of the
crowne, to men vnworthy, by reason whereof, new charges
were dayly laide on the neckes of the poore comminaltie.</p>
            <p>2 Item, where diuers Lords as well spirituall as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
were appointed by the high court of Parlament, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
and treate of matters concerning the state of the
realme, and the commonwealth of the same, they being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
about the same commission, he with others of his affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
went about to impeache them of treason.</p>
            <p>3 Item, that by force and menace, he compelled the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of the realme at Shrewsburie, to condiscend to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for the destruction of the said Lords: Insomuch as he
began to raise warre, against <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Lancaster, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Earle of Arundell, <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Warwicke, &amp; other
Lords contrarie to his honor and promise.</p>
            <p>4 Item, that he caused his vnckle the Duke of Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4090:50"/>
to be arrested without lawe, and sent him to Calice, and
there without iudgement murthered him: and although the
Earle of Arundell vpon his arraignement, pleaded his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of pardon, he could not be heard, but was in most vile
and shamefull manner sodainly put to death.</p>
            <p>5 Item, he assembled certaine Lancashire and Cheshire
men, to the intent to make ware on the foresaid Lords,
and suffered them to robbe and spoile, without correction
or reproofe.</p>
            <p>6 Item, that although the king flatteringly and with great
dissimulation, made proclamation throughout the realme,
that the Lords aforenamed were not attached for any crime
of treason, but onely for extortions and oppressions doone
within the realme, yet he laide to them in the Parlament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and manifest treason.</p>
            <p>7 Item, he hath compelled diuers of the said Lords ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
by menace, to make great fines &amp; extreame paiments,
to their vtter vndooing: and notwithstanding his pardon to
to them graunted, he made them fine a new.</p>
            <p>8 Item, where diuers were appointed to common of the
estate of the realme; and the commonwealth of the same, the
king caused all the roules &amp; records to be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his promise made in parlament, to his ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dishonor.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e vncharitably commaunded, that no man vpon

the returne of <hi>Henrie</hi> now duke of Lancaster.</p>
            <p>10 Item, where the realme is houlden of God, and not of
the Pope, or any other Prince, the said King <hi>Richard,</hi> after he
had obteyned diuers acts of Parlament, for his owne peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
profit and pleasure, then he procured Bulles and extreame
censures from Rome, to compell all men streitly to keepe
the same, contrary to the honour and auncient priuiledges
of this realme.</p>
            <p>11 Item, although the Duke of Lancaster had done his
deuoyre against <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of Northfolke, in proofe of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4090:50"/>
his quarrell, yet the said king without reason or ground ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
him the realme for ten yeares, contrarie to all equitie.</p>
            <p>12 Item, before the Dukes departure, he vnder his broad
Scale, licenced him to make atturneys, to prosecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his causes: the said king after his departure, would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
none atturney to appeare for him, but did with his at his
pleasure.</p>
            <p>13 Item, the said king put out diuers Shiriffes lawfully
elected, and put in their roomes diuers others of his owne
minions, subuerting the lawe, contrarie to his oath and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>14 Item, he borowed great summes of money, and
bound himselfe vnder his letters patents for the repayment
of the same, and yet not one peny paide.</p>
            <p>15 Item, he taxed men at the will of him and his vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
counsaile, and the same treasure spent in folly, not paying
poore men for their vittaile and viand.</p>
            <p>16 Item, he said that the lawes of the realme were in his
head, and sometimes in his brest: by reason of which phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
opinion, he destroyed noble men, and impouerished
the poore commons.</p>
            <p>17 Item, the parlament setting and enacting diuers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
statutes, for the profit and aduancement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
he by his priuie friends and solicitours, caused to
be enacted, that no acte then enacted should be more preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
to him, then it was to his predecessours: thorow which
<hi>prouiso,</hi> he did often as he list, and not as the lawe ment.</p>
            <p>18 Item, for to serue his purpose, he would suffer the
Shiriffes of the shires, to remaine aboue one yeare or two in
their office.</p>
            <p>19 Item, at the summons of parlament, when the Knights
and Burgesses should be elect, and the election had fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
he put out diuers persons elected, and put in others in
their places, to serue his will and appetite.</p>
            <p>20 Item, he had priuie espials in euery shire, to heare
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4090:51"/>
who had of him any communication, and if he communed
of his lafciuious liuing, and outragious dooing, he straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
was apprehended, and made a grieuous fine.</p>
            <p>21 Item, the spiritualtie alledged against him, that he at
his going into Ireland, exacted many notable summes of
money, beside Plate and Iewels, without lawe ot custome,
contrary to his oath taken at his coronation.</p>
            <p>22 Item, when diuers Lordes and Iustices were sworne
to say the trueth, of diuers things to them committed in
charge, both for the honor of the realme, and profit of the
king, the said king so menaced them with sore threatnings,
that no man would or durst say the right.</p>
            <p>23 Item, that without the assent of the Nobilitie, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
the Iewels and Place, and treasure, ouer the sea into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
to the great impouerishing of the realme; and all the
good recordes of the common wealth against his extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he caused priuily to be embeaseled and caryed away.</p>
            <p>24 Item, in all leagues and letters to be concluded and
sent to the sea of Rome and other regions, his writing was
so subtill and darke, that no other Prince durst once beleeue
him, nor yet his owne subiects.</p>
            <p>25 Item, he most tyranouslie and vnprincely said, that
the liues and goods of all his subiects, were in the Princes
hands, and at his disposition.</p>
            <p>26 Item, that he contrarie to the great Charter of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
caused diuers lustie men to appeale diuers olde men,
vpon matters determinable at the common law, in the court
Marciall, because that in that court is no triall but onely by
battaile: whereby the sayd aged persons fearing the sequell
of the matter, submitted themselues to his mercie, whom he
fined and ransomed vnreasonably at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>27 Item, he craftily deuised certaine priuie oathes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to lawe, and caused diuers of his subiects, first to be
sworne to obserue the same, and after bound them in bands
for surer keeping the same, to the great vndooing of many
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4090:51"/>
honest men.</p>
            <p>28 Item, where the Chancellour according to lawe,
would in no wise graunt a prohibition to a certaine person,
the king graunted it vnto the same person vnder his priuie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eale, with great threatnings if it should be disobeyed.</p>
            <p>29 Item, he banished the Bishop of Canterburie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause or iudgement, and kept him in the Parlament
Chamber with men of armes.</p>
            <p>30 Item, the bishops goods he graunted to his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
vpon condition that he should maintaine all his statutes
made at Shrewsburie Anno. 21. and the statutes made Anno
22. at Couentree.</p>
            <p>31 Item, vppon the accusation of the Archbishop, the
king craftily perswaded the said Bishop to make no answer,
for he would be his warrant, and aduised him not to come
to the Parlament; and so without answere he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and exiled, and his goods seazed. Foure other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were laide, which particularlie did concerne the said
Archhishop, by whose dooing chiefly the king was vtterlie
vndone.</p>
            <p>Then was demaunded of the Nobilitie and commons of
the realme, what they iudged both of the trueth and desert
of these articles? who all agreed that the crimes were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and that king <hi>Richard</hi> was worthie for the same to be
deposed from his princely dignitie. The noble men gaue
their voyces, part corrupted by fauour, part awed by feare:
and the commons are commonly like a flocke of Cranes, as
one dooth flye, all will follow. Herevpon Commissioners
were appointed by both the houses; who pronounced sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of deposition against king <hi>Richard,</hi> in manner and
forme as followeth.</p>
            <p>In the name of God Amen. VVe <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of S. Asses,
<hi>I.</hi> Abbote of Glastenburie, <hi>Thom.</hi> Earle of Gloucester, <hi>Thom.</hi>
Lord Berkley, <hi>Thom. Erpinghame, Thom. Graye</hi> Knights:
<hi>Will. Thirninge</hi> Iustice, Commissioners for the matters here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4090:52"/>
specified, by the Lords spirituall and temporall of the realme
of England, and the Commons of the said realme, representing
all the states of the saide Kingdome, specially deputed, sitting in
seate of iudgement, and considering the manifold periuries, and
cruelties, and many other crimes and offerces by <hi>Richard</hi> late
King of the saide realme, committed and doone, contrarie to
good gouernement in the realmes and dominions aforesaide, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his reigne: also considering the articles which
were openly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>bibited and red before the said states, which were
so publicke, notorious, manifest, and famous, that they could nor
can by no auoydance and shift be concealed: also considering the
confession of the saide King, acknowledging and reputing and
truly vpon his certaine knowledge iudging himselfe to haue
been and to be altogether insufficient and vnskilfull, for the rule
and gouernment of the realmes and Dominions aforesaid and of
any parts of them, and not vnworthy to be deposed, for the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
demerites, by the said <hi>Richard</hi> first acknowledged, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
by his will and mandate, before the said states publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to them opened and declared in the English tongue. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these and other matters which were done concerning the same
busines, before the said States and vs, by the diligent place, name
and authority to vs in this part committed, in aboundance and
for a cautele we pronounce, decree and declare, the saide <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
to haue beene and to be vnprofitable and vnable, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
insufficient and vnworthie for the rule and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said realmes, and of the dominions, rights and parts
of them: and in regarde and respect of the premises, worthily to
be deposed from all kinglie dignitie and honour (if any such dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and honour remaineth in him) and for the like cautele wee
doe depose him by our sentence definitiue in this writing: inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
from hencefoorth expressely, all and singular Lords, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
Bishops, Prelates, Dukes, Marquesses and Earles, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
Knights, Vassalles, and all other persons whatsoeuer, of the
saide realmes and dominions, and other places to the said realmes
and dominions appertaining, the subiects and liege people of the
same, and euery of them, that from henceforth none obey, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4090:52"/>
to obey the foresaid <hi>Richard,</hi> as king or Lord of the realmes
and dominions aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Then the same Commissioners were by the consent and
suffrages of both houses, constituted procurators, ioyntlye
and seuerally for all the states of the realme; to resigne and
surrender vnto King <hi>Richard,</hi> for them and all other homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the realme, all the homages and fealties which were
both due and doone vnto him; as King and Soueraigne, and
also to declare vnto him al the premises, concerning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Now <hi>Henrie</hi> Duke of Lancaster, that he might be
reputed, or reported at the least, not to attaine the kingdom
by intrusion and wrong, was counsailed by his friends, to
pretend some lawfull challenge and claime therevnto: and
being in power, it was no sooner aduised what was to
bee doone, but it was presently deuised how to doe it. So a
title was drawne from <hi>Edmund,</hi> sonne to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the
third, whom they surnamed Crowch backe: affirming that
he was the eldest sonne of King <hi>Henrie,</hi> and that for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie,
he was put from his right of succession in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
which was for that cause giuen to his yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
King <hi>Edward</hi> the third: to this <hi>Edmund</hi> the Duke was
next of bloud by his mother <hi>Blanche,</hi> sole daughter and
heyre to <hi>Henrie</hi> the first Duke of Lancaster, and sonne to the
saide <hi>Edmund.</hi> This cunning conceit was perceiued of all
men; but seeming not to perceiue it, was a point of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in some, and of obedience in the rest: therfore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of England being then thought vacant, both by the
resignation, and also by the deposition of King <hi>Richard:</hi>
Duke <hi>Henrie</hi> arose from his seate, and standing in the view
of the Lords, crossed himselfe on the forehead, and on the
brest, and spake as followeth.</p>
            <p>In the name of God Amen: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>owne, with all the appurtenances,

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of the bloud royall, comming
from that good Lord K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, and through the right
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4090:53"/>
that God of this grace hath sent mee, with the helpe of my kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and of my friendes, to recouer the same: Which kingdome
was in point to be vndoone, for default of good gouernment and
due iustice.</p>
            <p>After these wordes, it was demaunded in both houses,
of the Nobility &amp; of the commons which were assembled,
whether they did consent that the Duke should raigne? Who
all with one voyce, acknowledged and accepted him for
their King: then the Archbishop of Canterbury tooke him
by the hand, and placed him in the throane of estate, the
Archbishoppe of Yorke assisting him, and all the assemblie
testifying their owne ioy, and wishing his. Then the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
made an oration, and tooke for his theame, this place
of Scripture: <hi>See; this is the man whom I spake to thee of, this
same shall raigne ouer my people.</hi> 1. Reg. 9. 17. After all this
he was proclaimed King of England, and of Fraunce, and
Lord of Ireland: and the common people which is voide of
cares, not searching into sequels, but without difference of
right or wrong inclinable to follow those that are mighty,
with shoutes and clamours gaue their applause, not all vpon
iudgement, or faithfull meaning, but most onely vpon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
custome to flatter the Prince whatsoeuer he be. Yet
least the heate of this humour should allay by delay, it was
foorthwith proclaimed in the great Hall, that vpon the 13.
day of September next ensuing, the Coronation of the King
should be celebrated at Westminster. These matters being
thus dispatched, the King proclaimed, arose from his seate,
and went to White Hall: where he spent the rest of the day
in royall feasting, and all other complementes of ioy: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
there appeared in him no token of statelynesse
or pride, nor any change in so great a change.</p>
            <p>Vpon Wednesday next following, the procurators, before
mentioned, went to the presence of King Richard, being
within the Tower; and declared vnto him the admission
of his resignation, and also the order and forme of his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4090:53"/>
and in the name of all the states of the realme, did
surrender the homage and fealty which had been due vnto
him; so that no man from thence foorth would beare to
him faith and obedience, as to their King The King answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he nothing reguarded these titulare circumstances,
but contented himselfe with hope, that his cousen would be
gracious Lord, and good friend vnto him.</p>
            <p>So vpon the 13. day of October, which was the day of
the translation of Edward the Confessour, the Duke was
with all accustomed solemnities, by the Archbishoppe of
Canterbury, sacred, annointed and Crowned King at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,
by the name of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: vpon the
very same day, wherein the yeere before, he had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Realme. Hee was annoynted with an oyle,
which a certaine religious man gaue vnto <hi>Henry</hi> the first
Duke of Lancaster (Grandfather to the King by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
side) when he serued in the warres of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, beyond the seas; together with this Prophesie,
that the Kinges which should be annoynted therewith,
should bee the champions of the Church. Duke <hi>Henry</hi>
deliuered this oyle in a golden violl to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the
eldest sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third; who locked vp the
same in a barred chest within the Tower, with intent to be
annoynted therewith, when he should bee crowned King:
but the Prince dying before his Father, it remained there,
eyther not remembred, or not regarded, vntill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
yeere; wherein the King, being vpon his voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ireland, and making diligent search for the iewels and
monumentes of his progenitours, found this Violl and
Prophesie: and vnderstanding the secret, was desirous
to be anoynted againe with that oyle: but the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Canterbury perswaded him, that both the fact
was vnlawfull, and the precedent vnseene, that a King
should bee anoynted twice: whereupon he brake of that
purpose, and tooke the Violl with him into Ireland: and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4090:54"/>
when hee yeelded himselfe at Flint, the Archbishoppe of
Canterburye demaunded it of him agayne and dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
and reserue the same, vntill the coronation of
King <hi>Henrie;</hi> who was the first King of this realme, that was
anoynted therewith.</p>
            <p>I am not purposed to discourse, eyther of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye,
or of the certaintye of these prophesies: but wee
may easily obserue, that the greatest part of them, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
altogether fayled, or were fulfilled in another sence,
then as they were commonly construed and taken. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the raigne of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, execution by
fire was first put in practise within this Realme, for
controuersies in poyntes of religion: in any other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarye
mattter, hee did as much make the Church
champion, as shew himselfe a champion of the Church:
but afterwardes his successours were entytuled <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the fayth:</hi> and howe in action they veryfied the
same, I referre to remembraunce and reporte of later
times.</p>
            <p>Now it had beene considered, that the tytle which
was deriued to King <hi>Henrie,</hi> from <hi>Edmund,</hi> whome
they surnamed Crouchbacke, would bee taken but for
a blynde and idle iest: for that it was notorious that the
sayd <hi>Edmund,</hi> was neyther eldest sonne to King <hi>Henry</hi>
the thyrd (as it was plainely declared by an acte of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament)
nor yet a misshapen and deformed person: but
a goodly Gentleman, and valiant commaunder in the
field, and so fauoured of the King his Father, that hee
gaue him both the heritages and honours of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and of <hi>Iohn</hi> Barron of Monmuthe, who to theyr
owne ruine and destruction, had desplaied seditious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
against the King. And further to aduaunce him to
the marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> Queene of Nauerne, he created him
the first Earle of Lancaster, and gaue vnto him the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4090:54"/>
Castle, and towne of Lancaster, with the Forrestes of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resdale,
Lounsdale, Newcastle beneath Linne, the Manner,
Castle and Forrest of Pickering, the Manner of Scaleby,
the towne of Gomecester, of Huntendone, &amp;c. with many
large priuiledges, and high titles of homour.</p>
            <p>Therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> vpon the day of his Coronation,
caused to be proclaimed, that he claymed the Kingdome of
England, first by right of conquest: Secondly because King
<hi>Richard</hi> had resigned his estate, and designed him for his
successour: Lastly, because he was of the bloud royall, and
next heyre male vnto King <hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haeres malus</hi> indeed (quoth <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earle of
March vnto his secret friends) and so is the Pirate to the
Marchant, when hee despoyleth him of all that hee hath.
This <hi>Edmund</hi> was sonne to <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> who was not
long before slaine in Ireland, and had been openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
heyre apparent to the Crowne, in case King <hi>Richard</hi>
should dye without issue; as descended by his Mother <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
from Lionell Duke of Clarence, who was elder brother
to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Lancaster, King <hi>Henries</hi> Father: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sayd <hi>Edmund</hi> thought himselfe, and indeed was,
neerer heyre male to the succession of the Crowne, then
he that by colour of right clayming it, carried it by dynt
of force.</p>
            <p>But such was the condition of the tyme, that hee
supposed it was vaine, for him to stirre, where King <hi>Richard</hi>
could not stand: Whereupon he dessembled, eyther that
he saw his wrong, or that hee regarde it; and chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suppresse his title for a time, then by vntimely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himselfe, to haue it oppressed and depressed for euer:
to this ende hee withdrewe himselfe farre from London,
to his Lordshippe of Wigmore, in the West partes of the
realme: and there setled himselfe to a priuate and close life:
Idlenes and vacancy from publike affaires, he accompted a
vertue, and a deepe point of wisedome to meddle with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4090:55"/>
nothing, whereof no man was chargeable to yeelde a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.
In reuenues he was meane, in apparell moderate,
in company and traine not excessiue, (yet in all these honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and according to his degree) so that they which estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men by outward appearance only, could see in him no
great shew, eyther of wit and courage in his minde to be
feared, or of wealth and honour in his estate to be enuyed.
And thus whilest a greater enemy was feared, he passed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded;
making himselfe safe by contempt, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was so daungerous as a good opinion; and raking vp
those coales in obscuritie for a time, which shortly after set
all the realme on fire.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henrie</hi> presently after his coronation, created his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
sonne Lord <hi>Henrie,</hi> being then about xiii. yeares of age,
Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornewall, and Earle of Chester,
and soone after he created him also Duke of Aquitaine. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it was enacted, by consent of all the states of the
realme, assembled together in the Parlament, that the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the Crownes and Realmes of England and of
Fraunce, aud of all the dominions to them apperteyning,
should be vnited and remaine in the person of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
and in the heires of his body lawfully begotten: and
that Prince <hi>Henrie</hi> his eldest sonne, should be his heyre
apparant, and successour in the premisses: and if he should
dye without lawfull issue, then they were entayled to his
other sonnes successiuely in order, and to the heyres of their
bodyes lawfully begotten.</p>
            <p>The inheritance of the Kingdome being in this sorte set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in King <hi>Henrie</hi> and in his line, it was mooued in the
Parlament what should be doone with King <hi>Richard.</hi> The
Bishop of Caerliel, who was a man learned and wise, and
one that alwayes vsed both libertie and constancie in a
good cause; in his secret iudgement did neuer giue allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to these proceedings: yet dissembled his dislike, vntill
he might to some purpose declare it: therefore now being
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4090:55"/>
in place to be heard of all, and by order of the house) to be
interrupred by none, he rose vp and with a bould and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
spirit, vttered his minde as followeth.</p>
            <p>This question (right Honourable Lordes) concerneth
a matter of great consequence and weight: the determining
whereof will assuredly procure, eyther safe quiet, or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
disturbance, both to our particular consciences, and
also to the common state. Therefore before you resolue
vppon it, I pray you call to your considerations these two
things: First, whether King <hi>Richard</hi> be sufficiently depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
or no: Secondly, whether King <hi>Henrie</hi> be with good
iudgement, or iustice chosen in his place. For the first point
we are first to examine, whether a king, being lawfully and
fully instituted by any iust title, may vppon imputation, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of negligence, or of tyrannie, be deposed by his subiects:
Secondly, what King <hi>Richard</hi> hath omitted in the one, or
committed in the other, for which he should deserue so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
iudgement. I will not speake what may be doone in
a popular state, or in a consular; in which although one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the name and honour of a Prince, yet he hath not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power of Maiestie; but in the one, the people haue
the highest empire; in the other, the Nobilitie, and chiefe
men of estate; in neyther, the Prince. Of the first sorte
was the common wealth of the Lacedaemonians, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the forme of gouernement which <hi>Licurgus</hi> framed, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
fined, oftentimes fettered their Kings, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
condemned them to death: such were also in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
time, the petit Kings of euery Citie in Fraunce; who
were many times arreigned vppon life and death, and (as
<hi>Ambiorix</hi> Prince of the <hi>Leodienses</hi> confessed) had no
greater power ouer the people, then the people had ouer
them. Of the second condition were the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
at the first;<note place="margin">Tranquil in caligula. Tacitus, in proaemio.</note> of whome some, namely <hi>Nero</hi> and
<hi>Maximinus</hi> were openly condemned, others were sodainlie
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4090:56"/>
surprised by iudgement, and authoritye of the Senate:
and such are nowe the Emperours of Germany, whom
the other Princes by their Aristocraticall power, doe not
onely restrayne, but sometimes also remooue from
theyr imperiall state: such are also the Kinges of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,
and Sweueland, who are many times by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye
deiected, eyther into pryson, or into exile: such
likewise are the Dukes of Venice, and of some other free
states in Italy: and the chiefest cause for which <hi>Lewes</hi>
Earle of Flanders was lately expelled from his place, was
for drawing to himselfe cognisance in matters of life and
death, which high power neuer pertayned to his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>In these and such like gouernmentes, the Prince hath
not regall rightes, but is himselfe subiect to that power
which is greater then his, whether it be in the Nobility or in
the common people. But if the Soueraigne Maiesty be in the
Prince, as it was in the three first Empires, and in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of Iudea and Israell; and is now in the kingdomes of
England, Fraunce, Spaine, Scotland, Muscouia, Turky, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,
Persia, Aethiopia, and almost all the Kingdomes of
Asia and Africke: although for his vices he bee vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the subiectes, yea hurtfull, yea intollerable: yet can
they lawfully neyther harme his person, nor hazard his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
whether by iudgement, or els by force: for neyther
one, nor all Magistrates haue any authority ouer the Prince,
from whome all authority is deriued, and whose onely
presence doeth silence, and suspend all inferiour iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and power. As for force, what subiecte can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or assist, or counsaile, or violence against hys
Prince, and not incurre the high and heynous crime of
treason?</p>
            <p>It is a common saying, thought is free: free indeede
from punishment of secular lawes, except by worde or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4090:56"/>
deed it breake foorth into action: Yet the secret thoughts
against the sacred maiesty of a Prince, without attempt,
without endeuour, haue beene adiudged worthy of death:
and some who in auriculer confession, haue discouered their
treacherous deuises against the person of their Prince, haue
afterwardes beene executed for the same. All lawes doe
exempt a madde man from punishment: because theyr
actions are not gouerned by theyr will and purpose: and
the will of man being set aside, all his doings are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
neyther can the body offend without a corrupt
or erronious minde: yet if a mad man draw hys sword vpon
his King, it hath bin adiudged to deserue death. And least
any man should surmise that Princes, for the maintenance
of theyr owne safety and soueraignety, are the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of these iudgementes; let vs a little consider the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
and preceptes of holy Scripture. <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi>
King of Assiria wasted all Palestine with fire and swoord,
oppugned Hierusalem a long time, and at the last expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it: slue the King: burnt the Temple: tooke away
the holy vesselles and treasure: the rest hee permitted to
the cruelty and spoyle of his vnmercifull soldiers: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
all places with rape and slaughter, and ruinated to the
ground that flourishing Citty: after the glut of this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
butchery, the people which remayned, he led Captiue
into Chaldaea: and there erected his golden Image, and
commaunded that they which refused to worship it, should
bee cast into a fierye furnace.</p>
            <p>What crueltye, what iniustice, what impiety is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to this? and yet God calleth <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi>

            <p>The law of God commaundeth, that the Childe should
be put to death, for any contumely done vnto the parents:
but what if the Father be a robber? if a murtherer? if for all
excesse of villanyes, odious and execrable both to God and
man? surely he deserueth the highest degree of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet must not the Sonne lift vp his hand against
him, for no offence is so great as to be punished by parricide:
but our country is dearer vnto vs then our parentes: and

            <p>But alas good king <hi>Richard,</hi> what such cruelty? what
such impiety hath he euer committed? examine rightly those
imputations which are layde against him, without any
false circumstance of aggrauation, and you shall finde
nothing obiected, eyther of any truth, or of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It may bee that many errours and ouersightes haue
escaped him, yet none so grieuous to be termed tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
as proceeding rather from vnexperienced ignorance,
or corrupt counsaile, then from any naturall and wilfull
mallice. Oh, howe shall the world bee pestered with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,
if subiectes may rebell vppon euery pretence of
tyranny? howe many good Princes shall daylye bee
suppressed by those, by whome they ought to bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported?
if they leauy a subsedy, or any other texati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it shall be claymed oppression: if they put any to death
for trayterous attemptes against theyr persons, it shall be
exclaymed cruelty: if they doe any thing against the
lust and liking of the people, it shall bee proclaymed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
            <p>But let it be, that without authority in vs, or desert in
him, king <hi>Richard</hi> must be deposed: yet what right had the
Duke of Lancaster to the Crowne? or what reason haue
wee without his right to giue it to him? if hee make title as
heyre vnto king <hi>Richard,</hi> then must he yet stay vntill king
<hi>Richards</hi> death; for no man can succeed as heyre to one that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4090:58"/>
liueth. But it is well knowne to all men, who are not eyther
wilfully blinde or grosely ignorant, that there are some now
aliue, lineally descended from Lionell Duke of Clarence,
whose ofspring was by iudgement of the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
holden the viii. yeere of the raigne of King <hi>Richard,</hi>
declared next successour to the Crowne, in case King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
should dye without issue. Concerning the tytle from
<hi>Edmund Crouchbacke,</hi> I will passe it ouer, seeing the authors
thereof are become ashamed of so absurde abuse, both of
theyr owne knowledge, and our credulity, and therefore all
the clayme is now made, by right of conquest; by the cessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and graunt of King <hi>Richard;</hi> and by the generall consent
of all the people. It is a bad wooll that can take no colour:
but what conquest can a subiecte pretend against his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
where the warre is insurrection, and the victory high
and heynous treason? as for the resignation which king <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
made, being a pent prisoner for the same cause; it is
an acte exacted by force: and therefore of no force and
validity to binde him: and seeing that by the lawes of this
land, the king alone cannot alienate, the auncient iewels
and ornaments pertaining to the Crowne, surely hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
giue away the Crowne it selfe, and therewithall the
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Neyther haue we any custome, that the people at pleasure
should electe theyr king: but they are alwayes bound vnto
him, who by right of bloud is next successour, much lesse
can they confirme and make good that title, which is before
by violence vsurped: for nothing can then be freely doone,
when liberty is once restrained by feare. So did <hi>Scilla</hi> by
terrour of his legions, obtayne the lawe of <hi>Velleia</hi> to bee
made, whereby hee was created dictator for fourescore
yeeres: and by like impression of feare, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused the law
<hi>Seruia</hi> to be promulged, by which he was made perpetuall
dictator: but both these lawes were afterwardes adiudged
void. As for the deposing of king. <hi>Edward</hi> the 2. is no more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4090:59"/>
to be vrged, then the poysoning of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of any other good and lawfull Prince: we must liue
according to lawes, and not to examples: and yet the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was not then taken from the lawfull successour. But if
we looke backe to times lately past, we shall finde that these
titles were more stronge in King <hi>Stephen,</hi> then they are
in the Duke of Lancaster: for king <hi>Henry</hi> the first being at
large liberty, neyther restrained in body, nor constrained in
minde, had appointed him to succeed: (as it was vppon
good credite, certainly affirmed.) The people assented to
this designement; and thereupon without feare, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
force, he was anoynted King, and obtained full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the realme. Yet <hi>Henry</hi> (Sonne of the Earle of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iowe</hi>)
hauing a neerer right by his mother to the Crowne,
(notwithstanding his father was a stranger &amp; himselfe borne
beyond the seas) raysed such rough warres vppon King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
that there was noe end of spoyling the goods and spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the bloud of the vnhappy people, besides the ruynes
and deformities of many Citties and holdes; vntill his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inheritance was to him assured. It terrifieth me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how many florishing Empires, and Kingdomes haue bin
by meanes of such contentions eyther torne in peeces with
detestiue diuision, or subdued to forren Princes, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of assistaunce and ayde: and I neede not repeate howe
sore this realme hath heertofore beene shaken with these
seuerall mischieues: and yet neyther the examples of other
countries nor the miseries of our own, are sufficient to make
vs to beware.</p>
            <p>O English men, worse bewitched then the foolish Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians;
our vnstayed mindes and restlesse resolutions, doe
nothing els but hunt after our owne harmes: no people
haue more hatred abroad and none lesse quiet at home: in
other countries the swoord of inuasion hath been shaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs: in our owne land, the fire of insurrection hath bin
kindled amongs vs: &amp; what are these innouasions, but whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4090:59"/>
to sharpen the one, and bellowes to blowe vp the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>Certainely I feare that the same will happen vnto vs
which <hi>Aesope</hi> fableth to haue been fallen vnto the Frogges;
who beeing desirous to haue a King, a beame was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto them: the first fall whereof did put them in some
feare, but when they saw it lye still in the streame, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
thereon with great contempt, and desired a king of
quicker courage: then was sent vnto them a Storke, which
stalking among them with stately steps, continually deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them. The mildenesse of king <hi>Richard</hi> hath bred in vs this
scorne, interpreting it to be cowardise and dulnes of nature:
the next heyre is likewise reiected: I will not say that wyth
greater courage we shall finde greater cruelty; but if eyther
of these shall heerafter be able to set vp theyr side, and bring
the matter to tryall by armes, I do assuredly say, that which
part soeuer shall carry the fortune of the field, the people
both wayes must goe to wracke. And thus haue I declared
my minde concerning this question, in more wordes then
your wisedome, yet fewer then the weight of the cause doth
require: and doe boldly conclude, that wee haue neyther
power nor policy, eyther to depose king <hi>Richard,</hi> or to elect
Duke <hi>Henrie</hi> in his place; that king <hi>Richard</hi> remaineth still
our Soueraigne Prince, and therefore it is not lawfull for vs
to giue iudgement vpon him; that the Duke whom you call
king, hath more offended against the king and the relame,
then the king hath done, eyther against him or vs; for being
banished the realme for ten yeeres by the king and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
(amongst whome his owne Father was chiefe) and
sworne not to returne againe without speciall lycense:
he hath not onely violated his oath, but with impious armes
disturbed the quiet of the land, and dispossessed the Kyng
from his royall estate, and now demaundeth iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his person, without offence proued, or defence heard:
if this iniury, and this periury doth nothing moue vs, yet let
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4090:60"/>
both our priuate and common dangers somwhat withdraw
vs from these violent proceedings.</p>
            <p>This speach was diuerslie taken, as men were diuersly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
betweene feare, hope, and shame: yet the most parte
did make shew for king <hi>Henrie,</hi> and therevpon the Bishop
was presently attached by the Earle Marshall, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to prison in the Abbey of S. Albones. Whose counsaile
and coniecture then contemned, was afterwardes better
thought vpon; partly in the life time of king <hi>Henrie,</hi> during
whose raigne, almost no yeare passed without great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and executions: but more especially in the times succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
when within the space of xxxvi. yeares, twelue set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
vpon this quarrell were fought within the realme by
English men only: and more then foure score Princes of the
royall bloud slaine one by another.</p>
            <p>Then it was concluded, that king <hi>Richard</hi> should be kept
in a large prison, with all manner of Princely maintenance:
and if any persons should conspire, to reare warre for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance,
that he should be the first man who should suffer
death for that attempt. Then the Actes of the Parlament
holden at Westminster, in the xi. yeare of King <hi>Richard,</hi> were
reuiued; and the Parlament houlden the xxi. yeare of king
<hi>Richard</hi> was wholy repealed: and they who were attainted
by that Parlament, were restored againe to their fame and
honour, and to their landes without suing lyuerie, and to
such goods whereof the King was not answered; except the
rents and issues which had beene receiued out of their lands
in the meane time. Herevpon <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Warwicke
was deliuered out of prison, and the Earle of Arundelles
sonne recouered his inheritance: many others also that were
banished or imprisoned by King <hi>Richard,</hi> were then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
restored againe, to their Countrie, libertie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
            <p>It was further prouided, that none of those which came
in ayde of King <hi>Henrie</hi> against King <hi>Richard,</hi> should for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4090:60"/>
that cause be impeached or troubled. Also the King gaue
to the Earle of Westmerland the Countie of Richmond;
and to the Earle of Northumberland he gaue the Ile of Man,
to be houlden of him by the seruice of bearing the sworde,
wherewith he entred into England. Diuers other of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
he aduaunced to offices of highest place and charge,
some vpon iudgement and for desert, but most part to win
fauour, and perhappes proiecting a plot for friends, if times
should change: for in many actions men take more care
to preuent reuenge, then to leade an innocent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
life.</p>
            <p>It was further agreed, that the procurers of the death and
murther of <hi>Thomas</hi> late Duke of Gloucester, should be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out and seuerelie punished. And iudgement was giuen
against the appellants of the Earle of Warwicke and the
Earle of Arundell, that the Dukes of Aumerle, Sussex, and
Exceter, the Marquesse of Dorset, and the Earle of Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
who were present, should loose their degree of honour
for them and their heyres: that they should likewise loose all
the Castles, Mannors, Lordshippes, &amp;c. then in their hands
which sometimes apperteined to those whom they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,
and that all the letters patents and charters which they
had concerning the same, should be surrendred into the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie,
and there be cancelled: that for all other their Castles,
Mannors, Lordships, possessions, and liberties, they should be
at the grace and mercie of the King: that they should giue
no liueries, nor keepe any retinue of men, but onely such
officers as were meerelie necessarie for their degree: that if
any of them should adhere to <hi>Richard</hi> the deposed King, in
giuing him ayde or encouragement, against the iudgement
of his deposition, then he should incurre the paines and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures
of high treason. And because it was a clamorous
complaint among the common people, that many officers
had committed greeuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s extoruons and wrongs, eyther by

               </gap>itiuence of these Lords:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4090:61"/>
First those officers were remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ued, and that corruption ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away with integritie, which briberie h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d wrought, in
placing (for money) men of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d qualitie, in high degrees of
office and seruice: then proclamations were made, that if
any man had been oppressed by these Lords, or by any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
vnder them, he should prooue his complaint, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
recompence. It was made a question whether it was
not meete that these noble men should be put to death: the
importunitie of the people, and the perswasion of many great
men drew that way, but policie was against it, and especially
the opinion of clemencie, which seemed needfull to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a new risen state.</p>
            <p>In this parlament also the Lorde <hi>Fitzwater</hi> appealed the
sayd Duke of Aumerle, sonne to the Duke of Yorke, vpon
points of high treason: likewise the Lord <hi>Morley</hi> appealed
<hi>Iohn Montacute</hi> Earle of Salisburie, and moe then twentie
other appeilants waged battaile; but the king purposing to
laye the foundation of his realme by fauour and not by force,
gaue pardon and restitution alike to all, vppon sureties and
band for their alleageance: and in a sweet and moderate ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he admonished, and as it were intreated the one part,
that ould griefes and grudges should not be renued, but bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
together with the memorie of former times; wherein
men were forced to doe many things against their mindes:
the other part he desired to be more regardfull of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
afterward, and for the time past, rather to forget that euer
they were in fault, then to remember that they were pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
No punishment was laide vppon any, saue onely the
Earle of Salisburie and the Lord Morley, who had beene in
especiall grace and fauour with King <hi>Richard:</hi> these two
were committed to prison, but at the sute of their friends
they were soone released: the rest the King receiued freelye
to fauour, but most especially the Duke of Aumerle, and the
Duke of Excester, Lord Gouernour of Calice. The Duke of
Aumerle was cousen germane to both the kings: <hi>Iohn Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:4090:61"/>
Duke of Exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, was halfe brother to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and
brother in lawe to King <hi>Henrie;</hi> whose sister, the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
he had taken to wise. The greatest matter that was
enforced against them, was their loyaltie vnto King <hi>Richard:</hi>
(a grieuous crime among rebels) because they did not onlie
stomacke and storme at his deiection, but stirre also more
then others, and assaye to raise forces on his behalfe. The
Dukes bouldly confessed the accusation, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
vnfortunately faithfull to King <hi>Richard:</hi> but as those
who once are false, doe seldome afterwards prooue soundly
firme, so they that haue shewed themselues true to one prince
may the better be trusted by any other. The King did rather
admit this as a defence, then remit it as a fault: affirming,
that such examples were not to be misliked of Princes: so he
entred with them into great termes of friendship, and put
them in place neerest his person, endeauouring by courtesie
and liberalitie, to make them fast and faithful vnto him: this
fact was diuerslie enterpreted, according to mens seueral dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
some admiring the kings moderation, others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
and disallowing his confidence; and indeed although
these meanes haue to this purpose preuailed with some, yet
the common course may mooue vs commonly to coniecture,
that there is little assurance in reconciled enemies: whose
affections (for the most part) are like vnto Glasse, which
beeing once cracked, can neuer bee made otherwise then
crazed and vnsound.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, to qualifie all preiudice and hard opinion
which other princes might chaunce to conceiue, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
dispatched Embassadours to diuers countries neere vnto
him, to make it knowne by what title, and by what fauour
and desire of all the people he atteyned the kingdome. To
the court of Rome hee sent <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4090:62"/>

                  </gap>:</hi> and into Almaine he sent the Bishop of Bangor, and
certaine other. Most of these Princes (as in a matter which
little concerned eyther their honour or their harme) seemed
eyther not to regarde what was doone, or easely to bee
perswaded that all was doone well. But <hi>Charles</hi> King of
Fraunce, was so distempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed at this dishonourable dealing
with his sonne in lawe King <hi>Richard,</hi> that by violence of his
passion, he fell into his oulde panges of phrensie: and at the
last by helpe of Phisicke returning to the sobrietie of his
sences, he purposed to make sharpe warre vpon that disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
people (as he termed them) for this iniurie against their
lawfull and harmlesse Prince. Many noble men of Fraunce
shewed themselues verye forwarde to enter into the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
but especially the Earle of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
King <hi>Richards</hi> halfe Sister. So letters of defiance were
sent into England, and great preparation was made for the
warre.</p>
            <p>Likewise the newes of these nouelties much abashed
the Aquitanes (who were at that time vnder the English
subiection) and plunged their thoughts in great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Some were greiued at the infamous blemish of the
English nation, who had disteyned their honour with the
spot of such disloyall dealing: others feared the spoyle of
their goods, and oppression of their liberties by the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
against whose violence they suspected that the realme
of England, beeing distracted into ciuill factions, eyther
would not attend, or should not be able to beare them out:
but the Citizens of Burdeaux were chiefely anguished in
respect of King <hi>Richard,</hi> partlie fretting at his iniurie, and
partlie lamenting his infortunitie; because he was borne
and brought vppe within theyr Cittie. And thus in the
violence, some of they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> anger, some of theyr griefe, and

               </gap> to the
rest: whether one of them did perswade another to enter
into the action, or whether all were induced by the same
vnconstant disposition and light account of faith: which
being once falsed to King <hi>Richard,</hi> was afterwardes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
euery light discontentment, lyttle respected to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
but concerning these matters, the most current report
is this.</p>
            <p>There was at that time an Abbot of Westminster, one
that applyed his studies, not as the most part, to cloake
idlenesse and slouth vnder the glorious tytle of religion, but
to enable himselfe for counsaile and direction in publique
affayres: who for the generall opinion of his wisedome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4090:64"/>
and integritie, was in good fauour and credit with King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
and did accompany him in his last voyage into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>This Abbot called to his remembrance, a speach which
hee heard once fall from King <hi>Henrie,</hi> when hee was but
Earle of Derbie, and not yet come to any great stayednesse,
eyther in yeares or iudgement; that Princes had too little,
and religious men too much.</p>
            <p>At that time the riches of the church were growne so
great, that many began to looke vpon them with an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eye; but least couetousnesse should shew it selfe with
open face, policie was pretended, and the excesse thought
daungerous, both to the King and also to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the

            <p>Heerevpon many billes had beene put vppe in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments
houlden in the reigne of King <hi>Richard,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
might be made to represse the increase of religious pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions:
namely, that inquisition and redresse might be had
against such religious persons, as vnder the licence to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
ten pounds yearlie, did purchase foure score, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds: and also against such religious persons as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their villaines, to take to their wiues free women inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
whereby the landes came to those religious mens
hands: yea it was mooued in open Parlament, that the
king should seaze into his hands, all the temporall liuings
of religious houses, as beeing rather a burthen then a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
vnto religion.</p>
            <p>Vppon these and the like petitions, the Archbishop of
Canterburie, and the Archbishop of Yorke, for themselues
and the Cleargie of their Prouinces; were oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to make their solemne protestations in open Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
that if any thing were attempted in restraint of
the libertie of the Church, they would in no wise assent,
but vtterlie withstand the same: the which their protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4090:64"/>
they required to be enrouled.</p>
            <p>So partly vpon loue to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and partly vpon
feare, least King <hi>Henry</hi> would bee as ready to inuade,
as hee was to enueigh against the richesse of religious
houses: this Abbot was the first man that blew the coales,
and put fewell to the fire of this confederacy. And first
hee obserued a farre off, then hee searched more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and narrowly (and yet warely too) howe the myndes
of certaine Noble men were affected, or rather infected
agaynst King <hi>Henrie;</hi> tempering his speeches in such
sorte, that if matters sorted to his minde, hee myght
take them vpon him, if his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ses were crossed, he might
cleerely disclayme them: at last hee inuited to his house
vppon a daye, in Michaelmas terme, those whome hee
had sounded to bee moste sound for his purpose: the
chiefe of whome were such as in the Parlament before
had in some sorte beene touched in reputation, although
by pardon and reconcilement the harme did seeme to
bee closed vp: theyr names were <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Duke of
Exceter, of whome: mention hath beene made before,
<hi>Thomas Holland</hi> his brothers Sonne, Duke of Surrey, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Duke of Aumerle, <hi>Iohn Montacute</hi> Earle of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> Earle of Glocester, <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishoppe of
Caerliele, Sir <hi>Thomas Biunt,</hi> and <hi>Magdalen</hi> one of King
<hi>Richards</hi> Chappell, who in all poyntes both of feature and
fauour, so neerely resembled King <hi>Richard,</hi> that the
Lordes dissembled afterwardes that hee was King <hi>Richard</hi>
indeed.</p>
            <p>These and some others were highly feasted by the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot:
and after dinner they withdrewe themselues, into
a secret Chamber to counsaile: heere the Duke of Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who was moste hotly bent eyther to restore, or to
reuenge the cause of his deposed brother, declared vnto
the rest, the alleageance that they had sworne vnto King
<hi>Richard:</hi> the honours and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whereunto they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4090:65"/>
were by him aduaunced: that therefore they were bounde
both in conscience by the one, and in kindnesse by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to take his part against all men: that king <hi>Henry</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to both, had dispoyled him of his royall dignity, and
vniustly possessed himselfe thereof, whilest they stood loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on, and shewed neyther the obedience of subiectes,
nor loue of friendes, as though they were men who knewe
to doe any thing, better then to defend, and if neede were
to dye for theyr lawfull Prince and louing patron: that king
<hi>Henrie</hi> by violent inuading, or fraudulent insinuating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>else,
into the kingdome of his naturall and leige Prince,
was but a tyrant, and vsurper, and such a one as it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any man, by any meanes to throw downe, without
respect whether he were a good man or euill, for it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for no man, vpon pretence and shewe of goodnesse to
draw soueraignty vnto himselfe: that the lawes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of best gouerned common wealthes, did not onely
permit this action but highly honoured it with statues and
garlandes, and tytles of nobility, and also rewarded it with
all the wealth of the suppressed tyrant: that this enterprize
would be very profitable, and almost necessarie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, by extinguishing those warres which the Scots
menaced, the Frenchmen prepared, and the Welshmen had
already begun vpon this occasion and quarrell: that he did
not distrust but it might be accomplished by open armes,
but he thought it more sure for them, and for the common
wealth more safe, to put first in proofe some secret policie:
and to that purpose he deuised, that a solemne Iustes should
be challenged, to be kept at Oxforde, in Christmasse holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
betweene him and twentie on his part, and the Earle
of Salisburie and twentie on his part, to which king <hi>Henrie</hi>
should be inuited: and when he was most intentiue in regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their militarie disport, he should sodainlie be surprized
by men which without suspition might at that time be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
both for number and preparation sufficient for the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4090:65"/>
exployt, and thereby King <hi>Richard</hi> presently bee restored,
both to his liberty, and to his state.</p>
            <p>This deuise was no sooner vttered, then allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
of the rest of the confederates: and so resoluing
vpon the enterprize, they tooke an oath vpon the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes,
the one to be true and secret to the other, euen to
the houre and point of death: the Lords also made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture
sextipartite wherein they bound themselues, to doe
their best assay, for the death of the one king and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the other: this they sealed and subscribed, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to euery Lord a counter pane of the same: and further
they concluded what forces should be gathered, by whome,
howe they should be ordred and placed, and to whose trust
the execution should be committed.</p>
            <p>When all thinges were thus contriued, and theyr hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
ambitious mindes were well filled with the vaine winds
of hope and desire: the Duke of Exceter came to the king
at Windsore, and desired him for the loue that he bare to
the noble feares of Cheualry, that he would vouchsafe to
honour with his presence the martiall exercise, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
betweene him and the Earle of Salisbury, and to
be the iudge of theyr performances if any controuersie
should arise.</p>
            <p>The king supposing that to be intended indeed, which
was pretended in shew, easily yeelded to his request. The
Duke supposing his purpose now halfe performed, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his house, and so did the other confederates: where
they busily bestirred themselues, in raysing men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
horse and armour for the accomplishment of thys
acte.</p>
            <p>When the Dutchesse of Exceter, king <hi>Henries</hi> Sister,
perceiued the drift of the deuise, and saw that the Duke was
vppon his iourney: alas good Lady howe was shee distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in minde, with a sharpe conflicte of her conceiptes?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4090:66"/>
one waye she was mooued with nature towardes her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
another waye shee was more strongly stirred, with
loue towards her Lord and husband; and both wayes shee
was deuided in dutie. And what (sayd shee) is this loue
then against nature? or about it? shall I bee vndutifull to
my Prince? or is no dutie comparable to the dutie of a
wife? heigh ho: in what perplexities (wretched woman)
am I plunged, to see my two deerest friends in this case of
extremitie, that (it is doubtfull which but) certainlie one
must be ruined by the other. Heerewith such a shower of
teares streamed downe her cheekes, that it drowned her
speech, and stopped the passage of further complaint: which
when the Duke espyed, hee stepped vnto her, and seazing
softlie vppon her hand, vsed these wordes. What Besse? is
it kindnesse to me or kindred to your brother that thus hath
set your eyes on floate? Content your selfe woman, for
whatsoeuer the euent shall be, it cannot bee euill to you, nor
worse to me then now it is. For if my purpose preuaile, and
my brother bee restored againe to his crowne, both of vs
shall be sure neuer to decline: if it bee preuented, and your
brother continue still in his estate, no harme shall be doone
vnto you, and I shall be then sure of that distruction which
I doe now continually dread: the feare whereof in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is a greater torment then the paine in suffering.
When hee had thus saide, hee kissed her, and so leauing
her to the torture of a thousand thornie thoughts, he tooke
his iorney towards Oxforde, with a great company both of
Archers and Horsemen. There he sound all the rest of his
complices, well armed and banded, except onely the Duke
of Aumerle.</p>
            <p>The King also hearing that both the Challengers and
defendants were in a readinesse, determined the daye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to ride to Oxforde, according to his promise and
appointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:4090:66"/>
Now the confederates much maruailed at the stay of the
Duke of Aumerle, some onely blamed his slacknesse, others
began to suspect it, euery man coniectured as he was diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected betweene confidence and feare: and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of opinions, they sent vnto him in poste, to knowe the
certaine truth. Before the messenger came to the Duke, hee
was departed from Westminster towards Oxford, not the
direct way, but went first to see his Father the Duke of York,
and carried with him his counterpane of the Indenture of
confederacy. As they sate at dinner, the Father espied it in
his bosome, and demaunded what it was? the Sonne hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
craued pardon, and said that it nothing touched him, by
S. George (quoth the Father) but I will see it: and so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon a precedent iealosie, or some present cause of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
he tooke it away from him by force. When he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the contents, he sodainely arose from the table, &amp; with
great fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcenesse both of countenance and speech, vttered to
his Sonne these wordes.</p>
            <p>I see traytor, that idlenesse hath made thee so wanton
and mutinous that thou playest with thy faith, as children
doe with stickes: thou hast been once already faithlesse to
King <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp; now again art false to King <hi>Henrie,</hi> so that
the like fish <hi>Sepia,</hi> thou troublest all the waters wherin thou
liuest. Thou knowest that in open Parlament I became
suertie and pledge for thy alleageance, both in bodye and
goods: and can neither thy dutie, nor my desert restreine
thee, from seeking my destruction? in faith, but I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helpe forwarde thine. With that hee commaunded
his Horses to bee made readie, and presentlye tooke
his iorneye towardes Windsore, where the King then
laye.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Aumerle had no time eyther to consulte
with his friends, or to consider with himselfe what was
best to bee doone: but taking aduise vppon the sodaine,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4090:67"/>
he mounted likewise on horsebacke, and posted towardes
Windsore another way. It was no neede to force him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
his youthfull bloud, and his sodaine daunger were
in steed of two winges, to keep his horse in <hi>Pegasus</hi> pace:
so that he came to Windsore, &amp; was alighted at the Castell,
before his stiffe aged Father could come neere. Then hee
entred the gates, and caused them to be surely locked, and
tooke the Keyes into his owne hands, pretending some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
cause for which he would deliuer them vnto the King.
When he came in presence, he kneeled downe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
craued of the King mercie and forgiuenesse. The king
demaunded for what offence? Then with a confused voice,
and sad countenance, casting downe his eyes as altogether
abashed, partly with feare of his daunger, and partly with
shame of his discredit; he declared vnto the King all the
manner of the conspiracie. The King seemed neither rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to beleeue, nor negligentlie to distrust the Dukes report;
neyther stood it with pollicie to enterteine the discouerie
with any hard and violent vsage: therefore with gracious
speeches he comforted the Duke, and if this bee true, sayd
he, we pardon you: if it be feined, at your extreame perrill
be it.</p>
            <p>By this time the Duke of Yorke was rapping at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
gates, and being admitted to the Kings presence, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to him the endenture of confederacie, which hee
had taken from his sonne. When the King had redde it,
and was thereby perswaded of the trueth of the matter, he
was not a little disquieted in minde, complaining of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
disposition of those men, whom neyther crueltie
(he said) could make firme to King <hi>Richard,</hi> nor clemencie
to him; but vppon dislike of euery present gouernment, they
were desirous of any change. So being possessed with dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
thoughts then to gaze vppon games, he layde his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
aside, and determined to attend at Windsor, what course
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4090:67"/>
his enemies would take, and which waye they would set
forward: knowing right well that in ciuill tumults, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
patience, and opportunitie well taken, are the onely wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of aduantage; and that it is a speciall point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to make benefit of the enemyes follie. In the meane
time he directed his letters to the Earle of Northumberland
his high Constable, and to the Earle of Cumberland his high
Marshall, and to others his most assured friends, concerning
these sodaine and vnexpected accidents.</p>
            <p>The confederates all this time hearing nothing of the
Duke of Aumerle, and seeing no preparation for the Kings
comming, were out of doubt that theyr treason was betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And now considering that once before they had beene
pardoned, the guilt of this their rebellion, excluded them
from all hope of further mercie: wherevpon they became
desperate, and so resolued to prosecute that by open armes,
wherein their priuie practises had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailed. And first they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled
<hi>Magdalen</hi> (a man very like to King <hi>Richard</hi> both
in stature and countenance, and of yeares not disagreeable)
in princely attire; and gaue foorth that hee was King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
and that eyther by fauour or negligence of his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
he was escaped out of prison, and desired the faith and
ayde of his louing subiects. Then they determined to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patche
messengers to <hi>Charles</hi> King of Fraunce, to desire his
helpe and assistance on the behalfe of his sonne in lawe, if
need should require.</p>
            <p>The common people, which commonlie are soone change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and on the sodaine as prone to pittie as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
excessiuely cruell, most earnestlie wished the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and earnestly wishing, did easely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it: in which imaginarie conceit, being otherwise men
of no deepe search, the presence of <hi>Magdalene</hi> most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
confirmed them: and so eyther vpon ignorance of truth,
or delight in trouble, they ioyned themselues in great troops
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4090:68"/>
to the Lords: desiring nothing more then to be the meanes
whereby King <hi>Richard</hi> should be restored, as in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
their first affections and humors towards him. Then
the Lords of this association with great force, but with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fame, as the manner is of matters vnknowne, aduanced
forward in battaile arraye towards Windsore, against King
<hi>Henrie,</hi> as against an enemie of the common state; hauing in
theyr company aboue fortie thousand armed men. The
King vpon intelligence of theyr approache, secretlye with a
few horse, the next Sunday night after Newyeres day, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Windsore to the Tower of London, and the same
night before it was daye, the confederates came to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of Windsore: where missing their expected praye, they
stood doubtfull and deuided in opinions, which waye to
bend their course. Some aduised them with all speede to
follow the King to London, and not to leaue him any leaue
and libertie, to vnite an armie against them: that Winter
was no let but in idle and peaceable times: that in ciuill
discentions nothing is more safe then speede, and greater
aduantage alwayes groweth by dispatching then deferring:
that whilest some were in feare, some in doubt, and some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
the Citie, yea the realme might easilye be possessed:
and that many armies whose furie at the first rush could not
be resisted, by delayes did weare out, and waste to nothing.
Others who would seeme to bee considerate and wise, but
in verye deede were noe better then dastardes, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
rather to set King <hi>Richard</hi> first at libertie; for if their
counterfeiting should be discouered before they possessed
themselues of his person, the people vndoubtedly would
fall from them to the certaine confusion of them all. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
they gaue ouer the pursuite, and retired to Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,
and there delayed out the time of dooing, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating,
beeing neyther courogiouslye quicke, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
stayed, but faintlie and fearefullye shrincking
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4090:68"/>
backe: and when they once beganne to relent, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
euery daye more and more both in power and in
hope.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henrie</hi> the next morning after hee was come to
the Tower, sent to the Maior of the Citie to put Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in armes for his resistance, who presentlye presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him three thousand Archers, and three thousand
bill men, besides those that were appointed for defence
of the Citie. The King spent vpon him many good spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and liberally loaded him with promises and thanks;
and soone after he issued out of London, with twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
tall men, and came to Hounslowe Heath, abiding
there, and as it were da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing his enemyes to ioyne issue
in the field: contemning theyr disorderlye multitude, as a
vayne terrour of names without forces. But the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
eyther for feare of the Kings power, or for distrust
of theyr owne, or else lingring, perhappes, after some suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
out of Fraunce, refused the encounter, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it is whether they shewed greater courage in setting
vp the danger, or cowardise in declining it when it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
vnto them.</p>
            <p>So they departed from Colebrooke to Sunnings, a place
neere Redding, where Queene <hi>Isabell,</hi> King <hi>Richardes</hi>
wife did then abyde: to whom vppon the plaine trueth
before declared, fame had falslye descanted, that King
<hi>Richard</hi> was escaped out of prison, and did lye at Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret
with a hundred thousand armed men; and that King
<hi>Henrie</hi> for feare of him, was fledde with his children
and friendes to the Tower of London. All which was
as lightlye beleeued, as it was vainlye toulde: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
shee defaced King <hi>Henries</hi> armes, and plucked
away his cognisance from those his seruants that attended
vppon her; and hauing in some sorte satisfied her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannish
anger, with this harmelesse spight, she and the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4090:69"/>
Lordes departed together first to Wallingforde, and from
thence to Abington, stirring the people by the waye to take
armour, and to rise in ayde of king <hi>Richard,</hi> who was (saide
they) and is, and should be their Prince.</p>
            <p>At the last they came to Chichester, and there the Lordes
tooke theyr lodgings, the Duke of Surrey and the Earle of
Salisburie in one Inne; the Duke of Exceter and the Earle
of Gloucester in another; and all the hoast encamped in the
fields. But the Bayliffe of the towne, suspecting all this
countenance to be but the vaine flashe of a false fire, did in
the night with about foure score Archers, beset and set vpon
the house where the Duke of Surrey and the Earle of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie
laye: who were men but of weake resistance by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but being put vpon necessitie, shewed great manhood
and persistance in defending themselues against the towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
The Duke of Exceter and the Earle of Gloucester be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in another Inne, were not able by force to rescue their
associates; wherevpon a certaine Priest of their companye
set diuers houses in the towne on fire, supposing thereby to
diuert the townsmen from theyr assault, to the sauing of their
houses and of their goods: but this fire greatly inflamed
their furie, and made them more obstinate in their attempt;
crying out that they would neuer labour to rescue their los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but to reuenge them; and that with the bloud of the
Lordes, those flames should be quenched. Then there arose
confused clamours and noyses, all the towne being in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare
and in armes, shooting fiercelie and running vpon the
Lords with a rashe and desperate rage; not caring to loose
many, wherof they had many to spare.</p>
            <p>When the Earle of Exceter and they that were with him
perceiued the force of the assaylants daungerouslie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and that it was impossible for a few to susteine the
furie of so many so obstinately bent: they fledde out of the
backe side towards the campe, intending to bring the whole
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4090:69"/>
army to the rescue: but the soldiers hauing heard a tumu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
and seeing fire within the towne, supposed that the King
was entred with all his puisance: whereupon being strooke
with a sodaine and false feare, and wanting a commaunder
of courage to confirme them, they ran away, and dispear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselues without measure; and so whilest euery man
endeuoured to saue himselfe, all were brought to theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Duke of Surrey, and the Earle of Salisbury, &amp; the
Lords &amp; Gentlemen which were in their company, were left
to defend themselues against the townsemen as they coulde
who manfully maintained the fight with great bloudshed
of theyr enemies, from midnight vntill three of the clocke
the next day in the after noone: at the last, being inferiour
both in number and fortune, the Duke and the Earle were
wounded to death and taken, and the same euening theyr
heades were stricken off and sent to London: there were
also taken Sir <hi>Bennet Shelley,</hi> Sir <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Blunt,</hi> and 28. other Lordes, Knights and Gentlemen, who
were sent to Oxford, where the King then lay, and there
were put to execution.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Exceter when he found the army dispersed
and fled, fled likewise with Sir <hi>Iohn Shelley</hi> into Essex, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the certaine destruction which his rashnesse had
procured to himselfe, and to his friends, but moste especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to King <hi>Richard;</hi> if not as a party, yet as a cause of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
tumult; many times he did attempt to haue escaped
by sea into Fraunce, but he was alwayes driuen backe by
distresse of weather; and so wandring and lurking in secret
places, hee was at the last attached as hee sat at supper
in a certaine friendes house, and led to Plashy, and there
shortly after beheaded: so that a man might probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

brought in reckoning, who by his counsell and contry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance

chiefly, in the same place had been apprehended. An
excellent example for all those which measure their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
eyther by their pleasure, or by their power: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
of iniurious dealing, although it be prolonged, yet
doth neuer faile, but commeth surely although perhappes,
slowly. This duke was a man of high parentage, of a franke
minde, and wealth answerable thereunto: openly praise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, worthy,
but his secret actions were hardly spoken of: he was
of consent to all his brothers vices, and of counsaile to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet somewhat the more close and vigilant man: and
not so much partaker of his prosperity, as violently carried
with the current of his misery.</p>

and a great number of meane and base persons
were in other places put to death; insomuch as the King
though otherwise of a very temperate and intreatible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
seemed to shew too hard and haughty dealing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging
his owne iniury, or rather maintaining the iniury
he had done: the heads of the chiefe conspiratours, were
pitched vpon poles, and set ouer London Bridge: in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

friends, insomuch as many graue men openly gaue forth,
that in short time there would be cause to wish King <hi>Richard</hi>
again as being more tollerable to endure the cruelty of one,
then of many, and to liue where nothing, then where any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4090:70"/>
thing might be permitted.</p>
            <p>The Abbot of Westminster in whose house and in whose
head this confederacy began, hearing of these aduentures,
as he was going betweene his monastery and his mansion,
fell sodainly into a palsie, and hardly after without speech
ended his life; and although in this enterprize fortune gaue
policy the check, and by a strange accedent which wisdome
could not foresee, ouerturned the deuise, yet is it certainely
affirmed that this Abbot first stirred the stone, which row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a long, was like to haue turned king <hi>Henry</hi> out of his
seate. The bishop of Caerliel, was condemned vpon this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but the extreamity of his feare, and griefe, closed vp his
daies, and preuented the violence and shame of publicke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
And now king <hi>Richard</hi> after he had abdicated his
dignity, did but short time enioy that sweet security, which
he did vainely expect, and first all his goods which hee did
giue in satisfaction of the iniuries that hee had done, were
brought to deuision and share amongst his enemies: short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after he was remooued from the Tower, to the Castle of
Leedes in Kent, and from thence to Pomfret, to the ende
that by often changing hee might eyther more secretly bee
dispatched, or more vncertainly found: heere being kept
in streight prison, both innocent &amp; ignorant of this offence,
was notwithstanding made a party in the punishment. For
King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiuing that the Lords so far preuailed with
their late strategeme, that if their stomacke had bin answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their strength, &amp; their bloud beginning had not end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in faintnes and sloath, they might haue driuen him to a
hard hazard; caused King <hi>Richard</hi> to be put to death: inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to make sure, that no man should cloake open rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vnder the colour of following sides, nor countenance his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracy, either with the person or name of K. <hi>Richard:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee did expressely commaund his death, or no, it is a
question, out of question he shewed some liking and desire
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4090:71"/>
to the action, and gaue allowance thereto when it was
doone.</p>
            <p>The most current report at that time went, that hee was
princely serued euery day at the Table, with aboundance of
costlie meates, according to the order prescribed by Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but was not suffered to tast or touche any one of them;
and so perished of famine; being tormented with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of that, whereof hee dyed for want, but such horrible
and vnnaturall crueltie, both against a King and a kinseman,
should not proceed from King <hi>Henrie</hi> (me thinke) a man of
a moderate and milde disposition, not yet from any other
minde which is not altogether both sauage in humanitie,
and in religion prophane. One wrighter who would seeme
to haue the perfect intelligence of these affayres, maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that King <hi>Henrie</hi> sitting at his table, sad and pensiue,
with a deepe sigh brake foorth into these wordes: Haue I
no faithfull friend that will deliuer me of him, whose life will
breed destruction to me and disturbance to the realme, and
whose death will bee a safetie and quiet to both? for how
can I be free from feare, so long as the cause of my daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
dooth continue? and what securitie, what hope shall
we haue of peace, vnlesse the seede of sedition be vtterly roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out?</p>
            <p>Vppon this speech a certaine Knight called Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of
Extone, presently departed from the Court, accompanyed
with eyght tall men, and came to Pomfrete, and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
that the Esquire who was accustomed to sewe,
and take the assaye before King <hi>Richard,</hi> should no more vse
that manner of seruice: and let him (quoth he) now eate wel,
for he shall not eate long. King <hi>Richard</hi> sate downe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and was serued without courtesie or assaye, whereat he
merueyled, and demaunded of the Esquire, why he did not
his dutie? the Esquire answered, that he was otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
by Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of Extone, who was latelye come
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4090:71"/>
from King <hi>Henry.</hi> The King beeing somewhat mooued at
this acte and answere, tooke the caruing knife in his hand,
and strucke the Esquire therewith lightly on the head, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the deuill take <hi>Henry</hi> of Lancaster and thee together:
with that Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> entred the chamber, with eight men in
harneys, euery one hauing a byll in his hand: Wherevpon
King <hi>Richard</hi> perceiuing their drift and his owne daunger,
put the table from him, and stepping stoutlye to the formost
man, wrested the bill out of his hand, wherewith (although
vnarmed and alone) he manfully defended himselfe a good
space, and slew sowre of his assailants. Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> lept to the
chaire where king <hi>Richard</hi> was wonte to sit, whilest the rest
chased him about the chamber. At the last being forced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place where Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> was, he with a stroake of
his Pollax felled him to the ground: and foorthwith he was
miserably rid out of his miserable life. It is saide that at
the pointe of his death, hee gathered some spirit, and
with a fainte and feeble voyce, groaned foorth these
wordes.</p>
            <p>My great grandfather King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, was in
this manner deposed, imprisoned, and murthered; by which
meanes my grandfather king <hi>Edward</hi> the third obteyned
possession of the crowne; and now is the punishment of that
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>trie powred vpon his next successour. Well, this is right
for mee to suffer, but not for you to doe: your King for a
time may ioye at my death, and enioye his desire; but let
him qualifie his pleasures with expectation of the like iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
for God who measureth all our actions by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of our mindes, will not suffer this violence vnreuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>Whether these words proceeded from a distempered de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
or from the iudgement of his foresight, they were not
altogether idle and vaine. For Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> expecting great
fauour and rewards for his vngracious seruice, was frustrated
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4090:72"/>
of both, and not onely missed that countenance for which he
hoped, but lost that which before he had: so odious are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
euen where they are profitable.</p>
            <p>Heerevpon hee grew at the first discontented, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
mightely turmoyled and tormented in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and raging against himselfe would often exclaime,
that to pleasure one vnthankefull person, he had made both
himselfe and his posteritie, hatefull and infamous to all the
world.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henrie</hi> with great discontentment and disquiet
held the kingdome during his life: and so did his sonne
King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fifth: in whose time by continuall warres
against the Frenchmen, the malice of the humour was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
exercised and spent. But his second successour King
<hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was dispossessed thereof, and together with
his young sonne <hi>Henry</hi> imprisoned and put to death, eyther
by the commaundement or con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iuence of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
fourth.</p>
            <p>And hee also escaped not free; for hee dyed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               </gap> and after his
death his two sonnes were disinherited, imprisoned, and
butchered by their cruell Vnckle the Duke of Gloucester,
who beeing a tyrant and vsurper, was lawfully slaine in the
field; and so in his person (hauing no issue) the tragedie
did end. Which are most rare and excellent examples both
of comfort to them that are oppressed, and of terrour to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
dealers; that God in his secret iudgement dooth not
alwayes so certainely prouide for our safetie, as reuenge our
iniuries and harmes: and that all our vniust actions haue a
daye of payment, and many times by waye of retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
euen in the same manner and measure wherein they
were committed.</p>
            <p>And thus was King <hi>Richard</hi> brought to his death, by

hasten, eyther his fame or his fall, but by moderation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
safely that degree of praise, and honour, which others
aspiring vnto by desperate courses, wanne with ambitious
death, without any other profit at all; He left behinde him
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4090:73"/>
two noble sonnes, expresse resemblencers of his integritie:
<hi>Edward,</hi> who succeeded in his dignitie, and before was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Duke of Aumerle, and <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cambridge.
<hi>Edward,</hi> in the change of the state, neither constantlye kept
his fidelitie, nor stoutlie maintained his treason. <hi>Richard</hi>
tooke to wife the daughter and heyre of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi>
whose mother <hi>Phillip</hi> was sole daughter and heyre to <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>
Duke of Clarence, the third sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
thyrd, by which title and discent, his posteritie claimed the
Crowne and kingdome of this realme from the successours
of King <hi>Henrie,</hi> as heereafter more at large shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> King of Fraunce lost no time all this while in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
preparation to inuade England: and to that end had
now raysed an armie royall, which was brought downe into
Picardie, and in a readinesse to haue beene transported. But
it is verye like that this hast for the deliuerance of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
did the more hasten his death: vppon newes whereof
the Frenchmen perceiuing their purpose for his restitution to
be to no purpose, gaue ouer the enterprise; some being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that the occasion was lost of making spoile of so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a countrie, others being well content to be discharged of
that hope together with the hazard whervpon it depended.
Shortlie after the French King sent a solemne Embassage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
England, to treate, or rather intreate, that Lady <hi>Isabell</hi>
his daughter, who had bin espoused to King <hi>Richard,</hi> might
with her dowrie bee restored to him againe. King <hi>Henrie</hi>
most honourablie receiued these Embassadours, and gaue in
answere, that he would speedelie send his Commissioners to
Calice, which should fullye commune and conclude with
them, both of this and other weightie affayres concerning
both the realmes.</p>
            <p>Not long after he sent <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of Yorke, and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
Earle of Northumberland to Calice: Also the French
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4090:74"/>
King sent the Duke of Burbone and certaine others to Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine.
These Commissioners did often meete, sometimes at
one place, and sometimes at another: the Frenchmen espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
required, that Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> should be restored, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that King <hi>Charles</hi> her Father had giuen in charge, that
this before all matters, and without this nothing should be
concluded. On the other side the Englishmen desired that
she might be married to <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of Wales King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
eldest Sonne, a man answerable to her in equall degree
both of bloud and of yeeres: but the French King denyed
that he would any more ioyne affinity with the English na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whose aliance had once so vnfortunately succeeded: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they entred into speech of a perpetuall peace, but heereto
the Frenchmen would not agree. In the end it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> should be deliuered to King <hi>Charles</hi>
her Father but without Dower; because the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
King <hi>Richard</hi> and her, was neuer consummate: by
reason wherof she was not dowable by the very treaty of the
marriage. Also the surcease of armes which foure yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had beene made with King <hi>Richard</hi> for the terme of
30 yeeres, was continued and confirmed for the time then
vnexpyred. Some authors affirme that a newe truce was
taken, but these also are at diffierence: for some report
that it was during the life of both the Kinges, others that
it was but for a short time, which hath the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce
of truth, by reason of the open hostilitye which
the yeere following did breake foorth betweene the two
realmes.</p>
            <p>Shortly after King <hi>Henrie</hi> sent the Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> vnder
the conducte of Lorde <hi>Thomas Pearcy</hi> Earle of Worcester,
in royall estate to Calice: she was accompanied with a great
troupe of honourable personages, both men and women;
and carried with her all the Iewelles and plate which shee
brought into England, with a great surple sage of rich giftes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4090:74"/>
bestowed vpon her by the king: at Calice she was receiued
by the Earle of S. Paule, Leiuetenant for the French king
in Picardy, and by him was conducted to king <hi>Charles</hi> her
Father, who afterwardes gaue her in marriage to <hi>Cbarles,</hi>
sonne to <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of Orleance: and so was eyther rest
or respite of wars procured in Fraunce, whilest neerer stirres
might be brought to some stay.</p>
            <p>For within the realme, the fire and fury of the late sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was scarcely quenched and quiet, but (that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth should not cease to be torne by multiplying of
diuisions, one streight succeeding another) the Welshmen,
vpon aduantage of the doubtfull and vnsetled estate of king
<hi>Henrie,</hi> resolued to breake and make a defection; before ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the king could ground his authority, or the people
frame themselues to a new obedience: and hauing learned
that common causes must be maintained by concord, they
sought by assemblyes to establish an association, and to set
vp theyr owne principality againe.</p>
            <p>To this purpose they created for theyr Prince, <hi>Owen
Glendor</hi> an Esquire of Wales, a factious person, and apt to
set vp diuision and strife: and although hee was of no
great state in birth; yet was hee great and stately in sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke:
of an aspiring spirit, and in wit somewhat aboue
the ordynarie of that vntrayned people: boulde, craftie,
actiue, and as he listed to bend his minde, mischieuous
or industrious in equall degree, in desires immoderate,
and rashlye aduenturous, in his young yeeres hee was
brought vp to the studye of the Common Lawe of the
Realme, at London: and when he came to mans estate,
besides a naturall fiercenesse and hatred to the English
name, hee was particularlye incensed by a priuate suite,
for certayne landes in controuersie, betweene the Lord
Gray of Ruthen and him; wherein his tytle was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen;
and being a man by nature not of the myldest,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4090:75"/>
by this prouocation he was made sauadge and rough; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
eyther to repayre or to reuenge his losse, by setting
the whole state on fire. Also his expence and liberalitie had
been too excessiue for a great man to endure, which brought
him to barenesse too base for a meane man to beare: and
therefore he must of necessitie doe and dare somewhat, and
more daunger there was in soft and quiet dealing, then in
hazarding rashlie. Heerewith opportunitie was then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
presented: for troublesome times are most fit for great
attempts, and some likelyhood there was, whilest the King
and the Lordes were hard at variance, that harme might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selie
be wrought to them both. Vpon these causes his desire
was founded, and vppon these troubles his hope. But that
his aspiring and ambitious humour might beare some shew
of honest meaning, he pretented to his countrymen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of theyr free estate, the desire whereof was so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
sweete, that euen wilde Birdes will rather liue hardlye
at large in the ayre, then bee daintily dyeted by others in a
Cage: and opportunitie was at that time fitlie offered, or
else neuer to be expected, to rid them of theyr thraldome,
falselie and coulourablie intituled a peace; whilest the one
Kings power was waining, and the other not yet fullye
wexen, and eyther of them grew weake by wasting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
neither was there any difference which of them should
preuayle, sith the warre touched both alike, insomuch as the
ouerthrow would ruine the one, and the victorie the other:
So hee exhorted them to take courage and armes: and first
to kill all the English within their territories, for libertie
and Lordes could not endure together: then to resume their
auncient customes and lawes, whereby more then armes,
commonwealths are established and enlarged: so should
they bee a people vncorrupt, without admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
manners or bloud; and so should they forget serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and eyther liue at libertie, or else perhaps, bee Lordes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4090:75"/>
ouer other.</p>
            <p>Heerevppon many flocked vnto him, the best for loue of
libertie, the basest of desire of bootie and spoile, insomuch
as in short time hee became commaunder of competent
forces to stand openly in the fielde. And being desirous to
make some proofe of his prowesse, hee sharply set vppon his
ould aduersarie <hi>Reignold</hi> Lorde Grey of Ruthen, whose
possessions he wasted and spoyled, slew many of his men,
and tooke himselfe prisoner; yet gaue him faire and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
enterteinment, and promised him releasment, if he would
take his daughter to wife. This hee desired, not so much for
neede of his abilitie or ayde, as supposing that the name and
countenance of a Lorde, would giue reputation to the house
that was then but in rising: But the Lorde Greye at the first
did not so much refuse as scorne the offer: affirming that he
was no warde, to haue his marriage obtruded vppon him.
Well (sayde <hi>Owen Glendore</hi>) although you bee not my
warde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet are you in my warde: and the suing of your liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
will cost double the marriage money that elsewhere you
shall procure. The Lord Grey being not very riche to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his ransome, and seeing no other meanes of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,
at the last accepted the condition, and tooke the
damosell to wife; notwithstanding his deceitfull Father in
lawe trifled out the time of his enlargement vntyll hee
dyed.</p>
            <p>The Welshmen being confident vppon this successe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to breake into the borders of Hereford shire, and to
make spoyle and pray of the Countrey: against whom Lord
<hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earle of Marche, who for feare of King
<hi>Henrie</hi> had withdrawne himselfe (as hath been declared) to
Wiggmore Castle, assembled all the Gentlemen of the
Countrye, and meeting with the Welshmen, they ioyned
together a sharpe and cruell conflict: not in forme of a loose
skirmish, but standing still and maintaining their place, they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4090:76"/>
endeauoured with maine might to breake and beare downe
one another. The courage and resolution of both sides was
a like, but the Welshmen were superiour both for number
and direction: for they were conducted by one knowne lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who with his presence euery where assisted at neede, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
his Soldiours, some with shame and reproofe, others
with praise and encouragement, all with hope and large
promises: but the Englishmen had no certaine generall, but
many confused commaunders, yea, euery man was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder
to himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pressing forward or drawing backe, as
his owne courage or feare did mooue him. Insomuch as no
doubt they had taken a great blowe that day by theyr ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
bouldnesse, had not <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> presently vppon
the breaking vp of the field, ceased to pursue the execution,
and shewed himselfe more able to get a victorie, then skilfull
to vse it. But euen to his side the victorie had cost bloud,
and many of those which remayned, were eyther wounded
or wearie: the night was neere also, and they were in their
enemyes countrie; by which meanes our men had libertie
to retire rather then runne away, no man being hoat to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the chase. They lost of their company about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, who sould their liues at such a price, that when
manhood had doone the hardest against them, certaine
mannish, or rather deuilish women, whose malice is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
exercised a vaine reuenge vppon their dead bodyes;
in cutting off theyr priuie partes and theyr noses, whereof
the one they stuffed into theyr mouthes, and pressed the
other betweene their buttocks; and would not suffer their
mangled carcasses to be committed to the earth, vntill they
were redeemed with a great summe of money. By which
cruell couetuousnesse, the faction lost reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
with the moderate sorte of their owne people; sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
that it was not libertie but licentiousnesse, which
was desired: and that subiection to such vnhumaine
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4090:76"/>
mindes would bee more insupportable then anye bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>In this conflict the Earle of Marche was taken prisoner
and fettered with chaines, and cast into a deepe and vile
dungeon. The King was solicited by many noble men, to
vse some meanes for his deliuerance; but hee would not
heare on that eare; hee could rather haue wished him and
his two sisters in heauen, for then the onely blemish to his
title had beene out of the way: and no man can tell whether
this mischaunce did not preserue him from a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> by the prosperous successe of his actions,
was growne now more harde to be dealt with, and hautelie
minded, and stood euen vppon termes of equalitie with the
King: wherevpon he proceeded further to inuade the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Wales on the West side of Seuerne; where he burnt
many villages and townes, slew much people, and returned
with great prey, and praises of his adherents. Thus he ceased
not this yeere to infest the borderers on euery side, amongst
whom he found so weake resistance, that he seemed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
rather a spoile then a warre. For King <hi>Henrie</hi> was then
detained with his chiefest forces in another more dangerous
seruice, which besides these former vexations and hazards,
this first yeere of his reigne happened vnto him.</p>
            <p>For the Scottes knowing that changes were times most
apte for attempt, and vppon aduantage of the absence of all
the chiefe English borderers, partly by occasion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
and partlie by reason of the plague which was very
grieuous that yeere in the North partes of the realme: they
made a roade into the countrey of Northumberland, and
there committed great hauocke and harme. Also on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
night they sodainly set vppon the Castle of Werke, the
captain wherof sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> was then one of the knights
of the Parlament: &amp; hauing slaine the watch partly a sleepe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4090:77"/>
partlye amased with feare, they brake in and surprised the
place: which they held a while, and at the last spoyled and
ruined and then departed. Whilest further harmes were
feared this passed with light regarde. But when great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
were past, as if noe woorse misfortune could haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen,
then was it much sorrowed and lamented. And in
reuenge thereof, the Englishmen inuaded and spoyled cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ilandes of Orkney: and so the losse was in some sorte
repayred: yet (as in reprisals of warre it commonlye fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out) neyther against those particular persons which
committed the harme, nor for those which suffred it: but
one for another were both recompenced and reuenged.
Againe the Scottes set foorth a fleete, vnder the conduct
of Sir <hi>Robert Logon,</hi> with direction to attempt as occasion
should be offered: his first purpose was against our Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but before hee came to any action, he was encountred
by certaine English ships, and the greatest part of his fleete
taken. Thus peace still continuing betweene both the
realmes, a kinde of theeuish hostilitie was dayly practised,
which afterwardes brake out into open warre vppon this
occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George</hi> of Dunbarre Earle of the Marches of Scotland,
had betrothed <hi>Elisabeth</hi> his daughter to <hi>Dauid,</hi> the sonne
and heyre apparant of <hi>Robert</hi> King of Scottes, and in regardc
of that marriage to bee shortlie celebrated and finished, hee
deliuered into the Kings hands a great summe of money
for his Daughters dowrie. But <hi>Archibalde</hi> Earle Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse
disdayning that the Earle of Marches bloud should be
preferred before his, so wrought with King <hi>Robert,</hi> that
Prince <hi>Dauid</hi> his sonne refused the Earle of Marches
Daughter, and tooke to wife <hi>Mariell</hi> Daughter to the
Earle Dowglasse: Earle <hi>George</hi> not vsed to offers of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
could hardlye enforce his pacience to endure this
scorne: and first hee demaunded restitution of his money,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4090:77"/>
not so much for care to obteyne as for desire to pieke an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of breaking his alleageance. The King would make
to him neyther payment nor promise, but trifled him off

that the peace was already as it were out of ioynts, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not to loose the benefit of the discontented subiects of
his enemie: wherevppon hee returned aunswer to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralde

to holde me one, or hazard the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the worde of
a Prince was of great weight; and therefore sithe hee had
graunted a safe conduct to the Earle of Marche and his
companie, it were an impeachment to his honour, without
iust cause to violate the same. Vppon this answere the King
of Scottes did presently proclaime open warre against the
King of England, with bloud, fire, and sworde.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> thought it policie, rather to begin the warre
in his enemies countrie, then to expect it in his owne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

furnish both sides with necessarie supply; the friend
by contribution, and the enemie by spoyle. Therefore sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
certaine troopes of horsemen before him, both to espie
and to induce an vncertaine terrour vppon the enemie, hee
entred into Scotland with a puissant armie; wherewith hee
burnt many Villages and Townes, cast downe diuerse Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and ruined a great part of the Townes of Edenborough
and Lith, sparing nothing but Churches and religious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
so that in all places as he passed, the spectacle was ouglie
and grislie which hee left behind him; bodyes torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
mangled and putrified limmes, the ayre infected with
stincke, the ground imbrued with corruption and bloud,
the countrie wasted, the Grasse and Corne troden downe
and spoyled; insomuch as a man would haue sayde that
warre is an exercise not of manhood, but of inhumanitie.
They that fledde before the armie, filled all places with
feare and terrour, extolling aboue truthe the English fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to deminish thereby their shame in running from
them.</p>
            <p>In the end of September the King besieged the Castle
of Maydens in Edenborough; wherein were <hi>Dauid</hi> Duke
of Rothsaye Prince of the realme, and <hi>Archibald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Earle
Dowglasle; the inconstancie of the one, and ambition of
the other, were principall causes of all this warre.</p>
            <p>During this siege, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Albonye, who was
appointed gouernour of the Realme, because the King
was sicke and vnable to rule, sent an Herauld vnto <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi>
assuring him vppon his honour, that if hee would
abyde but sixe dayes at the most, hee would giue him
battaile; and eyther remooue the siege, or loose his
life.</p>
            <p>The King was well pleased with these tidings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
the Herauld with a gowne of silke and a chaine of
gould, and promised him in the worde of a Prince, to abide
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4090:78"/>
there and expect the gouernour, during the tyme by him
prefixed.</p>
            <p>The sixe dayes passed, almoste sixe tymes ouer and
no more newes was heard of the Gouernour, eyther
by presence or by messenger. Winter came on, and
victuaile fayled, the Country was colde and fruitelesse,
and it rayned euery day in great aboundance: so that
partly by hunger, partlye by distemperature of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Soldiers began to dye of the Flixe; it is verie
like that these accidentes stayed the Gouernour from
performing his promise, for pollicy was against it, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his men in the fielde, when winter and want, two
forceable foes, had giuen the charge vpon his enemyes:
certaine it is, that they mooued the King to remooue his
fiege, and to depart out of Scotland, without any battaile
or skirmish offred.</p>
            <p>Both the Wardens of the Marches were all this time in
Scotland with the King: vpon which aduantage the Scots
did breake into Northumberland, and burnt certaine townes
in Bamborough shire. The English men were speedilie
vp in armes; but the Scottes more speedily made theyr
returne, or else no doubt they had been met with and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered.</p>
            <p>Agayne when King <hi>Henry</hi> had discharged his armie,
the Scottes beeing desirous not so much of lyfe as of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
made a sodayne roade into England, vnder the
conduct of Sir <hi>Thomas Halsbarton</hi> of Dirleton, and Sir

they wrought dyd rather waken then weaken the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen:
and they themselues were somewhat encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,

            <p>Not long after, Sir <hi>Patricke Hebburne,</hi> beeing lifted vp

commaunder, and none a putter in execution: so the ranket
loosed and brake, and could not bee reunited, the victor
