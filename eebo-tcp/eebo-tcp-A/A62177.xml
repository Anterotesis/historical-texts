            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough your deſign'd
Favours to me might
juſtly claim this offer
of my Reſpects in a Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet I muſt own, That it is
<pb facs="tcp:62365:3"/>
not only Gratitude that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
me to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but it is my Choice and
Judgment that prompts me
to take the Liberty of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Piece under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your
Protection. And indeed, if
I regard either the Greatneſs
of your Family, or your own
Perſonal Endowments, where
could I have found a more Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Name, or a more
generally own'd Deſert.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sydneys</hi> have fill'd our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, and adorn'd
our Nation; Great in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
both at Home
and Abroad, but more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in aſſerting conſtantly
their Country's true Intereſt:
<pb facs="tcp:62365:3"/>
And your Lordſhip has not
been wanting to follow ſuch
Honourable Examples, firſt,
by a ſteddy adherence to all
the meaſures that could be
entred into by a wiſe man in
times full of dark deſigns;
and then (as ſoon as your
Countries Good requir'd it)
by boldly laying aſide all
dubious Counſels, to appear
in Arms with our Great and
Glorious Deliverer, His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Thanks we
owe to all thoſe who have
done the like, I think no one
can more juſtly be extoll'd
by this, or recommended
to the eſteem and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:62365:4"/>
of the next Age, than
your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>In your Negotiation in
<hi>Holland,</hi> during the cloſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of the latter end of
King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, you
ſtrove to keep both him and
us happy and quiet, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the true Intereſt of
both: But when the Ferment
of our Affairs forc'd you to
more ſenſible demonſtrations
of your thoughts, you No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
choſe rather to appear an
ill Courtier, than be thought
an ill Man to your Country.
The Proteſtant Intereſt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it with you, while the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Faction thought their
deſigns as ſecure as they
<pb facs="tcp:62365:4"/>
were deeply laid. 'Tis rare
to find ſuch Conduct and
Courage in a Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
But what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
leſs from one ready to
venture his Life in the Field at
the Head of our Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
againſt that unquiet
Monarch who was then inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the Liberty Mankind
had left.</p>
            <p>Heaven, My Lord, has at
laſt bleſs'd theſe conſtant
endeavours for <hi>England</hi>'s
Proſperity, and we ſee you
in the Councils and Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a Prince born for our
Felicity.</p>
            <p>The Great Queen of this
Monarchy, who ſo lov'd her
<pb facs="tcp:62365:5"/>
People, and underſtood their
Intereſt, had a <hi>Sydney</hi> for

in his Councils and Arms,
Guarded by you in the day,
he ſleeps often under your

            <p>To whom then could I

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THat <hi>Padre Paulo Sarpi,</hi>
of the Order of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
is the Author of
this Treatiſe, there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof than the reading of it;
for whoever is acquainted either
with his ſtyle, or his manner of
thinking, muſt of neceſſity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that they are both
here. And indeed we may ſay, that
this is not only a true repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government of the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Republick, but that
the Author alſo (like great <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62365:7"/>
who in all their Works give
us their own <hi>Genius</hi> with the
mixture of the Repreſentation)
has likewiſe drawn the trueſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of himſelf. He was one of
the greateſt men of his Age, of
vaſt Natural Parts, to which he
had added all the acquir'd ones
that great Study and much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with Men could give
him: It was he who defended the
Republick in the diſpute they had
with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>5th;</hi> which
he did ſo ſolidly, and yet ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly,
that his Subject never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him either to Invectives or
Railleries, unbeſeeming the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Matter, nor the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Perſons whoſe Cauſe
he managed; that Quarrel being
<pb facs="tcp:62365:7"/>
accommodated by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> in which the Republick
had all the advantage poſſible:
The Senate, very ſenſible of the
Obligation they had to <hi>P. Paulo,</hi>
made him <hi>Conſultor of State,</hi>
and added an Honourable Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his Life, giving him at the
ſame time Order to view all their
ſecret Records, where all their
Papers and Inſtruments of State
were laid up; all which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into ſuch a new order, as
that they might be recurr'd to
with the greateſt eaſe imaginable
upon all occaſions. The Eſteem
they made of his Abilities was ſo
great, that they never had any
important debate in which either
<pb facs="tcp:62365:8"/>
by publick order, or by the private
application of ſome of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
they did not take his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
which moſt commonly was
aſſented to afterwards. Towards
the latter end of his Life, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
of State</hi> ſeeing that
they could not hope long for the
continuation of thoſe Oracles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
that once for all he ſhould
impart them his thoughts upon
the whole Conſtitution of their
Government, and withal, add his
Opinion touching their Future
Conduct both within and without;
and that is this Piece with which
I now preſent the Publick. As it
was made for the peruſal of thoſe
only who were the participants of
all the <hi>Arcanums</hi> of the Empire,
<pb facs="tcp:62365:8"/>
it is writ with leſs regard to the
Publick Cenſure, to which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it would never be ſubject.
All other Writers of Politicks
may in one thing be juſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is, that when they write
with a deſign of publiſhing their
Works to Mankind, they muſt
have a regard to many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of the times they write
in, and Opinions that are then
receiv'd by the People, as alſo to
the Eſtabliſh'd Forms both of
Government and Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that Self-love too will not
let them forget their own Glory,
for the ſake of which they often
ſwerve from the true Rules of
writing; but here all theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
ceas'd; the Work is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb facs="tcp:62365:9"/>
to thoſe whoſe Intereſt it
was to conceal it: And for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelf, it may be ſaid, it was
rather his Legacy than any deſire
of ſhewing his Abilities, which by
other Pieces of his were already
ſufficiently publiſh'd to the World.
But what an <hi>Idea</hi> muſt we have
of that Man whom a <hi>Venetian
Senate</hi> not only admitted to their
Debates, but conſulted upon the
whole Frame of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
a <hi>Senate,</hi> I ſay, juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Titles of <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
<hi>Great;</hi> who have maintain'd
their State for 1200 years, with
little alteration; who have been
a Bulwark to the Chriſtian World
againſt the moſt potent Invader
that ever was; who at the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:62365:9"/>
time have ſtruggled with all the
Chriſtian Princes united, and
headed, even by Popes, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
power alone has been able
to ſubvert greater Empires: This
<hi>Senate,</hi> or at leaſt the wiſeſt of
them, the <hi>Inquiſitors of State,</hi>
who have the whole Executive
Power in their hands, cannot let
this Subject of theirs leave the
World without having from him
a Scheme of their preſent Affairs,
and a proſpect of the Occurrences
to come: Nothing certainly can
give us a greater <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Padre
Paulo,</hi> nor ſhew us how great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
in the moſt retired and
concealed Subjects, will break
out in all wiſe Governments, and
cannot long be conceal'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62365:10"/>
As to the work it ſelf, I ſhall
ſay little, it being improper to
foreſtall the Reader's Judgment
by mine; but I think I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to give him ſome cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a ſurpriſe, from ſome bold
Maxims and arbitrary Poſitions
which he will meet with, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not expect from one of our
Author's Profeſſion, nor in the
Methods of a Government which
carries the ſpecious and popular
Title of <hi>Liberty</hi> in the Head of
it. As to the Author, tho he were a
religious man, and a very ſtrict
obſerver of that Life; yet being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ordinary methods, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Mind elevated beyond his
ſphere, he thought, that not only
he might, but that he ought to go
<pb facs="tcp:62365:10"/>
to the Extent of his Capacity,
when he was to adviſe thoſe whom
God Almighty had inveſted with
Soveraign Power. This makes

Moſt people have an <hi>Idea</hi> of

which <hi>Poets</hi> and young people

they fancy, that without either la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

paſt their time in the Innocent

liberty, precarious, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their Votes, free from
oppreſſion and ſlavery, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

this is a very wrong Conception;
they are inveſted with Soveraign

            <p>I Write by Obedience to your
Lordſhip's Commands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reflection upon my own
ſmall Abilities, becauſe the
Chief Conſideration of a
Subject ought to be to obey his

            </p>
            <p>Your Excellencies have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to deliver my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62365:13"/>
how the <hi>Venetian Republick</hi>
ought to regulate it ſelf, to hope
for a perpetual Duration. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a true Notion of this, it will
be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh, and
firſt to regulate the Government of
the City, in which will be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the manner of keeping the
Nobles and the Citizens to their
Duty; then look abroad to the reſt
of your Dominions: and laſtly give
ſome Form to the dealing with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I might
in ſhort put you in mind of the
Saying of St. <hi>Bernardino</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi>
to the <hi>Doge Moro,</hi> who ſaid, That
the Republick ſhould continue ſo
long as they ſhould keep to the
Rule of doing Exact Juſtice; but
to come nearer to the matter, and
the Condition of theſe Times, we
muſt reduce under that Head of
Juſtice, all that contributes to the
Service of the State; and, to ſpeak
yet more ſuccinctly, we will lay it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62365:13"/>
down as a Maxim, <hi>That all is
just which is any ways neceſſary
for the maintaining of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the particular Government
of the City, 'tis an excellent Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to lay the Impoſitions as well
upon the Nobility, as the reſt of
the Citizens. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the
Burden is leſs when it is general:
And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe 'tis juſt
when 'tis without Partiality. There
is no doubt but it leſſens ſomething
of the Splendor of the Nobility to
ſee them tax'd particularly, ſince
in many Governments the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry, though they are
Subjects, and not part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
do nevertheleſs enjoy a
Freedom from Taxes, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more with their Sword than
Purſe, towards the Publick Charge:
But ſince the Ancient Simplicity of
our Anceſtors has patiently ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this Yoak; and becauſe the
Priviledges of the Sword are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62365:14"/>
in a Commonwealth, I
think 'tis adviſable not to innovate
in this Point, becauſe ſuch a change
would give too much offence to
the reſt of your People, and too
much Haughtineſs to your own
Nobility. 'Tis true, that when the
Taxes are upon the Lands, ſo as to
be unavoidable, it would be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to give the Nobility all the
advantage of time for payment,
and at laſt, if they are inſolvent, it
will not be amiſs to neglect the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Exaction of the Law, that
ſo the Nobility be not ruin'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Extreams are always dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and the Republick may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
as much from having too many
poor Noblemen, as from having too
many rich ones; beſides the Envy
and Jealouſie that muſt be in the
hearts of thoſe who ſhall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
naked, and their Equals cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Garments, and that
only for not having been able to
pay an Impoſition laid upon them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62365:14"/>
by other Peoples Contrivance.</p>
            <p>There are ſome, who not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a right Judgment of things,
do inveigh extreamly againſt a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of this Republick, which is
the having ſo many Offices and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſo ſmall Revenue, that thoſe
who enjoy them are almoſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to be corrupt; and ſo after
they have been Judges and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
forc'd to come under the
laſh of the Law, or to juſtifie their
Integrity, if they can: This ſeems
a notorious Abuſe, and carries with
it ſome appearance. But however,
I ſhould never adviſe to make theſe
Imployments better, becauſe there
reſults from this another greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the State, which is to
keep the ſmall Nobility under; for
they may be compar'd to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which cannot exert its Poyſon
when 'tis numm'd with Cold: And
if theſe Nobles, who are by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
diſcontented, ſhould once
arrive but to a Mediocrity in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62365:15"/>
they would preſently conteſt
with the great ones, and by ſtrength
of their Numbers play ſome ill
Trick to the Government: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now they are kept to their Duty,
not only by Poverty, which clips
the Wings of Ambition, but alſo
by being ſubject to the Cenſure of
the great ones, for having misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themſelves in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Indead I could think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to proceed againſt them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
coldly, unleſs they are guilty
of very great Enormities, ſuch as
ſcandalize the generality of your
Subjects; for then 'tis neceſſary to
ſhew a publick reſentment: But
otherwiſe I would have them hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
gently, it being a kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to lye open to a Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And indeed I would never have
any Nobleman, though never ſo
guilty, be condemned to a Publick
Infamous Death, becauſe the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
that reſults from thence upon
the whole Order of the Nobility,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62365:15"/>
when they are ſeen to paſs through
the Hands of an Hangman, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the Good of a Publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
can avail. Neither on the
other ſide would I have theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
thus guilty, to walk the
Streets, and be ſeen in publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then your Subjects would
conceive a ſiniſter Opinion of
your Juſtice; but they ſhould be
kept in Priſon, or, if it be neceſſary,
be privately diſpatch'd.</p>
            <p>If theſe Criminals fly from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
then you may uſe the utmoſt
ſeverity in your baniſhing of them;
becauſe then it appears, that if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more be done, nothing more
was feaſible; and let the ſame Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
be obſerv'd in keeping them
out: for ſince they are, as it were,
gangreen'd Members cut off from
the Body, it will not be expedient
to unite them again to it with defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the whole.</p>
            <p>Here I foreſee I ſhall be cenſur'd
by ſome, as a bad Pilot, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62365:16"/>
to ſhun <hi>Scylla,</hi> runs
upon <hi>Carybdis;</hi> that is, while I aim
at keeping the ſmall Nobility under,
I forget the danger may ariſe from
the Great, and the Rich of that
Order. I ſee the Objection, but
do not value it; and my Reaſon is,
the long Obſervation I have made
of the Nature of this City, by
the ſtrength of which I dare boldly
affirm, that the Republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
will never come to its end by
that which has ruin'd all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks,
to wit, when the power
has been reduc'd firſt into a few
hands, and then their Authority
devolv'd upon one who has erected
a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The ſtrange Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that reigns here among the
great ones, even among thoſe of
the ſame Family; nay, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Brothers themſelves, does ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Government from this
danger; and if by a Suppoſition,
almoſt impoſſible, all the Brothers
of one Family had the power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62365:16"/>
them of making a Dictator, I
am confident they would never
agree to chuſe one among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but would rather chuſe to be
a part of the Government, divided
among a Thouſand Gentlemen,
than to be Princes of the Blood, and
Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Great Governments, called
<hi>Governments of Expence,</hi> and ſo
contriv'd on purpoſe by our prudent
Anceſtors, to give an occaſion to
thoſe who are too rich to leſſen
their Riches; ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of according to the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their firſt Inſtitution: That
is to ſay, not to thoſe who have
no means to ſuſtain ſuch a Burden,
and muſt be forc'd by conſequence
to compaſs them <hi>per fas &amp; nefas;</hi>
and if they are Honeſt, muſt do
it fooliſhly, becauſe they are not
wicked enough to do it knaviſhly,
and ſo either acquire the Hatred of
thoſe they govern, or be laugh'd
at, and contemned by them. This
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62365:17"/>
is a Point of great Importance; and
he who goes through ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
meanly, and without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
demerits extreamly of his
Countrey, becauſe he renders the
Perſon that repreſents the State
contemptible; and all Rebellions of
Subjects have had their firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Riſe from the Contempt of the
Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The Conteſts that happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Nobleman and Nobleman of
equal Fortunes, and are follow'd
by Attempts upon one another,
may be conniv'd at when they are
reconcil'd; but if the thing be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Nobleman of the Better
ſort, and one of the Leſſer, let it
be chaſtis'd with ſome appearance
of Severity at leaſt, for fear the
Humours of the ſmall Nobility
ſhould be ſtirr'd; But if one of
theſe ſhall attack a Nobleman of
the Firſt Rate, let him be puniſh'd
with a heavy hand, leſt the Party
injur'd, being potent in Friends, go
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62365:17"/>
about to do himſelf Juſtice, to the
great detriment of the Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
But if a Nobleman do
commit an Enormity towards a
Subject, firſt let there be all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
poſſible uſed to juſtifie him;
and if that cannot be, let the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
be with more Noiſe than
Harm; But if a Subject inſults a
Nobleman, let the Revenge be ſharp
and publick, that the Subjects may
not accuſtom themſelves to lay
hands upon the Nobility, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think them Venerable and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
            <p>In Civil Judicatures it would be
requiſite to act without Paſſion, to
take away that ill Opinion that
Men have of the Partiality of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
in favour of the Great. This
Belief muſt be deſtroyed; for a
Subject that once thinks himſelf
prejudg'd by the Quality of his
Adverſary, will never be capable
of ſeeing whether his Cauſe has
been decided according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62365:18"/>
of it or no: Therefore there can
never be too much diligence uſed in
the Adminiſtration of Civil Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures,
which are one of the
greateſt Foundations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for when a Subject can ſay
to himſelf, That he ſhall have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
if his Caſe deſerves it, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to a great many other Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
without repining: And on the
contrary, though after an unjuſt
Sentence, he ſhould be indulg'd in
ſome Criminal Matter, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have a Love for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe the Injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
will ſtick in his Memory,
and the Indulgence will vaniſh out
of it.</p>
            <p>The Quarrels between the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
may be judged according to
the common courſe of Juſtice,
which may there appear in its
Natural Being, there ariſing no
Politick Grounds to diſturb the
Courſe of it; nay, rather their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Animoſities are to be fomented,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62365:18"/>
as <hi>Cato</hi> us'd to do in his Family;
and for this Reaſon, wiſe Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
permitted the Encounters and
Battles that are ſtill practis'd in
this City, between ſeveral Parties
of the People; But all Aſſemblies
of numerous Bodies are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
as the Plague, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſooner overturn the
<hi>Commonwealth,</hi> than the Facility the
People may meet with in getting
together to confer or debate about
their Grievances; Nay, this thing
is ſo dangerous, that it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
and abhorr'd, even in the
<hi>Nobility,</hi> becauſe that there being
in all Bodies ſome ill Humours, if
they are not united, either they do
not work at all, or do not work ill;
But if they once are in a Maſs, and
take their courſe one way, they
not only are hard to cure, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
prove mortal to the Body. Let
there be a careful watch upon all
Seditious Diſcourſes, nay, upon all
Speculative ones that ſeem any way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62365:19"/>
to cenſure the Government; and
ſet before your Eyes the Example
of Hereſies, which have never ſo
much waſted the Church as when
they have had their Beginnings from
Curioſity and Jeſts.</p>
            <p>Let the City <hi>Arſenal</hi> be kept up,
though there be not preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, becauſe things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon Time, muſt be anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by time. Let the Maſters and
Tradeſmen of the place be kept ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and upon any Fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
let the Puniſhment be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
that is, with ſeeming Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
but not ſuch as to make
them run away; for, if poſſible,
they are to believe the Fable of the
Mouſe, who thought its hole to be
all the World.</p>
            <p>Let the Publick Secretaries, and
all other Officers that muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the Publick Concerns, be
choſen with care, as like to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diligent; but when once
admitted, though they ſhould prove
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62365:19"/>
otherwiſe, let them be born withal,
becauſe there is need of but a few to
do well: But every ſingle Officer
can do hurt; and it's much eaſier
to defend ones ſelf from a Potent
Foreign Enemy, than from an ill-meaning
Servant.</p>
            <p>Let the Manufactures which are
peculiar to <hi>Venice,</hi> be preſerv'd; and
to that end let them not be loaded
with many Impoſitions, becauſe
that Profit and Gain which has
made Men venture through a
Thouſand Difficulties, to diſcover
New Worlds, will ſtill carry the
Merchant, if he cannot have it at
home, to ſeek it abroad, though
he go to the <hi>Antipodes</hi> for it. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Artiſts therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that moſt Arts are a kind
of Phantaſtick Being.</p>
            <p>The Marriages between Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Women of the City, may
be tolerated, if the Women are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich; becauſe it often happens
that the Induſtry of many Years
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62365:20"/>
of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> ſerves only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the Houſe of a Nobleman;
and it is a gentle Imperceptible ſort
of Uſurpation; 'tis true, 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
abating of the Luſtre of the
Noble Families; but that is only in
abſtract and in general, but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
it advantages the Nobility;
and there need be no fear that the
Children be degenerate and baſe,
becauſe nothing ſo debaſes a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as Poverty: Beſides, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
from this another great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which is, to make the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
concern'd by Affection for the
Nobility, and bound to ſtudy their
advantage by a much ſweeter tye
than that of Obedience.</p>
            <p>Let the Conſiderable Honours of
the Commonwealth be diſpoſed of
to thoſe who may naturally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to them, for having gone
through the many Employments,
which are ſteps to the higheſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
making always an allowance
for extraordinary Merit, in which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62365:20"/>
the State can never be too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal:
For otherwiſe to prefer thoſe
who cannot reckon themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Lawful Pretenders, gives
juſt Offence to the others his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
and likewiſe ſtrengthens the
pretenſions of the unworthy, who
not ſeeing any thing in that Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Man that exceeds their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Talent, cannot imagine why
he ſhould be preferr'd, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the like Dignities. The
Subject on the other hand is hardly
brought to pay Exceſſive Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
where they never us'd to
give but ordinary Reſpect; and
from this argues, That the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it ſelf is not of ſo much value,
ſince it is beſtowed upon ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Perſon.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is in the Nature
of all ſublunary things to have a
mixture of Imperfection, I muſt
own, that the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi>
has likewiſe its Defects; and the
Chief one is, That the Body of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62365:21"/>
Nobility is too numerous to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocratical;</hi>
therefore it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be expedient to contrive, by
all Arts imaginable, that the
Great Council do delegate the
greateſt Authority that may be
to the Senate and the Council of
<hi>Ten:</hi> But this muſt be done by
ſecret imperceptible ways, ſuch as
ſhall not be diſcover'd till after 'tis
done, becauſe when they have once
for all parted with their power, it
will be a happy ſettlement of the
deliberating part, and if the ſame
can be compoſed in the Judiciary
and diſtributive Power, it may be
hop'd, that the Conſtitution of the
State will be more vigorous: It
cannot be denied but the Great
Council does reliſh very much of
the <hi>Mobile,</hi> and by conſequent,
ſubject to impetuous Deliberations,
not always weigh'd in the Ballance
of Prudence and Experience. And
truly I admire, that wiſe Antiquity
did not gain this Point, it being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62365:21"/>
eaſie for them to take advantage
of the ſimplicity of their times;
or at leaſt to have prolong'd the
time of the great Magiſtratures
further than from Year to Year,
at the end of which they now
muſt have a new Confirmation
from the Senate; For this being
deſign'd to prevent the falling into
the Tyranny of the great ones,
does unawares run the State into
that of the meaner ſort, ſo much
the more odious by how much 'tis
more numerous and unexperienc'd;
We ſhould ſee more vigorous Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
in the Senators, if they
were not continually obliged to
court the Favour of the <hi>Piazza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office of <hi>Avogadore</hi> is to be
diſpoſed of with extream Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
and that to Perſons of
Eminency, ſuch as have no need of
fawning upon the Multitude of the
Great Council, and then the Senate
and Council of <hi>Ten</hi> might make
ſome ſteps beyond their Natural

Authority, which would be born
with patience, and Time would
give them Preſcription: Whereas,
if an <hi>Avogadore,</hi> to make himſelf
Popular, ſhall carry theſe Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to the Great Councils Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
immediately out of Jealouſie
they are annull'd, though never
ſo expedient. Therefore if that
Office of <hi>Avogadore</hi> cannot be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the hands of one who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
more to the <hi>Patritian</hi> than
to the <hi>Popular</hi> ſide, it would be well
to give it to one of mean Spirit, and
a quiet Temper; or if it be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of to an unquiet bold man, let
him be one who lies under ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
imputation of Corruption,
or other Enormity, to the end that
the firſt may not be able, nor the
latter dare to affront, and try it
with the Grandees of the State;
Otherwiſe an <hi>Avogadore</hi> of Parts,
Integrity and Malignity, may eaſily
ſet fire to the Four Corners of the
Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62365:22"/>
For the ſame Reaſons it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be well to leſſen the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Quaranties,</hi> they being
naturally popular. They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
numerous, to prevent the
Venality of Juſtice; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand they are ſubject to gather
peccant Humours, and afford too
much nouriſhment to a Feveriſh
Temper: They may be born with
in the adminiſtration of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
but in Criminals their power
ſhould be leſſen'd, which may
be done by the Council of
<hi>Ten</hi>'s taking to their Cognizance
all Criminal Caſes that they can
any ways draw to them, and by
leaving off the Cuſtom of deliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Power of the Senate and
<hi>Signoria</hi> to theſe <hi>Quaranties,</hi> as is
now practis'd but too often. If
theſe <hi>Quaranties</hi> were quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
it would be better for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but then it would be as
neceſſary to provide ſome other way
for ſo many neceſſitous and idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62365:23"/>
It were well to uſe all means to
take from them the Authority of
judging Noblemen in Criminal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
for ſo by degrees they will loſe
many of the Priviledges affected to
the Nobility, as alſo I could wiſh
they were totally excluded from the
Senate; But that is more to be wiſh'd
than hop'd for.</p>
            <p>As for the People, let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be provided for by plenty of
things for ſuſtenance, and as cheap
as may be: For the Nature of the
Rabble is ſo malicious, that even
when ſcarcity of Proviſions comes
from the failing of the Crops, they
nevertheleſs impute it to the Malice
or Negligence of the Great ones:
So there is no way to make them
hold their peace, but to ſtop their
Mouths. Employ as many of the
People as may be in the Service of
the Publick, that ſo drawing their
Livelyhood from the Government,
they may have affection for it, and
the Numbers of the Neceſſitous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62365:23"/>
will thereby be leſſen'd: for if
Hunger and Want can make ſtrong
Towns yield, it will likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Men to venture their Lives in
deſperate Attempts, rather than lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in miſery. Yet ſtill I would
not adviſe to take any into Office
that had not firſt gain'd wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to ſubſiſt in a mediocrity; for
elſe it will be but giving him a
kind of leave to cheat, to the great
damage of the Publick.</p>
            <p>As for the Married Women of
the City, let there be care taken
to keep them honeſt; and to have
them ſo, they muſt be kept retir'd,
remembring, that the Beginnings of
all Corruption in that kind are ſlight,
and proceed from a Look or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</p>
            <p>Let one Modern Abuſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
which is, that the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do take upon them to force
the People to make Agreements,
Payments, or Marriages, and not
dare to have recourſe to the Publick
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62365:24"/>
Authority, upon which this is an
Uſurpation: If this be not remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
'tis enough to cauſe another
<hi>Sicilian Veſpers:</hi> Beſides, that it is
likely to ſet all the Nobility together
by the Ears, while each will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his own Friends and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
            <p>In all Occurrences where the
Publick Faith is engaged, let it be
inviolably kept, without minding
any preſent advantage that might
accrew by the breaking of it; for
that is but momentaneous: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Benefit of keeping Faith is
eternal; and a Prince that breaks
his Word, muſt invent a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to make himſelf be believed
another time, ſeeing the Oaths
he made in the Religion he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
have not been able to bind
him.</p>
            <p>Let the Nobles forbear all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
for a State that will have
Merchants, muſt not have their
Governours exerciſe that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62365:24"/>
becauſe the Merchants will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be afraid of being Brow-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Bargains, and over-aw'd in
their Dealings. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who have ſo little kindneſs for the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Government, have not a
more odious Name than to call it,
<hi>A Republick of Merchants.</hi> By an
Ancient Law, a Nobleman tax'd
with Trading, cannot enter into
a Turnament, as not being fit
Company for <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
may in a ſhort time either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
enrich, or totally ruine a
Family, both which are dangerous
for the Commonwealth. Beſides,
a Merchant is of a neceſſity in ſome
meaſure a Foreigner, while his
Trade and Intereſt lies abroad, and
a Nobleman ought to have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
nor Affection but at home. If
Politicians have taught, that it is
not ſafe for a great City to have
too ſumptuous Palaces and Villas in
its Territory, leſt the fear of loſing
of them ſhould incline them to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62365:25"/>
yield the very City to a potent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy:
What ſhall we ſay of thoſe
Nobles, who, being engag'd in
Trade, may have many Thouſands
of Crowns in an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
In the beginnings of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
Merchandiſing was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to get out of Poverty, and
now 'tis dangerous, as being the
Fomenter of too much Luxury.
The <hi>Genoueſes</hi> who have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
the Trading of their Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
have but ſmall Reſpect ſhew'd
them by other Princes, and are
more valued one by one than alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Let ſuperfluous Pomps be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
though if they were only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Rich, it would be of
uſe to the Government, becauſe it
would bleed thoſe who are too ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine;
but by reaſon of the Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which is between thoſe of
the ſame Degree, the permitting of
them would prove ruinous to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Families, who could neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62365:25"/>
them, nor go through with
them: And whoever by a Punctilio
of Honour is brought to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of doing more than he is able,
muſt uſe, to compaſs it, ſuch means
as he ought not to employ.</p>
            <p>Before a Law be made and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated,
let it be well thought on
and debated: but being once made,
let it be obſerved, and the <hi>non</hi>-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of it puniſhed; becauſe
whoever ſuffers Diſobedience in
ſmall matters, teaches it in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
And that Nobleman who thinks
to diſtinguiſh himſelf by ſlighting
of the Laws, offends both his
Country and himſelf by ſuch an
Example, more than by any diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs
he could be guilty of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he directly ſtrikes at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority; and beſides, ſuch a
Cuſtom once taking Root in a
Commonwealth, and being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
Abuſe among the Nobility,
it is not to be reform'd with leſs than
the loſs of the Lives of half the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62365:26"/>
If there be an occaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome Reſolution that may
be thought unpleaſing to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,
particularly in point of
Juſtice, let it be given out, That
it was carried by a thin Majority,
that at leaſt they who were againſt
it, may pleaſe themſelves in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they had many of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Let the Secrets of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be kept inviolably, and do not
forget that Ancient Record of the
<hi>Venetian Circumſpection,</hi> which was,
That when the general <hi>Carmagnuola</hi>
was condemned, the Reſolution
(though taken by Three Hundred
and Fifteen Senators) never took
Air for Eight Months together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Execution; which is a
thing that the moſt abſolute Princes
could not have met with in the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Three or Four State-Miniſters,
though bound by exceſſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Secreſy. And what a
wonderful thing was the depoſition
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62365:26"/>
of the <hi>Doge Foſcari,</hi> conceal'd by
his own Brother? Certainly one
cannot without Tears obſerve, that
in our Times ſo great a Quality
which ſeem'd to be proper to the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Commonwealth, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
altered by the inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the young Nobility, who,
not out of Diſloyalty, but too much
Freedom, do let things ſlip from
them which ought to be conceal'd.
I think every <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman
ought to teach his Children the uſe
of Secreſie with their Catechiſm;
but the better way were to forbid
all talking of Public Concerns out
of the place where they are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be deliberated on, and much leſs
among thoſe who are partakers of
the Secret.</p>
            <p>Let the Honours and Dignities of
the Commonwealth be diſpenſed
regularly, and by degrees, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ſudden Flights, becauſe they
are dangerous: To ſee a Cloud en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd
of a ſudden, is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62365:27"/>
a ſign of a Thunderbolt to
come out of it; and he that from
a private man leaps in an inſtant to
the Port of a Prince, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Player. Honours gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by degrees keep the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
from attaining them before
they are ripe for them; and we
may obſerve, that as in Phyſick a
man moderately Learned, but well
Experienc'd, is ſafer for the health
of the Body Natural; So in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Commonwealth,
a man often employed, though,
perhaps of leſs acuteneſs, ſucceeds
beſt. All Matters of Benefices are
very properly under the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Great Council, but it
would be as proper to take away
all Appeals to the <hi>Quaranties,</hi> and
place them in the Senate, becauſe
it often happens, that theſe Cauſes
are to be decided according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of State; and thoſe <hi>Quarantia
Judges</hi> put little value upon thoſe
Politick Reaſons: And beſides, it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62365:27"/>
ſeems a great incongruity, that a
Sentence, where the Perſon of the
<hi>Doge,</hi> and the whole <hi>Signoria,</hi> both
intervene, ſhould afterwards be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Cenſure of Forty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of leſſer value. I believe if it
were obſerved to chaſtiſe rigorouſly,
but ſecretly all thoſe Lawyers and
their Clients, who carry theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the <hi>Quarantias,</hi> the uſe of
them would be leſs frequent, and in
time they would be forborn, as if
they were forbidden.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould fall out, that any of
your Subjects ſhould procure a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in the <hi>Rota,</hi> or Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
you muſt rigorouſly command from
him a Renunciation <hi>ab Impetratis,</hi>
elſe all beneficiary Cauſes will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are
look'd upon as Sacred, and ſo a
fourth part of all Civil Cauſes would
be loſt for your own Courts: Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the <hi>Rota</hi> are to be with the
Commonwealth, like Biſhops <hi>in
partibus Infidelium,</hi> a thing of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62365:28"/>
Title, but without Subjects.</p>
            <p>Let the Biſhops of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
State be always praecogniz'd in the
Conſiſtory by a <hi>Venetian Cardinal,</hi>
without the Circumſtance of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him Special Procurator; but as
Protector, which he really ought
to be as other <hi>Cardinals</hi> brag they
are ſo, for other States. For the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to avoid theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curations
to <hi>Venetian</hi> Cardinals,
would perhaps deſiſt making any
of that Nation, that ſo they might
oblige the State to have recourſe to
Strangers, which in time would alſo
prejudice the pretence of being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as <hi>Crown'd Heads.</hi> If the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniſation
be made otherwiſe, let
the State ſeize the Temporalities of
the Biſhoprick, and ſtop all Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
laid upon it: 'Tis true, that if
the Cardinal <hi>Nipote</hi> ſhould make
the Preconiſation, and enjoy at the
ſame time the priviledge of a <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Nobleman, it could not well be
rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62365:28"/>
If it ſhould ever happen that
there ſhould be a <hi>Pope,</hi> I won't ſay
a <hi>Venetian,</hi> for that would be of
more danger than advantage to
the Government, but a Foreigner
well inclin'd to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
then would be the time to
obtain once for all the Grant of the
<hi>Tenths</hi> upon the Clergy, as once it
was got under <hi>Clement</hi> the Sixth,
whoſe Bull is unfortunately loſt;
for 'tis troubleſome to get it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
every Five Year or Seven
Year; and it would be a Point
gain'd which ſtill would more and
more equal the Republick with
Crown'd Heads; as alſo if in the
Titles given by the <hi>Pope</hi> to the
<hi>Doge,</hi> there could be gain'd the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative,
as <hi>Cariſſimo</hi> or <hi>Dilectiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
as is uſual to Crown'd Heads,
it would be a new luſtre to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
which for want of theſe
things, and alſo becauſe that never
any <hi>Venetian Nuncio</hi> was promoted
to be Cardinal, is look'd upon at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62365:29"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> as a kind of Third Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Crown'd Heads and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
State. If, I ſay, all this could be
gain'd by the State from a <hi>Pope,</hi>
there might be ſome return made,
by making a Law, That Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Criminals ſhould not be
judged by any Tribunal but the
Council of <hi>Ten,</hi> or Delegates from
that Council. And now I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Council, I cannot but
inculcate, That all means poſſible
ſhould be uſed to hinder an <hi>Avoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
from daring to carry the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of the Council of <hi>Ten</hi> to be
re-view'd or cenſur'd by any other
Council: but rather, if there ought
to be any Change made in them, let
it be by the ſame Power that made
them; otherwiſe the Conſequence
will be a conſtant annihilation of
their Decrees, and a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the great Nobility,
with an Exaltation of the leſſer.</p>
            <p>Touching the Authority of this
Council, I have this more to ſay,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62365:29"/>
That I could wiſh, that the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of its Power were leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
with great regard to the
Dignity of the Perſons, as well as
to the Splendor of the Government,
which is always more reverenced
when it is leaſt communicated, like
the Sun-beams, which in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body are of Gold, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Moon, are but of
Silver. Indeed our Anceſtors would
have deſerved well of us, if they
had lengthened the time of this
Magiſtracy: but becauſe that which
was not done in thoſe Old Times,
can hardly be hop'd in theſe
Modern ones, the only Remedy
would be to obtain a Continuation
of the ſame perſons for another
year, under pretext of avoiding ſo
many various Elections in ſo ſhort a
time as muſt be made by a Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the <hi>Pregadi:</hi> 'Tis true, that
would exempt the perſons continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Governments of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
but as long as that Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62365:30"/>
did not extend beyond a year,
there would be little Inconvenience
in it: And if it be objected, That
this would too much ſtrengthen the
Authority of the great ones, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That it laſting but a few
months, could not be of ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
and on the other ſide, thoſe
hands are, as it were, tied up,
which ought to be at liberty to
do Juſtice, while every week they
may be canvaſs'd and teas'd by a
Party of mean Perſons, both for
the Conditions of their Mind and
Fortune: I have often admired
how the Council of <hi>Ten</hi> (having
already all the Criminal Power,
and a good part of the Judiciary in
Civil Cauſes, as well as in State-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs)
have ſuffered themſelves to
be thus fetter'd, it ſeeming to me
almoſt impoſſible that the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſort ſhould at the time of this
Modification have ſo far prevail'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the middling Nobility, as to
make them forget, that it is much
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62365:30"/>
better obeying a few Great Ones,
than a Multitude of Inferiours.
The Prudence of the Great Ones
muſt be awak'd, to take all ſecret
advantage to repair theſe paſt Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
by means not eaſily penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Let Vertue be eſteem'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is; and if it be Eminent
in one who is not Noble, let it
find a Regard; for he has made
himſelf Noble; and all Hereditary
Nobility has had its beginning
from ſome perſonal Eminency.
And thus much for the Firſt
Head.</p>
            <p>The Second Head, which is
concerning the Government of
your Subjects, may be divided
into thoſe who confine upon the
Sea, and in your Iſlands, and thoſe
of <hi>Terra Firma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, there needs not
much Speculation; for they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
only upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> and there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62365:31"/>
being among them but few Perſons
of Note or Riches, there remains
nothing but to ſhew your ſelves juſt
by giving them good Rulers; and
there you ought to be very careful:
for if they have Juſtice and Plenty,
they will never think of changing
their Maſters: Thoſe few of <hi>Iſtria</hi>
and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> that confine upon
the Emperour, have not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any Qualities to waken your
Jealouſie, and are beſides well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioned
to the Government of the
Republick.</p>
            <p>For your <hi>Greek</hi> Subjects of the
Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the other
Iſlands of the <hi>Levant,</hi> there is no
doubt but there is ſome greater
regard to be had of them, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the <hi>Greek</hi> Faith is never
to be truſted; and perhaps they
would not much ſtick at ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the <hi>Turk,</hi> having the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all the reſt of their Nation
before their Eyes: Theſe therefore
muſt be watch'd with more attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62365:31"/>
leſt, like Wild Beaſts, as they
are, they ſhould find an occaſion to
uſe their Teeth and Claws; the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
way is to keep good Garriſons
to awe them, and not uſe them to
Arms or Muſters, in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſiſted by them in an Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
for they will always ſhew
ill Inclinations proportionably to
the Strength they ſhall be Maſters
of, they being of the Nature of
the Gally-Slaves, who, if they
were well us'd, would return the
kindneſs, by ſeizing the Gally, and
carry it and its Commander to
<hi>Algiers:</hi> Wine and Baſtonadoes
ought to be their Share, and keep
Good Nature for a better occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>As for the Gentlemen of thoſe
Collonies, you muſt be very
watchful of them; for beſides the
Natural Ferocity of the Climate,
they have the Character of <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
which raiſes their Spirits, as
the frequent Rebellions of <hi>Candia</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62365:32"/>
do ſufficiently evidence. The uſe
of Colonies was advantageous to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, becauſe
they preſerv'd even in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,
Roman</hi> Inclinations, and with
them a kindneſs for their Country.
If the Gentlemen of theſe Colonies
do tyrannize over the Villages of
their Dominion, the beſt way is
not to ſeem to ſee it, that there
may be no kindneſs between them
and their Subjects; but if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in any thing elſe, 'twill be
well to chaſtiſe them ſeverely,
that they may not brag of any
Priviledges more than others: It
will not be amiſs likewiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
all their Pretenſions to any
particular Juriſdiction; and if at
any time their Nobility or Title be
diſputed, it will do well to ſell them
the Confirmation of it at as dear a
Rate as poſſible: and, in a word,
remember that all the Good that
can come from thence is already
obtain'd, which was <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62365:32"/>
Dominion; and for the future
there is nothing but Miſchief to be
expected from them.</p>
            <p>As for the Subjects of <hi>Terra Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
there is required a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
way of governing, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
thoſe who by an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Inclination are well affected to
the Republick, as thoſe of <hi>Breſcia,
Crema,</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and alſo thoſe
of <hi>Vicenza;</hi> for to them there
ought to be ſuitable returns of
kindneſs made upon occaſion to the
others, who only have a kindneſs
of Obedience, ſuch as are the
<hi>Veroneſes, Padouans</hi> and <hi>Trevigians,</hi>
it will be good to make ſhew of
great Juſtice towards them, but not
let ſlip any occaſion of keeping
them low: It is good to wink at
the Fewds and Enmities that happen
among them, for from theſe two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
ariſe to the Commonwealth,
to wit, Private Diſcord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and good Confiſcations to the
Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62365:33"/>
Let all Extortions and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
committed by the Gentry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the People, be ſeverely puniſhed,
that the People may be affectionate
to the Government, as being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
protected by it: In all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of Taxes and Impoſitions,
ſuffer not any Remonſtrances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
how in 1606. there had
like to have been a League between
the <hi>Breſcian</hi> and <hi>Veroneze,</hi> in order
to obtain an Abolition of Impoſts,
and with what boldneſs the <hi>Breſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Embaſſadours made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in the Senate: It was a very
previous Diſpoſition to a Rebellion;
Therefore it will be fit to let them
know, That if the State think good
to lay a Tax, there is no way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
it. Thoſe who in the
Councils of theſe Towns, are of
a reſolute Nature, and ſomewhat
refractory to the Orders of the
State, you muſt either ruin or
oblige, even at the Publick
Charge: For a ſmall Leven is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62365:33"/>
to ferment a great Maſs of
Bread.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Breſcians</hi> have a Priviledge
which you muſt infringe upon all
fit opportunities, which is, <hi>That
no Eſtates of</hi> Breſcians <hi>can be bought
but by</hi> Breſcians <hi>themſelves:</hi> For if
the <hi>Venetians</hi> could extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that moſt fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
in a few years it would be
as it is now with the <hi>Padouans,</hi> who
have ſcarce a Third of their own
Country left them. In the Caſe
of a Rich Heireſs, it will be well
to endeavour, by all fair means, to
marry her with ſome of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Nobility, to enrich them, and
impoveriſh the others. Let their
Governours be choſen among thoſe
of the higheſt Spirits of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Nobility, that they may in
them venerate the Prince: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man naturally gives more
Credit to his Eyes than to his
Ears. Obſerve however this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Taxing, That you do not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62365:34"/>
thereby hinder Plenty: For though
men may be perſwaded to part with
Superfluities, yet not with what is
neceſſary for Life. As for Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if there be room, omit not
to give them to the Natives, but
ſtill in places remote from their
own Dwelling, and keep them
there as long as may be, that they
may loſe their Intereſt at home. If
there be Heads of Factions among
them, they muſt be Exterminated
any way; but if you have them
in Priſon, 'tis better to uſe Poyſon
than the Hangman, becauſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
will be the ſame, and the
<hi>odium</hi> leſs. You muſt have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Taxes that their
Neighbours the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> undergo,
and ſtill let thoſe of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Subjects be ſomething lighter in
compariſon; and moreover let
them be free from quartering of
Souldiers, which is in it ſelf the
heavieſt of all Tyrannical Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62365:34"/>
Let the great Crimes be ſtill
brought before the Council of
<hi>Ten,</hi> that the Veneration for the
Power at diſtance may be greater,
and likewiſe becauſe the Miniſters
of Juſtice will be leſs ſubject to be
corrupted, when the Criminals are
in the Priſons of the State. Let
the Proceſs againſt them be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
that ſo the <hi>ſlowneſs</hi> of
proceedings may be ſome part
of puniſhment: But for the
<hi>Banditi,</hi> if they dare to appear
in the State, let them be Extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with all Induſtry; for there
cannot be a greater Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Contempt in the Subject,
and Weakneſs of the Prince, than
for a Condemned Man to dare to
come into the Dominions out of
which he has been baniſhed, as if
one ſhould frequent another man's
Houſe in ſpight of his Teeth.
The Biſhopricks and other Church-Preferments
may be conferr'd upon
the Natives, firſt, to avoid the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62365:35"/>
of too much <hi>Avarice</hi> in
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, if they
ſhould take all Preferments to
themſelves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In order to
debaſe the Spirits of the Natives,
and turn them off from Arms to
an idle Life: Beſides, it will be a
kind of a Shadow of Liberty, to
make them bear their Subjection
the better. But as much as it may
be convenient to let them attain the
Degree of Biſhops, ſo much would
it be dangerous to let them arrive
to that of Cardinal; for then they
will be ſure to abhor the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Subjects, ſince thoſe who
wear that Purple have uſurp'd
the Precedency even over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Let every City have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their own Gentry by
their Common-Council; for that
will make it ſo much the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but ſtill let them be bound
to have the Confirmation from the
Senate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62365:35"/>
Let all thoſe Families who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to the Service of
Foreign Princes, be upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſlighted, and not at all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by the Government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
to them by that ſilent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
That he deſerves little of his
own Prince who ſeeks Employment
with a Foreign one: And if any
of theſe who have ſerv'd abroad,
ſhould be ſo bold, as to contend
with a <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman, if it be
at <hi>Venice,</hi> let the Puniſhment be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
if he be in the wrong; but
if it is in his own Country, let it
be gentle, that the Opinion of the
Publick Juſtice may be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
inſinuated to the People;
and likewiſe, that the Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
themſelves may avoid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts,
where they are not more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
protected.</p>
            <p>Let the Citadels of the Chief
Cities be well provided, as much
againſt a Foreign Enemy, as to
chaſtiſe a Rebellion at home, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62365:36"/>
ſo much inclining to offend,
as the hopes of Impunity: and it
may indeed be ſaid, That if Men
were certain of a puniſhment to
follow, they would never offend at
all; but a Prince that is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided, is ſufficiently ſafe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that as it is very hard to
find either a Wife or a Monk, that
one time or another have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
the loſs of their Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
ſo the ſame may be ſaid of
Subjects, who fancy that they have
parted with more of that they
were born to than was neceſſary
for their well-being. And let this
ſuffice for the Second Head.</p>
            <p>Coming now to thoſe ſeveral
Princes with whom the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Republick may have Concerns,
we will begin with the <hi>Pope,</hi> as
being the firſt in Dignity, if not in
Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62365:36"/>
And here we muſt have a Two-fold
Conſideration, he being to be
look'd upon as a Spiritual and as a
Temporal Prince. There has been
ſome Advertiſements given already
about his Spiritual Power: We
will add here what was then omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt admire the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
State of that Monarchy,
which from a mean and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Condition, for the <hi>Series</hi> of
many years, in which the very
Exerciſe of Religion was puniſhed
with Death, is arriv'd to ſo much
Greatneſs, that all Regal Dignities
of the ſame Communion, pay Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to this Spiritual Monarch, by
the kiſſing of his Feet. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
has been pleaſed this way
to ſhew the Reward of Chriſtian
Religion, by raiſing to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt
Greatneſs the Inſtitutors
and Miniſters of it; but the Piety
of Chriſtian Princes has very much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62365:37"/>
tributed to it; and the firſt was
<hi>Conſtantine:</hi> This Emperor not only
embrac'd the Chriſtian Faith, but
enrich'd the Church extreamly,
and ſince his time ſeveral other
Emperors and Kings have, as it
were, vied with one another, who
ſhould give moſt: But that which
is moſt inſcrutable is, how with
their Riches they came to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
alſo their Juriſdiction and
Power.</p>
            <p>For ſix hundred years after the
coming of Chriſt the Popes were
always confirmed by the Emperors,
or in their ſteads, by the <hi>Exarcks</hi>
of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> and in the very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Confirmation there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
written theſe Words, <hi>Regnante
Tali Domino Noſtro.</hi> In the year
518. the Emperor <hi>Juſtinus</hi> ſent
from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> his Embaſſadors
to Pope <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> to confirm the
Authority of the Apoſtolical Sea,
and to announce Peace to the
Church. In 684. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62365:37"/>
Second gave to <hi>Benedictus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
a Conceſſion, by which, for
the future, the Election of Popes
ſhould be made by the Clergy and
People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhould not
need the Confirmation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
nor of the <hi>Exarck,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting,
that the holineſs of thoſe
times might come to change it ſelf
into an Intereſt of State. <hi>Bonifaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Third obtained of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Phocas,</hi> that all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches might be obedient
to the <hi>Roman.</hi> After this, in the
year 708. <hi>Juſtinus</hi> the Second was
the firſt that ſubmitted to kiſs the
Pope's Feet; and that Pope's Name
was <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> But <hi>Adrian</hi> the
firſt having received great Favours
from <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, King of
<hi>France,</hi> did in a Council of One
Hundred and Fifty Three Biſhops,
confer upon him the Authority of
chuſing the Popes, which was about
the year 773. a Priviledge which
his Son <hi>Lewis the Pious</hi> knew not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62365:38"/>
how to keep, but parted with it
for the imaginary Title of <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us;</hi>
to which might be added that of
<hi>Simple.</hi> Howſoever ſcandalous the
Emperours were in their Lives, the
Popes did uſe to bear with them,
referring to God Almighty the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of them: But in the year
713. <hi>Philip,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
being fallen into Hereſy,
was Excommunicated by Pope <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
and had the Reward due
for all the Honours and Priviledges
given by his Predeceſſors to the
Popes. This was the very firſt time
that the Imperial Power was forc'd
to ſtoop to the Papal; and yet at
the ſame time the Church of <hi>Milan</hi>
claim'd an Independency from the
<hi>Roman,</hi> and maintain'd it for above
Two Hundred Years, being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd
by the Emperours, who
often came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and in their
abſence hy the <hi>Exarcks</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi>
till at laſt in the year 1057. it yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up the Conteſt to Pope <hi>Stephen</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62365:38"/>
the Ninth. In the year 1143. <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
the Second was the firſt Pope
choſen by Cardinals in Excluſion to
the People.</p>
            <p>I have made this Narration, that
it may appear by what Degrees this
Spiritual Monarchy has increaſed;
and in it, the Goodneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes is not more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
than the Dexterity of the
Popes, in not omitting any occaſion
to gain ground.</p>
            <p>At preſent the Emperour is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by a Pontifical Bull, where the
Power of Election is committed to
the Three Eccleſiaſtical, and Four
Secular Electors, with an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nevertheleſs in the Emperour
choſen, to receive his Confirmation
and Coronation from the Pope; ſo
that the Subject is at laſt become
Prince over his own Prince, not
without ſome reflection of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon <hi>Otho</hi> the Fourth, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Germany,</hi> who in the year
994. agreed with Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62365:39"/>
ſettle the Election in this manner,
for the Honour (as he thought) of
the <hi>German</hi> Nation, but with great
Diminution of the Imperial Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To this Grandeur of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
if we add that of having
ſubjected to its power all the other
Biſhops of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to be own'd the firſt of all
the Patriarchs, who long conteſted
its Primacy. I ſay, ſo high a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ought to make all other well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
States very wary in their
proceedings with it, and to have
a careful Eye upon all thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherein the pontifical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be ſtill enlarged, becauſe
'tis obſerved, that all Courteſies and
Favours of Princes are in that
Court turn'd to Debts and Claims
in the ſpace of a few years; and to
obtain the poſſeſſion, they do not
ſpare for <hi>Exorciſms</hi> and <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>There is one Cuſtom, or rather
Abuſe introduc'd in that Court,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62365:39"/>
which deſerves great conſideration
from Princes, which is the power
the <hi>Pope</hi> has aſſum'd of depoſing
Princes and Soveraigns, and giving
their Kingdoms and States to others,
under pretext of ill Government.
The Prodigal Son in the Goſpel did
not loſe his Right to his portion,
though he was reſolv'd to diſſipate
and conſume it viciouſly, becauſe
that Title which we receive from
Nature can never be loſt in our
whole Life. The Kings of <hi>Navar</hi>
were fain to go <hi>Vagabonds</hi> about
the World for the ſake of a Bit of
Parchment which <hi>Pope Julius</hi> the
Second put out againſt them,
whereby King <hi>John</hi> the Second loſt
his Kingdom, which was given to
<hi>Ferdinand<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and had
not providence brought them to
the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> there
would have been no mention in
the World of the Kings of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62365:40"/>
From this Liberty of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Kingdoms, the <hi>Popes</hi> aſſume
that of Erecting them Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the Fourth made <hi>Ireland</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth Erected
<hi>Tuſcany</hi> into a great Dutchy. Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was depoſed
by <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and according
to the uſual cuſtom, her Kingdom
given to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi>
who was to execute the Papal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
but he met with the Winds
and Seas, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships,
which quite defeated his <hi>Armada.</hi>
In <hi>France,</hi> by a priviledge of the
<hi>Gallican</hi> Church, they admit of
no Bulls that contain Deprivation
of Kings, but keep to the Right of
Succeſſion: and indeed to depoſe
an actual King, and give away his
Kingdom, is not only to deſtroy a
ſuppos'd Delinquent, but to puniſh
an Innocent Succeſſour, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to prejudice the Right of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
in thoſe who have it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62365:40"/>
On the other hand <hi>England</hi> has
often thought fit to make it ſelf
Tributary to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> by
the <hi>Peter-Pence,</hi> the firſt time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, and more
remarkably under <hi>King John,</hi> in
1214. to avoid the Invaſion from
<hi>France;</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
himſelf once for all, and
not only refuſed the Tribute, but
made himſelf amends by ſeizing
the Church-Lands. The freſh Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth towards
this Republick is never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
who charitably would have
govern'd another bodies Houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext that the Maſter did not
underſtand how to do it himſelf:
And the conſtancy of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Republick will have given fair
warning to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
how they undertake ſuch Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
ſince they were forced to
come to an agreement with very
little ſatisfaction or Honour on
their ſide, having been obliged ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62365:41"/>
to give up their claim; for to
demand peremptorily, and then
relinquiſh the Demand, is a ſign it
was not well founded in Juſtice;
and the Abſolution refus'd, was
proof enough, that the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
was void in it ſelf: So that
the advantage that has accrew'd
to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Government from
the Conteſt, has been much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the damage ſuſtain'd in
it.</p>
            <p>If ever for the future, which I
ſcarce believe, there ſhould happen
an occaſion of an Interdict from
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
I ſhould adviſe preſently to
poſt up in <hi>Rome</hi> an Appellation
to the future Council, which is a
cruel blow to them: For firſt, it
inſinuates the Superiority of the
Council over the <hi>Pope;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it revives the memory of
Councils, and lets them ſee they
are not things quite forgot all
the World over. If there be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62365:41"/>
care taken to examine well all
Bulls that come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Obſervation of what has been
hitherto practis'd, be ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
it may be hop'd, that the
Republick ſhall not undergo any
greater Subjection than other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but rather ſhall have ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
above them, particularly
more than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
find their account in complying
with the Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they receive at the ſame
time great Favours from it, and are
proud of maintaining its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To ſay truth, the <hi>Popes</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
have ſhew'd little kindneſs
to the Republick, and except the
Priviledges granted by <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Third, which ſerve more to
regiſter to the World the Action
of the Republick, in reſtoring and
protecting him, than for any thing
elſe: For the <hi>Doge</hi> might of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without the Papal Conceſſion,
have aſſum'd thoſe other little Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62365:42"/>
of the <hi>Ombrella,</hi> the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
and the Sword: So that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Conceſſions of the <hi>Decimes</hi>
upon the Clergy, and the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to the Biſhopricks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this
Country of ours feels but ſlender
Effects of the Pontifical Kindneſs,
which may be an advantage upon
all Occurrences of Intereſt of State
to ſtick the cloſer to that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there needs no Complements
where every one deſires but his
own.</p>
            <p>In conſidering the Secular Power
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> we will do it upon Five
Heads, which may ſerve to examine
all other Princes Intereſts with the
Republick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be advantageous to the
Republick to have the Church grow
greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Title, Inclination
or Facility the Popes may have to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
any part of the State of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62365:42"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Inclination, Title
or Facility the Republick may have to
acquire any part of the State of the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Church may u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
with the Republick, to acquire
the State of any other Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If the Church can unite
with other Princes, to hinder the
progreſs of the Arme of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Firſt, we
will anſwer with a General Rule,
which is, That it never is advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to a Prince, who deſires to
remain free and powerful, to let an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
grow great, except it be to
leſſen a Third, who is greater than
them both; and if he that is thus
agrandiz'd be a Neighbour, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
is ſo much more to be
feared: Theſe Alterations indeed
may not be ſo dangerous to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Prince, who does not fear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon a great one, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62365:43"/>
being moleſted by one who
is already too ſtrong for him.</p>
            <p>But to come cloſer to the Caſe
of the Republick, we will ſay, That
if the Church could make it ſelf
Maſter of any part of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> where
he is the greateſt Prince, they
might hope for the conſent of the
Republick, which is the Second
Great <hi>Italian</hi> Potentate, becauſe by
that means the Republick might
become the Firſt; and however,
the ſtrength of the Church will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
give leſs jealouſie to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
than the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power in
<hi>Italy;</hi> for the Nature of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Principality is Elective and
Temporary, and the Aims and
Deſigns of that Court vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the ſeveral
<hi>Popes;</hi> and ſometimes it is ſubject
to long Vacancies: whereas the
Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſucceſſive,
and, as one may ſay, Eternal, and
govern'd by ſtanding laſting Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62365:43"/>
But if the Church be to grow
great by the Spoils of any other <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi>
Prince, it would be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Republick to oppoſe
it, becauſe the Damage thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
is evident, and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
dangerous. It ought to be
well conſider'd, how the State of
the Church is increaſed in this laſt
Century. The cuſtom that was
in the Church before, to give <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feodations</hi>
upon ſlight Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
had brought that power to
be more of ſhow than real ſtrength;
but <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, ſucceeding
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, made <hi>Borgia,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Volentine,</hi> Nephew to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
who had ſeiz'd upon all
thoſe <hi>Infeodations</hi> in <hi>Romania,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund
them to the Church, and add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them the conqueſt of <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and got alſo from the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
the Cities of <hi>Cervia, Rimini,
Ravenna, Faenza, Imola,</hi> and others,
to which, under <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth,
was added the whole Dutchy of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62365:44"/>
               <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and lately that of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin:</hi>
So that theſe Acquiſitions alone
would make up a great <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
and the Church ſeems to want
nothing towards the making of it
the moſt conſiderable power of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
than the addition of <hi>Parma</hi>
and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and ſome little Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Caſtles in the Territories
about <hi>Rome:</hi> Beſides, it can never
more be leſſen'd by <hi>Infeodations,</hi>
that being quite left off by that
Court: So that to let the Church
grow any greater in <hi>Italy,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſpeaking, cannot be for
the Intereſt of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>To the Second Point, <hi>What Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
Inclination or Facility the Church
may have to acquire any portion of the
State of the Republick,</hi> we ſhall
ſay, That ſince the Court makes
profeſſion of the Extreameſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and that likewiſe they are
loth to begin the Example of
Princes uſurping upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62365:44"/>
I think they can hardly ſet
up any Title but upon the <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi>
of <hi>Rovigo,</hi> which they ſay was
formerly annex'd to the Dutchy of
<hi>Ferrara;</hi> and in the times that the
Diſpute was between the Dukes of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> and the Republick, the
<hi>Popes</hi> always ſhewed themſelves
ſmart Defenders of the Dukes:
Of Four Interdicts publiſhed by
the Church againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
Two of them were for this very
cauſe, the firſt in the year 1305.
the Second in the year 1483. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, at which
time indeed the Republick had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the whole Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
by the Inſtigation of the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but he being Friends with the
Duke, commanded them to reſtore
what they had taken, which they
refuſing to do, he fulminated his
Excommunication and Interdict;
but a Peace following, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
kept by agreement the <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi>
of <hi>Rovigo:</hi> The Third Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62365:45"/>
was in 1505. under <hi>Julius</hi>
the Second, becauſe the Republick
had ſeveral Cities of <hi>Romania</hi> in
their poſſeſſions, and the laſt of all
was now lately under <hi>Paul</hi> the
Fifth: So that if the <hi>Popes</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch a concern for the thing
when it was only belonging to
the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> much more
would they do it now when the
profit would be their own: So
that we may believe that as to this
they do own a Title, and have
likewiſe inclination enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
this bit of Territory that is
lopp'd off from them. We are
therefore to conſider what Facility
they have to do it; and I do not
believe that ever of themſelves
they will kindle the fire, but make
advantage of one ready kindled by
ſome other, as it happened under
<hi>Julius</hi> the Second: Nay, if they
reflect upon the great Rule of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> they
will not for ſo ſmall a matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62365:45"/>
into a League againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
for it is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to them not to break the
Ballance of Dominion in <hi>Italy,</hi>
leſt the <hi>Tramontani</hi> ſhould take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it, and ſubdue all.</p>
            <p>But this very Reaſon was ſtrong
in Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second's time,
and yet was without Effect in a
Mind bent all upon particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
wherefore I conclude, that
we are not to expect greater Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the Modern <hi>Popes,</hi> but ought
to reſt ſatisfied, that if a powerful
Foreign Prince ſhould promiſe them
the acquiſition of the State of the
Republick, they would embrace the
motion without delay.</p>
            <p>To the Third Queſtion, I ſay,
That the Republick might have juſt
Reaſon to make themſelves amends
for the Country they loſt in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna,</hi>
it not being a thing they
had uſurp'd from the Church, but
a voluntary Dedition of thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
who were tyranniz'd over by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62365:46"/>
little Tyrants, that had taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from the Negligence of <hi>Popes</hi>
to make themſelves Maſters of
thoſe places: They were yielded
up by the Republick, to take off
<hi>Julius</hi> the Second, who was the
great Fomentour of the Fire which
was kindled againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi>
in the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi> where
the Forces of all the Princes of
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> were united againſt
them; and without doubt, upon
good circumſtances the Republick
might juſtifie the re-taking of theſe
Towns; and I believe there is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
enough to do it, all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being willing to extend their
Territories; but the point is the
Facility of doing it, which I think
altogether remote; for all other <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi>
Princes, if not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
yet out of Oſtentation of
Religion, would be backward to
fall upon the Church; and except
it ſhould happen that ſome one of
them ſhould grow too powerful for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62365:46"/>
all the others united, and ſo be able
to right himſelf, I think the State
of the Church need not fear being
leſſen'd.</p>
            <p>To the Fourth Queſtion, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in the Negative, and do not
believe that the Church would
joyn with the Republick, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the State of any other
Prince, except it were ſuch a one
as the Church had a pretence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then they would keep
all, which would not pleaſe the
Republick: Beſides, we ought to
reflect upon the <hi>Genius</hi> of the
<hi>Popedom,</hi> which being Elective,
moſt commonly the <hi>Popes</hi> have no
other aim than to keep all quiet,
and preſerve the general Reſpect of
Princes towards them, that in that
decrepit Age they may make their
Families, their thoughts being far
from enlarging a Dominion which
they expect to leave every day;
and in the mean time, all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money, which elſe they might
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62365:47"/>
lay up, would go upon projects of
a very uncertain Event: And 'tis
a wonderful thing that <hi>Julius</hi> the
Second, being of a very mean
Birth, ſhould have had ſo great
a Sence of the Publick Intereſt
of the Church, as to forego all
his private concerns, and take
the Empty Praiſes of his Courtiers
in payment for the loſs of ſuch real
advantages as he might have made
to his Family.</p>
            <p>The laſt Query depends, in a
great meaſure, upon the others. I
do not think it would be eaſie to
concert the Union of the <hi>Pope</hi>
with other Princes, in order to
attack the Republick, becauſe it
will never be advantageous to the
Church to increaſe the power of
that other Prince; neither will it
look like the Juſtice they profeſs, to
take to themſelves alone the Spoils,
except it be upon a Country on
which they have a pretence: 'Tis
true, that in thoſe noyſie Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62365:47"/>
where they deprive
Princes of their Dominions, and
give them to others that can take
them, there might be ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but they are ſeldom pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiz'd
but in an Attempt made by
a Prince upon the Church, which
is never to be feared from the Piety
and Moderation of the Republick.
There is no doubt but the Church
would enter into a League to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any progreſs of the Republick,
particularly againſt any Dependant
of theirs; and alſo in caſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
attack'd ſome ſmall Prince,
the <hi>Popes,</hi> to affect the protection
of the weak, would declare; but
if the Republick had to do with a
ſtrong Prince, the Church would
look on, for fear of greatning
too much that Prince, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe the Republick can
lay claim to none of thoſe Old
tickliſh Titles which ſome other
Princes might ſet a-foot againſt the
Church. And ſo much for the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62365:48"/>
               <hi>Now let us come to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
The Republick muſt never
forget that Maxim which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Princes bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Empire, which is,</hi> That it
is not convenient for them to ſee the
Emperour made more powerful, leſt he
renew thoſe antiquated Titles he has to
moſt Dominions near him, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
which extended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
over all the known World,
being at laſt uſurp'd by <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
and from him deriv'd to a
long <hi>Series</hi> of ſucceeding Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
might give the <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
a pretext to reckon with
all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> if he
were ſtrong enough; and perhaps
many who wear Crowns, would
be reduc'd to Beggary; therefore
'tis beſt to keep him in his cold
Country of <hi>Germany,</hi> where mens
Spirits are benumm'd, and leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
The Republick has
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62365:48"/>
Reaſon to diſtruſt him upon many
Heads; as Emperour he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
upon the Dutchy of <hi>Frioul,</hi>
and the <hi>Marca Treviſana,</hi> beſides
the Cities of <hi>Treviſa, Padoua, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi>
and <hi>Verona:</hi> As Arch-Duke,
he pretends to <hi>Iſtria:</hi> As King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> to <hi>Zara,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Country: So that his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and Neighbourhood are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
dangerous; all theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are beſides of greater Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
than the City of <hi>Venice</hi> it
ſelf: So that their being ſubject
to a <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a younger ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gives ſome ſuſpicion of the
Lawfulneſs of their Subjection. All
theſe pretences were renewed in the
League of <hi>Cambray;</hi> Therefore I
think, without heſitation, I may
pronounce, That it is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the Republick that the
Emperour ſhould be kept low,
both for General and Particular
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62365:49"/>
From theſe Reflections we may
alſo conclude, that the Emperour
to theſe Titles does not want Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to acquire a part of the
Territories of the Republick; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
it being yet a complaint
of that Prince, of the little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſhow'd him by the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
when taking advantage of his
Diſtractions, they Erected the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of <hi>Palma Nuova</hi> juſt under his
Noſe.</p>
            <p>There remains therefore to ſee
what Facility he might find in ſuch
an Attempt. In the preſent State
of his Affairs, while the Faction of
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is ſo ſtrong in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
I cannot think that he can
quarrel with the Republick, which
is as powerful in Money as he is in
Men: For in length of time 'tis
certain, that he who has Money
may have Men, and they who
have many Men muſt conſume
much Money: 'Tis true, he being
ſo near a Borderer upon the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62365:49"/>
it may give him the more
confidence, becauſe a leſſer Number
will be neceſſary to make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion;
but if the Enterprize be
not in the Name of the whole
Empire, in which caſe the whole
<hi>German</hi> Nation would be a party,
I believe, with the help of his own
Patrimonial Dominions, he will not
do any great matter, the rather,
becauſe many great Heretical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> have the
ſame Intereſt to keep him low: So
that as he might perhaps be pretty
ſmart upon an Invaſion or Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at length of time he would
prove as weak to hold out a War:
And indeed this was the true cauſe
of Erecting the Fortreſs of <hi>Palma
Nuova,</hi> to obviate a ſudden Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Forces, and provide a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
for the Country-people; ſo to
gain time, which is always as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Republick, as
dangerous to ſuch an Enemy, who
if he have not ſome body to furniſh
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62365:50"/>
him with Money, will get but little
ground, tho his Army be numerous,
as it was in the time of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether the Republick has
any Title, Inclination or Facility
to acquire any part of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Territories? I anſwer, That
without doubt the Republick has
pretences upon <hi>Goritia</hi> and <hi>Gradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
which formerly belong'd to the
Family of the <hi>Frangipani,</hi> and for a
little while was under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Republick: There are
likewiſe ſome Caſtles in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and
upon the Coaſt which the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
claims; and for an Inclination
to acquire theſe, we need not doubt
but the Republick has it, it being
either the Vertue or Vice of Princes
never to be without it: But ſtill the
great conſideration lies in the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of doing it; for it there be
that, 'tis above half the Title; and
if that is wanting, 'tis Imprudence
to own any part of a pretence that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62365:50"/>
muſt remain without Execution. I
believe by Sea it would prove eaſie
to take <hi>Trieſte,</hi> and ſome other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but it would be as hard to
maintain them; and to go further
into the Land, would need great
preparatives on the ſide of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick:
whereas on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
ſide, the Defence would be
eaſie, he having a command of
Men: So that except in an open
War, there is no thinking of any
ſtrong Attempt that way, and then
it were not amiſs to put a good
ſtrength to it, that at the end of
the War, which always muſt one
time or another be ſucceeded by
Peace, ſome of the Country might
remain by Treaty in the <hi>Venetians</hi>
Hands, for the charges of the War;
for to begin a War only for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
of theſe places, would not
be a Deliberation befitting the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Gravity of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Senate: It would be better to
watch the occaſion of ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62365:51"/>
or Pinch of an Emperour,
which often happens, and buy theſe
places; but then be aware that if it
be not a Patrimonial Eſtate, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Dyet is neceſſary to the
purchaſe, to cut off all claims in
time to come.</p>
            <p>'Tis as hard, that the Emperour
ſhould unite with the Republick, to
acquire the State of any other
Prince in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe, firſt, for
<hi>Spain,</hi> they are the ſame Family
with the Emperour; Againſt the
Church he will declare as little,
profeſſing a great Zeal for it, and
calling himſelf, <hi>The Churches Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate;
Modena, Mantoua</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randola</hi>
are Fiefs of the Empire; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
and <hi>Florence</hi> are remote from
him, and to come at them he muſt
overcome greater Princes that are
between him and them: ſo that
this Union would prove difficult. If
the Emperour ſhould fall out with
ſome of theſe Dukes, his Vaſſals,
and depoſe them, it might happen
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62365:51"/>
that if <hi>Spain</hi> were buſie elſewhere,
and the Emperour loth to take the
trouble of chaſtiſing them himſelf
alone, he might then unite with
the Republick, upon condition to
have the beſt part of the Spoil;
but if the Emperour ſhould, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
come to a great Rupture
with the Church, and employ
heartily his power in the Quarrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
'tis not impoſſible but he might be
willing to engage the Republick by
a promiſe of ſome part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
I think in any other way
'tis not probable to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Imperial Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>The laſt Queſtion is, <hi>Whether he
can unite with others againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick?</hi>
And of this there is no
doubt: For if <hi>Maximilian,</hi> tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
oblig'd to the Republick,
made no difficulty to unite in a
League with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth of
<hi>France,</hi> his Competitor and Enemy,
whom, for Injuries received, he had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62365:52"/>
declared a Rebel to the Sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
(tho <hi>Lewis</hi> laugh'd at that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Juriſdiction): I ſay, if he
could ſubmit to joyn with ſo ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a power, much leſs would the
Emperour now ſcruple the uniting
either with <hi>Spain</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for to acquire Territory, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for bare Money, if it were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him. With <hi>France</hi> I believe
the Union would not be ſo eaſie as
it was then, becauſe now the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
being partial for <hi>Spain,</hi> if
their Intereſt did not concur, they
would hinder him from being drawn
away by any hopes or promiſes:
But this will appear better when we
come to treat of <hi>Spain:</hi> For if <hi>Spain</hi>
will have a League againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
the Emperour will never
ſtand out.</p>
            <p>Now let us come to <hi>France:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not above Fifty years ago
that the Republick thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62365:52"/>
oblig'd not only to deſire, but
to procure the Greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi>
becauſe being under the phrenſie of
a Civil War, it threatned little leſs
than the diſſolution of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:
The Succeſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth to the Crown, who had his
Title from Nature, and the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from his Sword, reviv'd it, and
at laſt gave it ſuch vigour, that from
deſerving Compaſſion, it came to
move Envy; and if a fatal blow of
a mean hand had not cut off that
Prince's Life, and Deſigns, there
would have been requiſite great
Dexterity, or great Force to defend
the Republick from them. The
<hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Milan,</hi> us'd to brag, that he had
ſuch Muſick as ſhould make thoſe
dance who had no mind to't: <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth might have ſaid ſo
with much more reaſon, and he us'd
to affirm, That at the paſs things
were, the Neutrality of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
was a Coyn that would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62365:53"/>
be current. If he had given ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer
to his no ill-founded Deſigns,
half a World would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
him; but we muſt not be
frighted if we ſee the Raging Sea
ſwell in Billows, and look as if it
would ſwallow up the Earth, ſince a
little Sand ſtops all its Fury. <hi>Death</hi>
has a Scythe that moſt commonly
cuts off all the Nobleſt Lives: If
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> had
brought the Siege of <hi>Paris</hi> to an
end; if <hi>Philip</hi> the Second had not
had the Winds and Seas againſt him,
<hi>England</hi> would have been in Chains,
and <hi>Paris</hi> would have been a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.
In concluſion, the Fatality of
Humane Affairs is ſuch, that moſt
great undertakings are diſappointed
by unexpected cauſes. At preſent
the conſtitution of <hi>France</hi> is ſuch,
that there is little danger from
them; for during the Minority of
their King, they will have enough
to do not to loſe ground, there being
ſo many Jealouſies and Factions a-foot:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62365:53"/>
'Tis true, that the common
people have open'd their Eyes, and
begin to be weary of ſpending their
blood for the ambition of the great
ones; and amongſt theſe, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
are old, and at their eaſe, ſo that
they will think chiefly of keeping
themſelves in thoſe Poſts they enjoy.
The Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who is Head of
the <hi>Catholick</hi> Party, is very ancient
and very rich; wherefore if in the
time of the great troubles, he either
could not or would not aſpire to
make himſelf King, when even he
had all but the Name of it, 'tis not
to be imagined he thinks of it now;
and if he will be content with the
State of a Subject, he is as great as
he can be. The Duke of <hi>Mercaeur,</hi>
who in his Wife's right pretended to
Erect <hi>Britany</hi> into a Kingdom, is at
laſt dead in <hi>Hungary;</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Epernon</hi> is more ſtudious of good
Husbandry than Soldiery; the Duke
of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> has always been true
to the Royal Family; the <hi>Capricios</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62365:54"/>
of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Aumale,</hi> will
hardly have any Followers; and it
will be well if ſhe can clear her ſelf
of the late King's Death: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the
firſt Prince of the Blood, is young,
and of a mild Nature; he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
before his Eyes the Example of
his Father, Grandfather, and Great
Grandfather, who all periſh'd unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
in civil Broils, and has in
his own perſon experimented the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Parſimony,</hi> in his Retreat from
Court to <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> So that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
a greater Fortune, he may
compaſs it in <hi>France,</hi> from the hands
of the Queen her ſelf, who is ſo ill
a <hi>Politician,</hi> as to try to put out Fire
with pouring Oyl upon it. The <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi>
are weary; the Duke of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon,</hi>
their Head, well pleaſed with
his preſent Fortune; and if he have
a mind to be a <hi>Hugonot</hi> out of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
and not Faction, there is no
body will hinder him; but moſt of
theſe great men have Religion only
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62365:54"/>
for a pretext, as 'tis reported like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres,</hi>
which if it be true, they will never
be quiet till the King be of Age; and
by conſequence, there will be little
protection to be hop'd for from that
Kingdom. Our Speculation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may more certainly conclude,
that the Greatneſs of <hi>France</hi> is at a
ſtand, and cannot in the ſpace of
ſome years make any progreſs, and
till it come to an Exceſs not to be
thought on for theſe fifty years, it
can give no Jealouſie to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>As to the Title, Inclination and
Facility that <hi>France</hi> may have to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
any part of the Republick's
Dominions; I ſay, we need not
doubt of their Inclination, becauſe
Princes are like Wolves to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
always ready for prey. As for
Title, they can ſet up none till they
have conquer'd the Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan;</hi>
and Facility they have as little,
becauſe they cannot come at the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62365:55"/>
Republick's Territories, without firſt
paſſing over thoſe of other Princes,
which they will never conſent to,
leſt they prove the firſt conqueſt
themſelves: Whereupon I conclude,
that for a long time the power of
<hi>France</hi> can give no jealouſie to the
Republick.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
can have no pretences, as things
ſtand, upon any part of the <hi>French</hi>
Territories, as long as they are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Excluded from <hi>Italy;</hi> and if there
be no Title, there is leſs Inclination
and Facility.</p>
            <p>The Union of <hi>France</hi> with the
Republick, to acquire the State of
any other Prince, will always be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
when <hi>France</hi> is in a condition to
mind ſuch acquiſitions; the paſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
prove that ſufficiently; but
they do ſufficiently bear Teſtimony
likewiſe of the danger of ſuch Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Now that the <hi>French</hi> are totally
excluded <hi>Italy,</hi> they would agree to
very large conditions with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62365:55"/>
and allow them a great
ſhare of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and
Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> but they would
no ſooner have made the acquiſition
of their ſhare, but they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to caſt their Eyes upon that of
the Republick, and enter into a
League againſt them with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince, juſt as it happened in
the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, when
to gain <hi>Cremona,</hi> he was the firſt that
conſented to the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
deceiving all the while the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Embaſſador at Court, and affirming
(even with Oaths), That he would
never conclude any thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Republick, tho he had
ſign'd the League above ſix weeks
before the War began, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
likewiſe in a moſt barbarous
manner, hanging up the Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
that were Governours of the
Towns he took.</p>
            <p>I believe <hi>France,</hi> to get footing in
<hi>Italy,</hi> would engage with any other
Prince againſt the Republick, except
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62365:56"/>
with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and if that
ſhould happen, it would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſtir up the Factions of that
Kingdom, and bring upon them
ſome powerful Neighbour, ſuch as
<hi>England:</hi> The Friendſhip of <hi>Savoy</hi>
would likewiſe be uſeful, to hinder
the Paſſes of the Mountains, and
make ſome diverſion in <hi>Provence</hi> and
<hi>Dauphine,</hi> if there could be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
upon this preſent Duke; but
he is a <hi>Proteus,</hi> that turns himſelf
into many forms, and with his <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>'s
and Humours, would ſoon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
the Treaſures of <hi>S. Marc:</hi> But
theſe are things ſo remote, that they
may be left to the prudence of thoſe
who ſhall live in thoſe times; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Times there muſt be
alteration of Councils. And ſo much
for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us turn to <hi>Spain,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Family that from low begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
is come by Marriages to the
poſſeſſion of Twelve Kingdoms, and
ſeveral Dukedoms in <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62365:56"/>
what it has in the <hi>Indies,</hi> does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
evidence a great Favour of
Fortune, joyn'd with great applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and induſtry: So that if it be
not ſtopp'd by Fatality, may bid
fair for an Univerſal Empire: If
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had had as much
prudence in his youth as he had in
his old Age, he would not have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
the Empire from <hi>Spain,</hi> but
would have made his Son <hi>Philip</hi>
have been choſen King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
inſtead of his Brother <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand:</hi>
He underſtood his Errour,
and repented of it at laſt, trying
to perſwade <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to a Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
but he ſhew'd as much
prudence in keeping what he had
got ſo wonderfully into his Hands,
as <hi>Charles</hi> would have ſhew'd folly
in going to deprive him of it by
Force. <hi>Charles</hi> was not leſs unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the other Act of Moderation
he ſhew'd, when he renounc'd all
his Kingdoms to his Son, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a private Life; For to one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62365:57"/>
who on the Anniverſary Day of
that Famous Action, congratulated
King <hi>Philip</hi> for his Felicity, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That Day was likewiſe the
Anniverſary of his Father's Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
So that Actions of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Princes, are but like that
Inſect called the <hi>Ephemera,</hi> which
lives and dies the ſame day.</p>
            <p>The Greatneſs of <hi>Spain</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be ſuſpected; it has Two
Wild Beaſts that follow it always
cloſe, one on one ſide, and the other
on the other, which is the <hi>Turk</hi> by
Sea, and <hi>France</hi> by Land; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that it has that Iſſue of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as witty <hi>Boccalini</hi> calls it,
which will ſufficiently purge it of
all its ill Humours; and it muſt be
own'd, that all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has not hindered them from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Fable of the Dog, who
forſook the Subſtance for the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:
For, for Forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>France</hi> was ſufficiently taken
up with their own Inteſtine Broils,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62365:57"/>
during which time <hi>Spain</hi> might
with great advantage have made
a Truce with <hi>Holland;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
likewiſe humbled the <hi>Turk,</hi>
by the Battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> they
might have applied their whole
Force to <hi>Italy,</hi> which had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
but its own Natives, and not
of them above half: So that in
all probability they could have
met with no conſiderable oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>One might ſay, That it was
an Effect of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
if he had not ſhew'd as
great an Ambition of Dominion
as poſſible, in endeavouring firſt
to unite <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Spain</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
then to have his Daughter
choſen Queen, and laſtly, ſeiz'd
upon as many Towns as he could;
Therefore we may give the <hi>Italians</hi>
Joy, that half an Age of ſo much
danger paſſed without the leaſt loſs
of their Liberty. Now by reaſon
of the <hi>French</hi> King's Minority, the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62365:58"/>
Jealouſies againſt <hi>Spain</hi> are a-foot
again, but, I think, not with ſo
much ground; For if not <hi>France,</hi>
at leaſt <hi>England,</hi> would raiſe their
old Enemies, the <hi>Dutch</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the <hi>Italians</hi> ſhould help with
Money: So that if <hi>Italy</hi> can but
reſiſt the firſt brunt, it may hope
for all ſort of Relief; for <hi>France</hi>
has Forces, and they would ſoon
have a will to ſuccour <hi>Italy</hi> againſt
<hi>Spain:</hi> Neither do I believe, that
<hi>Spain</hi> would hazard the Truce with
<hi>Holland,</hi> it having been compaſs'd
with ſuch Difficulties, even to the
loſs of much of their Honour and
Faſt. 'Tis enough, that to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chriſtian Princes, except the
Emperour, the Greatneſs of <hi>Spain</hi>
is of ill Conſequence; And
therefore to be oppoſed by all
ſecret means firſt, and if need
be, at laſt openly, and without
a Mask.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Spain</hi> has any Title, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Facility to acquire part of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62365:58"/>
the Republick's Dominions, there
will be little Difficulty to anſwer:
Their Title would be upon <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Crema,</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> ancient
Members of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan:</hi>
And theſe Three Cities are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
that with their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they would perhaps make up
as rich a Dutchy as any in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi>
except <hi>Milan:</hi> So that we
need not doubt, but the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
looks upon theſe Cities with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Eye, and with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to enjoy them; there remains
only the Facility of doing it, which
is always the moſt important of
the Three Points: Upon this
Subject we muſt diſtinguiſh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will make the Attempt
by themſelves, or in Conjunction
with others: If alone, and that
the Republick have any Great
Prince, either <hi>Italian,</hi> or Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on their ſide, they will meet
with little Facility in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
becauſe the Republick's
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62365:59"/>
Money, joyn'd to the Forces of
another Prince, can give check to
almoſt any great Power, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to that of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe
States and Poſſeſſions are large, but
diſunited; and they cannot but be
afraid, that while they are buſied
in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> others would try
to attack them in a more ſenſible
part: If <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould therefore u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
with any other Prince, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Republick had <hi>France</hi> on
their ſide, they would not much
hurt it, becauſe the Inundation of
the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> uſes to
be both powerful and ſudden,
provided they be called in by an
<hi>Italian</hi> Prince of ſome Figure;
and by that means the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
being attack'd on Two ſides, would
go near to loſe his Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we conſider the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
united only with ſome <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Prince, and the <hi>French</hi> to ſtand
Spectator, as might happen in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62365:59"/>
Minority of a <hi>French</hi> King, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had the Pope
and Emperour of his ſide, I doubt
the Republick would be hard ſet;
for that other Prince in League
with them, cannot be of any
great Force; the moſt uſeful would
be <hi>Savoy;</hi> but beſides, that he
would be bought very dear, he
would be always wavering, if the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> tempted him ſtrongly:
The Richeſt would be <hi>Florence;</hi>
but his Territories not joyning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe of the Republick, there is
little good to be expected from his
aſſiſtance. Laſtly, If <hi>Spain</hi> will
fall upon the Republick alone,
and the Republick be likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
I ſay, That as to the State
of <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> it would go near
to be loſt; but by Sea the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
would make a ſtout Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>But if it be ask'd, whether the
Republick have either Title, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
or Facility to acquire any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62365:60"/>
part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in
<hi>Italy?</hi> I anſwer, the Title would be
upon <hi>Cremona</hi> in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Travi,</hi> and other Ports of <hi>La
Puglia,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
the Republick having been in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all theſe places before ever
<hi>Spain</hi> had footing in <hi>Italy:</hi> So that
there wants nothing but Facility;
and there is but one Caſe that I
know in which the Republick might
hope to get Poſſeſſion again; and
that is, in caſe the Republick were in
League with <hi>France,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
buſied by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
then ſome of theſe Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might be fulfilled, but ſtill with
the ſame Jealouſie, that your Friends
ſhould at laſt joyn with your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to fall upon the Republick, as it
happened in the League of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
And this anſwers the other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to wit, <hi>Whether</hi> Spain <hi>can unite
with any other Power againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick?</hi>
'Tis very true, that I can
hardly believe, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62365:60"/>
would, without any precedent broil,
attempt a League with <hi>France</hi> againſt
the Republick, becauſe the Damage
of one City's remaining in the <hi>French</hi>
Hands, would be greater to them
than the profit of taking all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
has in <hi>Terra Firma</hi> would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may unite
with the Republick, to acquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly
in <hi>Italy;</hi> I ſay, That if it be
againſt an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, they will
not, becauſe it is not their Intereſt
that the Republick ſhould be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and already almoſt all the leſſer
Princes are Dependants of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
and as for the Pope, they
would certainly help him, rather
than joyn againſt him, being us'd
to make a great ſhew of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
the Church: The only caſe
that would make them bear patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any new Acquiſitions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
would be, if <hi>France</hi> ſhould
make any progreſs in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62365:61"/>
After all, amidſt ſo many well-grounded
ſuſpicions, it muſt be
confeſſed, that the Neighbourhood
of <hi>Spain</hi> has prov'd of leſs diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to the Republick, than that of
any other Prince who had thoſe
Countries before them; for the
Dukes of <hi>Milan</hi> were perpetually ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quarrelling, or, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too weak, were inciting of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Powers under-hand againſt the
Republick.</p>
            <p>There may be an Union likewiſe
of the Republick and <hi>Spain</hi> by Sea,
againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and by Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Griſons,</hi> or any other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi>
And this is enough for
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by reaſon of Vicinity, we
will ſpeak of the other <hi>Italian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
It would be the Intereſt of the
Republick to ſee them greater, if it
could be done at the Expence of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and by their Spoils, as alſo
by getting from the Church: But
both thoſe Caſes are next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62365:61"/>
if firſt the World be not turn'd
topſy turvy, which can never be,
but by a League with <hi>France;</hi> and
then if any part of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Dominions could be ſhar'd amongſt
them, it would not injure the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
at all: but for any of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to grow great by ſpoiling one
another, I ſhould not like it; for the
advantage would be inconſiderable,
and in the mean time the fire would
be kindled in <hi>Italy,</hi> the property of
which is to go not where you would
have it, but often where you are
moſt afraid of it.</p>
            <p>Whether any of theſe Princes have
Title, Inclination or Facility to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from the Republick, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
will be ſhort, becauſe Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
will be wanting. <hi>Mantoua</hi> has
ſome pretences upon <hi>Valeſa</hi> and <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiera;
Modena</hi> upon the Town of
<hi>Eſte,</hi> from whence the Family comes:
But all theſe little Princes united
without the Pope and <hi>Spain,</hi> could
hardly give a diſturbance to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62365:62"/>
becauſe the Two powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
of them, to wit, <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
are not immediate Border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Whether the Republick have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Title, Inclination or Facility to
acquire from them in the State they
now are in; I anſwer, That the
Houſe of <hi>Eſte</hi> not having <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
the Republick has no Title to either
<hi>Modena</hi> or <hi>Reggio:</hi> There would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be a good Inclination againſt
<hi>Mantoua,</hi> becauſe he lies, as it were,
in the Bowels of the Republick; but
there would be but an ill Title, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Republick ſhould bear the
Charges of his Education, while
they were his Guardians; and then
the Facility would be ſmall; for no
ſooner would the Republick have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the Dance, but others would
come in, and perhaps it would not
end as it begun. Of the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I have little to ſay, the Republick
having had no diſputes with them;
for the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> who formerly ſet
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62365:62"/>
the Republick ſo hard, have done
as the Horſe in the Fable, loſt their
own Liberty, in hopes of being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
of their Enemies, and are by
that means out of power to hurt the
Republick.</p>
            <p>As for Leagues theſe Princes will
be ready to make them either with
or againſt the Republick, becauſe
their Fortune, as Princes, being but
ſmall, they will let ſlip no occaſion
of mending it, either by acquiſition
of new Territory, or by receiving
Subſidies and Penſions. <hi>Florence</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would hardly be mov'd by that
laſt motive, becauſe he is not needy,
being at this time perhaps the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Prince in ready Money that is in
Chriſtendom; and his Riches always
increaſe, becauſe the Princes of that
Family do yet retain their Anceſtors
Inclination to Merchandize, and
that enriches the Prince without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Subject. The Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the great Duke are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as well becauſe they are placed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62365:63"/>
as it were in the Navel of <hi>Italy,</hi>
with a fertile Territory, all united
together, as alſo becauſe the States
of other Princes are, as it were, a
Wall and Defence to it; and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
to be valued by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
it has with the Sea by <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>
and ſome other <hi>Maritime</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes:
So that if one were to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
upon any <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, I know
none that deſerves ſo well, as being
exempted from the temptation of
being bought, and having yet ſome
of that punctual mercantile Faith.</p>
            <p>If the Republick will have a
League with any of the other <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Princes, there will be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in it, provided they pay them;
but withal, one muſt not forget the
witty Reflection of <hi>Boccalini,</hi> when
the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes are willing to be
taught manners out of the <hi>Galateo,</hi>
provided that it may not look like ill
breeding in them, to eat with both
Jaws as faſt as they can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62365:63"/>
With <hi>Poland</hi> the Republick can
have no other Concern than that of
defending Chriſtendom, and by
ſome diverſion from that Crown,
bear the more eaſily the weight of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power: Therefore it
would be well for the Republick to
have that King and Kingdom grow
more powerful. As for any thing
elſe, the great diſtance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that State and the Republick,
takes away all matter of any further
Conſideration. The ſame thing may
be ſaid of the <hi>Moſcovite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> being the greateſt of thoſe
powers that are ſeparated from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a Kingdom of
great ſtrength, particularly ſince the
Union of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> have nothing left to deſire as
to Territory: All that Iſland is now
under the Dominion of one ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and has the Sea for a Wall:
So that if <hi>England</hi> be not diſunited
within it ſelf, there is no power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
it: We ſee the Example in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62365:64"/>
the Invaſion of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of
<hi>Spain</hi> (and yet then the Union was
not ſo great as might have been)
who loſt his mighty <hi>Armada</hi> that he
had been ſo long preparing at ſuch
vaſt Expences. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
has ſhew'd the World how far a
Woman's ability can go in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did likewiſe enlarge her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
by Navigations to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and wounded <hi>Spain</hi> in that
tender part; She likewiſe had ſome
Ports of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to her, ſo that ſhe ſeem'd to
be hardly contain'd in that ſeparate
World of hers. The Iſland is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and delicious, producing all
neceſſaries for Life, and though the
Natives go abroad and buy the
Products of other Countries, it is
more as Superfluities, and out of
Luxury, than want, and amongſt
the reſt, they have a Trade for
Grapes called Currans, which they
buy in the Dominions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62365:64"/>
was the King that Apoſtatiz'd from
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did uſe to
concern himſelf in the Affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeveral times the Popes
have had good Protection from the
ancient Kings of that Country, who
were moſt devoted to the See of
<hi>Rome;</hi> to ſay truth, Religion has
had a great Loſs, and the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> a greater, I cannot well ſay,
whether out of the great Luſt of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, or the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh,
at preſent that King will not hear
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and has but ſmall Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
for the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this King could grow greater,
it would be advantageous to the
Republick, becauſe it might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Alliance, and by that means
a greater reſpect from other
Crown'd Heads; but however, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without this conſideration, 'tis
a Power to be courted, becauſe the
Nation having an ancient Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to <hi>France,</hi> and a modern one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62365:65"/>
to <hi>Spain,</hi> it cannot but have a good
inclination for the Republick. 'Tis
true that the preſent King is more
enclin'd to Wars with his Pen, than
with his Sword, having a mighty
Love for Diſputes, and valuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the Character of a Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Divine; ſo much has the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with <hi>Rome</hi> influenc'd that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that even their Princes ſtudy
Controverſie; but however I ſhould
not think the Republick ought to
mind any of thoſe Circumſtances,
becauſe where there is ſtrength,
there is always hopes of making
uſe of it, that depending only upon
raiſing of Paſſions.</p>
            <p>The beſt means would be (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the continuation of thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
already introduc'd of mutual
Embaſſies) ſtrictly to command the
Governours in the <hi>Levant</hi> to ſhew
all good uſage to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and particularly obſerve
punctually all Treaties and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with them, becauſe there is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62365:65"/>
no Nation that puts a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon their Word than the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
do, and the Kings of that
Iſland have not yet learnt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Policy that gives them leave
to break their Faith in order to
reigning more abſolutely.</p>
            <p>With the Seven United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
'twill be good to cultivate
Friendſhip, and to encreaſe it by a
mutual defenſive League, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
at this time, that the Truce
is but newly concluded with <hi>Spain;</hi>
for it will be a Curb upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
if he ſhould attempt any
thing againſt the Republick, for
fear his old Wounds ſhould be ſet
a bleeding again, they being but
juſt bound up, and not healed.</p>
            <p>'Tis feaſable likewiſe to procure
ſomething more of Trade with the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> becauſe they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ingenious, and addicted
that way; and moreover, ſince
both the Republicks ſtand in awe
of the ſame Power, it will not be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62365:66"/>
difficult to unite their inclinations;
and they have made on their ſide a
ſufficient Advance, by ſending an
Embaſſy to the Republick, which
though of Complement, yet it has
ſhew'd great eſteem and inclination
to an Union.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Advantage of a ſolid
diverſion of the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi>
there is another Eſſential conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is, That from them
might be had a conſiderable Body
of well diſciplin'd Soldiers, and that
with admirable celerity, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Regiments that might be
rais'd in a Country ſo well us'd to
War, if there were occaſion, and
all the inconveniencies of Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
are not to be valued; for
the Republick will always have a
greater ſcarcity of good Soldiers,
than of good Money.</p>
            <p>With the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> of
a different Religion, there can
hardly be any Concerns, if there
is no room for Quarrels. As the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62365:66"/>
World ſtands now, if it be not
well, they ſhould grow greater, at
leaſt 'tis not amiſs, they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
great enough, becauſe they are
a Check upon the Emperour, who
elſe would be a moſt formidable
Potentate to all Princes, but more
particularly to the <hi>Italians,</hi> and
more to the Republick, than
to the reſt of <hi>Italy;</hi> but now by
their means his Power is not only
balanced, but almoſt quite oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the common benefit of other
Princes. With theſe Princes it will
be eaſie for the Republick to have
an Engagement: Firſt, becauſe they
know that the Republick is not a
blind Adorer of the Intereſts of the
Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> And, Secondly,
becauſe they ſee the Jealouſies that
are between the Republick and the
Emperour, from whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is no danger of a
League between them and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and by conſequence, they
have not the Republick for a ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62365:67"/>
Power; and upon all Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
it will do well to ſhew an
Inclination to Friendſhip with them,
firſt, becauſe they may make a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
diverſion; and, ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Country being a Nurſery
of Soldiers, the Republick upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
may make Levies there; and
it is a point of high importance for
the Republick to be certain of their
Levies; for in a time of need they
can hope but for ſmall help from the
<hi>Italian Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not yet ſaid any thing of
the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and he is not
to be omitted, being ſo much a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
of the Emperour, from
whom he has received the Electoral
Dignity, upon the Excluſion of the
Elector <hi>Palatin:</hi> This Prince has had
the boldneſs to conteſt the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
with the Republick at the
Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and therefore no
good Correſpondency can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the Republick. It
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62365:67"/>
would not be amiſs to ſee him leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd;
for 'tis always to be wiſh'd,
that he who has no good Intentions,
ſhould have as little power to offend
as may be.</p>
            <p>The Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> who are Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Princes, is likewiſe to be
minded; and their growth in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can be of no uſe to the Republick:
They do nothing but waken the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Power, when 'tis almoſt lull'd
aſleep; and therefore are dangerous:
Their Friendſhip, in time of open
War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> will be eaſily
had, upon the Hopes of a good
Booty.</p>
            <p>It remains for us now to ſpeak of
the greateſt Prince of this known
World, formidable to all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I mean the <hi>Turk;</hi> but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeak of him by the Rules we
have laid down for the others; for
with him all Arts and Policies are
vain: He makes no League with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62365:68"/>
any, neither has he any Reſiding
Embaſſadors in any Court, ſcorning
to deſcend to inform himſelf of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes Intrigues: He owns
his Greatneſs, and relies upon it, like
the Elephant, who by reaſon of his
great ſtrength, is never obſerved to
uſe Cunning: Perhaps it may be an
<hi>Arcanum</hi> of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> to hinder
his Subjects from contracting the
Manners and Cuſtoms of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and bringing them home at
their return: Perhaps likewiſe that
he is unwilling their Wits ſhould be
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in Politicks: His is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
built upon the Ruin of all other
Empires, founded in force, and
ſcorning Titles and Claims of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
If he can acquire a Country,
he has always Right to it; and
when he has conquer'd it, he aſſumes
all the power to himſelf, ſuffering
no Uſurpations where he himſelf u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps
all: His Miniſters make open
profeſſion of Ignorance, which is
propagated induſtriouſly amongſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62365:68"/>
his people, who are ſufficiently learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they know how to obey: They
are told openly of their Slavery, and
it is expected they learn the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of it: not but that they will
diſpute with Chriſtians for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and alledge, That he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to all the Rights of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
whoſe City he has conquered.
In his Religion the Prince is looſe,
and the <hi>Mufti,</hi> which is the High
Prieſt, tied up, who muſt ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placently
to the Ends of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in conformity to the Will
of him that rules, or pay his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
with his Life. In this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
all the Qualities of the Mind,
both ſpeculative and practick, are
deſpiſed and ſuſpected, which made
one of their Emperours ſend back
the Muſicians ſent him by <hi>Francis</hi>
the Firſt, leſt with their Harmony
they ſhould have molified the Iron
Temper of thoſe fierce Natures:
They value ſtrength of Body, and
the Arts of War, in which none are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62365:69"/>
ſooner preferr'd than thoſe who ſhew
the greateſt Fierceneſs and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in their diſpoſitions: They are
intent upon conquering the reſt of
the World, and in order to it they
have infinite Numbers of Men, and
infinite Treaſure: His yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
exceeds Twenty Millions of
Crowns; he inherits the Eſtates of
all his Subjects, whoſe Children can
lay claim to nothing but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Horſe and Arms. In the midſt
of all theſe Riches his thirſt of Gold
ſtill increaſes: ſo that often his Fury
is laid with the Charms of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
Out of that has been ſaid, <hi>'Tis
evident that his Greatneſs muſt be the
Ruine of all other Powers, and that it
would be an unſpeakable Felicity to ſee
him leſſen'd; but the hopes of that are
ſo remote, that they are next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for any Title upon the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the Republick, he can have
none; Inclination and Facility he
has but too much, deſigning the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62365:69"/>
of all Chriſtendom; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Diſunion of Chriſtians,
more intent upon Jealouſies at home
than upon an Union againſt a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invader, his Deſign is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his Force: He fears nothing
but an Union of Chriſtendom againſt
him; and that he may not be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in providing againſt it, that
cunning and wicked <hi>Mahomet</hi> has
left him a Prophecy to keep him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
by which, the Ruine of his
Empire is to come from ſuch an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
The <hi>Turks</hi> never mention it
but with Cries and Groans; and the
Government ſtrives to avoid it by
being invincible, not conſidering,
that if the Prophecy be true, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.
As for the Republick, he
is a terrible Neighbour to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
encroaching, and ſetting no
bounds to his pretences, till he has
ſwallowed all.</p>
            <p>The Republick, on the other ſide,
cannot want a Title againſt him; for
what he has taken from them, would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62365:70"/>
make up a great Principality: <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,
Negrepont, Modon, Coron, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramania,</hi>
all the <hi>Archipelago, Boſſina,
Scutari, Albania,</hi> part of the very
Imperial City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and
in ſhort, half his Empire in <hi>Europe</hi>
has been at ſeveral times extorted
from the Republick: but to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this back is the difficulty; and
'twill be well if he is content with
what he has, and that we can ſave
what remains. The only good thing
the Republick can hope for, is, that
the <hi>Turk</hi> will not enter into League
with any other againſt the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
becauſe he ſcorns all Leagues:
'Tis true, that in the time of <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico
Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> he was
by him drawn to invade the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and before that, by the <hi>Viſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
Dukes of <hi>Milan,</hi> likewiſe with
promiſe to buſie the <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
by a War on his ſide: 'Tis ſaid
alſo, That <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth ſtrove
to draw him into the League of
<hi>Cambray:</hi> But all theſe are rather
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62365:70"/>
Subornations than Leagues, and
ſpurring of a Horſe that's free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of his own Nature.</p>
            <p>He would eaſily unite with the
Republick, to conquer other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but then the Republick muſt
reckon, that he would take all to
himſelf, he not underſtanding any
Accounts of dividing: So that it
would only be a madneſs, and by
ones own Expence of Blood and
Treaſure, promote his Tyrannical
Empire. The <hi>Turk</hi> has often offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Succours to the Republick in their
Wars with others; but our wiſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
always diſliked ſuch a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
but were glad he did not take
the opportunity of their Troubles to
fall upon them.</p>
            <p>There is no other Politicks to be
uſed with this Empire, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Friendſhip, and reckon upon
ſudden Enmity; and therefore be
always provided, that the weakneſs
of the State may not be an Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him to uſe his Natural Rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62365:71"/>
for the Peace will be always the
longer, when the readineſs for War
ſhall be viſible.</p>
            <p>In caſe of a Rupture, one ſhould
try to make a diverſion by the King
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> and the <hi>Pole:</hi>
but that will be a long uncertain bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and of ſlow benefit; to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Miniſters of the Port in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
War, will be a very hard thing,
they will rather ſuffer a temptation
in time of Peace, and by that means
one may penetrate their Deſigns,
and retard their Deliberations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the perſon gain'd be of the
<hi>Divan,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Grand
Vizier,</hi> if poſſible; but they often
take Bribes, and deceive one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
their being ſubject to continual
Changes, and thoſe very ſudden, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Emperour's <hi>Capricio,</hi>
and the Calumnies of their Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
the Friendſhip of the <hi>Queen
Mother,</hi> and of the Wife of the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> may
help: But if the Prince himſelf be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62365:71"/>
of a reſolute Nature, their Offices
will be but weak: And all violent
ſudden Reſolutions of War made by
the Emperour himſelf, are always
welcome to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are
the Soul of that Empire: So that, as
I ſaid at firſt, I muſt conclude, That
Prudence and Politicks can be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
uſe againſt Rage and Fury, and a
Nation that depends not upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but upon Might.</p>
            <p>I can ſay nothing then but what
the Angel ſaid to <hi>Gideon, Comfortare
&amp; eſto Robuſtus;</hi> and with this good
<hi>Omen</hi> that comes from Heaven, and
which I offer with a moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Mind,</p>
            <p>I take leave, having accompliſh'd
the Task was impoſed upon me, if
not according to the full Extent of
my Duty, at leaſt in proportion to
my weak Forces, and ſmall Talent.</p>
