            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>THose that will heare any London newes,</l>
               <l>Where some be merrie and some do muse:</l>
               <l>And who hath béene at Bartholmew Faire.</l>
               <l>And what good stirring hath beene there.</l>
               <l>Come but to mée and you shall heare,</l>
               <l>For among the thickest I haue béene there.</l>
               <l>There double beere and bottle ale,</l>
               <l>In euerie corner had good sale.</l>
               <l>Many a pig and many a Sow,</l>
               <l>Many a Iade and many a Cow,</l>
               <l>Canole rushes, Cloth, and leather,</l>
               <l>And many things came in together.</l>
               <l>Many a pound and penny told,</l>
               <l>Many a bargaine bought and sold,</l>
               <l>And Tauernes full in euery place.</l>
               <l>And yet they say wine wilbe scarse:</l>
               <l>And this was all the heauy newes.</l>
               <l>That made the copper noses muse.</l>
               <l>For nose <hi>qui viuimus</hi> being there,</l>
               <l>Dranke Rosa solis in the fayre.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Libera</hi> nose cald for Sack,</l>
               <l>For euery nose was loath to lacke.</l>
               <l>And when the cheere was at the best,</l>
               <l>And welcome giuen to euery guest:</l>
               <l>Suddenly there came a Post,</l>
               <l>With weeping teares and told mine host:</l>
               <l>Be it knowne to all noses red,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nos maximus omnium</hi> is gone and dead.</l>
               <l>This is strange and this is true,</l>
               <l>Therefore mine host it belongs to you:</l>
               <l>And all that sell good Béere and Ale.</l>
               <l>To haue regard vnto my tale.</l>
               <l>And send vnto the Uintners hall,</l>
               <l>Present word to warne them all.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1977:2"/>To make ready to his funerall.</l>
               <l>And bury him in a malmesey tunne,</l>
               <l>For the good deedes that he hath done:</l>
               <l>For he was free of the old haunce,</l>
               <l>And much good wine procured from <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With Sack and sugar out of Spaine,</l>
               <l>Whereby he did more noses gaine,</l>
               <l>Under his baner for to be,</l>
               <l>Then all the noses that be frée,</l>
               <l>and a very commodious nose had he,</l>
               <l>A long nose like a mazer,</l>
               <l>Of murrey colour in stéed of azur.</l>
               <l>And he had a <unclear>ripe</unclear> and reddy head</l>
               <l>And yet his nose was neuer red.</l>
               <l>But he bare such a maiestie.</l>
               <l>To the copper noses company,</l>
               <l>He sent to <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Candie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For Muscadell and good malmesey:</l>
               <l>And all in a ship called the Minion.</l>
               <l>Which did more good in my opinion,</l>
               <l>With many voyage that she made,</l>
               <l>For sacke and sugar to the trade.</l>
               <l>That ship and the Iulian did more good</l>
               <l>To copper noses by the roode:</l>
               <l>Then all the ships that went abroad,</l>
               <l>And wheresoeuer they lay at roade:</l>
               <l>There should you sée red noses swarme,</l>
               <l>Like hony bées in a charme.</l>
               <l>But hearing of these tidings sad,</l>
               <l>The Can maker cried, as if he had bin mad,</l>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1977:6"/>The first statute that came in:</l>
                  <l>Was <hi>An act of Conformity,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For the Copper noses company.</l>
                  <l>Which the speaker very wiselie,</l>
                  <l>Did argue there precisely:</l>
                  <l>Then shaghaird ruffin he stept vp,</l>
                  <l>For he came lately from the cup,</l>
                  <l>And swore it were not out off square,</l>
                  <l>That it might be inacted there,</l>
                  <l>That all noses wan or pale,</l>
                  <l>That loued wine, beere, and ale.</l>
                  <l>With a constant mind; and a merry heart,</l>
                  <l>They should stick to the pot, and neuer part.</l>
                  <l>And be made Denizens,</l>
                  <l>Amongst vs Citizens.</l>
                  <l>The yonger warden then spake he,</l>
                  <l>But he that will a denizen be,</l>
                  <l>Must first of all compound with mee.</l>
                  <l>For I haue authority vnder seale,</l>
                  <l>To amend their noses a great deale:</l>
                  <l>God forbid quoth the speaker else,</l>
                  <l>But that officers that carry seales,</l>
                  <l>Should haue their fées and duties paid,</l>
                  <l>Ere any Pattents should be made.</l>
                  <l>Then came there a statute in,</l>
