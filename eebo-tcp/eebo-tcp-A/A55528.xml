            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have observed, and found by much experience, how
dangerous a thing it is to judge of our fellow-Professors
by the out-side and colour of their actions, whose most
sincere intentions God for the most part hides from the
World, under circumstances of very foul appearances; as if he
meant to make the World believe, that he hath no true servants in
the World; but that such as pretend most to Godliness amongst us.
are the veriest hypocrites, and are not ashamed to own the vilest of
Actions, under the notion of Religion: as to instance, <hi>Abraham</hi>
must do that out of Conscience, which the world no doubt looked
upon as the attempting to murder his Son. The Israelites take
their farewel of the Aegyptians, carrying their treasure with
them by a command from God, under a pretense of borrowing it:
A thing, though (all circumstances considered) justifiable, yet of
a foul appearance. And afterwards they seem to overthrow their
owne Doctrine against Images, by setting up a brasen serpent:
and at last, (as if God were at odds with himself, and angry that
men should reverence his own Ordinances) it must be broken to
pieces. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is put upon such a message from God, for which
he is accused of sedition. And when the Iewish Religion began to
be noted by the World, as the Orthodox Worship, Christ (as if he
affected nothing but Novelty) seems in their eys to cut it up by the
roots: And (as if he liked not to be served long after one fashion)
when once men built upon his own Principles that which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Catholick;</hi> he sends his own servants to protest against it, (as
in <hi>Luther</hi> and others:) And when his Doctrine also became a
little popular, you shall scarce find a Christian, but under the new
name of Puritan; And now it begins to be a Credit to be an old
Puritan, you shall scarce find any heat of true spiritual life, but
<pb facs="tcp:53360:4"/>
amongst them who are rayled against for the broaching of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
By all which seeming mutability, God testifies his constant
prosecution of the same Designe, <hi>viz.</hi> to make Christ, who to the
Greeks is foolishness, and to the Iews a stumbling block; to his
owne Servants, the power and wisdom of God to salvation; which
being fitly applicable to the times where in we live, and the Act of
the Army which I have undertaken to vindicate; I thought it
not amiss to make the Observation thereof one part of my Discourse

OR,
The Armies Vindication against an Aspersion
of Rebellion and Tyrannie cast upon them.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having read some Books inveighing against
the Armies late removing some Members
of Parliament from sitting in the House;
wherein they utterly mistake the state of
the present condition of affairs in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in all their Arguments; could do no less in duty, than
humbly to propose my thoughts, in vindication of them
therein.</p>
            <p>Those who dispute against them, do affirm these six
things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That they have resisted Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Broken their Trust and Vows to God and
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Dissolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53360:5"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Justified the King in that former somthing
Parallel attempt of his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Opened a gap to all Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Acted without any warrant from holy Writ.</p>
            <p>All which I conceive are grounded upon this one
mistake, <hi>viz.</hi> By giving that Authority to Governours
which is the right of a Free-born People, and onely ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
our taking up of Arms in Vindication thereof.
That is, that the Peoples Trustees, and not their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
should be Judges of their own Laws, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to remove their Rulers, if they will not keep
themselves within the bounds of their trust: which how
it may be applyed to justifie the present act of the Army,
in regard this Parliament was chosen to be the sole Judges
thereof in the behalf of the People; And consequently
the King who attempted to offer them violence in the
performance of this their Duty was so justly condemned.
How this Army in this particular can be justified, is the
scope I aime at.</p>
            <p>In order to which, we may observe that before the
King deserted his trust; the Parliament (being the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
were in such a capacity, that they were the sole
Judges of what concerned the Peoples Freedoms, and
therefore could not be said to tyranize over the People.
But since the King deserted the Parliament, they became
Governours themselves; and all Governours of a Free
people, ought to have their Wills regulated by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Trustees over whom they rule: which as the case
now stands, the Army having authority to do, did not in
restraining these members, act out of their Places and
Callings: And to cleer these particulars, we shall handle
them in this Order: Namely, to prove</p>
            <p>1. What it is to be in a capacity to act tyrannically, and
what not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53360:5"/>
2. That before the Kings deserting the Parliament, they
were not in a capacity so to act.</p>
            <p>3. That since the Kings deserting the Parliament, they
are in a capacity so to act.</p>
            <p>4. That the Army have a lawful Authority to judge of,
and restrain them from so acting.</p>
            <p>Which 4. being soundly proved, I doubt not but our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
such as are ingenuous, will yeild and confess, that
God hath overcome them, not onely by swords, but words;
by strength, but truth; by might, but right.</p>
            <p>And first, To be in a capacity to act tyrannically, is for ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to be the sole Judges of what they do or order, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the government of the people: because in this case,
whatsoever they ordain, the people are in no capacity to
shew their dislike: and consequently, if for their own privat
advantage, or some other by-respect they take away the just
due or Interest of some other man or men, there is no power
on earth to check or restrain them. On the other side, when
Rulers can make no Orders or Proceedings that are binding.
but those which the People (by their lawful Deputies) are in
a capacity to dis-avow and restrain, then Rulers are not in a
capacity to act tyrannically.</p>
            <p>2. Before the Kings deserting the Parliament, they were
not in a capacity to act tyrannically. For the Parliament
were the people met together, to demand of their Rulers
what they thought meet for their owne safety, and therefore
were not in a capacity to tyrannise over the people, because
themselves were the people, and not the Rulers, but were
to return to their dwellings, and themselves to be ruled by
those Laws they demanded.</p>
            <p>3. Since the Kings deserting the Parliament, they are in a
capacity to act tyrannically. For in his absence, they were
by approbation of the people, to take upon them to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53360:6"/>
that is, to make Orders and Ordinances to govern the
People by. Now it is already proved, that for Rulers to be
the sole Judges of what they do or order in reference to the
government of the People, is to be in a capacity to act Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically.
Therefore since the Kings deserting the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are in a capacity so to act.</p>
            <p>Or secondly, By giving Commission to Armies, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Governours of those Armies; and by governing
them, they govern the Kingdom: Now to govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
especially by force of Arms, and to be the sole Judges
of what they do or order in reference to the Government
thereof, is to be in a high capacity to act tyrannically.</p>
            <p>4. That the Armies which they raise, have a lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to judge of and restrain them from so acting. For
first, the People in Parliament are not Governours, but as
some of us are willing to acknowledge them so: For it is the
unquestionable right of a free people, not to be subject to
any whether they will or no. Indeed the Jews had somtime
Governours appointed them by Divine Authority; but we
(as far as we enjoy our freedom) not without our own choise,
and therefore as we were free in chusing them to represent us
as the people of England, so we were as free in chusing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we would allow them to be our Governours; except
we grant that the Kings deserting the Parliament, and their
undertaking to free us from tyrannie, could entitle them to
be our Governours, though none of the people of the land
had at all believed that they intended it. Therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Parliament were not our Governours, but as some of
us were willing to own them so.</p>
            <p>And that this is a truth, appeareth secondly, By the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
declaring the case, and therein appealing to the people
to be their own Judges, whether they wou'd receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
and take up Arms under their Authority or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53360:6"/>
2. We never owned their authority in giving Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to us or any of us, but as it gave them who received the
Commissions for us, a lawful authority to judge of and by
the sword, or otherwise to restrain them in acting tyrannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For if they gave us or our deputies (whom we and they
entrusted to receive the sword to defend us) a Commission
to oppose the Arbytrarie and Tyrannical power of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
then they gave us in our said Deputies, a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to oppose it in themselves; because in receiving their
Commission, we allow of them as Governours. Which
although it might not be expresly mentioned in their said
Commissions, yet it is to be understood, because we had
no other reason to take up Arms against our former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
but to oppose tyrannie.</p>
            <p>And secondly (as I have already shewed) if those who in
the capacity of Rulers do make Ordinances, should also in
the capacity of people have sole power to judge of the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them, then they are invested with power both to
make Ordinances whereby to dispose of the publike monies
for their own privat use, or otherwise dispose of our lives
and estates, and also be the sole Judges of the justness of so
doing: and it is not tolerable that our taking up Arms against
tyrannie, was to maintain such a tyrannical power. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must necessarily be allowed, that we never had owned
their authority in giving Commissions to us, or any of us, but
as it gave them authority, who received the Commissions
for us, again to judge of, and restrain them in acting tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
            <p>3. That thus to oppose, is the proper work of the Armies
raised by them; they being those who are entrusted with the
sword. First, because none but they are lawfully entrusted
to use their endeavours for this end: and therefore if those
who have no commission to assert our Liberties, should (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53360:7"/>
of another judgement) endeavour to oppose the Army
in what they do according to their Commission, they should
oppose them acting according to their places and callings to
preserve the people, without any commission or authority:
for to oppose those that act by a lawful commission, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against Authority.</p>
            <p>2. If both we as the people in Parliament, were willing
to give them a Commission to defend us the people of the
land against the tyrannie of Governours; and also they (as
willing to venture their lives in such our defence) were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to accept of this our deputation, as sufficient Authority
to bear them out in so doing: then though (now we see their
acting) we do not approve of their acting therein, yet if we
resist them, we act as private men against the Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by all the people in Parliament; and after we have
engaged ourselves to allow them liberty in so acting, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they should act therein, we also break our trust and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
if we deny it unto them: Therefore to use the
sword to oppose tyrannie is their proper work, and not ours.
So that you see here are three reasons why we may not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them herein.</p>
            <p>First, None can show a Commission to oppose tyrannie
but the Army.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We all entrusted them to use their best skill
herein. VVhich one is divided into two arguments.</p>
            <p>1. That they who oppose them, oppose their private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
against their own authority in Parliament. And</p>
            <p>2. Break their publike engagement to the Parliament and
Kingdom: which <hi>David</hi> saith <hi>we may not do, though the
keeping thereof should be to our prejudice.</hi> Now then, you see
it proved, that it is not onely the work to which they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lawfully: but so theirs, as none else may oppose, without
opposing the Authority of the whole Kingdom. Therefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53360:7"/>
the Armies raised by the Authority of Parliament, have a
lawful Authority to judge of, and restrain the same Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as they are not our selves or people, but our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours)
from acting tyrannically.</p>
            <p>And now I come to answer the six things before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
alledged against their proceedings herein.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>That they have resisted Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, That I have proved they were so far
from acting against Authority, that they have acted herein
according to their places and callings: and it is impossible that
mens very doing their duty should be the committing of sin,
or acting rebelliously. 2. I answer, That if the Members
in Parliament, as they are our Governours, have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to act and persever in acting things contrary to our liking,
declared by our lawful Deputies; then in so acting, they act
that which they have no Authority to do: in which to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, is to oppose their wills onely, not their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
3. It might by the same reason be proved that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
War is unlawful, because therein they opposed the
will of him that was their Governour. Therefore the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>my
have not resisted Authority.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. That they having vowed, and being entrusted to
maintain the Priviledges of Parliament) have broken their
vow and trust herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Priviledge of Parliament is the priviledge of
the people, whereby through their lawful Deputies they are
authorised to oppose that which they judge to be Tyrannie
in their Governours. But the Army (seing they, and none
else have Commission to oppose Tyranny) are therefore the
lawful Deputies entrusted to oppose that which they judge
Tyrannie in their Governours: Therefore they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
(not broken) their trust and vows to God and men
in thus doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53360:8"/>
               <hi>Object</hi> 3. They have dissolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Parliament be now not in the capacity of
a formal Parliament or People, met to demand our liberties
of our Governours, but as it were, a Councel of State, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised
(by means of them our lawful Deputies, taking up
Arms under their command) to be our Governours; then
to remove such evil Governours as by our lawful Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we judge tyrannical, is not to dissolve a Parliament, nor
yet to destroy, but regulate such a councel of Governours,
who must needs (in this case) without such a removal, be in
a capacity to destroy, but not to save us; and by such a remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
are restored unto a capacity to rule us safely. Now I say,
if this be true, (all which is either cleer of it self, or already
proved) then the Army have not by this act dissolved the
Parliament, nor yet the Government, but have done that,
which if they had not done, this Councel would have bin
not onely useless, but destructive to us, and being done, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
unto a capacity to preserve us: whose preservation is
the onely end of our fighting, and of their government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. That they justified the King in that former som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Parallel attempt of his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They are parallel in nothing but this, that the Kings
Act was in as high a degree of breaking of trust, as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
was a keeping of trust; That the Army without so act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
could not have performed their trust, I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
because they being in place of us the people, cannot be
faithful to us, but in removing such Governours they judge
tyrannical. And that the King without resisting the free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
or people of England, could not lightly have broken
his trust, is as cleer; but sure I am, that by his attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
some of them out of the House, he did endeavour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-aw
the rest, and so to make us all his creatures and slaves,
by our own consent in Parliament, is so evident, as it need not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53360:8"/>
be proved: which is manifestly against his Oath and Trust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. That they have opened a gap to all Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For the lawful Deputies of the people not to be
satisfied without a timely removal of such as they judge ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Governours; is so far from opening a gap unto, that
it shuts the dore against Rebellion, which otherwise they
judge would ensue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that is properly rebellion, which is
acted against the authority of the people in their lawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
upon any pretense whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object</hi> 6. That they have acted without any warrant from
holy writ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He that turns the truth with the wrong side up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and in that posture laies it to the rule of God word,
must needs give a judgment quite contrary to truth: For we
have proved that insteed of resisting our authority, they have
maintained our authority: insteed of breaking their trust,
they have performed their trust: insteed of justifying the
Kings act, they have condemned it: insteed of opening a gap
to rebellion, they have shut the dore against it: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it follows, that insteed of acting without warrant
from holy Writ, they have acted by authority from such
Warrant. And now, not doubting all honest Christians will
see their error, and (as <hi>David</hi>) take their own sentence to
themselves unto whom it belongs, which they have urged
with as much zeal as we can press upon them; We are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
they will yeild obedience unto lawful Authority, which
if others amongst them refuse to do, shall not God (to use
his own expression) laugh to see them taking such pains, thus
to sentence themselves, whilst they rejoyce in conceit, that
they have beaten his cause and servants down to the ground?
And shall not all the Saints say <hi>Amen?</hi> Even so be it Lord
Jesus.</p>
