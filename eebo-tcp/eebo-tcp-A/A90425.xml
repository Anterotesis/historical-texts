         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME
PROPOSALS
For a Second Settlement in the
<hi>Province of Pennſylvania.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas I did about nine Years paſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the ſelling of ſeveral <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Shares</hi> of
Land, upon that ſide of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> next
<hi>Delaware-River,</hi> and ſetting out of a Place upon it for
the building of a <hi>City,</hi> by the name of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and
that divers Perſons cloſed with thoſe Propoſals, who,
by their ingenuity, induſtry and charge, have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that <hi>City,</hi> from a Wood, to a good forwardneſs of
Building (there being <hi>above One Thouſand Houſes finiſht
in it</hi>) and that the ſeveral <hi>Plantations</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> begun up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land, bought by thoſe firſt Undertakers, are alſo
in a proſperous way of Improvement and Inlargement
(inſomuch as laſt Year, <hi>ten Sail of Ships were freighted
there, with the growth of the Province,</hi> for <hi>Barbados, Jamaica,</hi>
&amp;c. Beſides what came directly for this Kingdom) It
is now my purpoſe to make another <hi>Settlement,</hi> upon the
River of <hi>Suſquehannagh,</hi> that runs into the Bay of
<hi>Cheſapeake,</hi> and bears about fifty Miles <hi>Weſt</hi> from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Delaware,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Common Maps</hi> of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Dominion in <hi>America.</hi> There I deſign to lay out
a <hi>Plat</hi> for the building of another <hi>City,</hi> in the moſt
convenient place for communication with the former
Plantations on the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> which by Land, is as good as
done already, a Way being laid out between the two
Rivers very exactly and conveniently, at leaſt three
years ago; and which will not be hard to do by Water,
by the benefit of the River <hi>Scoalkill;</hi> for a <hi>Branch</hi> of
that River lies near a <hi>Branch</hi> that runs into <hi>Suſquehannagh</hi>
River, and is the <hi>Common Courſe</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> with their
<hi>Skins</hi> and <hi>Furrs</hi> into our parts, and to the Provinces of
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſy,</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> from the <hi>Weſt</hi> and
<hi>North-Weſt</hi> parts of the <hi>Continent</hi> from whence they
bring them.</p>
            <p>And I do alſo intend that every one who ſhall be a
<hi>Purchaſſer</hi> in this propoſed <hi>Settlement,</hi> ſhall have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<hi>Lot</hi> in the ſaid <hi>City</hi> to build a Houſe or Houſes
upon; which <hi>Town-Ground,</hi> and the <hi>Shares</hi> of Land that
ſhall be bought of me, ſhall be delivered clear of all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
pretentions;</hi> for it has been my way from the firſt,
to purchaſe their Title from them, and ſo ſettle with
their conſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Shares</hi> I diſpoſe of, contain each, Three Thouſand
<hi>Acres,</hi> for 100 <hi>l.</hi> and for greater or leſſer quantities, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that rate. The <hi>Acre</hi> of that Province is according
to the Statute of the <hi>33th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. And no <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement</hi>
or <hi>Quit-Rent</hi> ſhall be paid by the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
till five years after a Settlement be made upon their
Lands, and that only according to the quantity of <hi>Acres</hi>
ſo taken up and ſeated, and not otherwiſe; and only
then to pay but <hi>one ſhilling</hi> per annum for every hundred
<hi>Acres forever.</hi> And further, I do promiſe to agree with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Purchaſſer that ſhall be willing to treat with me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this and next Spring, upon all ſuch reaſonable
conditions, as ſhall be thought neceſſary for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
intending, if God pleaſe, to return with
what ſpeed I can, and my Family with me, in order to
our future reſidence.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that which particularly recommends
this <hi>Settlement,</hi> is the known Goodneſs of the Soyle,
and Scituation of the Land, which is high &amp; not Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous;
alſo the Pleaſantneſs, and Largneſs of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
being clear and not rapid, and broader then the
<hi>Thames</hi> at London-bridge, many Miles above the place
deſigned for this <hi>Settlement;</hi> and runs (as we are told
by the <hi>Indians) quite through the Province,</hi> into which
many fair Rivers empty themſelves. The ſorts of <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
that grow there, are chiefly <hi>Oake, Aſh, Cheſnut,
Walnut, Cedar,</hi> and <hi>Poplar.</hi> The native <hi>Fruits</hi> are <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paws,
Grapes, Mulberys, Cheſnuts,</hi> and ſeveral ſorts of
<hi>Walnuts.</hi> There are likewiſe great quantities of <hi>Deer,</hi>
and eſpecially <hi>Elks,</hi> which are much bigger than our
<hi>Red Deer,</hi> and uſe that River in Herds. And <hi>Fiſh</hi> there
is of divers ſorts, and very large and good, and in great
plenty.</p>
            <p>But that which recommends both this <hi>Settlement</hi> in
perticular, and the Province in general, is a late <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
obtained by divers Eminent Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>for that Land that lies North of</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>up to the</hi>
46th <hi>Degree and an half,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
will be chiefly through <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that Province and the Sea. We have alſo the
comfort of being the <hi>Center</hi> of all the Engliſh Colonies
upon the <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> as they lie from the
<hi>North-Eaſt parts of New-England to the moſt Southerly parts
of Carolina,</hi> being above 1000 Miles upon the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>If any Perſons pleaſe to apply themſelves to me by
Letters in relation to this affair, they may direct them
to <hi>Robert Neſs</hi> Scrivener in <hi>Lumber-Street</hi> in <hi>London</hi> for
<hi>Philip Ford,</hi> and ſuitable anſwers will be returned by
the firſt oppertunity. There are alſo <hi>Inſtructions</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for information of ſuch as intend to go, or ſend Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or Families thither, which way they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with moſt <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Advantage,</hi> both here and there,
in reference to <hi>Paſſage, Goods, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſels, Building, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
Stock, Subſiſtance, Traffick,</hi> &amp;c. being the effect of
their Expence and Experiance <hi>that have ſeen the fruit of
their Labours.</hi>
