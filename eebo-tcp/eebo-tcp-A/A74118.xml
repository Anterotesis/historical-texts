         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Right Honorable, The Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament:</hi> The humble Petition of the Major, Magiſtrates, Miniſters and Commons of the Town of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and others well-affected and deſirous of the Peace of God to rule in this Kingdom;</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners being conſcious of their Solemn Engagement with you in Proteſtation, Vow and Covenant before the Searcher of Hearts, and Judge of Spirits, for Reformation according to Gods Word, Extirpation of Popery and Prelacy, Reſtitution of Civil Rights and Liberties, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Juſt Priviledges of Parliament, and the Defence and Preſervation of His Majeſties Perſon and Authority in the Preſervation and Defence of all the former, do finde themſelves bound upon juſt grounds to make this recognition of their Duty unto you at this time.</p>
            <p>For firſt, knowing that this general Engagement was undertaken in order to procure a juſt, holy and ſafe Peace, which God might own, We deſire humbly to minde you, as our ſelves deſire ſadly to conſider, and to bear the iniquity in bitterneſs of Soul before God, whether the breach of Covenant in retarding the work of Gods houſe, and too much ſparing Malignant wickedneſs againſt God and man, have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord to keep this Peace far off from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, having ſeen ſtrange actings of many, and (as we humbly conceive) irregular preſsing upon your Authority to Byaſs you ſeveral ways, formerly and of late; and having heard of much Treachery of men in betraying their Truſts both by Sea and Land, and of impetuous Petitions and unreaſonable for a Perſonal Treaty upon any terms, without due Satisfaction and Security given for the effecting thoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and juſt ends of the Covenant (which we are conſident many of thoſe Petitioners have ſworn alſo to the Almighty) and for Ceſſation, and laying aſide your Arms in ſuch a time when the cruel and Malignant Enemy is prepared to ruine you and the Kingdom, we are ſenſible that theſe perverſe workings muſt be grievous to you, and cauſe many obſtructions to the work of God in your hands, as well as to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Peace, which we are confident God will require of thoſe Authors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſidering that ye are of the ſame mould with us, though called of God, and ſet up over us for good at this time, and that ye are ſubject to diſcouragement, and to wax feeble by defections and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of men, we that are your weakeſt and loweſt parts deſire to be ſupplying to you what ſtrength the Lord gives in, who alone is the life of you and us: Whom that we may not make our Enemy,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioners for themſelves, and in the name of many thouſands, do humbly pray you in the midſt of all diſtractions, to be incouraged in the Lord, to look ſtrictly to the performance of the Solemn Covenant, as you have to the making of it, that Gods work in eſtabliſhing Religion and Government according to his Word be haſtned, That your bands be ſtrong to do Iuſtice early and impartially among men, That you do not precipitate your Counſels and Reſolutions for a Treaty prejudicial to the end of our Covenant, at which God ſhould be angry: For as the Petitioners profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pray and long for the Peace of our Native and Neighboring Kingdoms; yet ſuch a Peace do we deſire, whereof God may be the Author, Rule and End, which alone will keep us in true ſafety. And foraſmuch as ye have engaged all the true hearted, godly and well-affected in theſe Kingdoms to undertake with you to their Eſtates and Lives, We humbly pray you faithfully to perſevere in acting your Declarations frequently made for their common ſafety, and notwithſtanding specious pretences made by Petition, not to ſwerve from your firſt juſt Principles of our general Covenanting with you to make God angry, and let in the common Enemy to spoil. And furthermore our humble requeſt is, ſeeing God hath made this poor place and people ſerviceable for the Kingdoms good, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your power through your Supplies to them (for which we deſire unceſſantly to bleſs the Lord) that ſtill through your gracious influence it may be enabled to ſerve God and you againſt the common Enemy by Sea and Land; and that ſuch Authority may be derived from you unto us, as may enable us to act again for our own and Kingdoms Defence: In doing all which ye ſhall pleaſe God, encourage the hearts of the faithful in the Land, ſtrike fear on your enemies; The Lord of Hoſts himſelf ſhall be ſtill your ſhield and great reward, but a terror and confuſion to and deceitful men.</hi>
