            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

STAFFORD-SHIRE, Esq.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat I here Offer You, I
choose to Pay as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of my Gratitude, and as
Part of the Debt I owe to the
Honour of your long-continued
Friendship and Acquaintance;
Notwithstanding you might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
Demand it on your own
Personal Account and Merit;
as being able to pass Sentence
<pb facs="tcp:60801:3"/>
both on the Author and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator,
and to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Criticisms are well
grounded, or the Translation
just and proper. For you have
not fail'd to Improve the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Nature has given you, by
the Advantages of Study and
Education; having a Mind
Inquisitive and Curious, Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
Solid and Retentive,
averse to Sloth, and always
Busy and Industrious: So that
you brought to the University, a
greater Stock of Sense, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen carry from it;
and Built successfully upon the
Grammar-Foundation, so well
laid by your Excellent Master,
a Superstructure of sound, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than superficial Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It was your distinguishing
Prudence, forthwith to make
<pb facs="tcp:60801:3"/>
Choice of the best Company, as
well as Books, thereby season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Mind with a true
sense of Learning, and good
Manners; which thing alone,
were there no other Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on you, had made you a
Friend to the University and
the Church, and a worthy
Member of both; whilst others
bringing nothing but Ignorance
and their hereditary Vices hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and Conversing with none,
but those of the like Stamp
and Character, make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
of the Colledge the
chief Topick of their Discourse
when they have left it: Those
being ever most forward to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
the Universities, when
from them, who in them were
their greatest Scandal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:60801:4"/>
a plentiful Estate calls off some
part of your Thoughts and time
from your Study, yet the choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of both are still imploy'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your own Improvement;
since you think it no less becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Gentleman to inlarge his
Mind, than his Fortune, and to
have his Head, than his House,
richly Furnisht; upon which
Account I shall not pretend, by
the Present I here make you,
to Inform you so much as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
you, whenever you shall
please to allow some of your lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure-minutes,
in comparing the
Copy with the Original. But if
this <hi>Comparison</hi> of the Two
Best Historians, and <hi>Reflections
upon History,</hi> shall either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to take Pen in Hand,
or Assist you hereafter in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
a Piece of that Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:60801:4"/>
I shall Merit more of the
Publick, than will at first
View be discover'd: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may happen, I shall
not fail of my Design, which
was my own Satisfaction, in
making, tho' a Poor, yet Real
Acknowledgement of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Favours you have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on,</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Must beg leave to Acquaint
the Reader, in Two or
Three words, with the Reason
that induc'd me to enter on
the Translation of <hi>Rapin;</hi>
which probably might seem
Unnecessary, since it had been
formerly done, and was in the
Hands of most People. But
understanding it was Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by several Persons, at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Times, and some of it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
enough, and that which
was better out of Print; and
being inform'd some parts of it
had not hitherto been Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and desir'd to go over with
<pb facs="tcp:60801:5"/>
it again, to make it all of a
Piece, and of more general
Use, I thought my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pains would
not be very ill Imploy'd, if I
Collected the scatter'd Parts of
so excellent a Book, and reduc'd
them into a Body: Especially
since I might Advantage my
self by the Failings and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
of Others, and possibly,
by imitating what was Good,
and avoiding what was Bad in
in them, make a tolerable
Translation. I began with the
Authors Treatises upon Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in his <hi>Comparison</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections;</hi>
upon the Booksellers
Information they had not been
Attempted before: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nothing was more season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than a Comparison of
<hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> at a time
when the former was Printing,
<pb facs="tcp:60801:6"/>
in an excellent Edition at the
<hi>Theatre;</hi> nothing being more
necessary to the thorow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any Author, than the
Reading, together with him,
the best Censures and Criticks
that have been Wrote upon
him. But it was a kind of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to me, when I had finisht
the <hi>Reflections,</hi> to find they
had been ventur'd on before,
by One <hi>Davis de Kidwelli,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
it would cost me a
fresh Trouble, where I fell
in with his Expression, to
Change my own: But finding
the Copy he went by to be the
Original rough-cast and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
before the Author had
put his last hand to it; and
that we seldome agreed in the
way of expressing the same
thing, I let Mine pass without
<pb facs="tcp:60801:6"/>
any Alteration. I have been
told too, by a Gentleman, he
thought he had seen the other
Part done; but not being able
to get a Sight of it, I leave
the <hi>Comparison</hi> to take its
Chance: If it meets with a kind
Reception, the rest shall speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Publisht; if not, I am
not not so great an Enemy to
the Bookseller and my self, as
as to throw my Pains, and his
Money away to no Purpose.
I have only this to add, That
I would not be thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have Translated the
whole, to Believe it all: There
are some few Reflections that
smell too strong of the <hi>Jesuite;</hi>
who, in Favour of his Church,
falls into Partiality, whilst he
is Declaring against it; but
the Instances serve his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:60801:7"/>
as well as if they were
True; and 'tis a Fault which
must be Pardon'd him, since
it cannot be avoided, be the
Man never fo Learn'd, without
abandoning his Religion.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR'S Preface.</head>
            <p>MY Design in Comparing these Two
Authors, is only to make their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
better known; since I take them to be
the most Proper of all others, to form a
Man's Sense and Reason, in an Age, where
both are better Cultivated and Improv'd,
than in any other. Wherein, this may be
said to the Commendation of our own Times,
That we understand the Character of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Authors better, and are more intimately
Acquainted with their Mind and Meaning
than our Predecessors.</p>
            <p>The Difference between them and us is
this, That greater Pretensions were made to
Learning in their Age, than ours. This
was formerly so much in Fashion, that
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Queen of England, Translated
several of <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Tragedies; and
<hi>Mary Stuart</hi> the Queen <hi>Dauphine,</hi> recited
at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> in the great <hi>Guard-Hall,</hi>
before the whole Court, a Latine Oration of
her Own making, and the Chancellor of the
Hospital, in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Ninth, was as well skill'd in Languages as
a Professor of the <hi>Colledge-Royal.</hi> 'Twas
the Genius of those Times, in which nothing
was so much in Vogue, as a great Capacity
<pb facs="tcp:60801:8"/>
and profound Reading: The Tongues were
thorowly Studied, and Men betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to reform the Text of Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
by far-fetcht Interpretations; to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilize
upon an equivocal Term, and to found
a Conjecture for the establishing a Correction.
In short, they scrupulously adher'd to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sense, because they were not able to reach
the Spirit of the Author, and his Meaning;
which now adays is done, Men being become
more Rational, and less Learn'd; and
greater account is made of good Sense, in
the greatest Simplicity, than of an awkward
and perverse Capacity of Mind.</p>
            <p>Hereby it is we are arriv'd to a greater
Intimacy with the Sentiments of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and a more thorow Knowledge of their
Writings: Which is so true, that all Men,
never so little Impartial, must agree to it;
and I may say without Vanity, I give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Idea of the Spirit of <hi>Livy,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in this little Piece I have drawn,
than <hi>Gronovius</hi> has done in his last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Printed at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the Year
1665; which contains a long, and exact
History of the Manuscripts of the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
of the Editions put out from time to
time, and of a Catalogue of those Men who
have endeavour'd, by their Notes or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
by their Reflections or Criticisms,
<pb facs="tcp:60801:8"/>
to re-estalish or augment him. There is not
to be found, in all the Assistances he affords
us, for the understanding this Historian,
nor in all his other Commentators, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
a Knowledge of his Character, as that
which I give in this Volume, as little as it
is. At least, I shall not spoil the fine Relish
the World begins to have of good Sense, upon
Reason's displaying its self to the Learn'd,
in all the Extent of Solidity and Delicacy:
Which is so thorowly setled in the Minds
of Men at this day, that in all the Works,
Recommended to us by the Merit of their
Antiquity, the Preference is without Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
given to a Man of good Sense, and little
Learning, before a Man of Learning of an
injudicious Character.</p>
            <p>I am fearful however of Discouraging
those who have no Genius for Writing, by
desiring to Encourage those that have. For
whatever Rules may be given for History,
none can be prescrib'd more severe than
those <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
After all, That which I shall say
may be Serviceable to many Things; being
design'd to destroy the Remainder of that
Love of false Lustre, which still obtains,
even in this Age, amongst Men whose Tast
is not throughly purg'd and purify'd; to
enlighten those who pretend to write with a
<pb facs="tcp:60801:9"/>
Ray of sober Reason, which makes the Solid
Character; to stop that current of Repute,
some sort of Men still attribute to Flash
and Words; to shew that 'tis from Things
rather than Words, the Nobleness of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
should be sought; to avoid that emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
greatness of Discourse, as contrary to the
real Dignity of Expression, as a too naked
Simplicity; and to write in a sensible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by the right use of a correct and sober
Reason, which is no where better learn'd,
than from the Acquaintance with these Two
Authors; for I know very few that are
more proper to make a Man Rational, that
reads them, if he reads them well: And
though I should only say, that all the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth still
reigns in <hi>Livy,</hi> after it has been more than
1500 Years destroy'd; and all the Purity
of Reason of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> appears
the same still in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> as it was
2000 Years ago; yet this would be enough
one would think, to excite the Curiosity of a
generous Soul to know the Bottome of them,
according to their Merits. For in short,
there probably never appear'd in any Work,
more solid Reasons, accompanied with all
the Force and Dignity of Discourse; nor
good Sense deliver'd with a more exquisite
Judgment, than in these Two Authors.</p>

of such Works as these which I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

be hard to convince them that a just
Comparison can be made betwixt Two
Authors, whose Works have nothing of
Relation or Proportion to each other.
For that of <hi>Livy</hi> is an Universal Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of a People who had the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the World, that takes in a space
of more than Seven Hundred Years;
and that of <hi>Thucydides</hi> is only a Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a History, relating to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Nation, and of a War that lasted
not Thirty Years in all: Such are the
Difficulties that immediately offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Execution of my propos'd
Design; and it is troublesome to engage
in't before this Point be clear'd.</p>
               <p>For the first we need only understand
what is the end of History, to be able
to judge with some kind of certainty
and distinction, of the excellency of a
work of that nature. And for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
difficulty which respects the choice
I have made of these two Authors, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can better justify it, than what I
shall say in Commendation of them
both. For not to tye my self to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Learned who have given
their judgment of them before me, upon
which I might build my own; not to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60801:11"/>
mention <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis,</hi> the
most judicious Critick of them all; who
calls <hi>Thucydides,</hi> the most perfect of the
<hi>Greek Historians,</hi> assuring us that the
ingenious of his time took him for the
true pattern of writing History: Not
to call in the evidence of <hi>Quintilian</hi> in
favour of <hi>Livy</hi> whom he prefers before
all the <hi>Latin Historians;</hi> nor to alledge
the admiration they have both been had
in, by all ages, where sound Sense hath
had any sway or dominion; nothing can
possibly afford us a better view of the
ascendant these <hi>two Historians</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all others, than the Parallel which
may be drawn betwixt them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
those that are doubtful in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For the only <hi>Greeks</hi> that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to completion with <hi>Thucydides,</hi> are
in my opinion <hi>Herodotus, Xenophon</hi> and
<hi>Polybius:</hi> The rest deserve not to enter
the Lists with him, as rising not to that
grandeur and dignity which History re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus,</hi> indeed took a greater flight:
His design including all that was nobly
transacted in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> for the space of
two Hundred Years was more fortunate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60801:12"/>
than that of <hi>Thucydides;</hi> but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is no way answerable to the
grandeur of the Subject. The too great
ambition that <hi>Author</hi> had to please made
him so careless of Truth, that <hi>Plutarch</hi>
concludes his Falshoods alone would
make a Volume: and his Integrity has
been extreamly run down, by all that
have examin'd it. He was of a temper
too agreeable to have a Character that
was solid, laborious, and fit for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Truth. He's of a superficial
Genius that lays not stress enough on
things to carry our Mind to the bottome
of them. As to <hi>Xenophon,</hi> he is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for the sweetness of his Stile; but
is too smooth, and too much upon the
level; he hardly makes a step out of that
<hi>middle way,</hi> which yet carries in it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
noble and natural. <hi>Polybius</hi> is a
kind of <hi>Philosopher</hi> of a penetrating
Spirit, who lays out himself in Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and generally divests himself of
the character of <hi>Historian</hi> to put on the
<hi>Politician.</hi> The rest of the <hi>Greeks</hi> have
nothing in them comparable to <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is still less Difficulty in respect
of <hi>Livy</hi> among the <hi>Latines,</hi> the most
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60801:12"/>
accomplisht of whose <hi>Historians</hi> come
not near him. <hi>Salust</hi> has scarce any
thing that is finisht: What we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
of his History, is in-sufficient
to give us a just notion of his Merit.
There remains indeed enough to give
us a good Opinion of him; but too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to found a Comparison on with <hi>Livy.
Cesar</hi> (that in the most familiar way of
expressing himself has retain'd that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which became him, and writing in
the lowest kind of <hi>middle Style,</hi> wants
nothing of the fineness of the most <hi>exact)</hi>
is no <hi>Historian. Paterculus</hi>'s Piece, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
of a noble and delicate tast has too
little <hi>Body,</hi> because it has too much <hi>Soul.
Tacitus</hi> has an admirable <hi>genius;</hi> but he
generally out-shoots the <hi>sublime:</hi> He is
noble enough in his Thoughts; but is
not Natural in what he thinks. 'Tis
true he has abundance of Wit, but such
sort of Wit that can not speak of <hi>plain</hi>
things in a <hi>plain</hi> manner: for he is still
politick and artificial in every thing he
says. His work is not so much an <hi>History</hi>
as <hi>Reflections</hi> on <hi>History:</hi> he busied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in making Reflections,<note place="margin">Fabius. Cluvias. Plin.</note> being
forestall'd by others, who left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new for him to say, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60801:13"/>
him to that way he took, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he succeeded, and made himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
<hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> has handled
a noble Theme with too florid and gay
an air, in terms too exquisite and far
fetcht, and too studied figures. In some
places he sports a little with his Subject,
forgetting the importance was such as
requir'd more Gravity. <hi>Livy</hi> alone has
<hi>fill'd</hi> up all the <hi>parts</hi> of a compleat <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
The greatness of his <hi>Subject</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his <hi>Style:</hi> he has matcht the
<hi>Grandeur</hi> of a People, whose History he
writes, with as noble a <hi>Genius:</hi> That
<hi>matter</hi> could not be treated, as became
its greatness, but in that <hi>manner</hi> he has
done it; who has been Master of all
the Beauties of Composition in such
heighth of perfection, as no Man else
has ever been so happy as to arrive to.</p>
               <p>So then, all things well consider'd,
<hi>Thucydides</hi> has not only stood <hi>unparallel'd</hi>
among those <hi>Greek Historians,</hi> which
have been handed down to us, and <hi>Livy</hi>
been <hi>unrival'd</hi> amongst the <hi>Latines;</hi> but
both the one and the other have arriv'd
to such a <hi>pitch</hi> of Excellency as has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in no <hi>Historian</hi> ever since. And all
succeeding Ages have as it were fall'n
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60801:13"/>
prostrate at their Feet, acknowledging
them to be <hi>Genius's</hi> of the highest Order,
destin'd to be Rules and Models to all
others. Which will be made out, in
that which follows, so as to be unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
to all those who will have
a little patience and attention.</p>
               <p>For the third Difficulty I own it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make a just Comparison of
<hi>two Authors,</hi> and their History who have
no relation to each other. But in respect
of their <hi>wit</hi> and of their <hi>temper,</hi> of their
<hi>ways</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of writing, and all that
belongs to Composition they may be
compar'd: 'tis only herein they can be
made the subject of a <hi>Comparison,</hi> and
it is in this only that I <hi>compare</hi> them:
But let us consider their <hi>Persons</hi> before
we enter upon their Works.</p>

               <p>THO' <hi>Impartiality, Fidelity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,</hi>
and other <hi>moral</hi> Virtues,
are not always necessary Qualifications
of an <hi>Author</hi> in general: we may say
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60801:14"/>
notwithstanding they are extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to an <hi>Historian</hi> whose Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should ever be honest and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning.
'Tis necessary his Zeal for
<hi>Truth</hi> be as Sacred to him as his <hi>Religion;</hi>
that <hi>Integrity</hi> be his indispensable Rule;
that <hi>Honour, love of Equity,</hi> and a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested
Meaning</hi> shine in every thing
he writes, and every thing he thinks.
So that although it requires a prodigious
stock of Parts to write <hi>History</hi> well; yet
an <hi>Historian</hi> that is in search of Glory,
and thinks to make himself Immortal,
should be more solicitous to avoid the
imperfections of <hi>Will</hi> than Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the one being more Essential than
the other. For 'tis not so much the
Parts and great Capacity, as the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of an Author which is regarded,
when Men desire to be instructed how
things have been managed and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacted
in former times; since the best
wrote History, take away the Credit of
it, is no better than a Fable. But an
Historian cannot himself be Faithful,
unless he is an Honest man, disengaged
of Prejudice, Interest and Passion. And
these Qualifications require a niceness
of Conscience, a greatness of Soul, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60801:14"/>
a Courage above the common rate.
Which probably gave occasion to that
<hi>Roman</hi> to admire how it
came into the head of one

<hi>History;</hi> because to carry on such an
Attempt successfully there is requir'd a
sort of <hi>liberty</hi> inconsistent with any
thing <hi>slavish</hi> or cringing. A <hi>dishonest</hi>
Man whose Soul is not of a make capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to distinguish <hi>false</hi> Glory from <hi>true,</hi>
and who can be sensibly affected with
other <hi>Interests</hi> than those of <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Reason,</hi> is the unfittest in the world to
write an <hi>History.</hi> He will never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the <hi>belief</hi> of Mankind, who
first gains not their good <hi>opinion</hi> of his
<hi>Probity.</hi> So that <hi>sincerity</hi> stands him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of all things, if he would be well
receiv'd, and if <hi>Wit</hi> should sometimes
chance to fail him, yet Principles of
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> should never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
This then is the first <hi>foundation</hi>
for an <hi>Historian,</hi> as to his own concern.
And these are the Principles on which I
intend to examine these <hi>two Authors</hi> in
what respects their <hi>Persons</hi> in order to
compare them.</p>

We know nothing of certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Thucydides</hi> but
what he himself has deliver'd in his
<hi>History,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides.</hi>
                  </note> that he was a Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi>
and General of the Army in <hi>Thrace,</hi>
where he Married; that his Possessions
were very great there, and that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
much esteem by the largeness of
his Expences. For the rest Antiquity is
almost silent in the matter. There is no
question to be made but that he was of
an honourable Extraction, which, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi>
who has left us a Fragment of
the Life of this Great Man, deduces
from the Kings of <hi>Thrace</hi> pretending
that his Grandfather married a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Family, whence his Father
took the Name <hi>Olorus,</hi> and that he
reckon'd amongst his Ancestors <hi>Miltia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
and <hi>Cimon</hi> those Two celebrated Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of the <hi>Athenians. Suidas</hi> and
<hi>Photius</hi> relate that <hi>Thucydides</hi> when a
Youth hearing <hi>Herodotus</hi> read his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
at the Solemnity of the <hi>Olympick</hi>
Games, fell a Crying, through a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Jealousy, and a sense of Emulation.
Which gave occasion to <hi>Herodotus</hi> to
Complement the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>young
Gentleman,</hi> as giving an infallible earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60801:15"/>
of his future Glory: In short he was
an <hi>honest</hi> Man; the severity of his <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi>
and his <hi>Piety</hi> are to be seen in several
places of his Works, where he ever
talks like a man of excellent Principles,
never advancing of his own Head any
Maxim of dangerous consequence. And
his Discourse carries always in it a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
air of Vertue. Take for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
what he says of a famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
that was put to Death by the
<hi>Syracusians</hi> after his Defeat. <hi>Thus fell</hi>
Nicias,<note place="margin">Libro 7. De Bello. Pelop.</note>

Worshiper of the Gods.</hi> And by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his Integrity, which appears
in all his Writings he discovers the true
bottome of his Heart, and the Purity
of his Manners, which is the Quality
<hi>Aristotle</hi> chiefly requires in a
Discourse:<note place="margin">Rhet. l. 3. c. 7.</note> when he says it can never
be agreeable to the Subject, when 'tis
insufficient to give you the <hi>manners</hi> of
the Speaker: and a Discourse is nothing
worth where the <hi>manners</hi> of the man
are naught; for 'tis a Rule that one
should be conformable to the other.
Which is the particular Character of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60801:16"/>
this <hi>Author</hi> who never fails to create a
good Opinion of himself in the Minds
of those that read him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was his Master in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi>
and <hi>Antiphon</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> by both
which his Mind was form'd in that
solid and sensible manner to those Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which lay the main Foundation of
his Character. But as excellent as he
was at these Sciences, he however knew
the <hi>World</hi> better than <hi>Books.</hi> The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
he had with <hi>Socrates, Plato,
Critias, Alcibiades, Pericles,</hi> and all the
Great Men of that Age, which was the
Politest, and of the finest Tast that has
ever been among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> gave the
finishing stroke, so as to fit his Mind
with these noble Idea's and Principles,
which make an absolute <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and
an accomplisht <hi>Historian:</hi> For besides
that no man ever wrote in a more <hi>brave</hi>
and disinterested manner, without the
least reserve to his Resentment: he has
moreover said nothing, but withal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Candor. He was so utter an
Enemy to all manner of <hi>disguise</hi> that he
could not away with any thing that
should, I don't say wound, but give the
least Offence to Truth, never advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60801:16"/>
any Maxime that lookt not towards
the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Publick,</hi> the Love of
which was engraven in his Heart. He
was so tender and scrupulous of <hi>honour,</hi>
that he has not fail'd in his <hi>History</hi> to
treat the <hi>Athenians</hi> well, even those at
whose Hands he had receiv'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Indignities: concealing nothing
which might be to the Advantage of
<hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Brasidas</hi> the principal Authors
of his Banishment.</p>
               <p>For it was principally through the
Intriegue of <hi>Cleon</hi> his Rival, that he
was Banisht his Country, for not having
succour'd <hi>Amphipolis</hi> whither he was
commanded: and it was during his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile
that he wrote his <hi>History,</hi> finding
more leisure, and better instructions in
the Enemies Affairs, amongst whom he
liv'd, as he declares in his Fifth Book;
in which he speaks of his Banishment,
and his Retirement among the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi>
by whose means he got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Mystery of Affairs,
which he had no possibility of knowing
any other way. His Lady that he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
bringing him a vast Fortune, he
made use of it to collect his <hi>Memoirs;</hi>
and he disburst considerable Summs to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60801:17"/>
the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Commanders to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Truth of those things
which his own <hi>Party</hi> for their <hi>own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
had disguis'd. The Passion he had
for Study, and the Pleasure he took in
it, made his ill Fortune sit easier upon
him, by giving him Resolution: 'Tis
not known that he ever attempted his
Restoration; the Honours that were due
to him seem'd <hi>odious,</hi> since he thought it
a <hi>shame</hi> to ask them; and having thro'
Modesty never been forward, before his
Exile, to make his way up to the Helm,
he thought himself now utterly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of doing it, being suspected by the
<hi>Citizens.</hi> He retreated to <hi>Egina</hi> a small
Island of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> where he began
to work upon his History: His Exile
lasted Twenty Years, and he Died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had finisht it. 'Tis his great
Glory to have said nothing against his
<hi>Conscience,</hi> as <hi>Dionysius Hallicarnassensis</hi>
assures us in his own words,<note place="margin">Dion. Halic. in Jud. de Thucyd. Num. 9.</note>
and that was One of his more special Qualities. <hi>Cicero</hi> gives him
almost the same Encomium:<note place="margin">Thucydides rerum gestarum pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciator sincerus.</note>
and 'tis the Testimony the
<hi>Learn'd</hi> of all <hi>Antiquity</hi> have given of
him, who have extoll'd his Sincerity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60801:17"/>
his other Vertues. He had the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to serve his Country both with his
<hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Pen;</hi> being engag'd in most
of the Expeditions he <hi>Describes.</hi> And
having, through the Employs the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>
had intrusted him with, obtain'd
an intire Knowledge of the Affairs of
his own Country, as well as the Interests
of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Common-wealth,
for the Particulars of which he was
wholly oblig'd to his Exile: This gave
him opportunity of preparing himself
for his Undertaking with a Diligence
which scarce had its Precedent. And it
may be said, never <hi>Historian</hi> took <hi>Pen</hi>
in hand better furnisht with Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which he collected out of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Interests of the Two Nations
whose History he undertook. It may be
farther added, that never Author had a

Aversion to Injustice than <hi>Thucydides.</hi>

of his Age, before his Work was finisht.

                  </note> For whether he had a

live retir'd in Silence and Obscurity:
certain it is we know very little of his
Origin, his Employments, his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or the condition of his Fortune
in general. Only thus much, that he
was of <hi>Padua,</hi> contrary to <hi>Sigonius</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
who would have him Born in a
Village near that Town, call'd <hi>Apona,</hi>
producing for this the pretended Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Martial</hi> in one of his Epigrams.
'Tis plain too he was of an <hi>honourable</hi>
Family, since it had the Honour of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

acquaintance, and good opinion;
that he after wrote a Treatise of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to his Son, which <hi>Quintilian</hi>
made great account of; that he began
his <hi>History</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> for the convenience
of such Memorials as were necessary,
which were Recorded in the <hi>Annals</hi> in

<hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>fabulous</hi> Traditions,
wherewith the <hi>Originals</hi> of the City of

in his Study; that he recited to
<hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Mecenas</hi> some parts of his
<hi>History,</hi> wherewith they were sensibly

After the death of <hi>Augustus</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Padua,</hi> where the Citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with extraordinary honours.
He dy'd in the fourth Year of the Reign
of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> His abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Favour of <hi>Augustus,</hi> gave him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of furnishing himself with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
necessary to his Design. The
Zeal for his Undertaking, which was
great and extraordinary, so fixt him to
his Closet, and gave him so little disquiet
for the Concernments of his Fortune,
that his Life thereby became a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure:
being he was Oblig'd to seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
himself from a more publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and live private, that he
might give himself wholly up to that
grand Work he had in hand. He must
needs have had a Soul prodigiously
great, to form the project of so vast and

the Scope of that <hi>History</hi>
which has been the most
absolute Master-piece of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi>
and the Admiration
of all Ages. <hi>I am uncertain
whether the History I write of the Actions
of the Roman People, since the Foundation
of Rome, will be a Work worth any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and tho' I were perswaded</hi> of it, <hi>I
durst not say it: for it is a matter</hi> &amp;c. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60801:20"/>
rest of that <hi>Exordium,</hi> which I offer not to
Copy, since 'tis in the hands of all Men,
is answerable to the beginning, and is
sufficient to shew the Spirit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
Never Man <hi>promis'd</hi> so little in
Beginning a Work that <hi>promis'd</hi> so
much. He comes not without <hi>trembling</hi>
to the opening his Design, Diffident of
his own strength, in the sustaining so
great an Enterprize. But 'tis only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to give us <hi>more</hi> that he suffers us to
hope so <hi>little:</hi> he is not <hi>timorous,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is <hi>wise,</hi> and ordinarily a Man is
no farther <hi>Modest</hi> than he is <hi>Judicious.</hi>
And this Character of <hi>Modesty</hi> is the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
amongst all the Qualities of an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
that is Meditating some great
thing; nothing creates a greater notion
of his Judgment than his Distrust. It is
a proof of his Capacity that he is sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the weightiness of his Subject, and
'tis the greatest Testimony can be given
of the Honesty of an <hi>Historian.</hi> For
what a Fund of Discretion and good
manners must he needs have that can sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
all Pride so natural to Mankind, and
do himself Justice without Flattery. See
wherein <hi>Livy</hi> is worthy of Admiration
as soon as he opens his Lips. But after
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60801:20"/>
he has given us so mean an Opinion of
himself by the small Regard he makes
of his own Performances, he lets us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a multitude of <hi>Lights,</hi> he discovers a
<hi>profoundness</hi> of Mind, an <hi>extent</hi> of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
a <hi>fruitfullness</hi> of Imagination; in
fine, a Thousand Beauties, and infinite
Treasures, which we attend not to, when
we only <hi>reckon</hi> upon what he promis'd us.</p>
               <p>For his <hi>Sincerity</hi> it Underwent the
severest Trial, that possibly could be,
without being Corrupted. The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he was in with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and that
Favour to which he had advanc'd him,
were not Motives sufficient to hinder his
speaking Honourably, not only of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
but also <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Enemies of that <hi>Emperour;</hi> honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Memory of the <hi>Conquer'd</hi> in the
Face, as one may say, of the <hi>Conqueror:</hi>
and Recommending to the World, as
Honest Men, the Murtherers of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
in the Presence of <hi>Augustus:</hi> because
they were Lovers of their own Country.
'Tis this which <hi>Cremutius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
thought impossible to be
sufficiently Praised in <hi>Titus

               <p>Such was <hi>Livy</hi> for his <hi>Moral</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments,

the Vertue of the later soar'd not quite so
high, since it went no farther, than cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him to speak well of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of

may be Collected of the Persons and

and Imperceptible, that without a

can be known. Take however what
Ancient Authors have left us of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,</hi>
who were best able to know his
Character.</p>
               <p>He has a mind so Solid,<note place="margin">The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides.</hi>
                  </note> and well
Founded, that he speaks nothing but
what is well thought, and correct; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what has all the Nerves and
Strength, his Subject is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.
And whereas he always arrives
at the truest Sense, and purest Reason,
troubling not his Head about the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Discourse, his way is usually
somewhat dry, yet strong and lively,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60801:22"/>
because he is concise and close in his
Expression. 'Twas from that great
strength of Parts that he Studied to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
so <hi>much</hi> Sense in so <hi>few</hi> words, and
<hi>talking less</hi> than others, that he often
<hi>said</hi> a great deal <hi>more.</hi> Take <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
Opinion of him in these
words.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thucydides</hi> omnes dicendi artificio mea sententia facile vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, qui ita creber est rerum frequentia ut verborum prope nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum sententiarum numero consequatur.

                  <hi>Thucydides in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Style, and the art of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
in my Opinion
goes far beyond all that have
Wrote: he abounds so with
Matter, that his thoughts are
almost equal in number to
his Words, and he is so expressive and close
in what he says, that 'tis hard to say whether
his words set off the</hi> things, <hi>or the things his</hi>
words, <hi>the most.</hi> This is what makes him
so very Sententious in respect of other
Historians; and is the cause that his
Sense, straitned and confin'd in so few
words, becomes something <hi>Obscure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it wants that <hi>Liberty</hi> and Compass
requir'd to make it Natural and Easy.</p>
               <p>His Style is Exalted, Noble and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
which is the reason of his using so
frequent and so <hi>bold</hi> Metaphors, in pure
<hi>Political</hi> terms, yet better <hi>manag'd</hi> than
those of <hi>Plato:</hi> and hence he arriv'd to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60801:22"/>
that grandeur of Expression which reigns
so strongly in his Writings: in which
he is ever <hi>great,</hi> without being <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi>
in his Thoughts; always Natural,
yet falls not into any thing <hi>vulgar</hi> or
<hi>common.</hi> This he took from <hi>Homer,</hi> whose
Imitator he perfectly was. He propos'd
him for a Pattern in his <hi>simple,</hi> though <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Expression, and almost in the whole
Order of his Discourse, that is <hi>lively</hi> and
<hi>animated. Marcellinus</hi> adds, that he betook
himself to one <hi>Prodicus</hi> of the <hi>Island Cos,</hi>
for the exact Choice of Words, and to
<hi>Gorgias</hi> of <hi>Leontium</hi> for Order and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
And besides that, this <hi>Historian</hi>
form'd himself upon <hi>Pindar</hi> for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi>
Style, and the Greatness of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
which was his Excellence.</p>
               <p>He had also learnt of <hi>Socrates,</hi> by the
acquaintance he had with him, the Art
of a Frank, and Ingenuous <hi>Narration,</hi>
which he was so well accustom'd to,
and which procur'd him the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion</hi>
in so high a measure: true it is
that never any Man knew how to use
his Reason better, or to make it more
prevalent by those <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>strong</hi>
and pressing Turns he gave it: 'tis in
this likewise he so far Transcends the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60801:23"/>
rest of <hi>Authors,</hi> speaking nothing but
what was Essential to his Design. This
it is that gives that Weight, Force and
Dignity to his Discourse. He is indeed
sometimes a little irregular in his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
but 'tis always an Effect of <hi>art</hi>
more than <hi>disorder.</hi> 'Tis only to <hi>inspirit</hi>
what he says, and to <hi>paint</hi> things in a
more <hi>lively</hi> manner, that he expresses
as <hi>present,</hi> what is <hi>past,</hi> and as careless
as he seems in certain places, he still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
a justness of Expression couch'd in
his words, so as nothing in the World is
more natural than his Eloquence, or more
<hi>finely</hi> Natural: His way of reasoning by
frequent <hi>Enthymems,</hi> which <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
has so well Copied, is strong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and nothing can be more lively
or more engaging, than that Air of his
which makes his distinguishing Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.
<hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</hi> concludes
him to be the first <hi>Inventer</hi> of that way,
which has set him so far above all other
Writers. We find in the end of that
<hi>Critick</hi>'s Discourse, to <hi>Tubero,</hi> the places
wherein <hi>Demosthenes</hi> has best exprest
the force and grandeur of <hi>Thucydides</hi> in
his imitation. 'Twas upon this great
Model that noble <hi>Orator</hi> was form'd, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60801:23"/>
which he apply'd himself with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Industry, as to Transcribe this
<hi>Authors History eight</hi> times over, to take
his Character, and Copy out his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as we are assur'd by his <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Vlpian</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician.</hi> And it was
chiefly in his Declamations against <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
of <hi>Macedon</hi> that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> imitated
that Historian; and in the places where
he speaks of the Republicks of <hi>Corinth,
Corcyra,</hi> and of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and in
such other Subjects as had reference to
those <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had to treat of.</p>
               <p>In fine <hi>Thucydides</hi> had a <hi>nobleness</hi> of
Thought, a <hi>choice</hi> of Words, a <hi>boldness</hi>
of Imagination, a <hi>vigour</hi> of Discourse, a
<hi>profoundness</hi> of Reasoning, a <hi>neatness</hi> of
Conception, a <hi>fineness</hi> of Stroke, Colour
and Expression, which none of the other
<hi>Greek Historians</hi> have been Masters of;
which gave the most Ingenious <hi>Criticks</hi>
amongst the <hi>Ancients</hi> reason to acquaint
us, he took the <hi>true Style,</hi> History ought
to be Wrote in: And indeed whatever
he says, whatever passes through his
Mind, receives a Turn of Greatness and
Beauty beyond what any others can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us. He is a <hi>Genius</hi> of an order above
the common Standard, that conceives
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60801:24"/>
every thing Nobly, and gives a sort of
Elevation to the most ordinary things.
This so solid Character of mind gave
him an exquisite <hi>relish</hi> for what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
an admirable <hi>sagacity</hi> in the
choice of things, an obstinate <hi>adherence</hi>
to <hi>Truth,</hi> (which made him a Critical
observer of every thing any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to the discovery of it) and an
incredible <hi>aversion</hi> to any thing that was
an offence to <hi>probability;</hi> ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
more to <hi>profit</hi> than <hi>please,</hi> as he
declares himself at the beginning of his
Work. Hence he became so careful and
scrupulous as to <hi>throw off</hi> many of those
Ornaments his Subject might have <hi>wore;</hi>
as his <hi>Historian</hi> has observ'd,<note place="margin">Marcellin. in vita Thucyd.</note>
to the end he might avoid
those famous <hi>Rocks,</hi> on which want of
Discretion cast <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as <hi>Arion</hi> and
his <hi>Dolphin,</hi> with the rest of his fabulous
Adventures.<note place="margin">Dionys. Halic. in Judicio de Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyd. Num. 9.</note> And 'tis on this
account also that all <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
has had so great an Opinion of
<hi>Thucydides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, this <hi>great Man</hi> seems to be
in nothing worthier of Admiration, than
in his Treating of the <hi>manners</hi> of Men,
as one that excellently understood <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60801:24"/>
and had all the <hi>penetration</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to <hi>unfold</hi> the most intricate <hi>doublings</hi>
of the Heart: 'Twas from this profound
Knowledge, he could so well discover
the <hi>springs</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> of the nicest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and the most imperceptible <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the secretest Passions that set
Mankind on work: 'twas through the
shrewdness of his <hi>view,</hi> that he stor'd
his mind with those grand Maxims of
the <hi>publick good,</hi> and all those <hi>political</hi>
Considerations wherewith his <hi>History</hi>
abounds: and upon which he built his
principal Reasonings for the establishing
of States, and continuing them establisht.
From this so vast, and rich Fund, it is
he draws out those <hi>noble sentiments,</hi> and
<hi>admirable reflections</hi> he makes upon the
management of the <hi>People,</hi> and conduct
of their <hi>Governours,</hi> and from whence
he deduces those excellent <hi>principles</hi> that
are the first Foundations of that <hi>Equity</hi>
and <hi>Honesty</hi> which make <hi>flourishing</hi>
States; and those sound <hi>political</hi> and
<hi>moral Maxims,</hi> which serve for Rules to
guide Men in their duty. Hence it is
he Circumstantiates every thing with
so much Distinction, keeping close to <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Particularities, and cutting of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60801:25"/>
what is <hi>useless</hi> or <hi>superfluous</hi> to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Hence he takes those lively, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
and pathetical <hi>descriptions,</hi> that
Embellish his Discourse: from hence it
is he forms the project of his <hi>Narratives</hi>
of Battles, Sieges, Assaults, Defences,
warlike Expeditions, popular Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all those Agitations that usually
happen in Common-wealths, through
the nature of their Government, which
are ever judiciously Circumstanc'd. To
conclude, 'tis from that <hi>rich treasury</hi> of
the knowledge of Mens manners he has
taken all those Rules of <hi>decency,</hi> which
teach him to represent all Conditions,
Persons and Actions as their Quality and
Capacity demand; and from whence
he has form'd that <hi>wonderful art</hi> of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that renders him absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of those he speaks to, in perswading
them whatever he desires. 'Tis by this
Art he engages and <hi>fixes</hi> the mind of
his Reader upon the <hi>action</hi> he describes,
by so dazling Colours and lively Images
representing to his Eyes, as it were, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his Understanding the things
he speaks of, moving his Passion, raising
his Attention, and filling him full of the
matter he's expressing: whilst the Mind

                  <hi>dragg'd</hi> along with a pleasing kind of
<hi>violence,</hi> lets go its hold, and is willingly
carried away by the <hi>Impetus</hi> of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
for the better <hi>attending</hi> to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
               <p>But though all <hi>Authors</hi> indifferently
make use of the <hi>same</hi> Terms and the
<hi>same</hi> Expressions,<note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  </note> yet each has a <hi>peculiar</hi>
Character, because the order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of his Discourse is different;
as every <hi>Painter</hi> has a <hi>particular</hi> way,
tho' all have the <hi>same</hi> Colours. Take then
the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Livy.</hi> He had, together
with all the Accomplishments of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,</hi>
in which he equally excell'd, an
advantage of <hi>Birth</hi> above him, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Felicity</hi> for all things fine and great,
wherein he had a Palate extraordinary
delicate. He had an exquisite Faculty of
expressing his Thoughts nobly, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Genius</hi> for Eloquence in general,
that is, for the <hi>purity</hi> of Discourse; for a
<hi>fineness</hi> of Speech, for the <hi>dignity</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and a certain <hi>elevation</hi> of Soul,
that made him most fortunate in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination.
He was to compleat these
Qualifications, <hi>choice</hi> in his Words,
<hi>just</hi> in the order of his Discourse,
<hi>great</hi> in his Sentiments, <hi>noble</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60801:26"/>
in the Disposition and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<hi>Oeconomy</hi> of his Design: he was
in short Master of all the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of
History: For <hi>History</hi> has a peculiar <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi>
of its own, and this <hi>Rhetorick</hi> has
its Rules.<note place="margin">Illa <hi>Livii</hi> lactea ubertas satis doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit eum qui non speciem expositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis sed fidem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Instit.</hi> l. 10. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Quintilian</hi> says
his <hi>Style</hi> is <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>fluent,</hi>
that it has a greater Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to <hi>Solidity,</hi> than <hi>flash</hi>
and <hi>lustre;</hi> and is most pleasing to
those who had rather be <hi>Affected,</hi> than
<hi>Dazled</hi> and <hi>Amazed.</hi> His Air is <hi>great</hi>
and noble in its <hi>simplicity,</hi> and he has a
<hi>softness</hi> of Expression, ever supported
with much <hi>force</hi> and Majesty. His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is <hi>animated,</hi> in so <hi>lively</hi> a manner,
as suffers nothing to <hi>droop</hi> or languish.
And the <hi>turn,</hi> the <hi>cadency,</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> he
gives to all he says, the <hi>justness</hi> of his
Words, the <hi>clearness</hi> of his Sense, every
thing he has is <hi>admirable.</hi> Perhaps there
was never <hi>Historian</hi> more Engaging by
the Talent he had of Expressing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Life, and giving her a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
Face, as became her <hi>several</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
painting her always in her <hi>proper</hi>
Colours, making every Passion speak its
<hi>Genuine Language</hi> that it might have
its effect upon the Mind. Hence it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60801:26"/>
he's so incomparable at <hi>painting</hi> the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
that his <hi>Potraictures</hi> are so <hi>like,</hi> that
he <hi>expresses</hi> every thing in the <hi>features</hi>
that become it, never <hi>confounding</hi> those
Beauties which Nature has distinguisht.</p>
               <p>He eminently exceeds the rest of the
<hi>Historians</hi> in that perfect Knowledge he
has of all <hi>decorums,</hi> which is a Science in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably
necessary to a Man that will
write <hi>History,</hi> since nothing carries a <hi>face</hi>
of Truth, but from an exact Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what is <hi>agreeable</hi> to each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
See how he distinguishes the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Ages</hi> of the Common-wealth, by
the <hi>difference</hi> of Spirit and Manners that
reign'd in it. 'Tis by this Principle <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
and <hi>Scipio</hi> preserve their Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
so well in this <hi>Author;</hi> where nothing
is touch'd in the same manner, or wrote
in the <hi>same tenour.</hi> From hence it is that
<hi>Rome</hi> could speak otherways under
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> than in the Reigns
of the <hi>last Consuls</hi> and <hi>Emperours:</hi> that
every one in that History stands mark'd
with a <hi>distinguishing</hi> Character. The
Historian often changes the <hi>Style</hi> its self.
His Discourse has <hi>authority</hi> when it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs,
it has <hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>condescension</hi>
when it Perswades, <hi>neatness</hi> when it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60801:27"/>
is <hi>graceful</hi> and Elegant when it
would Please, is <hi>fervent, moving</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical</hi>
when it would Affect. He is <hi>moral</hi>
and <hi>instructive</hi> where it is requir'd, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lessons to the whole World, and at
the same time seeming to do nothing less.</p>
               <p>Finally the <hi>length</hi> of his <hi>period,</hi> which
many are apt to reproach him with, is
in my Judgment one of his greatest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages:
'tis this only that makes him
<hi>majestical.</hi> For a long and ample <hi>Style</hi>
never wants <hi>majesty</hi> when it is, like his,
bore up with good Sense, and an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Choice of Words. After all, the World
has never been able to discern his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
He has a secret Art couch'd under
a seeming Plainness and <hi>simplicity,</hi> which
makes him appear <hi>natural</hi> throughout
his Work. He is particularly sure to
practise that Art, in that which seems
to have its dependance most on Nature;
carefully shunning all manner of <hi>affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and Studying always to be <hi>simple:</hi>
'tis by this <hi>stately</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> way toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is the most usual Ornament
of his Discourse, that he <hi>strikes</hi> the Soul
with those wonderful <hi>impressions,</hi> that he
<hi>shakes</hi> and Agitates it as he pleases, that
his sentiments <hi>break</hi> in upon you through
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60801:27"/>
the <hi>force</hi> of his words, (the strength of
which he very well understood,) and
that he always moves those whom he is
speaking to by the natural <hi>energy</hi> of his
Expression. This Quality renders him
as <hi>vehement</hi> in his <hi>great</hi> passions, as <hi>soft</hi>
and agreeable in the <hi>less,</hi> giving the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
a more <hi>active</hi> and lively Mein, and
<hi>smoothing</hi> over the latter with a <hi>gentle</hi>
and tender Touch. Indeed the Genius
he had for the Nobleness of Expression,
and the Art he had to manage it so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously,
and imploy it upon occasion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd
him to raise himself upon any
great Event. 'Twas here he took a kind
of Pride to set forth, as one may say,
and shew the most rare and conceal'd
Riches of his Soul, in their full Capacity.
What Draughts, what Paintings, does he
then give you, when the Greatness of
his Theme, at once excites him, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
him with those admirable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
he knew how to make the best
of! And it is in those <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
lofty Topicks, that he raises and
ennobles his Discourse, by those great
Ideas with which his excellent <hi>Genius,</hi>
for the <hi>sublime</hi> and majestick Style in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
him, which is his very Character.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60801:28"/>
'Tis in fine, by the natural and proper
Choice of Words, the most in use, but
the most Glittering and Harmonious,
which add a Lustre to all the other Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Discourse, He excites in the Mind
of his Readers, an <hi>admiration</hi> mingled
with Surprize, which is quite another
thing than the Pleasure that accrews
from meer Perswasion.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge <hi>Thucydides</hi> has much
of this Character, I know likewise that
<hi>Longinus</hi> reckons him amongst the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
he proposes of the <hi>sublime,</hi> that he
has a natural Happiness at Expressing
things <hi>nobly,</hi> that he even <hi>stamps</hi> the <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
of the Object he describes upon the
very Words: that the frequency of his
<hi>figures,</hi> especially the <hi>hyperbaton,</hi> which
he uses in his <hi>narration,</hi> gives more heat
and action to his Discourse, by transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
things, and changing the natural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the time, as a means to keep the
Mind <hi>close</hi> to the Subject he represents in
so <hi>lively</hi> Colours; that his <hi>sublime</hi> is ever
sustain'd by a <hi>greatness</hi> of Sense, and a
<hi>vigour</hi> of Expression; and that he has
throughout his manner of Writing, a
kind of <hi>loftiness</hi> that strikes the Mind.
For none but those who have a solid
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60801:28"/>
way of Thinking are able to <hi>elevate</hi> a
a Discourse. But it must be confess'd
that the <hi>sublime</hi> of <hi>Thucydides</hi> is less ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
than that of <hi>Livy,</hi> who knows as
well to <hi>stoop</hi> in lesser things, as to mount
and <hi>soar</hi> in greater, and to give those
Flourishes and Graces to his Discourse,
which <hi>Thucydides</hi> never thought of.
Which made <hi>Dionysius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassensis</hi>
say,<note place="margin">Lib. de Collec. Verb. numb 29.</note> That <hi>Thucydides</hi>
was always beautiful indeed, but scarce
ever agreeable: for he distinguishes the
<hi>gracefulness</hi> from the <hi>beauty</hi> of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
'Tis the <hi>cadence,</hi> the <hi>harmony,</hi> the
<hi>elegance,</hi> the <hi>fineness,</hi> the <hi>sweetness,</hi> the
<hi>lustre</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and the proper <hi>decorum</hi>
of a Subject, that he will have to make
a Discourse <hi>graceful;</hi> and 'tis in the <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi>
the <hi>nobleness,</hi> the <hi>majesty,</hi> and the
<hi>gravity,</hi> he makes the <hi>beauty</hi> to consist:
the <hi>grace</hi> and Mein is generally the effect
of Parts and Nature, <hi>beauty</hi> is often the
Product of Art; the one is the <hi>gift</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the other the <hi>effect</hi> of Study.</p>
               <p>'Tis herein, almost, consists the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
there is betwixt our

                  <hi>Livy</hi> is fine
and agreable to a Miracle; he
knew how to <hi>strew</hi> his <hi>flowers</hi> in the places
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60801:29"/>
that needed them: he had likewise a
happy Faculty of <hi>managing</hi> his Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and <hi>embellishing</hi> his Discourse;
which Advantage Nature had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
upon <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who is <hi>fine</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
caring to be <hi>agreeable;</hi> that <hi>austerity</hi>
of Temper, which is so natural to him,
that <hi>severity</hi> of Way, that <hi>exactness</hi> of
Sense, that <hi>correctness</hi> of Reason, and that
prodigious <hi>seriousness</hi> he Wrote with,
made him diligently avoid those <hi>charms</hi>
of Language, which he disapprov'd in
<hi>Herodotus.</hi> The <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>Livy</hi> is of a
<hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> make: The <hi>beauty</hi> of
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> is <hi>stately, austere,</hi> and <hi>ancient,</hi>
as <hi>Dionysius</hi> himself calls it:<note place="margin">Dionys. Halic. in Jud. de Thucyd.</note>
The one is always <hi>noble,</hi> and
the other taking. The one tyes himself
dryly to his Matter, which he precisely
pursues; the other gives an agreeable
Form to every thing that goes through
his Mind. And this is it wherein the
essential Difference of their Characters
consists. Let us examine the <hi>subjects,</hi>
both of them have work'd upon, and
compare them likewise in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that nothing may be wanting to a

                  <hi>THucydides</hi> having so great a <hi>Genius,</hi>
'twas impossible he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any mean Design. So <hi>lofty</hi> a Mind
could not admit <hi>low</hi> and groveling Ideas.
The <hi>Peloponesian War,</hi> which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to Write,<note place="margin">The Subject of <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                  </note> was at that time, the
most curious Subject of History in being;
<hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</hi> assures us too,
that he preferr'd it before that of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus.</hi>
And he says, That having laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him for a Model, the Two most ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<hi>Historians</hi> of his Time, <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> he found fault with
the <hi>subjects</hi> each of them had taken. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicus</hi>'s
Design, who had attempted to
write the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> lookt too
uncompounded, too narrow, and of too
little Action. <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s <hi>History,</hi> which
contain'd the Wars the <hi>Grecians</hi> wag'd
against the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> that is to say,
all the Memorable Actions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60801:30"/>
in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> for Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years space, seem'd too vast and
unweildy. He thought so great an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
very disproportionate to the Mind
of Man, unable to comprehend in his
Thought so mighty a Project: Upon
which he mistrusted his own Abilities,
despairing in the <hi>thread</hi> of a Discourse,
to give that due <hi>Connexion</hi> so different
Matters would require, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
seem'd too Extravagant and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent.</p>
               <p>So having thought upon his Design,
he pitcht upon a middle and a moderate
way, choosing a Subject capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bounded in a less compass than that
of <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and of receiving a greater
extent than <hi>Hellanicus</hi>'s: Engaging Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the History of the <hi>Peloponesian
War,</hi> which continued Seven and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years. But to ascend to the Fountain
head of that War; it Commenc'd upon
the occasion of the War betwixt <hi>Corinth</hi>
and <hi>Corcyra. Peloponesus</hi> is a kind of
Peninsula in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> formerly
going by the name of the Country of
<hi>Argos,</hi> and now of the <hi>Morea.</hi> The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
the more potent People of the
Two, being attackt by the <hi>Corcyreans,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60801:30"/>
who were the ancient <hi>Phaeacians,</hi> the
<hi>Athenians</hi> ingag'd in their Interest, and
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
into their Protection. The two Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> were then
in the most flourishing Condition they
were ever known in; and as their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was arriv'd to the highest pitch, and
their respective Grandeur gave a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Jealousy of each other, that War
was a kind of Dispute betwixt them for
the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> began to be suspected
by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who was become the
Favourite of the <hi>People,</hi> by his <hi>popular</hi>
Behaviour. He had the absolute Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Affairs of <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>War</hi> in the Republick for Fourty Years
together, and by that admirable Talent
he had in <hi>Oratory,</hi> becoming an <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Soveraign</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> he made
that City formidable to the rest of the
Common-wealths of <hi>Greece,</hi> by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Embassies he caused it to depute ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon its real, or pretended Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests:
which thing rendring that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>
so highly considerable in all the
Countries round about, caus'd the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60801:31"/>
first to take the Allarm; and
these two States exasperated by a long
Emulation, began to dispute the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power, by a formal War they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
for which the War of <hi>Corcyra</hi>
and <hi>Corinth</hi> was only a Pretense. All
<hi>Greece</hi> was concern'd, and most of the
Neighbouring People engag'd in the
Quarrel, which became the most Famous
in the World, and they sided according
as their different Interest, or different
Pretensions carry'd them, to this or that
Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> reflecting in his Exile on
that famous Dispute betwixt Two of
the most <hi>polite</hi> and <hi>warlike</hi> People in the
World, found nothing that could better
imploy his Leisure than the Writing of
their History: And being resolv'd upon
it, consulting his own Breast, he found
he had sufficient Strength to write what
he knew himself, and what he could
collect from those who had bore a part
in Affairs in a Controversy of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
so as to give a good Account
of it to Posterity. It is true, the different
Temper of the <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi>
that uniform Conduct he observ'd in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi>
for the continuance of the same
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60801:31"/>
Form of Government, without the least
Alteration, which made that <hi>Republick</hi>
so <hi>powerful,</hi> as to be able to give <hi>Laws</hi>
to its Neighbours; that <hi>severity</hi> of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<hi>rigidness</hi> of Morals, <hi>frugality</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<hi>modesty</hi> of Habit, all opposite to
the <hi>luxary, pompousness,</hi> and <hi>politeness</hi> of
<hi>Athens:</hi> besides the consideration of
that <hi>people,</hi> always giddy and wavering
in their Sentiments; which was a true
Image of Lightness and Inconstancy,
compar'd with the Constancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> promis'd
him fair Idea's for the compleating such
Pieces as were likely to please, from their
Diversity and Opposition: those great
Generals <hi>Themistocles, Pericles, Therame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Alcibiades, Nicias,</hi> with so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that had the principal Commands
on both sides, and all the <hi>Grandees,</hi> who
signaliz'd themselves more eminently
by their <hi>glorious</hi> Actions in that War,
whose Names have all along been mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd
in so high a manner, furnisht him
with noble Subjects, whereby he might
recommend himself by representing
them to the Life.</p>
               <p>Add to all this the strange Accidents
that War was disturb'd with, as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60801:32"/>
Earthquakes, frequent Eclipses
of the Sun, Droughts, Famines, Plagues,
and other more fatal Adventures, which
gave him a Priviledge of <hi>diversifying</hi> his
Work, mingling it with <hi>terrible</hi> Subjects,
and most <hi>frightful</hi> Occurrences. There
might probably be other more ingaging
Prospects than these foremention'd, that
determin'd this <hi>Author</hi> in the Choice
of his Subject, which seem'd worthy to
imploy his Pen, from such a Retail of
mighty Circumstances as render'd that
War, (as he himself in the beginning of
his Work confesses) the most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enterprize in all Antiquity: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon</hi> were
at their highest Point of Glory, and all
<hi>Greece</hi> interess'd it self in that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Sure it is also, that <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who
was a Man of a singular Judgment, found
the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> War so fine a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that he quitted those other Works
he had before him, to Accomplish that
<hi>History Thucydides</hi> had left imperfect, by
reason of his Death, that took him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly.</p>
               <p>As great,<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  </note> notwithstanding, as this
<hi>subject</hi> seem'd to this <hi>Author,</hi> it must not
come at all in Competition with <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60801:32"/>
which <hi>Livy</hi> went upon. There is so
great a Disproportion betwixt them,
that there's no room for Deliberation
concerning the Preheminence. This is
the <hi>intire</hi> History of many Ages, of a
<hi>people</hi> almost always Victorious, and
that made it self Master of the World.
'Tis a vast, and unfathom'd Ocean, a
Carriere of so unbounded an Extent, that
it may be said, such a grand Design never
entred the Head of any Historian besides
him. Others who have undertaken as
long-winded Pieces, in proper speaking,
are <hi>Compilers,</hi> not <hi>Historians.</hi> In fine, 'tis
one of the greatest Attempts of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Mind; and possibly never <hi>Author</hi>
appear'd in a vaster <hi>Theatre,</hi> as one may
say, than He. But 'tis not only from the
long <hi>succession</hi> of Time, and the <hi>multitude</hi>
of Years, the Subject is so great: 'Tis
through the Grandeur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a People that
was <hi>Soveraign</hi> of all others: 'tis by the
<hi>glorious actions</hi> of this People, in their
war-like Expeditions, and Treaties of
Peace, which they dispatcht so Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
for the Interest of their State;
'tis from a Thousand almost <hi>incredible
events,</hi> wherewith Fortune exercis'd
their Vertue; 'tis in that <hi>prudence</hi> they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60801:33"/>
manifested in their Councels, the <hi>Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of their Deliberations, <hi>diligence</hi> in
executing their Designs, their <hi>secrecy</hi> and
faithfulness in the most important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and in their <hi>resolution</hi> in unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Dangers, and the greatest Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
In short, every thing seems strange
and wonderful in that admirable Design.
The <hi>Originals</hi> of that State, which grew
so mighty from so small beginnings, its
<hi>progress,</hi> its <hi>changes,</hi> its Vicissitudes, the
Revolutions of its Power and Greatness,
its <hi>exaltation,</hi> and almost inconceiveable
<hi>pitch</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> it arriv'd to; by its patient
induring <hi>hardships,</hi> by its perseverance
in <hi>labours,</hi> by the exact Observation of
<hi>laws,</hi> by the inviolable severity of its
<hi>discipline</hi> in the <hi>duties</hi> of Peace and War,
and by training up a well regulated
and martial Souldiery, encourag'd, and
exalted, with the only Thoughts, and
prospect of <hi>Aggrandizing</hi> the Roman
Name.</p>
               <p>Thus then this <hi>design,</hi> considered well
in all its Circumstances, is the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Subject</hi> History ever had. 'Tis a
long train of the Adventures of a People
that being <hi>scandalous,</hi> as it was, in its
Origine, coming of an Extraction in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60801:33"/>
manner <hi>infamous,</hi> Born and Nurs'd in
<hi>plunderings</hi> and <hi>murders,</hi> train'd up to
<hi>villanies;</hi> became <hi>wise, frugal, just,</hi> passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<hi>studious</hi> of <hi>glory, faithful</hi> to its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and professing <hi>uprightness</hi> in all
things. 'Tis the Story of the Fate and
Fortunes of a <hi>City</hi> that rais'd it self to
Universal <hi>Empire,</hi> and became the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi>
of the whole World; from a
Troop of vagabond <hi>Shepherds,</hi> acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
packt together upon the Banks of
<hi>Tiber:</hi> 'tis the Conduct of a Government
wherein the Observation of a <hi>rigid</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
concurring with a <hi>ready</hi> and
faithful <hi>obedience,</hi> was had in greatest
Honour and Regard; though the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
thereof were very Lame and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.
For the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> having
subdued other <hi>nations,</hi> could no longer
suffer <hi>equivocations,</hi> or Disguises in its
<hi>consultations:</hi> loose, unresolv'd, feeble,
interessed, dishonest Councels were no
more heard of. 'Twas a Nation that
was <hi>vertuous</hi> through a <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi>
whose <hi>valour</hi> was the product
more of the <hi>head,</hi> than <hi>heart;</hi> That court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or avoided Danger, from a <hi>result</hi> of
Prudence; and knew as well when to
expose it self, as when to retreat by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60801:34"/>
                  <hi>Dictates</hi> of Reason; and obtain'd the
<hi>Soveraignty</hi> over the rest of the World,
more by the Reputation of its <hi>vertue,</hi>
than the force of its <hi>Arms.</hi> This is the
true Character of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<hi>Livy</hi> undertook to write. And as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
seems finer amongst all the works
of Reason, than the Relation of a great
Enterprize, happily conducted to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
End, through a thousand Obstacles
and Oppositions: as nothing is so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
as to see the Progress of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
through the successive Degrees of
its Augmentation and Strength it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by little, and little, from Poor,
Mean, and Contemptible Beginnings;
so nothing is more proper to be related,
because it will appear agreeable in all
its retail of Circumstances.</p>
               <p>The History of a <hi>people,</hi> or a <hi>Prince,</hi>
that is always <hi>successful,</hi> can never it self
Succeed: it will have too much <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi>
and nothing is more insipid in
a relation than too long a Prosperity, and
a perpetual Success. There must be <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi>
of Events, changes of Fortune, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of Adventures, all sorts of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are fit to attract the Mind of
the Reader, by their Diversity. And all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60801:34"/>
this abounding in <hi>Titus Livy</hi>'s History,
far more than in any other, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the most absolute Subject an
<hi>Historian</hi> could have fallen upon. 'Twas
from this view that <hi>Livy</hi> forthwith
pitcht upon it, as finding in it those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Advantages for his <hi>Genius,</hi>
which he knew how to dispose of to
their best Use, in the Execution of his
Work. This Subject so Noble, so Great,
so Rich, through so many different Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
it included, seem'd a <hi>weight</hi>
not too <hi>heavy</hi> for his Shoulders. He found
a means of confining himself in so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
a Matter without lanching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>needless</hi> Digressions, and Amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the generality of <hi>Historians</hi> do.
The <hi>greatness</hi> of his Subject, which he
so well gave us to Understand, by his
natural <hi>distrust,</hi> in shewing only his own
Weakness, and the Disproportion of his
Strength, at the entry of his Work, did
not at all discourage him; because he
saw that <hi>compass</hi> it took in, as vast as it
was, reduc'd to the <hi>unity</hi> of a single
State, whose Fortunes he describ'd.
That <hi>darkness</hi> likewise, and uncertainty
he found under the first Consuls, which
perplext the coherence of the Subject,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60801:35"/>
in the beginnings of the Republick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
not his Resolutions: For he knew
how in those <hi>confusions</hi> to do his part
<hi>sincerely,</hi> not vouching any thing for
<hi>certain</hi> but what he found to be <hi>so;</hi> and
Doubting himself the first, of that which
was Doubtful and Suspicious.</p>
               <p>Besides that <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>Genius</hi> which
he found capable of so great a Design,
in the ordering and management of its
Parts, in the just proportions of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht
Piece; besides that thorow
understanding he had of his Subject,
wherewith he had stor'd his Mind: the
Knowledge he got of the World in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>'s
Court by his <hi>acquaintance</hi> with
all the most accomplisht Persons in the
<hi>Empire; Rome</hi> that <hi>magazine</hi> of Vertue,
that <hi>seat</hi> of Grandeur and Majesty, as
<hi>Cicero</hi> Styles it,<note place="margin">Roma Domus virtutis, imperii dignitatis, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilum <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </note> began to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with lofty <hi>Ideas,</hi>
which he all along displays in
the several places of his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
He began to polish himself in a
<hi>Court</hi> the most <hi>delicate</hi> that ever was:
where all that had a <hi>Genius</hi> for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had a most <hi>exquisite</hi> Palat for what
ever was fine and excellent. He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the <hi>Commanders</hi> that were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60801:35"/>
about the <hi>Emperour</hi> in Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
in the Marches, of Armies, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments,
Sieges, and all that belongs
to the <hi>art</hi> of War, which is best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by <hi>practise.</hi> He observ'd the <hi>humour</hi>
that prevail'd most in that <hi>Court,</hi> and
the Tast of the People, who were become
very Polite: He form'd himself upon all
this, discovering by degrees infinite
things, of which he had been altogether
ignorant, without this Correspondence.
The Familiarity he had with the
<hi>Twelve Tables,</hi> which were contain'd in
the <hi>Fasti</hi> of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> taught him the
<hi>Ancient Romans</hi> manner of Life. The
Succours he elsewhere hop'd to receive
through the <hi>Emperours</hi> Favour, as of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Memorials necessary for his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the hopes his Friends gave him
of their Assistance, Incourag'd him to
conquer the wearisomness, and surmount
the Uneasiness, which are the general
Attendants of such tedious, and almost
endless Undertakings.</p>
               <p>But as soon as he had made all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Preparations for his <hi>Work,</hi> and was
assur'd of such Succours, and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as he thought necessary for its
Execution, he bade Farewel to all the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60801:36"/>
World, that he might give himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
up to his Enterprize; having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in his Thoughts but the <hi>Work</hi> he
was about, to which he Sacrificed his
Fortune, his Pretensions, the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he might hope for from his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Favour, and his own Merit; his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
his Hopes, his Ease, his All. And
never <hi>Author</hi> had that Zeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
to accomplish what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>

               <p>THe Attempt of Comparing these
two <hi>Historians,</hi> as to their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and of drawing a just Parallel
betwixt them, is so Rash, and so much

the Publick in this Point, as to be

that Particular. And I must confess, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60801:36"/>
speak sincerely, it is rather a <hi>project</hi> of
a <hi>Comparison</hi> of the two Works than a
<hi>Comparison</hi> it self. But I hope this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
will suffice for my Design, which is
to give the <hi>learned</hi> leave to determine
of the Preferrence of these two <hi>Authors,</hi>
and their <hi>Works,</hi> by the Essay I shall
make thereof, which can pass but for a
very imperfect part of this Piece. Here
is the Abridgement of <hi>Thucydides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He begins his History with an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Notion he gives us of <hi>Greece</hi> in
general,<note place="margin">An Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>'s Hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> (from whom it deriv'd its
name) after the War of <hi>Minos;</hi> thence
he enters on his Matter, and so passes to
the <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Troy.</hi> This is to ascend <hi>too
high:</hi> and this <hi>beginning</hi> is not sutable,
and proportion'd to the <hi>body</hi> of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
which is only a particular War
betwixt <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had his Reasons wherewith to
justify it; and that <hi>exordium</hi> is a kind of
<hi>platform,</hi> to represent the <hi>state</hi> of his
Country, on which it was expedient for
him to insist, to make it understood; he
descends there, probably, to too many
Particulars, which give us reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he more Studied to satisfy the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60801:37"/>
he had for his Country, than
the <hi>tast</hi> of an indifferent Reader. He
gives there too much Reins to his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere:
For he might have reduc'd that
long Digression into narrower Bounds,
as not being altogether so necessary for
the understanding his History as he I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
it. But he had a Mind to ingage
his Readers, by giving them great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and to accustom them by little and
little to embrace his Opinions, and Sense,
by filling them with his Ideas. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
one shall be hard put to it to
forgive him that vast Excursion, where
he immediately falls upon the <hi>Trojan
War,</hi> as also, the Relation of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
of <hi>Greece</hi> since that time, the
different Adventures of the Country, the
several Expeditions by Sea, the Trading
of the City <hi>Corinth</hi> that grew so Rich
by Commerce.</p>
               <p>Hereupon indeed he enters upon a
Narrative of the Advantages of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Greece,</hi> who became so Potent by
Sea: whence he passes to the several
ways of building their <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Galleys</hi>
and gives an Account of the Use of them.
And that <hi>narration</hi> tends directly to his
Point; for these are the Preparatives of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60801:37"/>
the War he is to describe. But methinks
he has crouded too much Matter in his
first Book, out of a desire of prefixing
a too stately <hi>portal</hi> to his History. He has
not confin'd himself enough in assigning
the several Reasons of the breach of
Treaty, betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi>
to give a very exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Causes of that War he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to write. He has not always so
cleverly open'd the Particulars of that
Affair, as his Subject demanded. But he
has shewn himself Profoundly skill'd in
the different Interests of <hi>Greece:</hi> and
the general Notion the <hi>Historian</hi> gives
of the Forces of the Country, both by
Sea and Land; the Description he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
of the Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of those
of his own Age; the Abridgment he
makes of the <hi>Persian</hi> War, is an happy
Beginning for his History, in as much
as there is something great in those
Particulars.</p>
               <p>But the Subject of the second Book
becomes still more Material, by the <hi>List</hi>
of the <hi>Allies</hi> who engag'd in that War,
on both sides: For he reckons up almost
all the <hi>Common-wealths</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, which took contrary Parts,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60801:38"/>
they were dispos'd by their Interests,
and Relations to the two <hi>Republicks, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> of which they were
either <hi>Allies</hi> or <hi>Favourers.</hi> And the
<hi>Historian</hi> bestirs himself here exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by reason of the different Embassies
the several States deputed to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which put the whole Country
in Ferment and Commotion by their
Factions and Intrigues: and all this is
still made Greater by the Art he has of
Interessing in that War, which at the
bottom was but of small Moment, all
the Countries of <hi>Greece, Sicily,</hi> and part
of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Generals</hi> also of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Persia,</hi> who make all a grand Figure in
that Expedition; and ingaging as one
may say <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and all the
<hi>Elements</hi> in that Quarrel, to make it
more Considerable, through those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Circumstances, of Eclipses,
Earthquakes, Plagues, Famines, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities,
and other Prodigies, of which I
have already spoken: and which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
in his History to give a greater
Idea of his Subject. It must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
the Wit of the Historian is very
Apparent in that part: and that so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable</hi>
a War as that of two <hi>petty</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60801:38"/>
Nations could never have been of much
<hi>importance,</hi> but by means of that Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Retinue of Circumstances it came
attended with. And herein he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be sufficiently admir'd, whilst we
reflect upon the Art he had of support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little Subject by Treating it in a
Method great and noble.</p>
               <p>He continues his Second Book with
the Description of the Condition the
Town of <hi>Athens</hi> was in, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
made a Descent into the Country,
by <hi>Oenoe</hi> the first Frontier Garrison on
the Coast of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> as also of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
<hi>Archidamus</hi> made about <hi>Eleusine;</hi>
whence passing through <hi>Acarne,</hi> he came
and posted himself within two Leagues
of <hi>Athens:</hi> The Alarm being spread
abroad, <hi>Pericles,</hi> who at that time had
the Administration of Affairs, refus'd
to convene the People, least the Fright
they were in should put them upon
some Absurdity or Extravagance,
through too much weakness. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
next the several Enterprizes of
each People upon one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
escaping any memorable Action,
the rest of the Summer; as also the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Solemnities the following Winter,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60801:39"/>
paid to the Honour of those who were
slain in this first Campaign; and he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the Ceremonies thereof: wherein
<hi>Pericles</hi> who had advis'd the <hi>War,</hi> made
an <hi>Elogy</hi> upon those who had lost their
Lives in it. Probably never Man suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
more happily than he in infusing
Courage into the <hi>living,</hi> by celebrating
the memory of the <hi>dead,</hi> and setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes the Glory of <hi>dying</hi> for
their Country with their <hi>swords in hand,</hi>
especially for a Country so Glorious in
all things as was then the Common-wealth
of <hi>Athens.</hi> There is nothing in
that Discourse but is set off with all that
Dignity, which shines so Eminently in
this Historian. The Description of the
<hi>plague</hi> in all its particulars, which comes
after, stands rightly placed, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing
that Variety which is requisit
to make a History taking.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> crusht almost at the
same time with a <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Pestilence,</hi>
which laid their Country desolate, began
to murmur against <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cles,</hi> who hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
assembled them, in order to incourage
them, by justifying his management.
That <hi>Harangue,</hi> howsoever Forcible, by
those Masterly and Engaging Strokes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60801:39"/>
he gave it, had but little Effect upon
their Minds, who were sensible of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Misfortunes: he was
discarded presently, and as suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd.
The inconstancy of that People
over whom he had gain'd all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
his Merit and his Eloquence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
hastned his Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
not long after. The <hi>Encomium</hi>
the Historian makes upon that Great
Man, affords us a very fine Idea of his
Vertue: His loss was none of the least
Disgraces that fell on <hi>Athens</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Campaign. For there being no one
left behind of so Eminent a Quality to
fill up his place; his Successours as <hi>equal</hi>
perhaps in Merit, and <hi>rivals</hi> in Dignity,
wanting sufficient Power to <hi>rein</hi> up a
People with an <hi>absolute</hi> hand, were
Oblig'd for their interests to manage
them <hi>remisly,</hi> and to Sooth and Flatter
them into Obedience.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Pericles</hi> the posture
of Affairs was more untoward than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
<hi>Sicily</hi> began to be in Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to Arm for <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> the
Siege of <hi>Platea</hi> was form'd in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> the
Assault was Vigorous, and the Defence
as Resolute. That <hi>Siege</hi> describ'd at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60801:40"/>
length in the second Book, falls into a
Blockade: thence follows the Attempt
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> upon <hi>Chalcis,</hi> to give a
Diversion to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which
occasion'd them to enter <hi>Acarne,</hi> to make
themselves Masters of the Isles <hi>Zacyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
and <hi>Cephalenia,</hi> as also of <hi>Naupact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
in order to prevent the <hi>Athenians</hi>
Sailing about <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> But as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
and imbroil'd as Affairs were
through the heat which was diffus'd in
the minds of the People, and their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ingagements with each other, in the
end of the second Book, they are clear'd
off by the Historian with that Easiness
and Perspicuity, as renders that an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Piece: the Naval Battle of the
<hi>Athenians</hi> against the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactus,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> are describ'd in
such a retail of Circumstances as is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
taking with the Reader. The
Advantages they had over each other,
being reciprocal; there was an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
on the Enemies side to surprize the
<hi>Pirean</hi> Haven near <hi>Athens;</hi> which prov'd
unsuccessful for want of due Measures
in taking the Advantage of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

This Book, and the third Campaign,
conclude with the <hi>Thracian</hi> War in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</hi>
Never History compriz'd so
much Matter in so little Room, nor so
much Action in so few Words. If any
thing can be found fault with, 'tis that
the Exploits are too <hi>closely wound</hi> with
one another, so that the <hi>coherence</hi> seems
somewhat intricate and confus'd; and
that <hi>multiplying</hi> of Objects tends only to
<hi>dissipate</hi> the attention of the Reader.</p>
               <p>He begins the Third Book with the
Revolt of <hi>Lesbos</hi> from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and
the Attempt of the <hi>Athenians</hi> upon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylene,</hi>
which sent <hi>Embassadors</hi> to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi>
to demand supplies. That Oration
is so insinuating, and full of Artifice,
that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> could no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
it. <hi>Mitylene</hi> is receiv'd into the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> The Harangue of
<hi>Cleon</hi> upon the Affair of the Prisoners
of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> which some were for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Death at <hi>Athens,</hi> of which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he himself was; and that of <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
who was for having them Pardon'd,
are very strong and perswasive. <hi>Platea</hi>
being at last surrendred up to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
that Town sent to justify its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> There are to be seen
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60801:41"/>
in the Discourse of that Embassy fine and
curious Strokes of Eloquence; nothing
can be more moving, or founded on
more substantial Reasons, yet all to no
purpose: The <hi>Plateans</hi> fell a Sacrifice
to the Revenge of the <hi>Thebans:</hi> which
makes a notable incident in the History.
The Historian, taking the Hint from the
Troubles of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> makes a Digression
upon the Factions that grow in a State,
and the disorders that spring from them
which is a very good Lesson for <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

That which follows of the Affairs
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Warlike Exploits of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
in that Country, their Defeat
in <hi>Etolia;</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Attempt
upon <hi>Naupactus;</hi> the Purification of the
<hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Delos;</hi> and the Description of
that <hi>mysterious</hi> Ceremony perform'd by
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> is express'd in a Noble,
Great and Stately manner.</p>
               <p>The Author quits the War of <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus</hi>
in the Fourth and Fifth Book, to
enter upon the Affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which
occasion'd several Enterprizes upon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,
Boeotia, Thrace;</hi> the Battle of <hi>Delia,</hi>
the taking of <hi>Amphipolis, Thoronus;</hi> and
several Expeditions which are related
in one and the same strain. The Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60801:41"/>
of <hi>Sicily</hi> gave Birth to a Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
whereupon was form'd a Treaty of
Peace betwixt them, which lasted Seven
Years: the Historian is here Oblig'd to
make a kind of an <hi>Apology</hi> to justify the
Continuation of his History, pretending
that League was broken, and renew'd,
done and undone several times, that the
War was never interrupted, that the
Treaty was never put in Execution, by
reason of manifest Trespasses; the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
having never quitted <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
which their Articles oblig'd them
to do. To speak Truth, that Treaty
was never ratify'd by the Allies, which
gave rise to several other Leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and many other Affairs.
But all that Campaign was spent in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
of Peace, which were put an
end to, by the Battle of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> from
which was dated the Renovation of the
Alliance betwixt <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sixth Book is a large Digression
upon the Wars of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which begins
with a long Description of the Country,
and the Founding of <hi>Syracuse</hi> by <hi>Archias</hi>
the <hi>Corinthian.</hi> He shews a great deal of
Ancient and far-fetch'd Learning in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60801:42"/>
that Description, but it is not pleasant
and agreeable: it is too remote from
the main Subject, and falls not rightly
in, unless it be that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> thought
of coming to maintain the League
of <hi>Peloponnesus. Alcibiades</hi>'s Discourse
to perswade the <hi>Athenians</hi> to a War with
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and that of <hi>Nicias</hi> on the other
hand to disswade them, are Two of the
chiefest Master-pieces of Eloquence in
their kind. The Description of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Fleet, and all the Equipage of War,
in their Preparations against <hi>Syracuse,</hi>
is very handsome. <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s Oration
to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in his Banishment,
advising them to send a Reinforcement
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> that was attackt by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi>
is a piece of lofty, lively, strong
and generous Eloquence.</p>
               <p>The Defeat of the <hi>Athenians</hi> at <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,</hi>
and the Description of the Battle,
is the finest part of the Seventh Book;
nothing is better drawn, or more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
than the Picture the Historian
makes of it: 'tis handled throughout
with abundance of Art and Mastery.
The Destruction of the Power of the
People of <hi>Athens,</hi> on occasion of a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
with <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who had thrown
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60801:42"/>
himself into the hands of <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi>
Lieutenant-General of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
because he had interfer'd with the
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who receiv'd him in his
Banishment, is describ'd in this Book
particularly enough. He was sought to
in his Disgrace for an Accomodation,
which he disdain'd to hearken to, but
upon Condition the <hi>people</hi> should not be
consulted; only the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Persia,</hi> who were honourable <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
The Reluctance he shew'd in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himself to the inconstancy and
humours of the <hi>people,</hi> occasion'd the
Destruction of <hi>Democracy;</hi> which is
very well open'd and related.</p>
               <p>The Digression upon the change of
Government in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Samos,</hi> where
it was attempted to <hi>humble</hi> the too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
<hi>power</hi> of the People, has very little
relation to the principal Design of the
History, which is the War of <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
and this last Book is generally very
confus'd, and has nothing finisht;
which has given reason to some <hi>Criticks</hi>
to think <hi>Thucydides</hi> was not the Author.
This is the Abridgment of his History:
now for that of <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> that we may
make the Parallel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60801:43"/>
There is nothing that can give us a
better notion of the difference betwixt
these <hi>two Authors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy's</hi> History.</note> than the different
ways of Writing they have taken: For
<hi>Livy</hi> takes a course quite contrary to
that of <hi>Thucydides.</hi> The Entrance to his
History is great, suitable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Subject, but it is modest and
humble: it may be said too not to want
simplicity, though it is Pompous and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick.
With what admirable Discretion
does he introduce that ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Quae ante condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam urbem poeticis decora Fabulis ea nec affirmare nec ref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>llere in animo est. <hi>Hist. Rom.</hi> l. 1.</note>
which makes <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the
first Parent of <hi>Rome,</hi> of a
Divine descent. He Treats
it as a <hi>fable</hi> that he would
neither <hi>mantain,</hi> nor <hi>overthrow,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there is so much deference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to be paid to <hi>antiquity,</hi> as to give
<hi>her</hi> leave to mingle something <hi>divine</hi>
with <hi>humane</hi> Affairs, to recommend the
Originals of Cities and Empires, as more
august, and venerable to Mankind by
such a mixture. He hence descends to
something of a more solid Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to give us an Idea of his Work,
He begins it with an Elogy upon the
Vertue and Probity of the People whose
History he is Writing, yet still preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60801:43"/>
himself from being blinded with
self-love, and carried away with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
a Man naturally has for his
own Country. For he scruples not to
give you their ill Qualities as well as
their good, that is, the remissness as well
as severity of the <hi>Roman</hi> manners; but
without any prepossession of Interest
or Passion, and with all the Prudence in
the World. That beginning of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
where the Author fetches the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of <hi>Rome</hi> quite from the Destruction
of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the whole Pedigree of the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Alba,</hi> is in it self a little cumbred
and confus'd, both in the words and
things, and has a Style that has hardly
any thing Great in it. One may see the
Author avoided flashing at the first: The
things he speaks are great, but his way
of speaking is low and humble; and
there is much Artifice in that entrance,
which the Author debases on purpose to
shew that the Beginnings of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Grandeur were but small,<note place="margin">Debebatur fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis tantae origo iuris, maximique secundum deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum opes imperii Hist. <hi>Rom.</hi> l. 1.</note> and
the better to observe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of that State. He how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
fails not to relieve the <hi>destiny</hi> of that
Empire, from the nobleness of its Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
deducing it from the God <hi>Mars,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60801:44"/>
whom he makes the Father of <hi>Romulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The haughty and fiery Temper of
<hi>Romulus</hi> is finely drawn, but the Picture
of his Successour <hi>Numa,</hi> and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
makes that Founder of <hi>Rome</hi>
seem more haughty than he really is:
That opposition is very Advantagious
in those two Characters. The fierceness
of the first, however softned it seems by
the Religion of the second, is set off the
more by that kind of <hi>contrast,</hi> which is
pleasanter in <hi>History</hi> than in <hi>painting.</hi>
Those petty Battles under the first <hi>Kings,</hi>
and kinds of Apprenticeships, the <hi>Roman</hi>
People serv'd in War against their
Neighbours, are heightned by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the <hi>Historian,</hi> who can, when
he pleases, animate little things with an
Air of Grandeur. The Engagement of
the <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii,</hi> for the Decision
of the Fate of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alba,</hi> is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
that Beautifies all that part; for
'tis admirably related. The <hi>expulsion of
Kings,</hi> which is the greatest Event in
the two first Ages of <hi>Rome,</hi> is render'd
more remarkable by <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s Exploit,
who Stabb'd her self before her Husbands
face, for having been dishonour'd by
young <hi>Tarquin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the making that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60801:44"/>
Circumstance the most material in that
Revolution, recommends the Relation
more effectually to the Reader, interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Affection, by so surprizing an
Adventure. All the Consequences of
that Revolution become more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by a Foundation so Solid, and of so
great a Lustre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scaevola</hi>'s attempt is Painted in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book, with all the Colours, so great,
Heroick, and extraordinary a Design, is
capable of. The <hi>love</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> to
which that Design ow'd its Conception,
the contempt of Life upon which it was
form'd; the Proposition that <hi>Gallant
Gentleman</hi> offer'd the <hi>Senate</hi> in ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Terms, that so he might Merit their
Approbation, without incurring Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
that undauntedness of Action,
and Resolution of Soul, and Courage in
revenging on himself the miscarriage of
his Blow; all is of that Spirit and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
as is hardly to be parallel'd.
And 'tis impossible a description of a like
Enterprize should be supported with
more astonishing Circumstances, with
more disdainful Language, or greater
Sentiments. <hi>Porsenna</hi> King of <hi>Clusium,</hi>
who was besieging <hi>Rome,</hi> amaz'd at so
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60801:45"/>
prodigious an instance of Valour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Peace of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that
Peace was the product of so desperate an
Undertaking. But finally, that Probity
he attributes to a People grown Fierce
and Untractable by the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Arms; that <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>clemency</hi>
they exercis'd in the very <hi>pride</hi> and
heighth of their Victories; that <hi>love</hi> of
<hi>glory</hi> he ascribes to them; that noble
Pride from whence he draws their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Character: that greatness of Soul, &amp;
loftiness of Thoughts, the Dignity of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Name inspir'd them with; the
Ingenuity of the <hi>Senate</hi> in its Suffrage,
instanc'd in their taking Generals from
the Plough: That Spirit of Wariness,
Frugality, Innocence, and Equity so
much practis'd, and had in Honour in
the raw and unpolisht Beginnings of the
Common-wealth: The publick Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who Sacrificed his
Childen to the Safety of his Country:
The <hi>Poverty</hi> of <hi>Curius,</hi> who after he
had <hi>inrich'd</hi> the <hi>Republick</hi> with the Spoils
of the Enemy, had not wherewith to
Bury him: Moreover those grand Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
engrav'd in all Hearts, truly <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
never to brook Disgrace: The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60801:45"/>
Resolve of the <hi>Senate</hi> after the Defeat,
by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> never to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to a Proposal of Peace: those Idea's
of Equity, intimately impress'd on their
Minds: that great Sense of Honour, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
love of their Country, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
Their incomparable Knowledge
in the Art of War, the Severity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Laws of War in their utmost
Extent: that invincible Patience in
Dangers and Hardships; and all those
other Vertues wherewith the <hi>Author</hi>
has stor'd his <hi>History,</hi> in innumerable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
are the most usual Strokes he
gives for the compleating of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
This was the Spirit that reign'd
in the Common-wealth in those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Times, when the Power of the first
Consuls was balanc'd by the Institution
of <hi>Tribunes,</hi> to bear up the <hi>people</hi> against
the Encroachments of the <hi>Nobles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Second <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War,
and the Defeat of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the taking
of <hi>Numantia,</hi> the Conquests of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
and all <hi>Greece,</hi> we may observe other
sort of Manners, and a quite different
Spirit introduc'd in the Republick,
through that abundant Prosperity their
Arms brought in. Politeness, and love of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60801:46"/>
Gentile Arts, a delicacy of Palate, and
the Study of Learning began to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to give quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countenance, Mode, and Lustre to
the Government, which the Historian
has admirably laid open in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
The Second Part also that
remains of his History, or rather the
Two last <hi>Decades,</hi> are incomparably
better than the First. For as to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which contains the Succession of
Wars against the <hi>Samnites,</hi> against the
People of <hi>Etruria,</hi> and <hi>Lucania;</hi> against
the <hi>Gauls,</hi> against <hi>King Pyrrhus,</hi> against
the <hi>Tarentines;</hi> the first <hi>Punick</hi> War
made by <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> and that against
the rest of the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> we can
say nothing of, since all that Decade
is intirely lost.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> who were
the perfectest Models of that Politeness
which was, through the Study of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
set up at <hi>Rome,</hi> and who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Worthiest Gentlemen of the
<hi>Republick,</hi> compleated the Perfection of
that State, already so far advanc'd; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the love of <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> and
all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> to flourish in it;
and 'twas by their Example, and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60801:46"/>
Converse and Familiarity with the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
that they Civiliz'd themselves,
utterly banishing out of their Republick
that rude, surly and unmannerly Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
their constant dealing in Arms had
introduc'd. 'Twas then this Victorious
People began to Plume it self upon the
Notion their Prosperity and Success had
inspir'd them with, that they were born
to be <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the rest
of the World. And from thence it was
that the love of Liberty, and the thirst
of Glory, so much possest them: This
is the Image <hi>Livy</hi> gives us of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War, and during
the Third: these are the principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of their Character. For Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had not as yet debauch'd the Minds
of a People, Vertuous, upon so good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as the <hi>Romans</hi> were. There runs
through the whole Character of <hi>Scipio,</hi>
who was at the Head of Affairs, a Spirit
of Religion, which shews that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
alone was in greater Reputation at
<hi>Rome</hi> than ever; one need only see the
Air the Historian makes him speak in,
in his <hi>African</hi> Voyage; the Discourse
he makes in the Twenty-ninth Book in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60801:47"/>
his Departure from <hi>Sicily,</hi> abounds with
all the Sense of Piety, an honest Man
is capable of. <hi>Cato</hi> gives his Voice in

of Women in the Thirty-fourth

They said, in accounting for their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
they had amus'd that Prince
with the Proposals of a Treaty,
and the Hopes of a Peace; that they had
thereby prevented him from making
War-like Preparations, and took off his
Allies from making their necessary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives,
and putting themselves in
readiness. The <hi>young Senators</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

seem'd novel to those who had grown

no less than that they exercis'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their <hi>Friends.</hi> Insomuch that that
sort of Disguise, and Tricking, which
had a tendency to Treachery, were
ever held as Means not to be practised,
and Paths their Probity and Vertue
knew not how to tread in.</p>
               <p>Moreover nothing is more bright and
dazling, in this History, than the Idea
<hi>Livy</hi> gives us in the Fourth Decade, and
in the beginning of the Fifth, of the
Dignity, and Power of the Senate, which
was grown the absolute Master of the
Republick; all things stood to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves,
and submitted to its Orders. If
<hi>King Antiochus</hi> restores to <hi>Scipio</hi> his Son,
whom he had taken Prisoner, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
him for a Peace, <hi>Scipio</hi> answers
in Capacity of a <hi>private</hi> Person, and a
<hi>Father,</hi> that nothing in the World could
more Oblige him to it than the Present
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60801:48"/>
he had made him of his Son; but in
Quality of a <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>General</hi> of the
Troops of the <hi>Republick,</hi> he could no
ways grant the Peace he demanded, for
that lay only in the Breast of the <hi>Senate.</hi>
And after the Defeat of <hi>Perseus,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
grew so absolute, that all stoop'd
to its <hi>Authority,</hi> Consuls, Generals, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were obedient to it. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Syria, Ptolemy</hi>
King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Sister,
make it the <hi>Vmpire</hi> of their Quarrels.
King <hi>Massinissa</hi> sends his Two Sons to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to complement the <hi>Senate</hi> from
him, upon their Defeat of King <hi>Perseus.
Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> dispatches his
Son <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of the <hi>Senate:</hi> But how
must the <hi>Historian</hi> Treat
the <hi>People</hi> of that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,<note place="margin">Positis jam adversus omnes mortales certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus haud secus quam Deos consulere, &amp; parcere vos generi humano oportet <hi>Hist. Rom.</hi> lib. 37.</note>

                  <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>'s
Ambassadors, (who
came to beg Peace of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio)</hi>
implor'd, as if it had
been from the Gods themselves: <hi>If,</hi> say
these Ambassadors, <hi>out of a greatness of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60801:48"/>
Soul you have Pardon'd those Kings and
People you have Vanquisht, what ought
you not to do in that Victory which makes
you Masters of the World?</hi> And this was
it, that made this People, in their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
take upon them the glorious Title
of Deliverer of other Nations. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
nothing is so Great and Majestick
as the Image the Historian gives us of
the <hi>Republick</hi> in those happy Times.
There you may see King <hi>Perseus</hi> chain'd
to the Chariot of <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
the Glory of the Triumph. Next
is to be seen <hi>Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Illyricum,</hi>
with his Wife and Children Vanquisht
by the Pretor <hi>Anicius,</hi> and led Captive
along the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi> There are the
<hi>Ambassadors</hi> of <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi>
and of his Brother <hi>Eumenes,</hi> in Posture
and Quality of <hi>Supplicants</hi> before the
Senate of the <hi>people.</hi> Thus possibly never
Historian had so great a Subject, nor
supported the Grandeur of it better by
the Dignity of Expression, and loftiness
of Idea's. See then the end of what we
have remaining of <hi>Livy</hi>'s History. For
after follow the Successful and Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Times of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who subdued
<hi>Spain;</hi> of <hi>Pompey</hi> who subjected to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60801:49"/>
Republick <hi>Mitridates, Tigranes, Armenia,
Cicily,</hi> and the other Provinces of <hi>Asia;</hi>
and of <hi>Cesar</hi> who Triumph'd over the
<hi>Belgians,</hi> the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and most part of the
<hi>Northern</hi> People, as <hi>Pompey</hi> had over
those of <hi>Asia.</hi> This is then the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or rather the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
History, which it was necessary to
reduce into this Form, the better to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Nature of it; and thus this
History is Preferable to that of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi>
because it represents a mighty
Design carried on by regular Methods
to the top of its Perfection, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
grown up to be <hi>Mistress</hi> of the
<hi>Vniverse,</hi> from so small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Foundation: but now let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Imperfections and Beauties
of these two Histories: That which is
still behind, for the Accomplishment of
the Comparison.</p>

               <head type="sub">A Comparison of the Faults of
the Two Historians.</head>
               <p>'TIs a very bold Undertaking to
enquire into the Failures of so
accomplisht Authors as <hi>Thucydides</hi> and
<hi>Livy:</hi> For to find fault with those which
a Man sets up for Models and Exemplars,
is to destroy what he would estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and Undermine the Credit of that
he desires to Confirm. Besides that it
seems unmannerly to Criticise upon
these Two great Men, when Antiquity
recommends them to us as the Perfectest
and most Absolute of all others. But as
nothing is more Essential to Man than
to <hi>Err</hi> and slip sometimes; and those
who pretend to be most <hi>Infallible,</hi> have
their Faults; I Presume the Criticisms
I shall make upon these Two <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
will make not a little for their
Praise; and that the World will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
satisfy'd of their Excellence, when I
have examin'd their Faults, which
may serve to set off the greatness
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60801:50"/>
of their Merit. For 'tis not so much by
<hi>avoiding</hi> Faults, as by a <hi>direct tendency</hi> to
his Point, without any Deviation, that
an Author shews himself: he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in the directest Line, and wanders
out of his Way the least, as does <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi>
is the most accomplisht in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius
Halicarnassensis</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionys. Halicarn.</hi> ad Aelium Tuberon. Num. 3.</note>
Let us see what it
is wherein <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s History may be
reprehended.</p>
               <p>He is not so Fortunate in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Subject,<note place="margin">Thucydide'<hi>s Failings.</hi>
                  </note> as in his Invention,
which always bottoming upon a great
Fund of Reason, never fails him. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
confounds his Subject by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or else Suspending, or lastly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
his Narrations, which break off
the Course of the History, and dissipate
the Mind of the Reader, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Objects that present themselves.
For instance, in the Third Book he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
a Matter relating to the <hi>Mityleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and before he has finisht it, he skips
to an Expedition of the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi>
from that Expedition, which he leaves
Imperfect, he undertakes a Relation of
the Siege of <hi>Platea,</hi> which he abandons,
to return again to the <hi>Mitylenians.</hi> And
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60801:50"/>
upon their Account, he touches upon
something of a Sedition happening at
<hi>Corcyra,</hi> wherein the People divided
themselves, some siding with <hi>Athens,</hi>
and some taking the Part of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
Thence he passes to the business of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
and again pursues other Affairs
without concluding any. And the whole
Book is stuffed with such a multitude
of Matters, and so different from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that a Man is quite lost, and can
never be able to discover the natural
Thread of the Principal History. And
this is one kind of Fault in a Narration,
which should ever have Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
and be still endeavouring at the
Scope it Proposes; that so it may fix and
determine the Mind of the Reader to
the same Object, without offering any
thing to disengage him from it.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis pretended, he has not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
so cleverly as he might have
done, the Cause of the War he goes to
Write: <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</hi> is of
Opinion he has not given us the True
one, at least that he has mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the True one, (which
was the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Jealousy, of the
too great Power of the <hi>Athenians)</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60801:51"/>
Causes which are not True. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
he is somewhat Dark in that
Place. The occasion of that War is much
finer Explain'd in the Life of <hi>Pericles</hi> in
<hi>Plutarch;</hi> where that Author makes it
appear that is was <hi>Pericles</hi> who first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by the frequent
Embassies he advised them to Depute,
in order to perswade all. <hi>Greece</hi> to enter
into a Confederacy against the King of
<hi>Persia;</hi> which gave the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
Reason to suspect them: For thereby
<hi>Athens</hi> gave it self a considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
which it never had before, and by
that Distinction seem'd to take a kind
of Preheminence above all other People.</p>
               <p>That large Amplification upon the
different Characters of the People of
<hi>Greece</hi> in the Proem, their several Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which he drives up as high as
the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; the Luxury of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi>
which he is too curious in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing,
talking even of their Curling
their Hair: what he says of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and Frugality of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and
what he add<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> concerning one <hi>Amino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who first taught the
Art of Building Ships: and such other
Loose and Unconnected Matters he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60801:51"/>
Treats of as a Preface to his History, are
nothing to his Purpose in <hi>Dionysius Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnassensis</hi>'s
Opinion. He thinks he
might have let all that alone, and have
enter'd on his Subject without making
so great a Ramble from his Design: he
concludes likewise that his History has
for its Subject not only the War of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesus,</hi>
but all the Affairs of <hi>Greece;</hi>
for he brings in the Enterprizes of the
<hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Chalcis,</hi> the Breaking in of
the <hi>Thracians</hi> into <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book, the War of the <hi>Leontins</hi> and
the Concerns of <hi>Sicily</hi> in the Third
Book: and thus he seeks out Matters
that are Forreign, because his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is unable to furnish him with Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
enough out of its self; which is the
Reason there is so little Accord and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in his Work: There are two Wars,
one of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and the other of
<hi>Syracuse,</hi> without any Reference to, or
Connexion with one another.</p>
               <p>That Celebrated Funeral-Oration in
the Second Book, which he makes <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>
to speak, is neither Agreeable, nor
Proportion'd to the Occasions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that it concerns; and the <hi>Historian</hi>
himself confesses, that Affair had nothing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60801:52"/>
memorable in it, in Respect of that
which he Describes in the Fourth Book
under <hi>Demosthenes</hi> near <hi>Pylus;</hi> where
the <hi>Athenians</hi> were Routed both by Sea
and Land: and those who fell, Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
themselves much more than in the
former Defeat, in which only a few of
the <hi>Cavalry</hi> were slain; and all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the former Battle, have
nothing comparable to the other, which
he slightly passes over unregarded. But
that the Historian might add greater
Weight and Moment to his Discourse,
he puts it into the mouth of <hi>Pericles,</hi>
who indeed was <hi>alive</hi> at the first Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
but was <hi>dead</hi> at the Second; in
which a little Fault may be found with
the Sincerity of the Author so Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
elsewhere for his Integrity: He is
Upbraided too with his so long and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Harangues,</hi> and for having so little
Variety. It is true, the Number of them
is great; but since the Humour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
and <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was to have every
thing done by Haranguing, whilst the
People were in Power, he must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
Harangue them, since they
would have it so. After all, the <hi>Historian</hi>
knows how to abate that Heat of his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60801:52"/>
Eloquence, when he Divests himself of
the Orator, and puts on the Historian.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> dejected by their Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the wast the Plague had made
in their Country, having the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
a famous Embassy to demand a
Peace of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Dionysius
Halicarnassensis</hi> blames the <hi>Historian</hi> for
passing so considerable a Point so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
over; and reprehends him for
not so much as naming the <hi>Embassadors,</hi>
(which seem'd very Material in that
War, through so considerable an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their Characters;) nor make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mention of one Tittle of the
Embassy: He that at other times would
diligently Court every Occasion, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
<hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> Discoursing
by so frequent Deputations. It is certain
he is guilty of a little Negligence in so
notable an Opportunity, where he might
have made his Country speak so fine
Things, and have added more Renown
to his History, by the Talent he had of
Haranguing so excellently well.</p>
               <p>I Omit several other Places <hi>Dionysius
Halicarnassensis</hi> dislikes in this Author;
because he runs into an Excess, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
his Criticisms through a Spirit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60801:53"/>
of Animosity, against that Historian,
whose Reputation he endeavours to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
that he may with more Ease set up
<hi>Herodotus</hi> against him, who was his
Country-man, wherein his Proceedure
has a Tincture of Partiality; not but
that he had just Reason for it in many
Particulars, but he had not in all. He
is frequently too rigidly Censorious, so
that it is necessary sometimes to Correct
Spleen, at least not to be carried away
with it without Examination. These
following are the other Faults the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Learned find with <hi>Thucydides.</hi>
He leaves too much to his Readers <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi>
whether for want of Care to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himself clearly, or whether through
an earnestness to Express things nobly, he
does it in fewer Words; by which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
falls into such <hi>Obscurities</hi> as the
whole World can never reach his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because his Sense is as it were choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the multitude and force of his
Images, which he crouds into his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
But by that <hi>affected loftiness</hi> that
everywhere abounds in him, he without
Scruple over-bears all the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of Construction; which he seems very
little to Regard, provided he can express
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60801:53"/>
himself with more Grandeur. 'Tis also
through the self-same Principle, that the
<hi>figures</hi> he makes use of, are for the most
part <hi>violent;</hi> that the <hi>colours</hi> he Paints
things in, are too <hi>strong;</hi> that his <hi>strokes</hi>
are too <hi>deep;</hi> that he has a <hi>theatrical air</hi>
diffus'd through his Discourse, by means
of Expressions, that sound <hi>tragically,</hi> and
of a <hi>Character</hi> not much different from
that which <hi>Pindar</hi> took by his too closely
following <hi>Eschylus;</hi> that the Historians
which preceeded him, were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Expressing things plainly; that
he is too <hi>Figurative</hi> in his Speech; that
he affects an <hi>uncouth ancient</hi> way, in
Words worn out of use, or In-authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
that there is nothing of <hi>sweetness</hi>
in his Expression; that he can <hi>not</hi> Paint
a thing with any <hi>softness;</hi> that his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is Disagreable; that he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unacquainted with those Graces
and Charms his Predecessor <hi>Herodotus</hi> so
well understood; and that in fine, by
the natural Prosperity of his <hi>Genius,</hi> he
runs into a dryness of Style, which
renders his Discourse harsh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverisht.</p>
               <p>There are those who push their Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms
farther still; pretending he has
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60801:54"/>
not sufficient care to search into the
<hi>bottom</hi> of Things; that he is too <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial;</hi>
that he <hi>simply</hi> relates Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without giving us the <hi>Reasons</hi> of
them, or explaining the Motives that led
to them: they add, there is no <hi>turn</hi> in
his Periods, no <hi>harmony</hi> in the Cadence,
no <hi>agreeableness</hi> in the Words, no <hi>fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in his Discourse: that there is very
little <hi>variety</hi> in his Harangues; that
there are perpetual Embassies, wherein
are large Discourses, excellent indeed,
but <hi>too prolix,</hi> and too Studied: 'Tis
thought he took that Method from
<hi>Homer,</hi> who to make his Narration the
more lively, makes those, he introduces
in his Poem, talk everlastingly. The
Dialogue he makes between the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and the <hi>Melians,</hi> upon their different
Interests, in the Fourth Book of his
History, has something of the Nature
of a <hi>Dramatick Poem,</hi> where things are
Play'd by several Persons that are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd;
for which there is no Precedent
in any History, which ought to be
united, and continued in a Thread,
without Interruption: in short, this is
not suitable to <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s Character
of Simplicity. 'Tis suppos'd too, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60801:54"/>
he makes the <hi>Greeks</hi> have more Courage
than Strength: their Ability is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to their Pride; and one can
not always have an opinion of their
Merit great enough to support that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Arrogance he puts into their
Character. For their War-like Exploits
went no farther often, than the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
a Village, or over-turning the
side of a Wall: He is a little deficient
too, by giving petty Things more Stress
than they can well bear, and in not
giving the greater so much Weight as
they require.</p>
               <p>Besides that, the Distinction he makes
of the Campaigns, by the Seasons, is not
always neat enough; it is moreover te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
because he is oblig'd to use the
same Terms, and the same Transitions,
which cause a disag<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeableness in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
and by too Scrupulous and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
an Adherence to his Method,
he leaves his Matter unfinisht, and his
Narrations interrupted. Others carp at
I know not what abstruseness of Style,
that wants a little clearing. I pass by
that Digression in his Eighth Book,
upon the Change of the Government
in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Samos,</hi> when there was a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60801:55"/>
necessity of curbing the Power of the
People, who abus'd their Authority, and
carried things to an excess of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence to the State. The
Criticks have not, without good reason,
reflected on the too great Length of
that Digression, for the little Relation
it has to the principal Design. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Athens,</hi> who had Banisht him,
without declaring the reason why; and
how he broke with the Republick, and
was reconcil'd again; which is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the same Book, is methinks a
little defective. Something more had
been due to so considerable a Man:
many other of the like Faults are to be
met with in <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis,</hi>
whom it is but turning to, to find them.</p>
               <p>But for my own part, if I thought
the Failings that are laid to the Charge
of great Men, were to their Dishonour,
I could easily vindicate <hi>Thucydides</hi> in the
greatest part of those they object against
him. I could say he was possess'd with
so high a Notion of the <hi>sublime</hi> Style,
that he affected it in all Things;
that all besides seem'd inconsiderable,
even so far, as to trample on the most
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60801:55"/>
common Rules of Grammar, by the
change of Tenses, Numbers, Genders
and Persons; provided he could thereby
exalt his Expression, and add more heat
and vehemence to his Discourse: I could
mantain, that the little Connexion there
is in some of his Narrations, is more the
fault of his Subject, than his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For at the bottom, the War he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
has nothing in it of a continued
and premeditate Design: one shall not
see any Enterprize regularly form'd,
well contriv'd, and well executed: 'Tis
all tumultuously Transacted, according
to the different Movements or Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People ingag'd in the War;
and 'twere easy to make an Apology for
the Author, in his other Faults imputed
to him, if a Man would have the Patience
to Reflect, that he was only Careless in
some things, to add greater Perfection to
others, which he thought of more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For it was often on the account
of Elevating his Style, and writing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestically,
that he over-lookt some little

And they are <hi>Beny</hi> and

the most to carp at; since they judge
not of <hi>Livy</hi> by the general Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Work, which demands Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
He may be censur'd for that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
of his <hi>Style,</hi> but that Fault is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
pardon'd, if it be a fault, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that 'tis only that <hi>diffuseness</hi>
that makes him Stately and Majestick.
The dignity of his Design, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of his Thoughts required a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Style, and 'tis in that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60801:56"/>
Majesty principally consists.</p>
               <p>It must be own'd, he is sometimes
Obscure, as well as <hi>Thucydides;</hi> but
there is no necessity of absurdly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ones Head to understand him all;
for there are many Places in him which
are, in their own Nature, Difficult: As
the Explication of Ceremonies, Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes,
and Matters of Fact; of which
we have neither any Knowledge, nor
Idea. He affects too, the usuage of very
ancient Latin Words, which now are
Obsolete; and he has peculiar ways of
speaking, unknown to the other Authors,
&amp; only Proper to himself. Besides all this,
'tis probable he has been Corrupted in
many places, whether by those who
were the first Copyers, or by the ancient
Editions; whether by the Moderns, or
by the false Conjectures of unskilful
Criticks; who pretending to correct
him, where they have not understood
him, have quite spoil'd what they
would have mended; so that we are
far from having <hi>Livy</hi> such as he was at
first. <hi>Turnebius</hi> will have <hi>Sigonius</hi> to be
the only Man amongst the <hi>Criticks,</hi>
who has us'd him well, and set him
best to rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60801:57"/>
There are those who disapprove some
bold Expressions and Thoughts he has,
whereby he over-leaps the Bounds of
Modesty, to which he is a great Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I confess he sometimes ventures
such sort of Sallies, but always with the
greatest Prudence; for as much as he
knows how to make good use of them
in the moving part of his Discourse,
wherein nothing succeeds better than
that which is least contriv'd. That too
great Inclination of observing nicely,
whatever he found Monstrous in his way,
and attributing the Reasons of it to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Causes, as to the Anger of the
Gods, smells strongly of the Heathen,
somewhat too Superstitious. St. <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Great taxes him with this Fault, in
<hi>Causabon</hi>'s Preface to <hi>Polybius,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
he only intermixt these <hi>prodigies</hi>
in his History, to authorize his <hi>Religion;</hi>
which I fancy was less in his Thoughts
than the seeking Variety, to enliven the
dulness and melancholly of his Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
That <hi>Rustical air, Asinius Pollio</hi> finds
fault with in this Author, which has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
occasion for the Niceties and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions of the <hi>Criticks,</hi> is in my
Judgment only an ill Pronunciation that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60801:57"/>
sounded a little Country-like, and was
Offensive to the Courtiers accustom'd to
all the Delicacy of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Court: at
least it is the Sentiment of <hi>Quintilian,</hi>
who was too piercing a
Wit himself,<note place="margin">In <hi>Tito Livlo</hi> mirae facundiae viro putat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse Pollio quandam Patavinitatem: quare si sieri potest verba omnia &amp; vox hujus alumnum urbis oleant ut oratio Romana plane videatur non civitate donata. <hi>lib. 8. c.</hi> 1.</note> and too near
a Neighbour of those
Times to be ignorant of
the Mystery, which he
wholly imputes to the
Pronunciation.</p>
               <p>Others assure us he was not exact e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in furnishing himself with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
by diving to the bottome of
his Subject; that he only Wrote from
the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of the Conquerors, who
had undoubtedly suppress'd what made
for their Disadvantage; and that he has
not justly Distinguisht one from th'other.
They add, that if <hi>Livy</hi> had been at the
same Expence to Purchase the <hi>memorials</hi>
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as <hi>Thucydides</hi> to obtain those
of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he had not expatiated so
largely upon the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi>
People: he would doubtless have found
some particulars where to have done
more Justice to <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
than he did. For opposing <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Carthage,</hi> as two Cities <hi>Rivals</hi> in Glory,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60801:58"/>
it lay upon him to display the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
Riches and Power of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Government, and he had done more
Honour to his Country, by extolling the
Merit of those who disputed with it the
Empire of the World.</p>
               <p>Some men blame him for taking the
main Instructions of his first Decades
from the ancient <hi>Origins</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
are full of Forgeries, and scarce have
any thing else but Fabulous Traditions;
since the use of <hi>Annals</hi> what but of a late
Date in that <hi>Republick,</hi> as <hi>Sigonius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
Moreover <hi>Mascardi</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
on History, lays much Negligence
to the Charge of this Author, for not
having open'd the greatest Events in all
their Circumstances, especially such as
were principally necessary to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Importance of Affairs;
which are found elsewhere, as in <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and other less exact <hi>Historians.</hi> But
let us see the Faults of <hi>Livy</hi> more in
particular.</p>
               <p>He is obscure in some places of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
as for Example, in the line of
Descent of the <hi>Kings of Alba,</hi> which he has
not unravell'd plain enough. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
of <hi>Romulus,</hi> after his Death,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60801:58"/>
that <hi>Rome</hi> should become the <hi>Capitol</hi>
City of the World, and all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of that Apparition, seen by <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and which he related to the People,
has something so Enthusiastick in it, that
one is amaz'd an Author, of so solid a
Character, should suffer such a Story
to pass, without giving it a more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Turn; yet he relies upon it, and
gives it not out for a Tale or a Fable.
The Adventure of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> as wondrous
as it is, is not so admirably put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there is something wanting to its
Probability; a Man knows not upon
what Grounds she Kills her self. If she
has suffer'd Violence, why does she <hi>punish</hi>
her self since she could not <hi>resist</hi> it? Why
would she not <hi>dye</hi> before she was Ravisht?
Is it <hi>modesty</hi> or <hi>vanity,</hi> is it <hi>wisdom</hi> or <hi>despair,</hi>
is it <hi>love</hi> of <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> that makes
her Stab her self? All things rightly
consider'd, one knows not what it is. If
she could not open her Eyes at the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of her Condition, her Vertue is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too <hi>nice</hi> or too <hi>self-interess'd:</hi> in
short, that wants a little Neatness. And
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who examines that Action, in
all its Circumstances, in the Nineteenth
Chapter of his Book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60801:59"/>
has much ado to discover what his
Thoughts are of it. Is not that Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of <hi>Clelia</hi> too, a little Extravagant?
and considering the make of <hi>Tyber,</hi> was
it a thing Practicable: could a Maid, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Timorous, ever think of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so dangerous a Passage in a River
that had Brinks almost inaccessible. For
though <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</hi> agrees
with <hi>Livy,</hi> in the Description of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
<hi>Val. Maximus</hi> expounds it in a
manner that looks much more probable.</p>
               <p>'Tis pretended also, that the Historian
shews too much Partiality in the Ninth
Book of the first <hi>Decade,</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
he makes of <hi>Alexander</hi> with the
<hi>Romans</hi> in Point of Valour: He seems to
divest himself too much of the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of an <hi>Historian</hi> in that place, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
to play the <hi>Declamer;</hi> giving the
Preference to his <hi>Country-men</hi> before the
<hi>Conqueror of Darius,</hi> upon uncertain
Conjectures, and without examining the
Matter any farther than by extravagant
Suppositions, and a List of <hi>Consuls</hi> which
the Common-wealth of
<hi>Rome</hi> had set up in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him.<note place="margin">On Pompejum <hi>tantis laudibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit</hi> Livius, <hi>ut</hi> Pompejanum Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus <hi>appellaret.</hi> Tacit. An. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<hi>Livy</hi> with the same Fault, in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60801:59"/>
respect of <hi>Pompey,</hi> for whom he was too
Partial against <hi>Cesar;</hi> which <hi>Augustus</hi>
objected to him without taking it amiss:
On the contrary he commends him, for
that instead of <hi>flattering</hi> the Victorious
Party in the Civil-War, he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with himself to <hi>condemn</hi> those Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentlemen, who were ingag'd on
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s side.</p>
               <p>That Train of Affairs, of <hi>Philip</hi> King
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> spun out to such a length in
the Fortieth Book, the Intrigues of his
Family, the Adventures of <hi>Theoxena,</hi> a
Princess of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and her Children;
the Cruelty of the King; the Quarels
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Perses</hi> his Two Sons;
and all that Retinue of Circumstances
relating to that Monarch, seems of an
Extent disproportion'd to the principal
Subject of the History, which an exact
<hi>Historian</hi> should always keep in view:
And that long Digression has, methinks,
something Forreign in it to the business
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Story; for what is it to
the purpose of the War the <hi>Romans</hi> wage
with that <hi>Prince,</hi> that we must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
know all those Particularities? Was
it not enough to have related those that
concern'd the Controversy betwixt him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60801:60"/>
and the <hi>Republick;</hi> and the War the
<hi>Romans</hi> made upon him. <hi>Perses</hi>'s Speech
to his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> to justify himself,
that long Exaggeration of his Brother
<hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Crimes, together with his
Answer, is too Studied an Amplification,
and is a sort of Declamation that has a
relish of the Desk or Bar in it. One
might to this add, that the Historian
suffers his Eyes to be dazled with that
Triumphant and Victorious Air he gives
the People, whose History he writes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of the Wars of <hi>Asia;</hi>
where he represents, in two Arrogant
and Lordly a Style, Captive <hi>Kings</hi>
chain'd to the Chariot of the <hi>Conqueror,</hi>
and dragg'd with their Queens along
the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi> There is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Pride in those Strokes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he gives the Victors; wherein he
makes the People too vain, and is not
himself so Modest as he might be. It
is a <hi>false</hi> Clemency, or a <hi>real</hi> Vanity, to
treat <hi>Soveraign Princes</hi> so shamefully,
and to pardon their Subjects: Would it
not have been much better to have had
some Veneration for Crowned Heads?
Does not that Respect which is due to
Mankind, claim some consideration for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60801:60"/>
the Governours thereof? And that
Greatness of Soul, which is the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that Nicety in Glory,
upon which they Plum'd themselves,
would have been more conspicuous, by
their replacing the Crowns on the
Heads of those they had Vanquisht, than
by their ignominious Treatment of them,
and their contemptuous sporting on
their Grandeur. To conclude <hi>Livy</hi> with
that sound Sense he had so natural and
inbred, desiring to give us a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the <hi>Romans</hi> Vertue by their
Conquests, gives us as scurvy a one as
may be by their Triumphs; for as much
as he makes a People, when forgetting
it self, so far forgetful of its real Glory,
as to abandon it self, to all the Pride of
its Conquests, and the Extravagance of
its Vanity. It had at least been a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
part in him, to have seem'd to
dislike that sort of Management. There
are doubtless, other like Observations to
be made upon this <hi>Author,</hi> if a Man
would Cavil. Let this suffice, whereby
to Judge of the rest, since 'tis necessary
to fix Bounds to a Subject, that will not
bear too many Particulars.</p>

the narrowest Souls, that are the

more easy than to find fault, witness

                  </note> who could Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the most Absolute

Prerogative of the most exalted Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to know what is Praise-worthy, and
to praise it as it should be. I am very
sensible I am not one of that Order, nor
sufficiently Enlightned to discern, my
self, the greatest Beauties in these Two
Authors, or discover them to others:
But possibly by attempting these little
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60801:61"/>
Essays, I may be instrumental to others
to exercise themselves in greater; and by
opening the lesser Excellencies make
the Understanding sort of Men sensible
of the greatest. Here then is, in my
Mind, a part of that which is remarkably
fine in both One and the Other; for I
pretend not to give an account of all
that is so.</p>
               <p>It must be acknowledg'd in general,<note place="margin">The Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides.</hi>
                  </note>
that <hi>Thucydides</hi> had one of the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Genius</hi>'s that ever was, Relating
what he had a mind to, with all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Dignity imaginable. As he
was Eloquent before <hi>Aristotle</hi> had wrote
his Rules of Eloquence, he was Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of improving, with all manner of
Application and Study, that wonderful
Talent of Speech he had receiv'd from
Nature; and he made that Art of his,
whereing he excell'd, consist in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing that could any ways <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble</hi>
his Discourse, and giving all those
<hi>impresses,</hi> and <hi>turns</hi> to Reason, whereof
it was capable, in order to <hi>perswade;</hi>
laying upon it all the <hi>weight</hi> it would
sustain, to make the deeper <hi>impression</hi> on
the Mind; tending directly always to
the <hi>bottom</hi> of Affairs, without staying on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60801:62"/>
the <hi>surface;</hi> and by a Profoundness of
Reasoning, peculiar to him, reducing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing to the <hi>fountain-head</hi> from
whence it came. But though he bestows
nothing upon the <hi>ornaments</hi> of Style, or
the Charms of Elocution, yet he is sure
to <hi>please,</hi> because he is throughly <hi>sound</hi>
in his Discourse, altogether <hi>clear</hi> in his
Thoughts, and <hi>solid</hi> in all his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And there is nothing but what is
Natural in his Expression, and 'tis by
these ways he tends directly to the Soul.
'Tis also the frequent use of the <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme,</hi>
which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> learnt of him,
that in some measure, renders him live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
strong and powerful in his Discourse.
It is by this Art he domineers over the
Resolutions of those he speaks to, that
he seizes the Soul of his Readers, and
hurries it away with the same vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
as if it were an Heavenly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Motion: he carries away the Mind
with the Spirit, and <hi>force</hi> of such kind
of Reasoning, as give it not leisure to be
<hi>sensible</hi> of his Faults. 'Tis herein he
is so successful in engaging, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
he is carrying on, all that hear
him. That seriousness, gravity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of his Character, makes his Style
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60801:62"/>
noble, masculine, vigorous and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Sense; and that vehemence of
Expression, which sets him so far above
other Authors, proceeds only from the
Greatness of his <hi>Genius.</hi> For it is not so
much the glittering of his Words, as the
solidity of Sense, and the nobleness of
his Thoughts, and the propriety of
Terms, that gives weight to his Speech.
All this is compleated with the utmost
heighth of so clear and sober Reason, so
exact a Judgment, and so noble a Style,
that nothing seems more capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a true relish of what is Excellent,
than an Acquaintance with this <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, he is ever so full of his Subject,
through his profound Contemplation
of it, that he leaves nothing for his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to desire, by the way he has of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiating</hi>
things. 'Tis meerly by this
Art his Narration is so delightful, in
that he omits no one Particularity, that
might be serviceable to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Business he is about. Thus he so
strongly ingages the Mind, by the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
images of things, that he Paints the
<hi>ghastlyness</hi> or <hi>beauty</hi> of those dismal or
agreeable Objects he represents, and 'tis
by this Art of <hi>representing</hi> to your <hi>eyes</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60801:63"/>
the things he speaks of, he inforces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Reader the same Impressions
those feel who have been Actors, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Spectators or Witnesses of the things
related.</p>
               <p>I say no more of those admirable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
than I have said already, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Historian so Personates every
Man as to make him speak in his proper
Character; having compos'd them by
<hi>Pericles</hi>'s Model, who could Charm the
People of <hi>Athens</hi> even in Declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and opposing their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For <hi>Thucydides</hi> had often heard that
<hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Greece, upon whose Lips dwelt
the Charms of Eloquence,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> says.
Upon this Model he form'd
himself,<note place="margin">Cujus in labris leporem habitasse dixerunt comici. <hi>Cic.</hi> l. 3. de <hi>Orat.</hi>
                  </note> and by proposing
so great an Example, carried
the Art of Speech to its highest Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Orations that he made. It is
certain that Author gave a prodigious
Lustre to his History by those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
It must likewise be acknowleg'd
those so Studied and exact Discourses,
had quite another Beauty when Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and spoken in the heat of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Business. To all this we may
add those most solid Principles and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60801:63"/>
Reason and sound Sense; those
most establisht Maxims of Morality and
Politicks, and that general <hi>decorum</hi> which
runs through all he says, by pursuing
particular Circumstances up to univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Idea's; and giving Energy to his
Reasons, by tracing them to their first
Principles, and Sources from which they
were deriv'd, which is the thing that
gives that substantial Form and Solidity
to his Discourse: These are the main
Beauties of that Author in general; let
us observe now his Excellencies in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>The Harangue of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
only by obtaining a Magisterial
Authority over his Auditors, speaking
ever in an imperial Strain, and as one may
say, with <hi>Thunder</hi> in his <hi>hand;</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
him to be styl'd <hi>Olympian Jove:</hi>
that admirable Discourse that Great Man
makes in the First Book of his History,
in counselling the <hi>Athenians</hi> to a War, is
of a noble Spirit, and abounds with lofty
Thoughts. For instance, when he says
to encourage them to take up Arms,
<hi>Let us not be concern'd at the loss of our
Lands, or Country-seats; but our Liberty
is that which ought nearly to concern us:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60801:64"/>
We are not made for our Estates, but our
Estates for us: I am more afraid of our own
Vices, than all the Advantages of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
great Glory and a mighty Name is
only to be purchas'd by great and dangerous
Vndertakings:</hi> all the rest of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is of an equal Force and Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what Wisdom, what Dignity is
there is that of</hi> Archidamus <hi>King of</hi>
Sparta, <hi>disswading the</hi> Lacedemonians
<hi>from War in the same Book.</hi> Let us not
suffer our selves, <hi>says he,</hi> to be blinded by
those Mens Flatteries, who only Praise
that they may Destroy us: Let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our Modesty, which is the Source
of our Valour: We are the only <hi>Greeks</hi>
whom Prosperity has not as yet puffed up
with Vanity.</p>
               <p>What is there Comparable to those
Beauties we find in the Funeral Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick
in the Second Book, upon those
who lost their Lives the first Campaign
of that War; especially where he speaks
of the Manners that prevail'd in <hi>Athens,</hi>
and of the <hi>government? Our</hi> Government
says he, <hi>is</hi> popular, <hi>because the end we
propose is the</hi> happiness <hi>of the</hi> Republick,
<hi>not the making of some few</hi> particular
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60801:64"/>
                  <hi>Persons; and Honour is the Reward of
Merit, not the Priviledge of Birth. We
love</hi> Politeness <hi>without being fond of</hi>
Luxury; <hi>we apply our selves to the Study
of Philosophy, without giving up our
selves to</hi> Effeminacy <hi>and Laziness, the
ordinary Companions of that Study:
We take the estimate of Riches from
their Vses, and not from their Pomp;
and we think it no shame to be Poor, but
not to do what is necessary to avoid Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
this is Disgrace.</hi> The Interests of
each People are examin'd in that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where <hi>Pericles</hi> gives his Sentence
for the War, with all the Sagacity, the
most subtle and curious Politicks are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. That is a Place worthy of their
Study who have the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs:
Nothing can be better explain'd.</p>
               <p>That terrible Pestilence, describ'd in
the Third Book is so particularly Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstanc'd,
is so elaborate and exact,
that <hi>Lucretius</hi> has almost intirely
Translated it into his Poem;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lucret.</hi> lib. 6. versus finem.</note>
and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the <hi>Phalerian,</hi> has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it as one of the Chiefest Works
of Art, though <hi>Lucian</hi> finds fault with
it in his Treatise of <hi>History:</hi> because
that Description falls into too great a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60801:65"/>
Retail of Circumstances. The Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Livy</hi> gives us in his Seventh Book
of a Plague that happen'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> like
that at <hi>Athens,</hi> is more succinct, and has
a Style more serious. The Discourse of
the Inhabitants of <hi>Platea,</hi> who in the
same Book justify their Conduct to the
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> after they had Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to the Enemy, is a piece of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
that <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the declar'd Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> could not chuse but
admire: There is a justness of Sense,
and a force of Eloquence that penetrates
the Soul, and causes a kind of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mingled with Surprize. 'Tis in
these Discourses the Models for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Perswasion are to be sought, as
being such masterly Strokes of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as are no where else to be found.</p>
               <p>The Sea-fight, in the Port of <hi>Syracuse,</hi>
describ'd in the Seventh Book, so highly
valued by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is express'd so much
to the Life, and the Motions of the Two
Fleets of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> are so clearly
distinguisht by their different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> himself calls that
Description, a lively Image of the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul; 'tis all drawn in so live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sensible a manner: Nothing can
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60801:65"/>
be touch'd with a finer Hand, or be more
absolute than that Piece; which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
the Excellence of the Art, and the
Greatness of the Master. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in the Sixth Book, an Oration of
<hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to perswade the <hi>Athenians;</hi> to
resolve upon a War with <hi>Sicily;</hi> which
is remarkable for those Draughts of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Politicks it is stor'd with:
As for instance, when he introduces that
great Man, saying, That <hi>Turbulent Spirits,
such as were the Athenians, made greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Commotions than they could of
Settlement:</hi> and <hi>that it was more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to stick to the Ancient Maxims, though
possibly not so Good, than to change them for
those that are better; because Nature,</hi> says
he, <hi>is a Principle of an higher extract
than Reason; this being but the common
Operation of Man's Soul, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the Decree of God Almighty.</hi>
There is a profound Wisdome, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sense in that Reflection. 'Tis
much the same Reasoning that he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to <hi>Cleon,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> upon
the Case of the Prisoners of <hi>Mitylene;</hi>
saying, <hi>That ill Laws, well observ'd, were
better than good Laws that were despis'd or
neglected:</hi> and <hi>that a well-meaning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60801:66"/>
Ignorance, was preferable to disorderly
and inconstant Knowledge:</hi> For nothing
is more dangerous in a State, than
change of Conduct.</p>
               <p>Again, what is there more wise or
rational, than the <hi>Dialogue</hi> of the
<hi>Melians</hi> with the <hi>Athenians</hi> Deputies, in
the Fourth Book. The <hi>Melians</hi> talk in
a submissive way, which is however no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ingenuous; they preserve well
the Character which became the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,
without loosing that of Worthy
Men, who knew how to imploy their <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
well,</hi> when their <hi>sword</hi> hed fail'd them.
But the <hi>Athenians</hi> Lord it in too insolent
a manner. The <hi>Historian</hi> gives them too
<hi>contemptuous</hi> a Carriage, not very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Persons charg'd with a Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
It must be confest, nevertheless,
that nothing is more sensible or solid
than that Entercourse. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
wherewith the Ambassadors of
<hi>Platea</hi> urge the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in the
Third Book, of which I have already
spoken, is very noble. <hi>If you measure,</hi> say
they, <hi>Justice by your Interests, you will give
us reason to believe your Interests are dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to you than your Glory.</hi> All the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Historian imploys in that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60801:66"/>
are like the Flashings and Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Thunder and Lightning, as his
most severe Censurer <hi>Dion. Halicarnassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
acknowledges; 'tis all Divine, even
in his Opinion. But if a Man would set
down all the Excellencies he shall find in
this Authors Orations, he must intirely
Transcribe them, as did <hi>Demosthenes.</hi>
What can be imagin'd more pressing,
than that which he makes his <hi>Hero</hi> of
Eloquence, <hi>Pericles</hi> to speak; when he
endeavours to perswade the <hi>Athenians</hi>
to the War in the First Book. <hi>If it were
possible</hi> (says he to them) <hi>you should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by the labour and hazard there is
in Conquering; I would advise you to bid
farewel to Glory; For 'tis only by Pains
and Hardships, ye can become worthy of that
Honour.</hi> The Argument is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in all its Force and Dignity.</p>
               <p>Finally, those Grand Principles of
Honour, Equity, Honesty and Glory, to
which he knows how to give their due
inforcement, are the most usual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
he imprints upon his Discourse.
'Tis herein he makes use of the purest
Reason, not laying more weight on it
than it will bear, as the <hi>Sophists</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to do, nor desiring through a <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:60801:67"/>
Eloquence to carry it beyond its
<hi>natural</hi> bounds. 'Tis in these <hi>Harangues</hi>
that all things shine and glitter, with
the Lustre of a noble strong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Eloquence, which he had form'd
from the lively Sense he had of Things,
and a thorough Understanding of the
Subjects that he Treated on. Let us then
Pardon him those Discourses, for which
we see some Criticks have Censur'd him,
since they are fraught with so many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
For, besides that the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
as I have observ'd before, were Devoted
to that Haranguing Humour, and their
<hi>Republican</hi> Spirit Authoriz'd that way:
This Great Man was very sensible of his
own Qualifications, for making States
and Common-wealths discourse; by
which means he makes his History, of so
little and inconsiderable a Subject, to be
of so important Consideration: And
here he delivers those grand Maxims of
Morality and Policy, he understood so
well. And though <hi>Cicero</hi> is of Opinion,
that the <hi>Rhetorick of the Bar,</hi> through its
too great Loftiness, is improper for <hi>civil</hi>
Affairs; I maintain that for Reasoning, in
the great Affairs of Treaties, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
of Peace and War, and in all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60801:67"/>
weighty &amp; important Interests, Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by States, <hi>Thucydides</hi> is the greatest
Master that can be Consulted; and 'tis
impossible to find, elsewhere, Reason bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wrought, by all the wisest Maxims
of Government, than in <hi>Thucydides.</hi> And
all things well consider'd, there is not
to be found, in other Works, that Force
of Eloquence that appears in his.</p>
               <p>What Wit,<note place="margin">The Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  </note> what Understanding, what
Views must not a Man have, to discover
the Excellencies of a Work, conceiv'd
in the very purest Reign of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Eloquence; and to distinguish those
Beauties, that so highly transcend the
common Rules as <hi>Livy</hi>'s do: He had an
Elevation of Soul, that gave him a noble
Conception of things; and it proceeded
more from the Nobleness of his
Thoughts, than that of his Language,
that he was so Happy in his Expression.
He was intimately acquainted with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and all her Movements; of which
he gave us such lively Draughts, that
there is ever a surprizing Sprightliness
of Soul in his Discourse: And as he had
contriv'd a <hi>sublime</hi> Style, by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Expression, which he diffuses
through his Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' he manages it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60801:68"/>
with all that Prudence, which was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to him, so he has plac'd all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
he Represents, in the finest Light
imaginable. His Discourse is clear, ever
tending to its Purpose, without making
those Starts and Excursions other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are so Subject to. His Logick is
exact, his Diction pure, his Narration
full of variety: His Order looks so Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
as if the most curious Images of
things, so Postur'd themselves in his Mind,
as to fall each in its proper Place, to
make an absolute Picture, both in all he
thinks, and all he says. He disposes of
those Images, which he unfolds in
his Narration, by a great Diversity of
Ideas; and 'tis by the Disposal and Order
of them he is so Engaging: And as he
speaks more to the Understanding, than
the Eye or Ear, so he ever tends more
directly to the Soul.</p>
               <p>The Ornaments, which he mixes
with his Discourse, and those Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
he bestows upon it, are so well
Husbanded, as to appear only in those
Places that demand them, and can bear
them well; wherein he shews himself
Liberal without Profuseness. As for the
rest, 'tis generally the Plenty of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60801:68"/>
that makes him so Copious in his
Style; the native Richness of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
causes that Luxuriance in his Speech:
And his Narration becomes taking, by
means of its Diffuseness, growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
better Circumstantiated, and more
Probable. For nothing is more effectual,
to render a thing Credible, than the
Knowledge of the Particularities how
'twas Acted: Besides, a Man gives a
steadier View of the Objects represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by standing a little upon the Turn
of a Narration, without precipitating,
or exhibiting things in a transient
Glance. To all which may be added, the
admirable Discretion he has, to dissever
and separate the Sentiments of Men,
&amp; to make them speak and act according
to the <hi>Decorum,</hi> of their several Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in which Nature has instated them.
I am dazled with that Lustre which
reflects from his Discourse, by the
Choice, the Harmony, and Elegance of
the Words he uses, and those softer
Passions, that abound in his History, of
which <hi>Quintilian</hi> speaks so
favourably:<note place="margin">Affectus quidem praecipue eos qui sunt dulciores nemo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendavit magis. <hi>Quint.</hi> l. 10. c. 1.</note> those moving
and delicate Affections,
which he treats with all the Art and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60801:69"/>
Nature imaginable, perfectly Enchant
me, by those wonderful Commotions
they raise in my Soul.</p>
               <p>Perhaps never Man came furnisht
with better Parts, or those more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
to the Writing of a History, than
he: For he was form'd in a <hi>City,</hi> at
that time, the <hi>Empress</hi> of the World;
in which all the most important Affairs
of the Universe were Decided: and in
the politest Reign that ever was, having
had scarce any other <hi>school</hi> than the
Court of <hi>Augustus.</hi> There it was he
learnt the Language of the Genteelest
part of Mankind, and that lively, fine,
subtle and natural Air, then in Fashion;
that exquisite Tast, that purity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Expression, which was the
Character of that Age; and of which
there were so great Models in all sorts of
Writing, perfecting and polishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon them. Thence it was he took
that Softness, necessary to please, and
that Force which renders him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
wherein peculiarly consists his
essential Character: For never Man uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Grace and Beauty, with all
the Vehemence of Discourse, so much
as he; so much does the sweetness of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60801:69"/>
Beauty Temper the Masculine Force
and Energy of what he says: that
there falls not any thing from his Pen
too strong, but is softned with a Term
more nice and delicate. He prepares
whatever is Bold, and heightens what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is Low, with the Brightness of his
Speech: These then are part of his
Beauties in general; let us now see those
he has in particular.</p>
               <p>He immediately procures a great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and much Inquisitiveness, by
that great Idea he gives his Subject, at
the Entrance to his Work, when he says,
the Destiny of a City, design'd for the
<hi>Empire</hi> of the World, ought to have
something of Divinity in its Original;
and when he gives so great an Opinion,
of the Vertue of the People, whose Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
he undertakes.</p>
               <p>In the First Book, wherein Events
are little, and proportion'd to the
strength of a State in its Infancy, nothing
is better related than the Battle of the
<hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii;</hi> the Adventure is
Great and Extraordinary. Two little
States, which make War, and Dispute for
Soveraignty, give up their Interests and
Destinies into the Hands of Two Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60801:70"/>
to decide them. What Colours,
what Expressions does not the Historian
imploy in that Combate, where he Paints
with all his Art, the Fears, the Hopes,
and the rest of the Passions of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who were concern'd in that Affair,
where the Dispute in hand was, who
should be Masters or Subjects of each
other. Is there any thing to be seen
more strongly Painted, or better Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented?
Does not a Man <hi>feel</hi> what the
<hi>Historian</hi> says, and take in the very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
he inspires, by the Impressions
his Narration makes upon the Soul?
The Adventure of <hi>Lucretia</hi> is finely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
in the same Book, for as much
as it renders the Revolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which it occasion'd, more
Remarkable. The Banishment of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
and his Family; the Revolt of
the People against the King, whose very
Name was abhorr'd; which is one of
the greatest Adventures in the History,
and all that grand Enterprize, is made
much more considerable and surprizing,
by so illustrious and vertuous a Motive.</p>
               <p>This dethron'd <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who so Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
implores the Assistance of his
Neighbours to Re-establish him; that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60801:70"/>
Image of the growing Liberty, of the
novel State, after the slavery it had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd
from; that Pleasure in the mighty
Hopes of a lasting Settlement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they flatter'd the Desires of the
People; that ease and quiet they sensibly
enjoy'd: Those Proceedings <hi>Brutus</hi> put
them upon,<note place="margin">Plebs soluta Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio metu, agitari coepta Tribunitiis procellis. <hi>Hist. Rom. lib.</hi> 2.</note> to make them
still more sensible, they had
the <hi>Power</hi> in their own
Hands, as desirous of <hi>Ruling</hi> as he was
himself: The several Accessions of the
love of that Liberty, that ripened daily
through the Pleasure they began to take
in Dominion: and which still increased
by the Disturbances of those tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Assemblies held under the <hi>Tribunes:</hi>
those popular Commotions caus'd by
the Excess of Power they had left them,
which it was necessary to repress by the
Creation of <hi>Decemviri,</hi> accustoming them
insensibly to use no other Authority but
that of Laws. Those petty Wars they
wag'd against their Neighbours; their
Successes proportion'd to their Valour
and their Strength; and those <hi>Essays</hi>
wherewith Fortune delighted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
that growing <hi>Republick,</hi> to exalt it
to the <hi>heighth</hi> of Glory, which it arriv'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60801:71"/>
to: All these, I say, Painted in those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
the Historian knew how to order
so admirably well, are the greatest Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the first Decade; the Events
whereof are mostly contain'd in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and amongst the Neighbouring People,
without going out of <hi>Italy:</hi> And though
all is mean and little in the Beginning,
according to the Nature or Fate of
Things of no long Date; yet the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
sails not to Elevate his Subject, by
the Greatness of his Expression, and to
inspire several Persons, he introduces,
with noble Thoughts, as <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Manlius,</hi> who Sacrifice their Lives to
the Security and Glory of their Country.
There are divers Occurrencies, in the
Third Book, set in a fine Light: As the
Transport of young <hi>Appius,</hi> who so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
carry'd off <hi>Virginius</hi>'s Daughter,
and that had like to have destroy'd
<hi>Rome;</hi> and such Indignation the People
conceiv'd at so Brutal an Action: The
Havock of that horrible Attempt, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in a very passionate Air. The
Adventure of the Old Senator <hi>Quintius
Cincinnatus;</hi> taken from the Plough, to
be made <hi>Dictator;</hi> and the Diligence
of his Wife, to make him Neat and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60801:71"/>
Cleanly, and look something like a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi>
and all the Circumstances of that
Adventure, are very Naturally Painted.
The Historian, who makes <hi>Camillus</hi> take
up Arms against the Common-wealth,
and to do himself Justice on a People
jealous of his Power, but insensible of
the Merit of Brave and Couragious
Men, makes him speak with all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
a noble <hi>Roman</hi> was capable of,
when fir'd with Glory. <hi>'Tis Rome</hi> (says
he) <hi>that calls me back, not to re-instate me
in my Place, but that I may re-establish
her in hers:</hi> Which he did by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of the <hi>Vientes,</hi> and the taking <hi>Veii</hi>
after Ten Years War. The Encomium,
the Historian bestows upon that Great
Man, in the Seventh Book, is full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Sense; and there is somewhat
very singular and rare in the Praises he
gives him. The Magnanimity of young
<hi>Curtius,</hi> who all in Armour, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
head-long, into a vast Chasm of the
Earth, which happen'd in the City, to
close it up, and Appease the Gods by
such a Sacrifice, is an extraordinary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
in the same Book. In fine, we
see in the First Part of this History, a
rising Neatness, that makes large Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60801:72"/>
to its Perfection, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing unlike it self. And that
One thing, well laid open, is of a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Excellence.</p>
               <p>The Second Decade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the
constant Succession of that growing
Glory, and of all its Progress, is intirely
lost: which contain'd the Wars against
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> who broke into
<hi>Italy</hi> to Succour the <hi>Tarentines;</hi> and all
that happen'd in those Wars, concerning
the Valour and Probity of the <hi>Romans:</hi>
Amongst which was that high Principle
of Honour, which appear'd in <hi>Fabricius,</hi>
who Heading the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Consul,</hi> sent back to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
that made an Offer to the <hi>Romans</hi>
of Poisoning his Prince, who had ingag'd
them in a bloody War, and was become
their most terrible Enemy. Here was
the first <hi>Punick-War,</hi> wherein <hi>Attilius
Regulus</hi> so highly Signaliz'd his Vertue,
when having been made Prisoner by the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he was dispatch'd to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to treat of the Exchange of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
of both Parties; and who out of
an heroick, dis-interess'd Principle, was
the First that Advis'd them not to do
it, because that Exchange must needs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60801:72"/>
be Disadvantagious to the Common-wealth,
though he himself might have
enjoy'd his Life and Liberty as the
Fruits of it. These are the principal
Subjects of the Second Decade, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Freinshemius</hi>'s Supplement, who
hits his Character exactly, and succeeds
much better in making up the Loss of
<hi>Livy,</hi> than he has done in the Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the History of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, Wrote by <hi>Quintus Curtius;</hi> as
may be seen, if any one will give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the trouble to Compare them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Livy</hi>'s History takes another sort
of Flight, in the Third Decade, which
is come to us intire; with the Fourth,
and half of the Fifth. The Scene grows
more lively and animated, and more
astonishing, through those mightier
Movements, and more important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures:
For now comes the second
<hi>Punick-War,</hi> and that Famous Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Marching from his
Country at the Head of an Hundred
Thousand Men; to make an Assault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Romans,</hi> ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at <hi>Rome</hi> it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing in other Histories
comparable to the Portraicture this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
makes of the March of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60801:73"/>
'Tis all of a Force and Expression
above the common level: 'Tis the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Scene of the whole History, and the
Consequences perfectly answer the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
where the Historian, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Pictur'd <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him more Terrible, through his
Vertues than his Vices, as taken up as
he is with that mighty Object, he falls
upon his Matter, that he may express
the Particulars, and loose nothing at all
of it; every step he makes him take, in
despight of Danger, as he passes the
<hi>Alps,</hi> is terrible: All the Circumstances
are dismal and ghastly, and the Picture
of Danger is imprinted almost in every
Word, and every Syllable. Thence he
soars in the Expansion that his Subject
gives him, which is so spacious, so copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as to give him Scope for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Books, and all the Third Decade:
For <hi>Hannibal</hi> is the Leading Subject of
it all. The most notorious Adventures
of that War, are the Battle fought upon
the Banks of the <hi>Trasymenian</hi> Lake in
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> wherein there were above Fifty
Thousand <hi>Romans</hi> kill'd upon the spot,
and the rest of the Army taken or rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The Battle of <hi>Cannae</hi> far more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60801:73"/>
Bloody than the former, in which were
above Forty-five Thousand slain. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Nature is describ'd in so mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Strain; the Terrour and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>Hannibal</hi> casts in the Face of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by those bloody Victories, are express'd
in such a way, as never any other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could reach. There are such
Draughts, and such Colours, as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all Historians besides. The
Consequences of those Two Battles
were still more Terrible, a general <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation</hi>
run through the Heart of <hi>Italy;</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> were Deserted by all their
<hi>Allies;</hi> the People was Allarm'd, and
the whole Body of that great Republick,
till that time Victorious, was in a violent
Commotion, except the Nobility and
Chief Men, whom <hi>Scipio</hi> caus'd to Swear
with a Dagger at their Throat, that
neither any of them, nor the remaining
Officers, should abandon the <hi>Republick</hi>
in that present Conjuncture: and there
was that Fierceness at <hi>Rome,</hi> after that
last Defeat, that it was not lawful to
make mention of a Peace
with <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nulla timoris sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatio, nulla men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, pacis. <hi>Off. l.</hi> 3.</note> Their
Minds were shaken, but not dejected;
and 'twas the Resolution of the Great
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60801:74"/>
Men which inspirited the People, and
re-establisht Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Wars of <hi>Sicily</hi> against <hi>Hieron</hi>
and his Sons, that of <hi>Numidia</hi> against
<hi>Syphax,</hi> were the Consequents of the
Second <hi>Punick-War.</hi> But in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-sixth
Book the Historian describes the
new impressions of Fear, <hi>Hannibal</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in <hi>Rome,</hi> when he pitch'd his Camp
before the City, and advanc'd as far as
the <hi>Porta Collina</hi> near the Temple of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> whence he took a Turn upon
the Walls, to take the Model of it.
But the Conqueror of <hi>Rome</hi> Retreated
on his own accord, and he whom the
Vertue of his <hi>Enemies</hi> could not Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish,
was subdued by his own <hi>Vices,</hi>
and the Pleasures of <hi>Capua,</hi> where he
was for some time Posted; and he was
heard to say in his Retreat, that one
while he only wanted an Inclination,
and other time good Fortune, to make
him Master of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Idea the
Historian gives us in that
Place of a <hi>Veteran</hi> General
hardened to the Fatigues
of War,<note place="margin">Potiundae sibi urbis Romanae modo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non dari, modo fortunam <hi>Hist. Rom. lib.</hi> 28.</note> and coming to soften him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in <hi>Italy</hi> in the Embraces, as one may
say, of Pleasure, is very agreeable, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60801:74"/>
of an extraordinary Beauty. The Affairs
of <hi>Sicily</hi> having oblig'd <hi>Marcellus</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
<hi>Syracuse, Archimedes</hi> was there kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Two blundering Souldiers, who
took the <hi>Diagram</hi> of a Geometrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
he was drawing upon the
Sand to be Conjuring; which is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and surprizing Incident in that
place.</p>
               <p>But after all, nothing is Comparable to
the Picture the Author gives us of young
<hi>Scipio,</hi> in the End of the Twenty-sixth
Book; where he Represents him, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd
<hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army
into <hi>Spain,</hi> to give a Diversion to the
Progress of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> That
Victorious Youth, at Twenty Four
Years of Age, was of a ripe and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Prudence; And though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Exploits of Arms, that astonisht
his Enemies, tho' in One Day he took
New <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had a numerous Garrison; He yet
obtain'd greater Victories by his Vertue
than his Valour. For when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
with <hi>Mandonius</hi>'s Lady, a Prince
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Two of his Nieces, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Beautiful, he sent them back
with these Words, <hi>That though, for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60801:75"/>
sake of his own Integrity and the publick
Discipline of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Meae populique Romani di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplinae causa facerem ne quid quod sanctum usquam esset, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos, vialoretur: nunc ut id curem impensius, vestra quoque virtus &amp; dignitas fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit: quae ne in malis quidem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blitae decoris matronalis estis. <hi>Lib.</hi> 26.</note>
                  <hi>it lay upon him to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from Violence
whatever was Sacred:
yet their own Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
was still a greater Engagement to do
them Justice, since in their Misfortunes they
were not forgetful of themselves, nor of their
Vertue:</hi> And having shew'd the same
Respect to another <hi>Spanish Prince,</hi> whose
Princess was presented to him, of a more
accomplisht Beauty than the other, he
sent her back to her Husband with a
great summ of Mony offer'd for her
Ransome. That <hi>Prince</hi> charm'd and
amaz'd, with so great Bounty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
in his Country, There was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in <hi>Spain,</hi>

                  </note> a Young
<hi>Roman,</hi> Qualify'd like
the <hi>Gods,</hi> that carried on
his Conquests as well by his Vertues as
his Arms. Nothing can be finer; and the
image the <hi>Historian</hi> gives us, of the
Young <hi>Victor,</hi> produces an admirable
Effect, through the Opposition he makes
of his Vertue against <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Vices.
'Tis only by his good Nature and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
that <hi>Scipio</hi> Triumphs over the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60801:75"/>
                  <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whereas <hi>Hannibal</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over the <hi>Romans</hi> by Savageness
and Violence. The one is Plundering
<hi>Provinces,</hi> and Battering <hi>Towns,</hi> whilst
the other is winning the Hearts of the
People, and Captivating their Souls by
his Beneficence and Goodness.</p>
               <p>The last Books of this Decade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the mighty Progress of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Arms in <hi>Africa: Hannibal</hi> is recall'd
to the Succour of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he
was Defeated, <hi>Carthage</hi> taken, and <hi>Scipio</hi>
Triumphantly return'd from <hi>Africa</hi> to
<hi>Rome.</hi> Thus the End of this Decade,
by its Opposition to the Beginning,
where <hi>Hannibal</hi> drives on his Victories
uncontroul'd, is one of the finest Places
of the History; especially by the new
Road the Young <hi>Roman</hi> takes to Glory;
contributing more to the Conquests of
the Republick, by setting in the Minds
of the People the Reputation of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Vertue, than by giving Battle:
For that Reputation becoming the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the Conquer'd Nations, was
more Victorious than their Arms.</p>
               <p>After the Defeat of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name soar'd to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Heighth. The Victorious People,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60801:76"/>
whose Renown was spread far and near,
began to be lookt upon as the Deliverer
of other Nations. Thus Gloriously it
is Represented by <hi>Livy,</hi> in the Fourth
Decade. The <hi>Athenians</hi> Oppress'd by
<hi>Philip</hi> (the last of the Name) King of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> implor'd the Assistance of the
Senate. <hi>Publius Sulpitius</hi> was sent
thither, who having Subdued all <hi>Greece,</hi>
Proclaim'd Peace to all the People by his
Lievtenant <hi>Quintius,</hi> and restor'd them
their Liberty; and in a Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for the Celebration of this Festival,
was heard that saying,

                  <hi>at last, there was
a People in the World,
born for the safety of all
others, that cross'd Seas,
made Wars at its own Cost and Peril, to
revenge the Oppress'd, to establish Laws,
causing them to be observ'd through the
whole Earth, and to maintain the publick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Historian afterward opens the
mystery how <hi>Hannibal</hi> became suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Country-men, upon advice
that he entertain'd a constant Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
with King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to oblige
him to declare War against the <hi>Romans:</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60801:76"/>
That was it which this Great Man Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
out of his Country, and as it were
a Vagabond abroad, voted in that <hi>Kings</hi>
Councel; that if he would make War
as he should do, with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he
must attack them in their own <hi>Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and Fight them at <hi>Rome</hi> as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had done: There is a greatness of
Soul, and a loftiness of Thought in what
the Historian makes him speak, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Character of <hi>Hannibal:</hi>
'tis in the Thirty-fourth Book. There
is something Rare and Uncommon in
point of Adventure in the accidental
meeting of this Commander, and <hi>Scipio</hi>
who was made <hi>Lievtenant</hi> to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it is related in the following
Book. Undoubtedly it creates a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
surprize, as it needs must, to see
two Great <hi>Generals</hi> who had disputed
the Empire of the World at the <hi>head</hi> of
two potent Armies meeting by chance
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and coldly giving their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as two private Men, in a Sedate,
and unpassionate Discourse of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
of the Greatest Officers, who
have made the most noise in the World.
In fine, <hi>Hannibal</hi> suspected by his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and hated by all the World, is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60801:77"/>
constrain'd to fly to <hi>Ephesus:</hi> his flight
contains several Adventures, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that part of the History very Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as being of a Man of so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
that every Step he makes is
Considerable.</p>
               <p>But the Adventure of <hi>Scipio,</hi> accus'd
before the People by <hi>Q. Petilius</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Converted part of the Spoils of
King <hi>Antiochus</hi> to his own Coffer, is
more surprizing and remarkable thro'
the giddiness of Fortune, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
of the <hi>Roman</hi> People; and 'tis
represented by the Historian with all
the dignity so strange an Adventure does
require. That Man of incomparable
Vertue as well as Valour, made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
at the Day prefixt by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.
But instead of making his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
to his Accusation, presumptuous
upon his own Innocence, he spoke to
the People assembled, to Condemn him,
with a bold and undaunted Gallantry,
and the Voice of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror:<note place="margin">Celebratior is prope dies favore hominum, &amp; aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matione vere magnitudinis ejus fuit, quam quo trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans de Syphace &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginensibus urbem inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus. <hi>Lib.</hi> 38.</note>
                  <hi>Such was the
day wherein I took</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
<hi>beat</hi> Hannibal,
<hi>and Vanquisht the</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;
<hi>let us go to the Capitol, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60801:77"/>
thank the Gods.</hi> The People surpriz'd at
so magnanimous a Carriage, left the
<hi>Accuser,</hi> and followed <hi>Scipio:</hi> and that
Day, says the Historian, was infinitely
more Glorious to him, and advanc'd his
Honour higher in the Opinion of the
People, than that wherein he Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over King <hi>Siphax,</hi> and the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
Dissatisfy'd however with that
Treatment, which manifested so much
Disesteem, he Retreated to <hi>Linternum,</hi>
a Country-seat of his towards <hi>Capua,</hi>
where he dy'd, sometime after, in the
Embraces of his Family, as a private
Person. The Portraicture of <hi>Cato,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated
in the Thirty-ninth Book, on
occasion of the Dignity of <hi>Censor,</hi> which
he Canvas'd with the <hi>Scipio's, Valerius
Flaccus, Furius,</hi> and other Persons of
note in the Senate, is a Master-piece.
'Tis pleasant to see how Resembling it
all is, upon the Notion a Man has of the
Austerity of Vertue in that Great Man:
For that <hi>portraicture</hi> is so singular, in all
the <hi>features</hi> that compose it, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is <hi>like</hi> nothing, or whether it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles</hi>
its <hi>original,</hi> all is touch'd off
with an admirable Air. That which
the Historian brings him in speaking, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60801:78"/>
the Luxury of Women, in the
Thirty-fourth Book, to put in Execution
the <hi>Oppian</hi> Law, which regulated the
Expense of Habits, and retrench'd the
Prodigality therein; and against the
Nocturnal Devotion, describ'd in the
Thirty-ninth Book, wherewith they
mixt all the Horror of the most disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Practices, and abominable Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
in the World, has much of the
Spirit of a rigid Censour of Manners.
The Speeches he makes against the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
which the Wars of <hi>Asia</hi> had
brought into <hi>Rome,</hi> by infusing Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
Licentiousness, and a Prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Youth, which tended to its utter
Ruine, bear the Stamp of a sincere and
Great Man, who contributed with the
Old <hi>Senators,</hi> to the Preservation of that
Wisdom, Probity, Hatred of Injustice,
love of Equity, and horrour of Vice,
which prevail'd in the Senate at that
time: And all this has its Effect in the
End of that Decade; where the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
presents us with the Spirit and
Character of the Republick, then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting.
The Death of <hi>Annibal,</hi> who had
retir'd to <hi>Prusias,</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> after
the Defeat of <hi>Antiochus</hi> (having Poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60801:78"/>
himself to avoid falling into the
Hands of <hi>Flaminius)</hi> is very moving at
the End of the Thirty-ninth Book: One
is concern'd to see so great a Man Die
in such a manner; and that Particular
prepar'd so finely, with such remarkable
Events, is of a singular Excellence.</p>
               <p>But it must be acknowleg'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more pompous or magnificent
than the Entrance of the Forty-third
Book, where <hi>Livy</hi> sets forth the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the People of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>
after the subduing <hi>Macedonia,</hi> sending
their Embassadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> to implore
the Protection of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the <hi>Republick:</hi> All
that Part is describ'd in that Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Character, which usually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
the happy Conquerours. The
Historian himself there strikes on such
a Key, as lets us know he is Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the good Fortune of his Country
and the Merit of his Subject. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of <hi>Perses</hi> in the Forty-fourth Book,
happening upon occasion of an Horse,
that escap'd the Hands of his Servants,
and was the Cause of the Battle, which
the Two Armies, incamp'd upon the
opposite Banks of a little River, would
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60801:79"/>
willingly have avoided, has something
surprizing in it; and indeed nothing is
finer in an History than great Events,
caus'd by trifling Accidents, as this,
which is very Remarkable upon the
Wonder it raises.</p>
               <p>The Oration the Embassadours of
<hi>Rhodes</hi> make before the <hi>Senate,</hi> in the
Forty-fifth Book, is fine, lofty and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
nothing comes nearer the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<hi>Thucydides</hi> attributes to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of States and Common-wealths,
in his History of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War:
Nothing can be more fitly compar'd
with him, in that very Kind in which his
Excellence lay; nor is there any thing
more like that manner of speaking, he
gives the Towns and States whose
History he Writes. <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi>'s
Voyage through <hi>Greece,</hi> after he had
Conquer'd it, his Visiting the Provinces
to observe what was Remarkable for
Antiquity, or for the Rarity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Work, is handsomely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in the Forty-fifth Book. Every
Town has its peculiar Character, its
Order and Distinction; and the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
by giving us a fine Notion of the
<hi>Country,</hi> heightens the Victories and
Advantages of his <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:60801:79"/>
All this receives an additional Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the <hi>remainder</hi> of that History,
after the Defeat of <hi>Perses,</hi> which was
the concluding Blow of that long and
hazardous War of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and the
<hi>Roman</hi> Name was exalted to its highest
Pitch of Glory. In effect, the Senate
had scarce any other Employment, than
the answering the Requests of <hi>Kings,</hi>
and ordering their <hi>Destinies.</hi> 'Tis no
longer the <hi>Embassadours</hi> of Kings and
Crowned Heads: Here are the Kings
of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and
<hi>Pergamus;</hi> here is <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and his Sister
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who make the Senate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
of their Difference; here's King
<hi>Massinissa</hi> sending his Two Sons to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to Congratulate the Republick, in his
Name, for the Defeat of <hi>Perses:</hi> Here's
<hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> accompanying
his Son <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and presenting him
to the Republick, to take him under its
Protection: Here's <hi>Perses</hi> fasten'd to
<hi>Emilius</hi>'s Chariot, with his Two Sons,
to render the Triumph of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
more Arrogant and Glorious, as had
done <hi>Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> with his
Wife and Children, over-come by the
Pretor <hi>Anicius.</hi> In fine, not to repeat
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60801:80"/>
what I have already observ'd, at the
End of the Abridgment I have made
of the History in the Fifth Chapter, we
may say, there is nothing Comparable
to the Idea <hi>Livy</hi> gives of the Grandeur
and Glory of the Republick in those
Times: That never History went upon
so great a Subject; nor ever Historian
supported the Dignity of the Matter
with a greater Majesty and Force of
Expression. That Picture the Author
draws of <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who

Flattery, is
well worthy of him
and that Purity of

highly Professes: Herewith he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Forty-fifth Book; for the rest
of it is lost.</p>
               <p>How Glorious, would it be, should we
have the Residue of the History which
is lost, and the Description of those
great Transactions of the following
Times, I would say the Particulars of
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s Victories, the adopted Son of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60801:80"/>
                  <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> who subdued <hi>Africa</hi> to
the <hi>Romans:</hi> those times wherein <hi>Thebes,
Calcis, Corinth, Numantia,</hi> were seen
levell'd to the Ground, and following
the Destiny of <hi>Carthage?</hi> Those Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Wars against <hi>Jugurtha</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates?</hi>
Those terrible Seditions, that
began to make Head in the Republick
through <hi>Cinna, Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi>'s abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Power, which the Success of
their Arms conspiring with that Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy,
Abundance and Luxury had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
into the Generality, and their own
Fortune had given them?</p>
               <p>What should we say, did there but
remain in this mighty Work, any Track
of those great Expeditions of <hi>Sertorius</hi>
into <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Marius</hi> upon the <hi>Cimbri</hi>
and <hi>Teutons,</hi> and of <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Asia,
Cesar</hi> amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and in all the
North? The mutual Jealousy of those
Two Great Generals who caus'd a Civil
War? The Sequels of that War, so fatal
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which went near the
Destruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Revolution
of the Government? Finally, should we
see in this Historian, those ghastly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of the <hi>Republick,</hi> ript open
to her very Bowels, by the Hands of her
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60801:81"/>
own Children? Of the <hi>Senate</hi> broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Parties, of <hi>Italy</hi> in Distraction, and
of all the Universe almost in Disorder
and Confusion? Should we see the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the Empire, the Death of
<hi>Cesar,</hi> stab'd by the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi>
of <hi>Octavius,</hi> the Defeat of <hi>Antony,</hi>
the Triumph of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and all the
great Objects of those unfortunate
Times, which doubtless made the finest
part of <hi>Livy</hi>'s History, as being the
most memorable Events of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Common-wealth; For why should we
not reckon up all the Beauties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Works that came from his Hands,
and were only lost through the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or perhaps Ignorance, and corrupt
Palate of the succeeding Ages.</p>
               <p>But I pretend not to have Remark'd
all the Delicacies of this Author; I
have only mention'd those I my self
was most Affected with; a Man must
go quite through with him, that would
do the Historian Justice. And to speak
more freely upon the Point, he must
fetch a vaster compass, than the Bounds
I have prescrib'd my self would admit.
This may suffice for an Essay, to Judge
of the rest by, without being mistaken.</p>

               <p>ANd now having examin'd the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Disadvantages of
these Two Historians, Their Persons,
their Genius, their Subjects, their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the Faults and Excellencies of
each; it may be determin'd which
ought to have the Preference. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they mutually Excel each other, in
several Particulars, to hold the Balance
even, and do them all the Justice that
is possible, here is, in my Opinion, what
we ought to think, and say of One and
the Other. They are both Equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
that exact and scrupulous Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which too Studiously affects a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Regularity; since they were only
made for great Things, and the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their <hi>Genius,</hi> would not permit
them to stoop to so mean Regards.
They had in the same degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
an admirable <hi>Judgment</hi> in the
Choice of their Thoughts, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60801:82"/>
them Nobly: They had an
exquisite <hi>sense</hi> for the natural Turn of
Expression, which is the effect of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Judgment, and they were skill'd in
the <hi>choice</hi> of Words, which enlivened
the Expressions most, and were most
proper to declare their Meaning; they
were equally industrious to avoid flashy
and glittering Words, and to stick to the
more ordinary and significant: Both of
them have more of a figurative, than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Style, knowing that one made great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
impression than the other; but their
Discretion in this Practise was equally
admirable in both, being ever happy in
the Images and Representations of their
Thoughts, wherein we may always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Foot-steps and Tracks of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus there has been but very few
Authors, every way so Accomplisht, as
these Two Historians; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but is judiciously and happily I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
in them both.</p>
               <p>They have both a Sublimity, ever
maintain'd with, and founded on Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
a thing not known to other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
They both endeavour'd to copy
Nature, and this they propos'd as their
main End. They are just in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60801:82"/>
Easy in their Figures, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in their Metaphors. <hi>Livy</hi> is <hi>richer</hi> in
his Expression, is more Copious, and
fuller of Variety, and has more of those
<hi>passionate</hi> Strokes that affect the Mind.
But <hi>Thucydides</hi> has Expressions more
<hi>strong,</hi> Colours more <hi>terrible,</hi> and Strokes
more <hi>lively,</hi> and seems to make more
forcible Impressions on the Thoughts:
He likewise gives more Action and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Speech; and by inclosing a
great deal of Sense in a little room, he
leaves more to the Imagination and
Conjecture of his Reader. But <hi>Livy</hi> is
sure to please more, because to the force
and vehemence of Expression, he adds
all the sweetnesses, and graces of Art,
he is as Florid and Agreeable as he
pleases, by the Art he has of Tempering
his Discourse, with such fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Airs; by giving it those enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Turns; and by the Method he found
out of joining to that Dignity, upon
which he ever bottoms his Discourse, all
the Easiness and Simplicity requisite to
make it Natural. Besides that <hi>Livy</hi> has a
greater abundance of Matter, and more
order and variety in the Events he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents,
there is moreover something
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60801:83"/>
unaccountably <hi>sweet</hi> and insinuating in
his Transitions, which renders him so
smooth and easy, that in Reading him,
a Man is convey'd from one Subject to
another, without being sensible of the
Motion; so dextrously he orders his
Matters, and threads his Discourse. He
marches, or makes a halt, advances, or
takes breath, as his Occasion or his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is, and no Man is aware of it. The
<hi>Greek</hi> is <hi>great</hi> in his Words, and <hi>little</hi> in
his Events, which are generally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
The <hi>Roman</hi> is <hi>great</hi> in both,
and is very singular in the Art he has of
drawing out at length extraordinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
in all their train of Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For he postures them with Design,
and collects them with Discretion, by
avoiding all Superfluous Particulars; and
herein it is he is generally so Alluring;
for nothing ingages a Reader more,
than that Choice of necessary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
singled out from those that are
less useful.</p>
               <p>Nor are onely his Idea's more noble,
but also the Affairs he treats of, and
the Adventures he describes; are of
more weight and moment; and the
Persons he introduces, are of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60801:83"/>
Character: For what can a Man
find in <hi>Thucydides</hi> a Match for <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s; for <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Cesar;</hi> and
all those mighty Names the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
abounds with? Again, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
which <hi>Livy</hi> proposes, present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in all their <hi>formalities,</hi> that is in
their <hi>beginnings</hi> and their <hi>progress;</hi> than
which nothing can be more Delightful
in an History; which is neither so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
nor sufficiently observ'd in <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides.
Livy</hi> has a more rich, a more
embellisht, and a more fruitful Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
he has more fire and liveliness
in his Expression: His Project is greater,
and the contrivance of his Design more
magnificent. That Majestick Strain of
Talking, which is Natural to him; that
Elegance he shews in little Subjects; all
that admirable Art of Rhetorick, with
an exquisite Choice of Words; and all
those other Qualities, which distinguish
him from the Rest of the World, give
him a vast Advantage over <hi>Thucydides;</hi>
who by a dry, unsavoury and austere
way of Speaking, has nothing by way
of Shew and Ostentation: Whereas the
other knows how to manage all this to
his use, and practice it according to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60801:84"/>
necessity of his Subject, without any
Appearance of Study or Affectation.
And those favourable places of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
where one may play the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all those secret Engines, which
move the Soul, are much frequenter in
<hi>Livy,</hi> by reason of those great Concerns
he is engag'd in, and which furnish his
History.</p>
               <p>There seems too to be in <hi>Livy,</hi> more
Purity, better Construction; greater
Order and Regularity, throughout his
Discourse: Which <hi>Thucydides</hi> troubled
not his Head with; nay, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he affected to be <hi>disorderly</hi> in his
Expressions: And indeed, he talks best
of War, especially of the Sea, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Expeditions, having made that his
Exercise and Employment. But it must
be confest, that <hi>Livy</hi> gives us a better
Opinion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than <hi>Thucydides</hi>
of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> though at the same time
they have both pursu'd the Truth of the
History; and the Greek <hi>Historian</hi> is not
to be blamed, if the <hi>Portraictures</hi> he
copies, want that Beauty which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have; for as much as he <hi>makes</hi> not
the Characters, but <hi>represents</hi> them only.
It must be own'd too that the <hi>Athenian</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60801:84"/>
People were more intractable, and head-strong
than the <hi>Romans;</hi> because their
Power was not poiz'd, with such Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Mediums,</hi> as was that of <hi>Rome:</hi>
And that which was <hi>haughtiness</hi> in the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> was true <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and a Nobleness of Soul. <hi>Livy</hi> too had
a great Advantage over <hi>Thucydides,</hi> from
the Nature of his Subject; which was
not only more Fortunate, but more
Stately also and Magnificent: For 'tis
the Empire of the World, 'tis all the
Universe he grasps into his History,
whilst <hi>Thucydides</hi> is confined to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
piece of a Continent, an inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Spot of Ground: But this may be
said in his Commendation, that he has
exprest more Artifice in supporting the
Meanness of his Subject; he has shewn
a great deal of Dexterity, in improving
so harsh and barren a Soil, into so rich,
and, in some measure, fertile a <hi>capacity;</hi>
and herein consists the Greatness of his
Merit, that he has rais'd so Disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
a Subject; to so high a Value as it
bears. It is true, <hi>Livy</hi> takes Pleasure
to open the growing Grandeur of the
Republick by degrees, striking always
at his Mark, which is his Countries
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60801:85"/>
Glory. <hi>Thucydides</hi> had scarce such
Thoughts in's Head; he follows the
beaten Road, without turning to the
Right-hand, or the Left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livy</hi>'s Beginning bears more Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the rest of his History; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
great was his Design, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
haughty in the Proposition of it.
<hi>Thucydides</hi>'s Entrance on a <hi>particular</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
is too <hi>universal.</hi> It would have
serv'd for an <hi>Exordium</hi> to a <hi>general</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and have given us a
compleat Notion of it.</p>
               <p>After all, they are Both of them
mighty Artists, Admirably skill'd in
expressing the Passions in their proper
Characters, and natural Colours. <hi>Livy</hi>
has a softer, and a sweeter Hand;
<hi>Thucydides</hi> has something strangely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and grave in his way of Painting.
The Morals of them both are uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
pure, exact and honest; they have
great Principles of Vertue, admirable
Maxims of the Publick Good, a noble
Tast of Things, and are very experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
in Decency and good Breeding.
To this may be added that they are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
and Rivals in the Love of Truth;
they are Men of an untainted Honesty,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60801:85"/>
of an inviolable Fidelity and Sincerity
on all Occasions.</p>
               <p>One might possibly, to push the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
as far as it will go, compare
<hi>Thucydides</hi>'s Description, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Eighth Book, of the Event,
the News of the intire Rout of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
by the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Army had,
with the Effect the News of the Battle
at <hi>Canna</hi> caus'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Picture
<hi>Livy</hi> makes of the Consternation the
People of <hi>Rome</hi> were in, after that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
is not so Circumstantiated as that
of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> but it is more <hi>greatly</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.
There appears not that Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as in the People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> supported by the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the
<hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Republick;</hi> and all well
consider'd, the <hi>Latine</hi> Historians Genius
seems to have the Ascendant over the
<hi>Graecians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, 'tis confess'd, <hi>Thucydides</hi> is
much exacter in his <hi>Logick,</hi> that he is
more Elevated in his Reasonings, that
he has greater Principles and nobler
Thoughts, in several places, than <hi>Livy,</hi>
and that he makes greater Impressions
on the Soul; but the other is always
more agreeable and moving; the one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60801:86"/>
gives his Colours Strength, the other
Charms and Liveliness. What Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly
Strokes, what bold Expressions
are in the former, what variety in the
latter? <hi>Thucydides</hi> chooses rather to be
Solid than Polite; <hi>Livy</hi> has found
the Method of being Solid and Polite
together; and of joyning all the Elegance
and fineness of Words, with the Solid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Things: The one is great on no
other Bottome than himself; the other
is so, through the nature of his Subject,
and his manner of treating it. The one
has nothing but Strength and Vigour;
The other has the Art of Tempering
that Masculine Vigour with the softest
Charms, such a Work as his is capable
of.</p>
               <p>Finally, to draw to a Conclusion,
<hi>Livy</hi> has been incomparably Happier in
his <hi>choice,</hi> in his <hi>project,</hi> in the <hi>performance</hi>
and <hi>success</hi> of his Work; which leads
the Reader step by step, from contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<hi>Beginnings,</hi> through extraordinary,
and sometimes miraculous <hi>Events,</hi> to a
Glorious <hi>end;</hi> that represents the <hi>Roman</hi>
People, risen from a <hi>base</hi> and <hi>scandalous</hi>
Extraction, to such a Pinacle of Glory,
as never People yet arriv'd to: This
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60801:86"/>
History displays all the Motions and
Progress of that Glory, through its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
and Oppositions, which make
it appear the brighter; and it displays
that growing Greatness, conducted to
its highest Pitch and Elevation, through
all the several Degrees of its Perfection.
This is the thing wherein it is so Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
For nothing is so Charming and
Delightful, as to see the Representation
of the Beginnings and <hi>birth</hi> of things,
gradually <hi>increasing,</hi> and a great Design
methodically <hi>accomplisht,</hi> and brought
to its Perfection: In which point, <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>'s
History is nothing Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, which is
the principal Design, aims at nothing
but the weakning the Two States that
strove for the Empire of <hi>Greece.</hi> The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of that War has nothing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
or Coherence; it is interrupted
by a multitude of Occurrencies that have
no Analogy to the End of it; and that
End is neither happy for the One nor the
other: Thus it leaves the Reader's Mind
discontented, at least very little satisfy'd
with a Story, whereof it retains no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
but of <hi>Battles</hi> and <hi>Orations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60801:87"/>
But if so, then the <hi>Comparison</hi> of these
<hi>Two Authors</hi> is very <hi>unequal,</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi>
has much the better of <hi>Thucydides;</hi>
which yet I cannot absolutely Agree
to, if a Man considers them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in their Personal Merit: I
add too, that probably <hi>Thucydides</hi> had
Excell'd <hi>Livy,</hi> had he been equally
Happy in the Choice of a Subject: For
he is not at all Inferior to him, in the
natural Solidity of good Sense; in that
exactness, or rather severity of Reason
that accompanies all he says: I question
too, whether <hi>Livy</hi> argues always in the
Justness of <hi>Thucydides;</hi> 'tis true, he has
always a nobleness of Expression in his
Narration; but 'tis to be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has all that Simplicity, which
should go into the Character of a perfect
Historian.</p>
               <p>Thus then, to <hi>decide</hi> the <hi>Controversy,</hi>
and precisely to Declare the <hi>Preference,</hi>
it is requisite we return to the Stating
the essential Character of an Historian,
and determine whether <hi>Truth</hi> is all that
is requir'd in him; whether it is enough
meerly to recommend <hi>Truth</hi> to our <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
&amp; not indear it to our <hi>Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi>
by His manner of speaking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60801:87"/>
it; for Simplicity is all that's
requir'd to a Discourse, to discover the
Truth of it: But to make the Reader in
love with it, when presented to him,
there must be a great deal more; there
must be <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Language, nobleness</hi> of
<hi>Expression, loftiness</hi> of <hi>Thought,</hi> and
much <hi>variety</hi> in his <hi>Narration:</hi> It ought
to be known, whether <hi>Truth</hi> is not <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
and attractive enough, through
its own <hi>native Brightness,</hi> and <hi>naked Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi>
without the assistance of <hi>Paint</hi>
and <hi>Artifice;</hi> and whether she is not
spoil'd of her natural Ornaments, and
such as really become her, by that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary
Wash and Dress they bestow on
her. For if so, then <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who has
the most Plainness and Simplicity, is to
be preferr'd before <hi>Livy:</hi> And on the
contrary, if Truth ought to become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
and Lovely, by the Charms and
Beauty of Discourse, <hi>Livy</hi> must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
the Precedence. Here is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to exercise nice and curious Wits,
to whose Sentence I refer my own, being
not Confident and <hi>bold</hi> enough, my self,
to pass the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
