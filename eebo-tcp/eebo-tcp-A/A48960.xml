            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <p>ALL Honours may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be said to receive their Birth either from the City, Court, or Camp, which of all is esteemed the most worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, raising some to Imperial and Princely Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and disthroning others: And in all Kingdoms (even amongst the barbarous <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi>) War hath ever been, and yet is, held in high esteem, and of great Importance; as well for the preservation of their Laws and Rights, as for the defence of their Dominions; for which War is permitted by the Laws of God, is taught by the Laws of Nature, and commanded by the Laws of Nations. And to excite men to valour and noble Atchievments, Reward, or Honours is conferred upon such that merits the same, according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, for the defence of holy Church, their King, and Country.</p>
                     <p>War being therefore of such concern, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth every prudent Prince, for the welfare of his People, to be always prepared for Peace or War, either Offensive or Defensive, both for Forreign Invasion, or the suppressing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Insurrections; wherefore it hath been found expedient to joyn good Laws (the Friends of Peace and Rest) unto Arms; War being always accompanied with men of audacious and furious Spirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iustinianus,</hi> for the uniting of Laws and Arms, appointed one Officer, called a <hi>Praetor,</hi> to command both Martially and Civilly; which Name the <hi>Romans</hi> continued for their General of War, and by his Office had Authority both Martial and Civil. By which it appears that War cannot endure without the assistance of Law: and wise men, in former Ages, did hold that Prudence and Power ought not to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; of which Opinion was <hi>Horace,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Vis expers consilii mole ruit sua.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the same reason, learned Writers were induced to commend valiant Captains and wise Counsellors, as it were joyntly and in one rank; for with <hi>Simonides</hi> they joyned <hi>Pausanias,</hi> with <hi>Craesus, Solon</hi>; and with <hi>Pericles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras.</hi>

                        <head>Of War, and the Causes thereof.</head>
                        <p>DIscord is common to all men, and that occasioned either by Revenge for Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done, out of covetousness in gaining that which belongs to others; for ambition in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fame by noble Victories, or such like
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50041:3"/>
Reasons; and this maketh one City to wage war against another, one Province to invade another, and whole Kingdoms to oppress one another, even to a Conquest if they can. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> proveth that some men by nature are born to Command, and others to Obey: by which it appears that War is necessary, as well to compel those to Obedience, as the others to hold their Authority. The Romans did sometimes judge it convenient to make War only to train up their Youth fit for Service, and to keep them from idleness, which breedeth Intemperance and Dishonesty. And by Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Princes that are martially inclined, have not only gained Renown, but also much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their Dominions. Yet I am of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That War ought not to be made without just cause, and when the Enemy cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to reason by Embassadors, prudent Princes and Commanders do not wage War unadvisedly; and when they do, they should follow the Example of <hi>Trajanus,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served these Cautions; to be careful to supply the places of his slain Souldiers; to repress the enemies pride; and according to Military Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, constrain Mutiners to Obedience and Order.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Of Souldiers.</head>
                        <p>SOuldiers, or men professing Arms, according to <hi>Vlpianus,</hi> were called <hi>Milites Ã  mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, id est duritia</hi>; that is, were so named in respect of the hardness and danger they endure in defence of other people, or because they keep off the injuries which enemies do offer. He that desireth to enjoy the Honour belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Arms, ought first to prove himself a Souldier: which by the Civil Laws may be done three ways; the first is by Certificate from the Captain or Officers; secondly, he ought to make proof of his experience and manhood in Martial Affairs; and thirdly, to be registred in the List of received Souldiers: and none other properly ought to be termed Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>By ancient Custom, Souldiers always took an Oath not to abandon their Captain or Camp, not to commit Treason, nor consult with one another privately to cause mutining, and the like. <hi>Martianus</hi> the great Doctor, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Bondmen as persons unfit and unworthy to be called Souldiers; and no person that hath committed any infamous Crime, of which he is convicted, ought afterwards to bear Arms; so honourable is the Name and Dignity of a Souldier.</p>
                        <p>The persons excused from bearing Arms, are Priests, and all in Holy Orders, all Graduates in Schools, all men above the Age of 60 years, and those under the Age of 17 years.</p>
                        <p>Those Souldiers that had long served the Romans, either in their Legion, or elsewhere, and deported themselves obediently to their Officers, and honestly to all men, were called <hi>Veterani,</hi> and had great favour shewed them; and that when any <hi>Veteran</hi> had honestly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them the space of twenty years, he was then called <hi>Emeritus,</hi> and might have his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to end his days in peace and quietness, with the enjoyment of divers Immunities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides signal marks of Honour according to their merit; which was a great encouragement to Youth to be trained up in Military Service, which oft-times they made use of, appointing Tutors to instruct them therein, and these they called <hi>Tyrones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as on the one hand the Romans reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for good Service, so on the other they inflicted punishments according to the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the Offence; as for Treason, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, Abandoning their Colours, and Assisting the Enemy; also for Theft, Murther, and Cowardise, which they esteemed most vile. The experience of which was seen when <hi>Spra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacus</hi> defeated the Romans, conducted by <hi>Crassus</hi>: For presently upon that dishonour, <hi>Crassus</hi> commanded a Decimation, and put to death a tenth man in every Legion, for not having couragiously behaved himself; which being done, he began the fight afresh, and although their number was lessened, yet were they victorious, and made havock of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And if it happened that a Souldier was degraded for any Offence, it was deemed more dishonourable unto him, than a punishment either Corporal or Pecuniary.</p>
                        <p>The Donatives or Rewards which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans used to bestow on deserving Souldiers, were either advance of Honour, increase of Wealth, or both; and that more or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Deserts: some of which I shall here give account of. To him that had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted an Enemy (if a Foot-man) was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a pot of Gold, or a piece of Plate; and if an Horse-man, an ornamental Badge to be set on his Crest. He that first mounted the Wall of an Enemies Town or place of Fortification, had a Crown of Gold. <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi> after the <hi>Philippian</hi> War, gave unto the Legionary Souldiers certain Crowns, and unto every Captain a purple Garment. <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> after his Triumph for Victory against <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax,</hi> gave unto every Souldier five thousand Groats, to every Leader twice as many, and to every Horse-man double so much. <hi>Pompeius</hi> having overcome <hi>Mithridates,</hi> before he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed, bestowed upon every Souldier five hundred Groats, and upon the Captains a far greater Reward. And <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> did usually say, <hi>That Souldiers would not live in awe of their General, if they were not well clothed, well fed, well armed, and some mony in their Purses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor was the Romans slack in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unto their Generals; for besides rich Presents, they conferred Honour on them, and received them home with triumphal Arches;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50041:3"/>
and to perpetuate their Fame, they erected Pillars, Statues, or Obylisks, to set forth their noble Victories.</p>
                        <p>But what need we fetch all these Examples from the Romans, when our modern Princes do the same: witness the high advance to Honour and Riches that our Soveraign, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, bestowed on that truly loyal and much deserving Subject, <hi>George</hi> late Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> whom I shall anon take more occasion to speak of: Nor hath his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Favour been only shewed on him, but on divers others, as their Merits deserved; some of which I shall also take occasion to speak of in place more convenient.</p>

                        <head>Of Ambassadors or Legats.</head>
                        <p>THE Office of an Ambassador is of so great Honour and Trust, that none are imployed therein, but such as are sufficiently known unto their Prince for Persons of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Prudence, Knowledge in State Affairs, and such as will be strict Observers of their Masters Commands. The Romans had so high an esteem for Ambassadors, that whensoever any came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was first brought unto the Temple of <hi>Saturnus,</hi> where his Name was written before the <hi>Praefectiarii,</hi> and from thence he was conducted to deliver his Embasie to the Senate. Ambassadors ought to be in all Countries inviolable; and whoso offered Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence unto them, was thought to have done contrary to the Law of Nations: which caused <hi>Publius Mutius</hi> to command, That whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did assault an Ambassador, should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to the Enemy from whom the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador was sent; and although the Enemy received him not, yet was he to remain an Exile.</p>
                        <p>Ambassadors are generally imployed by their Prince for the Confirming or Establishing of Peace, a Truce, or Leagues: To demand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution for things unjustly detained, or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Injuries done: To establish or adjust Commerce, or the like. And they are sent (and so likewise received) in some State and Grandure befitting so high a Dignity.</p>
                        <p>The Ceremonies, in many Countries, for the Confirming and Establishing of Peace, a Truce, and Leagues have been diversly used.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> confirmed their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with great Sacraments, swearing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same justly, and without fraud. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> caused some weapon of War to be brought, and thereupon they took an Oath to observe the same; which done, they drank of the water wherein the weapon was washed. The <hi>Grecians</hi> (after the death of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the younger) confirming a Peace with <hi>Arieno,</hi> a Commander of a barbarous sort of people, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Bull, a Boar, a Wolf, and a Ram to be slain, and laid upon a Shield, and in the blood of those Beasts the <hi>Grecians</hi> dipt their Swords, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> their Launces, each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing to observe Fidelity and Friendship to each other. And the <hi>Romans</hi> used this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that when Peace was made, the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> the <hi>Consul,</hi> or <hi>Senate</hi> delivered to the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> an Herb called <hi>Verbena,</hi> or Grass pull'd up by the root, and therewith some Boughs of <hi>Verbena,</hi> together with a Flint taken out of the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Feretrius</hi>; which done, the <hi>Foecial</hi> caused a Sow to be brought to the Market-place, and holding a Scepter in his Hand, having his Head covered with a Cloath, he crowned himself with a Crown of <hi>Verbena</hi>; then beseeched he <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and the other Gods, that if any of the Parties failed to perform their Agreements, that then he should be stricken and slain like the Sow; after which Imprecations her Body was cut with the Flint, upon which they cast Fire and Water, and so their Sacrifice was solemnized.</p>

                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50041:4"/>To draw home to <hi>Britain,</hi> a Microcosme of it self, situate under a temperate Clime, Fertile to the envy of many of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and blessed with all that is necessary for Human Life, producing Men endowed with all the Vertues that other People dispersed over the face of the Universe, can boast of, and principally with hearts that contemn death it self, which to other Nations is so dreadful, having an affection to Arms, and are covetous of Fame, Soveraignity, and Honour above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
                        <p>But it may be objected, How then comes it to pass that we are confined within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bounds of our <hi>Brittish Seas</hi>? Secondly, Wherefore have we quitted our Claim to <hi>France,</hi> or suffered it to lye dormant so many Ages?</p>
                        <p>To the first may be Answered; That it was the piety of our Princes to content their selves within their own Limits, and were unwilling to be troublesome to other Princes, until our <hi>Henry</hi> the Second was supplicated by the <hi>Irish</hi> to commiserate their Calamities, and deliver them out of their Intestine Broyls, into which their irreconcileable Divisions and unchristian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Fewds had plunged them. Thus by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, rather than Conquest, was our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity confirmed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Charter signed by the <hi>Irish</hi> Princes and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, which being transmitted to <hi>Rome,</hi> was confirmed by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> about the Year 1174.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>France</hi> it may also be Answered; That we were constrained to vindicated a just Title to that Crown by force of Arms, when Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and fair Means would not prevail: and for the loss of it, 'tis apparent in all Histories, that our Discords at home, not the Courage or Force of <hi>France</hi> forced us to quit the same, gaining with few Blows what otherwise they would not so much as have attempted. Add hereunto the covetousness and envy of some of our Natives, who being themselves out of Command, will yield any tearms to a Forreign Enemy, rather than maintain an Army in pay for their security; by which facile Concessions and Peace thus purchased, we discourage our Souldery, suffer them to lose their Discipline, and to degenerate by Sloath and Idleness; (a Depravity which cost the <hi>Romans</hi> very dear at the beginning of their second <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genian</hi> War) being almost ruined before they could recover their former practise of Arms, but for us <hi>meliora spero.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>War being in divers Cases just upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive part, and absolutely necessary on the Defensive, 'tis fit we consider the proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition thereof. It is generally said, to be the Exercise of Arms against an Enemy, but more properly 'tis a Contention between Princes or States, by force of Men under Discipline to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Victory: And the end of War is either to obtain Victory, or to live in Peace and Honour.</p>
                        <p>The Division of War (for so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>England</hi>) may be of two sorts or kinds; <hi>viz.</hi> Terene and Naval; in open Field, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Seas. The Art and Exercise of both are absolutely necessary, it being impossible for us to secure our Shoars, if we are not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Seas; nor were we ever victorious in our Transmarine Attempts, before our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Naval Forces were conquered, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Histories of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, &amp;c. Thus are our Oaken Castles our securest Bulwarks to defend us from our Enemies; nor can we offend them abroad without these floating Squadrons; how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then is the excellent employ of Navigation to our Nation, and how glorious, or rather terrible might we be to the Universe, it we did more encourage it, by maintaining a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Navy, and having an Army ready upon any occasion; be it either by standing Troops, or a reformed and well disciplined Militia, which is held more grateful to the People in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> tells us of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That the <hi>English,</hi> at their first Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in <hi>France,</hi> were very raw, and ill disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Souldiers; but within the space of two or three weeks, which they spent in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Exercise, before the <hi>French</hi> could rally up a Force to engage them, they grew expert in their Weapons, and became fit for the Field-Service: from whence he concludes, That the <hi>English,</hi> of all People in the World, are the most prone to War, and aptest to make good Souldiers. Our late Actions at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad justifie our ligitimate Succession from such valiant Ancestors; nor is there any thing so much wanting amongst us, as Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the truly generous Martial Spirits. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth advises his Son to preserve his old Souldiers from sloath by constant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and to train up the Youth of <hi>Spain</hi> under Leaders who had Lands, Goods, and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to secure their Loyalty to the Crown, if they were naturally addicted to Arms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sense of Honour, or shame of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the loss of Estate, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail more with such, that can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from others who carry all their Interest in their Persons, and have nothing to care for but their own safety. Also the priviledge of wearing a Martial Robe; the priority of place in some publick Assemblies, or the like, would much encourage Youth to Martial Discipline. Nor is this only a <hi>Spanish</hi> Device, but 'twas the practise of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had their several Triumphs for their Victorious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and also particular Rewards for their private Souldiers. He who had first boarded an Enemies Ship, entred their Camp or Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, slain one of their Captains in Combat, taken a Standard, &amp;c. was rewarded with a Silver Crown of form denoting his Exploit, with a Collar of Gold, or the like; the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

It were to be wished that such <hi>Roman</hi> Spirits were now to be found amongst us, and then 'tis probable the War might have proved more succesful: but now<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adays such true Valour gives place to Interest, and to an Officer of Fortune, the dread of being disbanded makes a Victory more fatal to him than a Foil; for who will beat his Enemy, that must feel a want when he has none to appear against? What then more serviceable than a well disciplined Militia to be imployed upon all occasions, at Sea and Land? For the Officers (as men of Estates) would be glad to win Honour with hazard of their Lives; and if they should return with the loss of a Limb, would not put the King to the Charge of a Pension: And for the Souldiers, when dismist, may immediately fall to their Trade, or to Husbandry, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves to tell their Neighbours the Story of their Adventures. Thus the large Armies of Horse, which support the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, are maintained. Thus is <hi>Poland</hi> preserved from the power of the <hi>Turk</hi>: and by this very way were our Kings anciently guarded, their Castles defended, their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Conquest, as well as Defence, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered up (<hi>viz.</hi> by Knights Service) as our Histories and Law Books sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>

                        <p>AN Army may be provided, a Navy rigged, manned, and equipped, but the chief and most difficult task is to find a <hi>Generalissimo</hi> worthy of Command, one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose Conduct the hope of the War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; I mean not in the force of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but in his Knowledge in Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, in his Magnanimity, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the four Cardinal Vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude; in his Authority, and in his Disposition to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Affections of his Souldiers, without which they will hardly be brought to do him Honour, nor their King and Country good Service, as might be demonstrated by several Examples, were it convenient.</p>
                        <p>It behoveth a General, not only to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his Army, but carefully to provide for them Provisions as well as Ammunition, and to shew himself prudent, patient, cautious, and liberal unto them, indeavouring to gain by love what he might command from them by power. And this made <hi>Homer</hi> to call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon</hi> a <hi>Pastor of People,</hi> because he carefully looked after the safety of his Army. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor did not command the meanest of his Souldiers to do any thing, but that he himself would sometimes do. And <hi>Antonius</hi> did sometimes march on foot, and carry in his Hand the general Ensign of the Army, which was very ponderous, to shew that his Souldiers should not refuse to undergo any Labour that should be required from them.</p>
                        <p>Amongst the many good properties required in a General, nothing is more commendable than Liberality; and on the contrary, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness as much detestable: for hard it is to attend the Affairs of War, and be overmuch in love with Money. Yet that Commander, who with Honor and good Conscience can attain to Wealth, is not to be disliked; for thereby he may upon an emergent occasion supply the wants of a necessitated Army. And that General is most to be esteemed, who (as a Souldier) knoweth how to offend his Enemy, to govern his own Forces, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to suffer want, and to endure labour. heat, and cold: For sometimes it is found, that he who hath Authority to command, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another to command him, for want of true knowledge of those things that belong unto his Office; for it is more difficult for a General or Commander to know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto him, than to execute the Office of that place, seeing that Skill must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Action, and use go before Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>It is expedient for all Princes and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be well read in Histories, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally those that concern the Actions of their Ancestors. And this (as some believe) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third (when he made War against <hi>Robert</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Scots</hi>) to order a certain <hi>Monk</hi> to attend him in that Expedition, to write down all the Actions of that Enterprize. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi>; endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to know the Histories of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and gave liberally unto one <hi>Iohn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> of <hi>Vincenza,</hi> to write the Victories he obtained against <hi>Vssancassan</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Much more praise and honour is due unto those Commanders, that by long Service, and due degrees of War, have deserved the Titles

appertaining unto Arms, and bear about them the Scars and Marks of true Valour.</p>
                        <p>A General of Horse (according to <hi>Plato</hi>) ought to be made by the consent of the whole Army. The <hi>Praefecti</hi> or great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were elected by those Souldiers that bare Targets: The <hi>Tribuni militum</hi> had their advancement by the voice of Men at Arms; and other Captains or Commanders of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quality were chosen by the chief Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

                        <p>A Charge of so grand an Import ought therefore to be bestowed upon a worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whose Vertues have been tryed in times of trouble, one (if to be found) whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct hath been crowned with Success. The Commander, whose Helmet hath been usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly canopied with the Plumes of Victory, will not quickly be forsaken of his Souldiers in the uttermost Extremity; they still expecting the same Fortune should attend him, as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> oftentimes experienced: nor is it an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie task to engage an Enemy against him upon equal terms.</p>
                        <p>An experienced, liberal, and tender affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native General to his Souldiers is then the Man: and the more Illustrious by Birth the better; Equality causing Emulation, which some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to envy, and that oftentimes ends in inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Malice.</p>
                        <p>Never have we been more fortunate than in our Royal Armies when we have had a King, or an Heir Apparent to the Crown, the Head thereof; witness our Victories in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> under King <hi>Richard</hi>; our many victorious <hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Edwards</hi>; the Battels of <hi>Cressey, Poictiers,</hi> and <hi>Agincourt</hi>; our grand Victory at Sea in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War under the Conduct of his Royal Highness <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York.</hi> Nor are we at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent destitute of Captains of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which are endowed with all Virtues and Princely Qualities requisite for so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: Let me but mention his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all Christendome will second me, to his eternal Fame; that neither <hi>Alexander, Caesar,</hi> nor any other old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains shewed greater Courage or Skill, passed through greater perils by Land or Sea than he hath done; nor is there any Person in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> that can justly dispute for Glory with him, or whose Life hath been so illustrious. Let us but consider, How that at Twenty years of Age he had traced most part of Christendome to encounter glorious Actions; that since he has been engaged in all sorts of Combats, wherein he hath been Conqueror: That he hath appeared magnanimous in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, Leguers, Battels, and Seiges by Land; in the most furious and dreadful Sea fights, in which he hath given life to some Enemies, and taken it from others: His escaping such Hazards, and passing by Domestick Broyls with a Princely Scorn, would half perswade a credulous person that he had evaded the time of dying, and that for the World's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good it were decreed, he should endure as long as the Sun and Moon to support the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Monarchy, in the Person of his Sacred Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and his lawful Successors.</p>
                        <p>Next to his Royal Highness, we may justly commemorize his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c.</hi> who from his Birth was designed for Warlike Atchievements: for the calamities that followed that illustrious Family from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> to the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> forced the Queen and this Infant Prince into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> where he passed his tender Age in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the knowledge of Military Affairs; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at about the Age of Thirteen years he marched under the command of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the Seige of <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and proved so good a Proficient in that rough Study, that at the Age of Eighteen he was thought fit to command a Regiment of Horse in <hi>Germany.</hi> In the Battel of <hi>Lemgow,</hi> 1638. being taken by the Imperalists under the Command of Count <hi>Hatzfield,</hi> he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prisoner above three years, till by the Mediation of his Uncle, the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> he was set at Liberty: And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of which kindness, hearing that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was in an uproar, he posted hither, and tendered his Service to his Uncle, who in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1642 graciously received him; and at a Chapter held at <hi>

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes four kinds of Civil Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>viz. Divitiarum, Generis, Virtutis, &amp; Disciplinae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> defines Civil Nobility to be an Excellency of Dignity and Fame, placed in any Kingdom or People, through the Vertues there shewed forth to the profit of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which made <hi>Diogenes</hi> to tearm No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Blood a Vail of Lewdness, a Cloak of Sloth, and a Vizard of Cowardise.</p>
                        <p>Civil Nobility may be refined into a triple Division; first by Blood, secondly by Merit, and thirdly by Blood and Merit; which last without doubt is the most honourable, and of greatest esteem: For certainly the Honour gained lives in his Family, and doth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his Vertues to Posterity; whilst the glory that those by descents of Blood shine in, is but the reflection of their Ancestors. For all will judge the raiser of a Family more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than him that succeeded him, not adding to that Honour by any Merit of his own. So that it is the best honour the Son can do his deceased Father or Relation, to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate his Vertues.</p>
                        <p>If any person be advanced by lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his Prince, to any Place, Dignity, or publick Administration, be it either Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, Military, or Civil, so that the said Office comprehends in it <hi>Dignitatem, vel dignitatis titulum,</hi> he ought to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Degree of Gentility. And a Man may be ennobled by Letters Patents from his Prince, though he have not the Superiour Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles added; and may have a Coat of Arms given him.</p>

                        <p>Of these three issued divers Emperors and Rulers, whereof at this day we have ten De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; of which Six are called Noble, as a <hi>Gentleman, Esquire, Knight, Baronet, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and <hi>Viscount:</hi> and four others are called excellent, as an <hi>Earl, Marquis, Duke,</hi> and <hi>Prince.</hi>

                           <item>2. The second is a Gentleman of Blood, and not of Ancestry, as when he is the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree descended from the first.</item>
                           <item>3. The third is a Gentleman of Coat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and not of Blood, as when he weareth the Kings Devise given him by a Herald. If he have Issue to the third Descent, that Issue is a Gentleman of Blood.</item>
                           <item>4. The fourth also is a Gentleman of Coat Armour, and not of Blood; as when the King giveth a Lordship to him and his heirs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; then he may by vertue thereof bear the Coat of the Lord's making, the Herald ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thereof: But if any of the Blood of that Lordship be yet remaining, he cannot bear the same.</item>

If he also have Issue to the fifth Degree, they are Gentiles of Blood. Note that no Christian may bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Christians Coat, nor a Pagan a Pagans Coat, on the Condition abovesaid: But if an English man in the Field, when the Banner Royal is displayed, do put to flight any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman which is an Enemy to his Prince, from his Banner of Arms the English Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may honour his own Coat in the Sinister Quarter with the proper Coat of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that he so put to flight.</p>
                              <p>Also in Challenge of Combat the Victor shall not bear the Coat of the Vanquished: yet indeed the Vanquished shall lose his own Coat; But if he marry a Gentlewoman of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, by the Courtesie of <hi>England</hi> he may bear hers.</p>

                           <item>7. The Seventh is when a Yeoman's Son is advanced to Spiritual Dignity, he is then a Gentleman, but not of Blood; but if he be a Doctor of the Civil Law, he is then a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Blood.</item>
                           <item>8. The Eighth is called a Gentleman untry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as brought up in an Abby, and serving in good calling, and also is of kind to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots.</item>
                           <item>9.

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Politicks</hi> reciteth four kinds of Nobility; that is, Nobleness of Riches, Nobleness of Lineage, Nobleness of Vertue, and Nobleness of Science, amongst which, those of Vertue and Lineage are of chief esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, being such from whence the others do proceed.</p>
                        <p>As some write, Nobility began to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced shortly after <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood: For when pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions were given by the consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who had all things in common, and were of equal degree) they gave them to such whom they admired for their Vertues, and from whom they received a common benefit.</p>
                        <p>The Law of Arms, which is chiefly directed by the Civil Law, must needs be very ancient; for field nor fight cannot be continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law; therefore 'tis to be presumed it began when Battels were first fought in the World; and the bearing of Arms was come to some perfection at the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi>; for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> bore Sable, two Lyons combattant, Or.</p>

                        <p>As in Man's Body, for the preservation of the whole, divers Functions and Offices of Members are required; even so in all well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Common-wealths, a distinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is necessary; and the policy of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> for the Government and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the Common-wealth, hath made a threefold Division of persons; that is to say,</p>
                        <p>First the King, our Soveraign Monarch (under which Name also a Soveraign Queen is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, as it is declared by the Statute made in the first of Queen <hi>Mary, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Parliam.</hi> 2.)</p>
                        <p>Secondly the Nobles, which comprehend the Prince, Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly the Commons, by which general word is understood Baronets, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Artificers, and Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                        <p>It is observed, that our Law calleth none No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the Degree of a Baron, and not as men of Forreign Countries do use to speak, with whom every man of Gentle Birth is counted Noble: For we daily see, that both Gentlemen and Knights do serve in Parliament, as Members of the Commonalty. Neither do these words the Nobles, the high and great men in the Realm, imply the Person and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the King: but with the Civilians the King is reckoned among the Nobility.</p>
                        <p>The Nobility are known by the general Name of Peers of the Realm, or Barons of <hi>England</hi>; for Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, and Viscounts did anciently sit together in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50041:15"/>
King's great Council of Parliament as Barons, and in right only of their Baronies: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the general Name of Barons of the Realm, and for the Baronage thereof, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>and the whole Body of the Nobility; the Parliament Robes of the Dukes differing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Barons, but that they wear the Guards upon their Shoulders three or four folds: For though Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, and Viscounts in their Creations are attired with Ornaments of Silk and Velvet; yet in Parliament they use the same that Barons do, made of Scarlet, with divers differences of white Fur set as Fringes or Edgings on their Shoulders; and although they sit in right of their Baronies, yet they take their places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their degrees of Dignity.</p>
                        <p>And hence it is that those bloody Civil Wars concerning the Liberties granted in the Great Charter, both in the time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, his Son, prosecuted by all the Nobility (some few excepted) are called in our Histories the <hi>Barons Wars.</hi> Neither have the Spiritual Lords any other Title to that preheminence, but by their ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies: For although originally all the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Bishops, Abbots, and Priors, were given and holden in Frank Almoign; most of their Tenures were altered, <hi>viz. Baronia,</hi> as appeareth in <hi>Matthew Paris A.</hi> 1070. <hi>fol.</hi> 66. and of that Tenure have continued ever since, as you may read by the Constitutions of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and in <hi>Glanvile</hi> and <hi>Bracton.</hi> But the Tenures of all Abbots and Priors were extinguished by the uniting and coming of them to the Crown by the Statute of Dissolution of Monasteries: For though the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> differ in Titles and certain Ceremonies, yet a Baron en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth the same priviledges.</p>
                        <p>And by experience it is found, That Dukes and all other degrees of Nobility in Cases Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal are tryed by Barons, together with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisses, Earls, and Viscounts, as their Peers, and Peers of the Realm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nobilitas</hi> generally is of the word [<hi>Nosco</hi>] signifying in common phrases of speech, Men of Generosity of Blood and Degree; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>Vir nobilis idem est quod notus, &amp; per omnia or a vulgatus:</hi> But especially it is applyed and used to express the reward of Vertue in honourable measure, <hi>Ageneris clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> which being in part of distributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, remaineth with the highest Soveraign annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</p>
                        <p>For as Vertue is the gift of none but of God, so the reward thereof with Honour cannot be the gift of any but the Supreme Governour, being God's Vicegerent on Earth. But when Honour and Arms be bestowed upon any, if there shall arise contention between Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the same, the ancient policy of this Realm hath ordained a Special Court; the Judges whereof in all times having been Right Honourable Personages, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord High Constable and the Earl Marshal; and in latter times the Judge thereof only the Earl Marshal. The Jurisdiction of the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>eth in the Execution of that part of distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Justice, which concerneth the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and support of Vertue.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless some men there are, not duly considering of what principle and parts the Laws of this Realm do consist, have laboured to prove that the Questions and Controversies of Nobility and Arms should not be determined by the Laws of the Realm, but by the Civil Law, framing to themselves many Arguments to prove the same; but being of small value, I pass them over.</p>
                        <p>The Common Laws, as also the Laws of Charity used in the Marshals Court, do prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit any Subject of this Realm to receive Titles of Honour and Dignity by gift or donation from a Forreign Prince, King, or Emperor; for it is a thing greatly touching the Majesty of the King and State of his Kingdom, <hi>Est vis Majestatis &amp; inter insignia summae potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if a man shall bring an Action, and in the Writ is styled by such a Forreign Title, the Defendant may plead in Abatement of his Writ, That he is no Duke, Marquis, Earl or Baron; whereupon if the Plaintiff, as demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, take Issue, the Issue shall not be tryed by the Jury, but by the Records of Parliament, wherein he faileth.</p>
                        <p>And if any English man be created Earl of the Empire, or of any other Forreign Nation, and the King also do create him into any Title of Honour in <hi>England,</hi> he shall be named in all Judicial proceedings only by such Name and Title as he hath received from the King of this Realm, whose Subject he is. And if by the King of <hi>England</hi> he be not advanced to Title of Honour, then he shall bear the name only of his Baptism and Surname, unless he be a Knight. For experience teacheth that Kings joyned in League together by certain mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and as it were natural, power of Monarchies according to the Laws of Nations, have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed one anothers Subjects and Ambassadors graced with the Dignity of Knighthood.</p>
                        <p>A Duke of <hi>Spain,</hi> or of another Forreign Nation, cometh into <hi>England</hi> by the King's safe Conduct, in which also the King doth style him Duke, according to his Creation; nevertheless in all proceedings in the King's Courts he shall not be so stiled by his Title of Dignity.</p>
                        <p>And although the said Noble person be also by the King's Letters Patents, and by his Forreign Name and Title of Dignity made Denizon (for that is the right Name so called, because his Legitimation is given to him): Or if he be naturalized by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, wherein he seemeth to be in all things made as a Subject born,

                        <p>And so it is if a Nobleman of <hi>France,</hi> or elsewhere, come into <hi>England</hi> as Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and by lawful Marriage hath a Son, and the Father dieth, the Son is by Birth a Natural Englishman, yet he shall not bear the Title of Honour of his Father; and the reason thereof is, because that Title of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had its Original by a French King, and not by any natural Operation: which thing is well proved both by Authority of Law and Experience in these days.</p>

                        <p>And here by the way may be noted from those recited Books alledged, That the person of the King in another King's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is not absolutely priviledged, but that he may be impleaded for Debt or Trespass, or condemned for Treason committed with in the said Dominions: For it is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of Nations, that in what place an Offence is committed, according to the Law of the said place they may be judged, without regard to any priviledge. Neither can a King in any other Kingdom challenge any such Prerogative of Immunity from Laws: For a King out of his proper King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath not <hi>merum Imperium,</hi> but only doth retain <hi>Honoris titulos &amp; dignitatis</hi>; so that where he hath offended in his own Person against the King in whose Nation he is, <hi>per omnia distringitur, etiam quoad personam.</hi> And the same Law is of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, <hi>ne occasio daretur delinquendi.</hi> That Ambassadors are called Legats, because they are chosen as fit men out of many; and their Persons be sacred both at home and abroad, so that no man may injuriously lay violent hands upon them, without breach of the Law of Nations, and much less upon the person of a King in a strange Land.</p>

they do gird them with Swords, that is to say,</hi> Ringis gladorium. Upon this cause were the Stations and Encampings of Arms, called by the <hi>Romans Castra,</hi> of the word <hi>Castrare,</hi> since they ought to be <hi>Castrata vel Casta.</hi> In this place ought a good Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to foresee that <hi>Venus</hi> Delights be (as it were) gelded and cut off from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

                     <p>MONARCHY is as ancient as Man, <hi>Adam</hi> being created So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord of the Universe, whose Office was to govern the whole World and all Creatures therein. His Posterity (after his Death) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding into Tribes and Generations, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no other Dominion than Paternity and Eldership. The Fathers of <hi>Nations</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Kings, and the Eldest Sons in every Family were reverenced as Princes, from whence came the word <hi>Seignior</hi> amongst the Italians and French, and <hi>Seignories</hi> for Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Dominion; of which <hi>Seneca</hi> makes two kinds, <hi>viz. Potestas aut Imperium,</hi> power to command, <hi>&amp; Proprietas aut Dominium,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or Dominion.</p>
                     <p>These Empires in the Golden Age were founded upon natural Reverency and Piety; their Power was executed with the soft Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of paternal perswasions, and the greatest penalties that they inflicted upon the most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Criminals was the malediction of their Primogenitors, with an Excommunication out of the Tribes: But as Men and Vice began to increase, Pride and evil Examples overshadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Filial Obedience, and Violence entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage of the World, the mighty Men tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Island of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> when Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism was so happy as to submit to a Regal Power (as <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Commentaries wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth) then divided into many Kingdoms; under which Government of Kings (with some small alterations, according to the necessity of times and pleasure of Conquerors) it hath flourished, descending from the <hi>British, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Danish, Norman,</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Kings, to our gracious Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, into whose Veins all those several streams of Royal Blood are conjoyned to unite those jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nations into one Body, under a Head, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which each one may justly claim an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
                     <p>God hath thus restored our ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and seated our Soveraign in the Throne of his Ancestors, giving him a power just and absolute, as well to preserve as curb his people, being not only <hi>Major singulis,</hi> but <hi>Major universis</hi>; and his power is <hi>super totam Rempublicam,</hi> which I thus prove, Either the whole power of the Commonwealth is in one, or not; if not, then he is no absolute King or Monarch; but if he be (as all must yield) a Monarch, I ask if there be a power in the Commonwealth which is not in him? Is it subordinate to his power, or not? If subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, than his power is above that power, and so <hi>super totam Rempublicam &amp; Major universis</hi>; if it be not, then there are a <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> to Supream Civil Powers in the same individual Kingdom and Gubernation, and yet divided against it self, which is most absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. This in Answer to a monstrous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, which the lasciviousness of our late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wars produced, which asserted <hi>Rex mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor universis.</hi> But the Divine Providence hath (I hope) put a period to all such Trayterous Tenents, and concluded such Disputes by Acts of Parliament; so that no person for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shall dare to question who hath the right of making Peace or War, the power of Militia by Land and Sea, all strong Holds and Forts, &amp;c. being the inherent right of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Monarchs by their Prerogative Royal.</p>
                     <p>The King is God's Vicegerent, and ought to be obeyed accordingly: If good, he is a blessing; if bad, a judgment: and then against whom we are to use no other weapons but prayers and tears for his amendment.

He is under no Vassuage; he takes his Investure from no man. <hi>Rex non habet Superiorem, nisi Deum: satÃ¬s habet ad poenam, quod Deum expectat ultorem.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>England, France, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> Kings are styled <hi>Dei Gratia, &amp;c.</hi> and as the French King is said to be <hi>Rex Francorum Christianis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus,</hi> the most Christian King of <hi>France</hi>; The King of <hi>Spain</hi> the most Catholick; The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the Defender of the Church: So the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> by a Bull from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, sent to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth (for a Book of Controversie written by him against <hi>Luther</hi>) have the Title of <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Faith</hi>; and by Act of Parliament he is declared Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the manner also for Kings to write in the plural Number (which is God's own style) <hi>Mandamus, Volumus, &amp;c.</hi> and in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we find them called <hi>Gods,</hi> in which sense they may be styled <hi>Divi,</hi> or <hi>Dii, quia Dei Vicarii, &amp; Dei voce judicant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Lawyers also say, <hi>Rex est persona mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta cum Sacerdote, habet Ecclesiasticam &amp; Spiritualem Iurisdictionem.</hi> This shews the King's power in Ecclesiastical Causes, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with Oyl as the Priests, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were; which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his person to be both Sacred and Spiritual. And therefore at the Coronation hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him a Priest's Garment, called the <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> or <hi>Colobium,</hi> and other such Vests. And before the Reformation, the King, as a Spiritual person, received the Sacrament in both kinds. He is capable of holding Tithes; all Extra-Parochial Tithes, some Proxies, and other Spiritual profits belong to the King.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies at the Coronation of the King are many, and with us in <hi>England</hi> more than in many other Countries; As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting with Oyl, which is proved by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to be of above one thousand years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Crown set upon his Head with many Religious Ceremonies: besides the Ensigns of

                     <p>But this Imperial Crown hath not been long in use amongst us (though our Kings have had Imperial Commands, as over <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, Man,</hi> and other Isles) being in a manner like that of an Earls now. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it found that any such thing as a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem was at all in use, until the tune of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great: For before the distinction was some kind of Chaplet, or rather a white silk Fillet about the Head, which was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way to distinguish them. And we read that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great took off his white Diadem to cure the madness of <hi>Seleucus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first King that was crowned with this Imperial Crown floried and arched, was <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, but some say <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and indeed it is left in dispute. However, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable and plain, That the ancientest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Regal Authority was the Scepter, which is every where spoken of, both in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Prophane History.</p>
                     <p>There is another Ensign of their Authority, which is a Globe or Mound with a Cross, which hath been in use amongst us ever since <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor's time, which is placed in the left hand, as is seen in most of their Coyns: The Cross denoting his Faith, the Globe his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by Sea and Land; as 'tis said of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperor, who was the first that ever used it.</p>
                     <p>The Office of the King of <hi>England,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Fortescue, Pugnare bella populi sui &amp; eos rectissime judicare,</hi> to fight the Battels of his people, and to see Right and Justice done unto them: or more particularly (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised at the Coronation) to preserve the Rights and Priviledges of Holy Church, the Royal Prerogatives belonging to the Crown, the Laws and Customs of the Realm, to do Justice, shew Mercy, keep Peace and Unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King is enabled to perform this great and weighty Office by certain extraordinary powers and priviledges which he holds by the Law of Nations, by the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or by Statutes.

So it is in Ecclesiastical Laws for conformity to the Liturgy, &amp;c. which are <hi>Malum prohibitum</hi>; and the King may by his Prerogative Royal as well dispense with all those penal Statutes, as with Merchants to transport Silver, Wooll, and other prohibited Commodities by Act of Parliament.</p>

                     <p>Note, That by Order, not Creation, our present King was admitted Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> had the Principality with the Earldom of <hi>Chester, &amp;c.</hi> confirmed to him by Patent, and was allowed to hold his Court apart from the Kings.</p>

A usual custome in <hi>Spain,</hi> and once allowed here to <hi>Henry,</hi> Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; yet he holdeth his Seigniories and Principalities of the King, as Subject to him, and giveth the same respect to him as other Subjects do.</p>

                     <p>To eschew Maintenance, and nourish Peace and Amity in all parts of the Realm, many Statutes have been made in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, prohibiting the giving of Signs or Liveries to any but Menials; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless by the Statute 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. it is provided that the Prince may give his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Liveries or Sign to the Lords, or to his Menial Gentlemen; and that the same Lords may wear the same as if they were the King's Liveries; and that the Menials of the Prince may also wear the same as the King's Menials.

                        </gap> that enormity of Maintenance, and of the general word in them, that priviledge of the Prince was abridged, or rather taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, therefore the Statute 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. was made.</p>

                     <p>By the Order of the Common Law, the King may Levy a reasonable Ayd of all his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as well of those that did hold their Lands of him by Knights Service, as in Soccage, <hi>pur faire fitz Chevalier, &amp; pur File marrier,</hi> and the sum of Money was not in certainty.</p>

                     <p>By another Statute made in the said 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. amongst other things it is declared, That to compass or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the death of the King's eldest Son and Heir, is <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis</hi>; or if a man do violate the Wife of the King's eldest Son and Heir, it is High Treason. And so the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. doth declate. And so was the ancient Common Law of this Realm, and not a new Law made by the Statute, <hi>Coke</hi> 8. <hi>part</hi> 28. <hi>b.</hi> but this Statute is a Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Application of the ancient Common Law in this Case.</p>
                     <p>Because the people were in ambiguity, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children born in parts beyond the Sea, and out of the King's Dominions, should be able to demand any Inheritance within his said Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or not; It was declared at a Parliament holden at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the Seventeenth of King <hi>Iames,</hi> for the removing of those doubts, That <hi>les Enfants du Roy,</hi> the Children of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in whatsoever parts they are born in, are able, and ought to bear the Inheritance after the death of their Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>Read the Statute in <hi>Coke's Seventh Part,</hi> 8. <hi>a.</hi> where you shall see, that though generally the Birth-place is observed, yet many times Legiance and Obedience without any place in the King's Dominions, may make a Subject born: For we see by Experience almost in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Parliament, that Ambassadors, Merchants, and the King's Souldiers do sue therein, in such Cases, to have their Children Naturalized, or made Denisons. And in the Articles confirmed by Parliament touching the Marriage between <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary, Anno primo Parliamenti</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. a special Proviso was to bar him from being Tenant by the Courtesie of the Crown, in case he should have Issue by her, and survive; which was super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, because the Common Law would have denied it. For this last point see the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Speech in the Case <hi>Postnati, f.</hi> 36.</p>
                     <p>But note, If an Alien Enemy come into this Realm, and his Wife, English or Stanger, be here delivered of a Child, this Child notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Birth-place, is an Alien born, for want of Allegiance in the Parents, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third did create <hi>Edward</hi> his eldest Son the first Prine of <hi>Wales,</hi> and did give unto him the Dominion and Dignity thereof, to be holden of him and his Heirs, Kings of <hi>England</hi>: And after that time the eldest Sons of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been Princes of <hi>Wales</hi>; and as incident to the State and Dignity of a Prince, did and might make Laws and Statutes, and use Jurisdiction and Authority, as amply as any King of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could do; for <hi>Wales</hi> was a Kingdom in ancient time: but by a Statute made the Twelfth of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, <hi>Wales</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated and united to <hi>England,</hi> and became part thereof.</p>

                     <p>And it hath been resolved by the Judges of all Acts of Parliament and Statutes which do concern the Prince, who is the Firstbegotten Son of the King, and Heir apparent to the Crown for the time being, <hi>perpetuis futuris temporibus,</hi> be such Acts whereof the Judges and all the Realm must take Cognizance, as of General Statutes: For every Subject hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the King, and none of his Subjects (who are within his Laws) be divided from him, being he is Head and Sovereign; so that the business and things of the King do concern all the Realm, and namely when it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Prince, the Firstbegotten Son of the King, and Heir apparent to the Crown.</p>

                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second was deposed by his eldest Son, who in the life time of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took upon him to be the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Richard,</hi> the only Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>black Prince,</hi> and next Heir to the Crown after the death of his Grandfather King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, was defeated both of his Crown and Life by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Son to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> who was but the fourth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; yea, although <hi>Lionel,</hi> the third Son of the said King <hi>Edward,</hi> had Issue <hi>Philip</hi> his only Daughter, who by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was next to the Crown before the Issue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50041:23"/>
of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>; which <hi>Philip</hi> was married to <hi>Edward Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> from whom the House of <hi>York,</hi> by the name of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, are lineally descended: For <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> second Son to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third, died young without Issue.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, having but one Son, named <hi>Edward,</hi> he was slain in the life time of his Father, and the King himself deposed by <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and murthered in the <hi>Tower:</hi> So the Act of Parliament made between them for an indented Peace, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in our Books of Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> the two only Sons to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, after the descent of the Crown, and before the Coronation of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> were both of them murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Tower</hi> by their Uncle, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who thereupon took upon him the Crown, although there were remaining alive divers Daughters of the late King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth. During these troublesome and tragical times, each of the Kings prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attainted the other their Adversary of High Treason by Act of Parliament, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly to disable them, and make them to be incapable by the Law of the Crown. And it is a matter worthy of Observation, how the Hand of God did not forget to pursue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in these Cases; for <hi>William Rufus</hi> died without Issue; <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother had a Son and one Daughter, but his Son died an Infant, and his only Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> was defeated of her Birthright by <hi>Stephen.</hi> King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who defeated <hi>Arthur</hi> his Nephew of his Birthright and Life, lived in continual Wars, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Peace, but was driven to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and subject his Kingdom to the Pope. In his time <hi>Normandy,</hi> which King <hi>William</hi> the First brought with him, and which in five Descents continued in actual Obedience of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> was in the sixth year of his Reign lost, until King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it again, and left it to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, who again lost it in the Eight and twentieth year of his Reign, as doth appear both in our Chronicles, and in our Books of Law.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the violence done to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Second, albeit <hi>Edward</hi> his Son enjoyed a long and prosperous Reign; yet his Successor, King <hi>Richard,</hi> was in the like violent manner imprisoned, deprived, and put to death.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, by whom King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was deposed, did exercise the chiefest Acts of his Reign in executing those, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with him against King <hi>Richard</hi>: His Son had his Vertue well seconded by Felicity, during whose Reign, by the means of Wars in <hi>France,</hi> the humour against him was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise imployed: But his next Successor, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was in the very like manner deprived, and together with his young Son <hi>Edward,</hi> imprisoned and put to death by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. This <hi>Eward</hi> died not without suspicion of poyson; and after his death, his two Sons were likewise disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, imprisoned, and murthered by their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Uncle, the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who being both a Tyrant and Usurper, was justly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh in the Field: So infallible is the Law of Justice in revenging Cruelties and Injuries, not always observing the present time wherein they are done; but often calling them into reckoning, when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders retain least memory of them.</p>
                     <p>But as the saying is, <hi>Ex malis moribus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae leges oriuntur</hi>; so their Tragical and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Combustions have occasioned, that the Law hath established more certain Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all these cases and pretences against the right Heir to the Crown than before. For first, though a common Opinion was conceived, that a Conqueror might freely dispose of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of that Estate, which he had obtained by the purchase of his Sword (which was the Title pretended for <hi>William Rufus</hi>) yet now in our Books this difference is taken for Law, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Conquest of a Kingdom from a Christian King, and the Conquest of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from an Infidel: For if a King come to a Christian Kingdom by Conquest, seeing he hath <hi>Vitae &amp; necis potestatem,</hi> he may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure alter and change the Laws of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but until he doth make an alteration thereof, the ancient Laws do stand; and therefore the case of <hi>Rufus,</hi> the ancient Law of this Realm being, That the eldest Son should inherit, and that a King in possession cannot devise the same by his last Will, or by other Act; therefore the said <hi>William Rufus</hi> was no other than a Usurper. But if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King should Conquer a Kingdom from an Infidel, and being then under his subjection, there <hi>ipso facto</hi> the Laws of the Infidels are abrogated; for that they be not only against Christianity, but against the Law of God and Nature, mentioned in the Decalogue: and in that case, until certain Laws be established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, the King by himself, and such Judges as he shall appoint, shall judge them and their causes according to natural Equity, in such sort as Kings in ancient times did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Kingdoms, before any certain muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Laws were given. And if a King have a Kingdom by Title of Descent there, seeing by the Laws of that Kingdom he doth inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom, he cannot change those Laws of himself, without consent of Parliament. Also if a King have a Christian Kingdom by Conquest, as King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second had <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> after that King <hi>Iohn</hi> had given unto them (being under his Obedience and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) the Laws of <hi>England</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Country, no succeeding King could alter the same without Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In Succession of Kings a question hath been, Whether the King, who hath had Sons both
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50041:23"/>
before and after he came to the Crown, which of them should succeed, he that was born before, as having the prerogative of his Birthright; or he that was born after? And for each Reasons and Examples have not been wanting. For <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> being the eldest Son after the enthroning his Father, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Empire from his Brother <hi>Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones</hi> or <hi>Artobazanes,</hi> who was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father came to the Royal Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof. So <hi>Arceses,</hi> the Son of another <hi>Darius,</hi> born in the time of his Fathers Empire, carried away the Garland from his Brother <hi>Cyrus,</hi> born before his Father came to the Empire. So <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> born after his Father was Duke, was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Dukedom before his Brother <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasius,</hi> born before the Dukedom. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these Examples, and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sundry Doctors to the contrary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of Succession in these latter days hath been to the contrary, and that not without good reason; for that it is not meet that any that hath right to any Succession by the prerogative of their Birthright (such as all elder Brothers have) should be put by the same. And this was the pretence of <hi>Henry</hi> the First against <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest Brother.</p>
                     <p>Also sundry Contentions have risen in Kingdoms between the Issue of the eldest Son of the King dying before his Father, and the second Brother surviving, who should Reign after the death of the Father; the Nephew challenging the same unto him by the Title of his Fathers Birthright, and by way of Representation, <hi>Cok. part</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. the other claiming as eldest Son to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the time of his death: Upon which Title, in old time, there grew a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie between <hi>Arcus</hi> the Son of <hi>Arrotatus,</hi> eldest Son of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> second Son of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> Uncle to the said <hi>Arcus</hi>: But upon debate of the matter, the Senate gave their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for <hi>Arcus</hi> against <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> Besides, <hi>Enominus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> having two Sons, <hi>Polydectes</hi> and <hi>Licurgius, Poyldectes</hi> dying without Children, <hi>Licurgius</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Kingdom; but after he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that <hi>Polydectes</hi> Widow had a Child, he yielded the Crown to him; wherein he dealt far more religiously, than either did King <hi>Iohn,</hi> or King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third: For King <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon the like pretence, not only put by <hi>Arthur Plantaginet,</hi> his eldest Brother's Son, from the Succession of the Kingdom; but also most unnaturally took away his life And King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, to come to the Crown, did most barbarously, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slay his two innocent Nephews, but also defamed his Mother in publishing to the World, that the late King his Brother was a Bastard.</p>
                     <p>Our Stories do obscurely note, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of like matter had like to have grown between King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> his Uncle; and that he had procured the Counsel fo sundry great Learned Men to this purpose: but that he found the hearts of divers Noblemen of this Kingdom, and especially the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to be against him; whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from his intended purpose, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Nephews Right. And the reason of the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> is notable in this point, and may be collected out of the ancient Authors of the same; <hi>Glanvile lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 30. and by <hi>Brittan, fol.</hi> 119. For they say, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Heir to another, <hi>aut est haeres jure proprietatis,</hi> as the eldest Son shall inherit only before his Brothers; <hi>aut jure represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis</hi>: as where the eldest Son dieth in the life of his Father, his Issue shall inherit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the youngest Son; for though the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>sit magis propinquus,</hi> yet <hi>jure represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis</hi> the Issue of the eldest Son shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, for that he doth represent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Father; And as <hi>Bracton</hi> saith, <hi>jus proprietatis,</hi> which his Father had by his Birthright, doth descend unto him: <hi>aut jure propinquitatis, ut propinqui jus excludit remotum, &amp; remotus remotiorem: aut jure sanguinis.</hi> And yet <hi>Glanvile,</hi> Lord Chief Justice under King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make this questionable here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Who should be preferred, the Uncle or the Nephew. Also it hath been resolved for Law, That the possession of the Crown purgeth all defects, <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 3. and so doth <hi>Vlpian</hi> the Civilian determine. And this is one of the three Reasons alledged, wherefore by the policy of our Law the King is a Body Politick, thereby to avoid the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of him that had right to the Crown, <hi>Coke's seventh part,</hi> 12. <hi>a.</hi> lest in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim there should be an <hi>interregnum,</hi> which the Law will not suffer, because of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Incumbrances thereof: For it hath been clearly resolved by all the Judges of the Land, That presently, by the descent of the Crown, the next Heir is compleatly and absolutely King, without any essential Ceremony or Act to be done, <hi>ex postfacto</hi>; And that Coronation is but a Royal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and outward Solemnization of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent. And this appeareth evidently by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Presidents and Book-Cases. Let us take one or two Examples in a Case so clear for all: King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was not crowned till the Eighth year of his Reign, and yet divers men before his Coronation were attainted of Treason, Felony, and the like Crimes; and he was as absolute and compleat a King for matters of Judicature, Grants, &amp;c. before his Coronation, as he was after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50041:24"/>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reigned three moneths before she was crowned, in which space the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed for Treason which they had committed before she was Queen.</p>
                     <p>And upon this reason there is a Maxim in the Common Law, <hi>Rex nunquam mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> in respect of his ever living and never dying politique capacity. In <hi>France</hi> also the same Custome hath been observed; and for more assurance it was expresly enacted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, That after the death of any King, his eldest Son should immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately succeed; for which cause the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Court of <hi>Paris</hi> doth accompany the Funeral Obsequies of those that have been their Kings, not in mourning attire, but in Scarlet, the true Ensign of the never dying Majesty of the Crown: Nevertheless certain Cities in <hi>France,</hi> not long since, alledged for themselves, that because they had not reputed <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth for their King, and professed Allegiance unto him, they were not to be adjudged Rebels; Whereupon the chief Lawyers of our Age did resolve, That forasmuch as they were original Subjects, even Subjects by Birth, they were Rebels in bearing Arms against their King, although they had never professed Allegiance unto him.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Chapter, I shall give you a View of the Ceremonies of the Creation of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which began on the Thirtieth of <hi>May,</hi> 1610. as followeth; The Prince accompanied with divers young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, together with his own Servants, rode from his Court at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> where he reposed that night; on the next day the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, with the several Companies in their Barges at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Highness about <hi>Barn Elmes,</hi> where he was entertained with a Banquet, and in other places with Speeches by a <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> upon a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and a <hi>Sea Goddess</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Whale,</hi> &amp;c. His Highness landing at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> was received by the Officers of his Majesties Houshold, according to order, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Knight Marshal and the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Porter; In the Hall by the Treasurer and Comptroller of the Houshold; in the great Chamber by the Captain of the Guard, and in the presence Chamber by the Lord Chamberlain; from whence he went into the Privy Chamber, where the King and Queen met him; the Saturday after was taken up with the usual Ceremonies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Knights of the Bath to attend his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at his Creation, which were Five and twenty in number.</p>
                     <p>Upon Monday following these Knights of the Bath met in the Queens Closet, where they put on long Purple Satten Robes, lined with white Taffata, and a Hood like a Batchelor of Law about their Necks; and in a Barge prepared for them went before the Prince to <hi>Westminster Palace,</hi> where his Highness landed, and proceeded to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus:

The Patent being read, the King kist him on the Cheek, and the Earl Marshal, with the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, placed him in his Parliament Seat, <hi>viz.</hi> on the left hand of the King; which Ceremony being ended, they returned to the Palace Bridge in manner as followeth.</p>

They took Barge at the Palace Stairs, and landed at <hi>Whitehall Bridge,</hi> where the Officers at Arms, the Members of Parliament, and the Lords being first landed, attended the King and Prince, and went before into the Hall, and so into his

                     <p>THE Title and Degree of a Duke hath been of ancienter standing in the Empire, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, than amongst us; for the first English Duke was <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince, created Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi> by his Father King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; by which Creation, according to the Tenure of his Patent, the Firstborn Sons of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are Dukes of <hi>Cornwall</hi>: Nor is there any Creation required for the said Honour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is for Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> A Duke is said to be so called <hi>Ã  Ducendo,</hi> from lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; being at the first always a Leader of an Army Imperial or Regal, and was so chosen in the Field, either by casting of Lots, or by common Voice; and the <hi>Saxons</hi> called this Leader an <hi>Hertzog</hi>: but now, and for some time past, it is a Dignity given by Kings and Princes to men of great Blood and excellent Merit. In some Countries, at this day, the Soveraign Princes are called Dukes; as the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the like.</p>

                        <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in the third year of his Reign, by his Charter in Parliament, and by Authority of Parliament did create <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his eldest Son, called the <hi>black Prince,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi> not only in Title, but <hi>cum feodo</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> as by the Letters Patents may appear in <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>Eighth Part</hi> in the Pleadings, <hi>Habendum &amp; tenendum eidem Duci, &amp; ipsius, &amp; haeredum suorum, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> Angliae, <hi>filiis Primogenitis, &amp; dicti loci Ducibus, in Regno</hi> Angliae <hi>ei haereditarie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessuris</hi>: So that he who is hereditable must be Heir apparent to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and of such a King who is Heir to the said Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and such a one shall inherit the said Dukedom; which manner of limitation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state was short and excellent, varying from the ordinary Rules of the Common Law, touching the framing of any Estate of Inheritance in Fee-simple, or Fee-tayl; and nevertheless, by the Authority of Parliament, a special Fee-simple is in that case only made, as by Judgment may appear in the Book aforesaid, <hi>fol.</hi> 27. and 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.41. <hi>b.</hi> And ever since that Creation, the said Dukedom of <hi>Cornwall</hi> hath been the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Inheritance of the King's eldest Son, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the King his Father, so that he is ever <hi>Dux natus, non creatus</hi>; and the Duke at the very time of his Birth is taken to be of full and perfect Age, so that he may send that day for his Livery of the said Dukedom. And the said black Prince was the first Duke of <hi>England</hi> after the Conquest: For though <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,</hi> who made his Book in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, saith, <hi>&amp; sunt sub rege Duces</hi> (as appeareth) that place is to be understood of the ancient Kings before the Conquest: For in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which was made in the Ninth of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, we find not the name <hi>Duke</hi> amongst the Peers and Nobles there mentioned; for seeing the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings themselves were Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> for a great while, they adorned none with this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And the eldest Son of every King, after his Creation, was Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi>: as for example; <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> eldest Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windsor,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> eldest Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> eldest son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Hampton,</hi> first Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. But <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who was the first Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince, was not Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> by force of the said Creation: For albeit, after the death of his Father he was Heir apparent to the Crown; yet because he was not the Firstbegotten Son of a King (for his Father died in the life of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third) the said <hi>Richard</hi> was not within the limitation of the Grant and Creation by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament made in the Eleventh of King <hi>Edward</hi> aforesaid; and therefore to supply that defect, in the Fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, he was created Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> by special Charter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldest Daughter of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, was not a Dutchess of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> although she was the Firstbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; for the Limitation is to the First-begotten Son. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was not in the life of his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, after the death of his eldest Brother <hi>Arthur,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> by force of the said Creation; for although he was sole Heir apparent, yet he was not his eldest begotten Son.</p>
                        <p>And the Opinion of <hi>Stamford,</hi> a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judge, hath been, That he shall have within his Dukedom of <hi>Cornwall</hi> the King's Prerogative, because it is not severed from the Crown after the form as it is given; for none shall be Inheritor thereof but the King's of the Realm: For example; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by Common Law, if a man hold divers Mannors, or other Lands or Tenements of divers Lords, all by Knights Service, some part by Priority and ancient Feoffment, and other Land by Posterity and a later Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Tenant so seized dieth, and his Son and Heir within Age, in this case the custody and wardship of the Body, and his marriage may not be divided amongst all the Lords, but one of them only shall have right unto it (because the Body of a man is intire). And therefore the Law doth say, That the Lord, of whom some part of those Lands are holden by Priority, and by the same Tenure of Chivalry, shall have it, except the King be any of the Lords; for then though the Tenant did purchase that Land last, yet after his death the King shall be preferred before any of the other Lords of whom the Tenant did hold the Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And so shall the Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> in the same Case have the Prerogative, if his Tenant die, holding of him but by poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Feoffment for any Tenure of his Dutchy of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> although the same Duke is not seized of any particular Estate, whereof the Reversion remaineth in the King; for the Prince is seized in Fee of his Dukedom, as beforesaid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50041:29"/>
                           <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the fourth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, took to Wife <hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> who had Issue <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; so that the said Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster</hi> did come unto the said <hi>Henry</hi> by descent from the party of his Mother; and being a Subject, he was to observe the Common Law of the Realm in all things concerning his Dutchy. For if he would depart in Fee with any thereof, he must have made Livery and Seisin; or if he had made a Lease for life, reserving Rent with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry for default of payment, and the Rent happen to be behind, the Duke might not enter without making his Demand; or if he had alienated any part thereof whilst he was within Age, he might defeat the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser for that Cause; and if he would grant a Reversion of an Estate for life or years in being, there must also be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornment, or else the Grant doth not take effect.</p>
                        <p>But after that he had deposed King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, and did assume the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Estate, and so had conjoyned his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body in the Body Politick of the King of this Realm, and so was become King; then the possession of the Dutchy of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> was in him as King, but not as Duke, which degree of Dignity was swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in that of the King; for the lesser must always give place to the greater. And likewise the Name of the Dutchy, and the Franchises, Liberties, and Jurisdictions thereof, when in the King's Hands, were by the Common Law extinct; and after that time the possessions of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster</hi> could not pass from <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth by Livery of Seisin; but by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents under the Great Seal, without Livery of Seisin, and with Attornment. And if he make a Lease for Life, being Duke, reserving a Rent with a Re-entry for default of payment; and after his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the Crown, his Rent happen to be unpaid, he might Re-enter without Demand; for the King is not bound to such personal Ceremonies as his Subjects are.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to have the said Dutchy to be still a Dutchy with the Liberties to the same, as it was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>ore, and to alter the order and degree of the Lands of the Dutchy from the Crown; the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth made a Charter by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, which is entituled <hi>Charta Regis Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>de separatione Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striae Ã  corona authoritate Parliamenti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Regni sui primo,</hi> as by the Tenor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may appear. And so by Authority of that Parliament, the said Dutchy, with all the Franchises and Liberties was meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed from the Crown, and from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Officers thereof, and from the Order, to pass by such Conveyance which the Law did require in the possessions of the Crown. But now the possessions of the Dutchy by force of the said Statute, stood divided from the Crown, and ought to be demeaned and ordered, and pass as they did before <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was King; yet there is no Clause in the Charter which doth make the person of the King (who hath the Dutchy) in any other Degree than it was before.</p>
                        <p>But things concerning his pleasure shall be in the same estate as they were before such separation: insomuch, as if the Law before the Charter, by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, adjudged the person of the King always of full Age, having regard unto his Gifts, as well of the Lands which he doth inherit in the right of his Crown, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, it shall be so adjudged for the Dutchy Land after the said Statute; for the Statute doth go and reach unto the Estate, Order, and Condition of the Lands of the Dutchy, but doth not extend unto the person of the King, who hath the Lands in points touching his person. Neither doth that distinguish, or alter the preheminences which the Law doth give to the person of the King: For if King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, after the said Act had made a Lease, or other Grant of parcel of the Dutchy, by the Name of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> only, it had been void; for it should have been made in the Name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus stood the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster</hi> severed from the Crown, all the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, being politickly made for the upholding of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> their true and ancient Inheritance; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the right Heir to the Crown might, in future time, obtain his right thereunto (as it happened in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's time:) but after the said King <hi>Edward</hi> obtained his right unto the Crown, in Parliament he attainted <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and appropriated and annexed the said Dutchy again to the Crown, as by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute thereof made in the first of the King's Reign it doth appear. By which Statute three things were ordained: First, The County Palatine of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was again e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished: Secondly, He did invest it in the Body Politick of the King's of this Realm: And thirdly, He did divide it from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Crown Land. And in this form it continued until <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who forthwith (being descended from the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) did separate it only in Order and Government from the Crown, and so it continueth at this day.</p>

                     <p>A Marquiss, which by the <hi>Saxons</hi> is called <hi>Marken-Reue,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Governor or Ruler of the <hi>Marches,</hi> hath the next place of Honour to a Duke. This Title came to us but of late days; for the first was <hi>Robert Vere,</hi> who was created Marquiss of <hi>Dublin</hi> by King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and from that time it became to be a Title of Honour; for in former time those that Governed the <hi>Marches</hi> were commonly called <hi>Lord Marchers,</hi> and not <hi>Marquisses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Normans</hi> had conquered this Land, it was by them carefully observed, as a matter of great moment, to place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Confines and Borders of the <hi>Britains</hi> (and those not then subdued) men of much Valour; such that were not only sufficient to encounter the Inrodes and Invasions of the Enemy, but also ready upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to make onset upon them for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Conquest. These men thus placed were of high Blood and Reputation amongst their Countrey-men, the <hi>Normans,</hi> and in whose Faith the Conqueror reposed special Trust and Confidence: And therefore in their Territories given unto them to hold, their Tenures were devised to be very special, and of great importance and honour, enriched with Name and Priviledges of Earl of <hi>Chester</hi>; and so the North-border of <hi>Wales</hi> created to a County Palatine; and the Barons of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part of the South Marches were adorned in a manner with a Palatine Jurisdiction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and Writs only amongst themselves pleadable, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that their Attendance might not thence be drawn for the prosecuting of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies or Quarrels in the Law. And as for the other part of the South Marches, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be sufficiently fenced with the River <hi>Severn</hi> and the Sea.</p>
                     <p>A Marquiss is created <hi>per gladii cinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, &amp; circuli aurei suo capiti positionem.</hi> He is honoured with a Coronet of Gold, which is part flowered, and part pyramidal, with the points and flowers, or leaves of an equal height.

                     <head>OF EARLES. CHAP. VI.</head>
                     <p>THE next Degree of Honour is an Earl, which Word and Title came from the <hi>Saxons</hi>: For it is observed, That originally within this Realm, in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent English-Saxon Government, Earldomes of Counties were not only Dignities of Honour, but Offices of Justice, having the charge and custody of the County whereof they were Earls; and for their Assistance, had their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, called <hi>Vicecomes</hi>: which Office is now managed by Sheriffs, each County having his Sheriff Annually chosen out of the eminent Inhabitants thereof under the Degree of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles Majores.</hi> And the Earls, in recompence of their Travels concerning the Affairs of the County, then received a Salary, <hi>viz.</hi> a third peny of the Profits of the County; which Custome continued a long time after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and was inserted as a Princely Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their Patents of Creation (as by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ancient Patents may appear) which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were turned into Pensions for the better support of that Honour, as appeareth by a Book-Case 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 28. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in respect of such Pensions, or such other Gratuities given in lieu thereof, some men have not without probability thereof imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>quod Comites nominabantur, quia Ã  multis fisci Regii socii &amp; Comites eidem participes essent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Earl</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi> was called <hi>Erlig</hi> or <hi>Ethling</hi>; by the <hi>Germans Graves,</hi> as <hi>Lantgrave, Palsgrave, Margrave, Rhein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and the like; and by the <hi>Dutch</hi> was called <hi>Eorle</hi>: But upon the coming in of the <hi>Normans</hi> they were called <hi>Comes,</hi> or <hi>Comites,</hi> that is, <hi>Counts</hi>; and for Gravity in Council, they are called <hi>Comes Illustris, a Comitando Principem.</hi> And as Earls for their Vertues and Heroical Qualities are reputed Princes, or Companions for Princes: so ought they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themselves answerable to the said Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well in their Attendance and Noble House-keeping, as otherwise.</p>
                     <p>The Dignity of Earl is of divers kinds, and is either local or personal: Local, as from the denomination of some place: and Personal, as being in some great Office, as Earl-Marshal, and the like. Those Local are also Palatine and Simplices. Those that are Palatine, or Count Palatine, are <hi>Chester, Lancaster,</hi> and the Bishopricks of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain some of the ancient Priviledges allowed them by the <hi>Saxons. Hugh Lupus,</hi> who was the first Hereditary Earl, had the County Palatine of <hi>Chester</hi> given him by the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who governed it Forty years, in which time he created eight Barons, and had <hi>Iura Regalia</hi> within the County.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50041:45"/>Of Earls not <hi>Palatine,</hi> which is as ancient as the Conquest, there have been principally two kinds, but either of them subdivided into several Branches; for they either take name of a place, or hold their Title without any place. Those that take their Name of a place are of two kinds; for either the place is the County, as the Earl of <hi>Devonshire, Kent, Middlesex,</hi> or the like; or else some Town, Castle, or Honour; as the Earldom of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire, Clarence</hi> in <hi>Suffolk, Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> in <hi>Suffex, Bathe</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersetshire,</hi> and so forth. And those Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which have their Titles without any place, are likewise of two kinds, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Office, or by Birth: By Office, as the Earl-Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Marascallus Angliae,</hi> and is an Office not only of great power, being in the Vacancy of the Lord High Constable of <hi>England</hi> the King's Lieutenant General in all Marshal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but of as great Honour, taking place of all Earls, except the Lord Great Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> and is likewise endowed with many honourable priviledges. This Title of Earl-Marshal was by K. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second first given to <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earl of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (whereas before they were simply styled Marshals) and after the Banishment of <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> he granted it to <hi>Thomas Holland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Surrey</hi>; and that he should carry a Rod or Verge of Gold enammeled black at both ends, whereas before they used one of Wood: This Office is now by his present Majesty restored to the ancient Family of the <hi>Howards</hi> Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for ever, and is enjoyed by the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Baron <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Castle-Rising</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Heir apparent to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other sort of Earls are by Birth, and so are all the Sons of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> if they have no other Dignity bestowed upon them: And therefore it was said that <hi>Iohn,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>England,</hi> in the life time of his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, was <hi>Comites sans terre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Earls (as other Degrees of Nobility) are Offices of great Trust, being created by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for two principal purposes; one <hi>ad consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum Regi in tempore pacis</hi>; the other <hi>ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendum Regem &amp; Patriam in tempore bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi> And therefore Antiquity hath given them two Ensigns to resemble both the said Duties: For first, the Head is adorned with a Cap of Honour, and a Coronet of Gold, which for distinction is pyramidal, pointed, and pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, between each pyramid a Flower much shorter th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>n the pyramid: And the Body is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Robes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Hood, Surcoat, and Mantle of State, with three guards of Fur upon the Shoulders; which Robe is an emblem of Counsel: and they are begirt with a Sword in resemblance of that they must be faithful and true to defend their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>An Earl had formerly the Title of Prince; but now it is Most Potent and Noble Lord, as also The Right Honourable and truly Noble. Out of his Superiors presence he may have a Cloth of Estate fringed without pendants; and his Countess may have her Train born up by an Esquire's Wife.</p>
                     <p>But to the King's high Council of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no man ought to presume to come before he hath received the King's Writ of Summons. This Constitution was first made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, after the Barons War was appeas'd, and by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and his Successors, it hath been carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. The form of a Writ of Summons to an Earl, is as followeth:

                     <p>After a man is created an Earl, Viscount, or any other Title of Honour above his Title, it is become parcel of his Name; and not an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only, but in all legal Proceedings he ought to be styled by that his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>In the first of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>fol.</hi> 151. a Writ of <hi>Formedon</hi> was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Richard</hi> Son of <hi>Alleyn,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and did demand the Mannor of <hi>C.</hi> with the Appurtenances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Tenant by his Learned Counsel, did plead that he was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50041:45"/>
Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and was at the day of the Writ purchased, and demanded Judgment of the Writ, because he was not named in the Writ according to his Dignity and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Honour. To which the Demandant saith, That at that time, when he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Writ, the Tenant was not known nor taken to be an Earl, and it is severe Justice if the Writ shall abate without any default in the Plaintiff: nevertheless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the truth of the matter was so, that the Earldom did descend unto him before the Plaintiff had commenced his Action, and purchased his Writ against him; therefore by Judgment his Writ was abated, although the Tenant was not at that time known to be an Earl. But if a Baron be Plaintiff or Defendant, it is not of necessity to name him Baron, 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 10. yet see a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Barons concerning this matter, here following: And so <hi>Reginald Gray</hi> was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Esquire after the Earldom descended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, till at last it was published and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Queen, and the Heralds, that he was Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in Right, and by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, although he was not reputed or named Earl before that time.</p>
                     <p>But an addition may be used, or omitted at pleasure, except in special Cases where Processes of style of <hi>Supremum Caput Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Anglicanae,</hi> which by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and in the 35<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. was annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm. It is no part of the King's style, so that it may be omitted in the Summons of Parliament at pleasure; and so it is adjudged and declared by Parliament in the First and Second of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> and <hi>Mary, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 156.</p>
                     <p>But not between the Majestical Style of the King, and the Title of Honour apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a Subject; this difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Grants or Purchases made by or to a Nobleman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in that first case it is necessary that the Name [<hi>King</hi>] be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, otherwise they are void. But if a Duke, Earl, or other Degree of Nobility, do Purchase or Grant, by the Name of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and Surname, or other Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it is not void; for it is a Rule in Law, That every man's Grant shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued most to the benefit of him to whom the said Grant is made, that it may rather be strengthened than made void; for there is a great diversity in the Law between Writs and Grants: For if Writs are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally made, they shall be abated, which is only the loss of the same; but if a Grant should be made void, then the party hath no remedy to have a new one, and for that cause the Law doth not favour Advantages by occasion of false Latin, or such like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
                     <p>And if an Earl be Plaintiff or Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and having the Writ, shall not abate; but nevertheless he shall proceed, and count by the Name of an Earl, according to such Title of Honour as he did bear at the time of the Commencement of his Action.</p>

                     <head>OF THE Lords Spiritual. CHAP. VIII.</head>
                     <p>ACCORDING to the Laws and Customes of this Realm, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the Ecclesiastical Dignities and Priviledges belonging to the Bishops and Clergymen, who in all succeeding Ages have been reverenced with the greatest observance imaginable, as being acknowleded by all good Christians to be those Messengers sent, and particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to take care of our Souls.</p>
                     <p>The Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are either Clergy or Laymen, both which are subdivided into Nobility and Commons. Thus we find in our Parliament the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral make the Upper House; the Commons Spiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clergy elected to sit in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (who once had place and suffrage in the Lower House of Parliament) and the Commons Temporal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knights and Burgesses make the Commons.</p>
                     <p>Most evident it is, by the Consent of all the Councils, Fathers, Histories, and Universal Tradition, That for the first Fifteen hundred years continuance of Christianity, there is no Example to be found of any Church governed by any Authority Ecclesiastick but that of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; they were ordained by the Apostles themselves to be their Successors in Christ's Church, to have a vigilant eye over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers under them, as to their Lives and Doctrine, for the preservation of Truth and Peace, the prevention of Scandal, suppression of Heresie and Schism, and to have a care of their Flock, to bring them to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis not therefore without reason that in all times they have been the first of the two Divisions of the people, the Clergy and Laity; and as Spiritual Barons take place of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; they take their name from the Saxon word <hi>Biscoep,</hi> a Super-intendent or Overseer.</p>
                     <p>They are three ways Barons of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> by Writ, Patent, and Consecration. They precede all under the Degree of Viscounts, and are always placed upon the King's right hand in the Parliament House. They have the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Lords, and Right Reverend Fathers in God: And their Sees, by the piety of former times, are endowed with fair Revenues for the due administration of what belongs to their places: And to keep them from corrupt and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister affections, the King's most Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, and the Ancestors of the Nobility and Gentry, have sufficiently endowed the Church with Honour and Possessions.</p>
                     <p>Many Priviledges and Immunities were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise granted to them, and the Clergy, by the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Kings; as coyning of Money, conferring the Order of Knighthood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hath been long since appropriate to the Crown. Thus <hi>Laufranck,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> made <hi>William</hi> the Second Knight in the life time of his Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50041:52"/>Of Priviledges remaining, some belong to to the Archbishops; some to the Bishops, as they are so; and some to them, and all other of the Clergy.</p>
                     <p>We read of three Archbishopricks in <hi>England</hi> before the <hi>Saxons</hi> came amongst us; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>London, York,</hi> and <hi>Carleon</hi> upon <hi>Vske</hi>: But Christianity being thence expelled, by the Pagans, the succession of those Sees ceased, till it pleased God to restore the Light of his Gospel to the blind <hi>Saxons</hi> (which in this Kingdom had planted themselves) by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who first preached Salvation to them at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was there buried, for whose sake they removed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal See from <hi>London</hi> unto <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and in process of time placed another Archbishop at <hi>

                     <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the Metropolitan of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and the Isles adjacent; and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sometime styled a Patriarch, and had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Archbishops under him: His style was, <hi>Alterius orbis Papa, &amp; orbis Britannici Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex:</hi> The Date of Records in Ecclesiastical Affairs ran thus, <hi>Anno Pontificatus nostri primo, &amp;c.</hi> He was <hi>Legatus Natus</hi>; which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was annexed to that See near One thousand years ago, whereby no other Legat or Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio from <hi>Rome</hi> could exercise any Legantive power without the King's special Licence. In General Councils he had place before all other Archbishops at the Pope's right Foot: Nor was he respected less at home than abroad, being according to the practise of most other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian States, reputed the second person in the Kingdom, and named and ranked before the Princes of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>By the favour of our present King he still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys divers considerable preheminences; as Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England</hi>; hath power to summon the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Bishops of his Province to a National Synod; is <hi>primus par Regni,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding not only Dukes, but all the Great Officers of the Crown, next to the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He is styled by the King, <hi>Dei Gratia Archiopiscopus Cantuarii</hi>: Writes himself <hi>Divina Providentia,</hi> as doth the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>; (other Bishops write <hi>Divina per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missione</hi>:) and hath the Title of <hi>Grace</hi> given him, (as it is to Dukes;) and <hi>Most Reverend Father in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Office is to Crown the King; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Court shall happen to be, 'tis said the King and Queen are <hi>Speciales Domestici Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiani Domini Archiepisc. Cant.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London</hi> is accounted his Provincial Dean; the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> his Chaplain. He hath the power of all the probate of Wills, and granting Letters of Administration where the party hath <hi>bona notabilia,</hi> that is Five pounds worth, or above, out of the Diocess wherein he dieth; or Ten pounds worth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Diocess of <hi>London.</hi> By Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 25. he hath power to grant Licences, Dispensations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and holds divers Courts of Judicature; <hi>viz.</hi> his Courts of Arches, of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, his Prerogative Court, and his Court of Peculiars: And he may retain, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie eight Chaplains, which is more by two than a Duke can do.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> was also <hi>Legatus Natus,</hi> and had that Authority annexed to his See. He had all the Bishopricks of <hi>Scotland</hi> under his Province till the year 1470. He hath the place and precedency of all Dukes, not of the Royal Blood, and of all great Officers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He hath the Title of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Most Reverend Father in God</hi>: He hath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Crown the Queen, and to be her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Chaplain. He is also styled Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and Metropolitan of his Province. He hath the Rights of a County Palatine over <hi>Hexamshire</hi> in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> He may qualifie Chaplains; and hath divers other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives which the Archbishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath within his own Province; but <hi>Durham</hi> being one, hath in many things a peculiar Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, exempted from the Archbishop.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Priviledges belonging to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are as followeth.</head>
                        <p>IN their own Court they have power to judge and pass Sentence alone, without any Colleague, which is not done in any other Court: And therefore the Bishops send sorth their Citations in their own Names, not in the King's, as the Writs in other Courts run. They may depute their Authority to another (as doth the King) either to their Suffragan-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, their Chancellors, Commissaries, or other Officers, which none of the King's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es can do. In whatever Prince's Dominions they come, their Episcopal Dignity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is owned; they may confer Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas no Lay-lord is acknowledged but in the King's Dominions, who gave him the Title. None of them can be Indicted of any Crime before a Temporal Judge, without especial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from the King: A severe penalty to be inflicted on them that raise any Scandal or false Report. In a Tryal where a Bishop is Plaintiff or Defendant, the Bishop may, as well as any Lay-lord, challenge the Array, if one Knight at least be not returned upon the Jury. In Criminal Tryals for life, all Bishops are to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50041:52"/>
be tryed by their Peers, who are Barons, and none under that Degree to be impanelled: but anciently they were exempted from any Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Temporal Judges. In Parliament they may Vote in any thing, but in sentence for Life, or loss of Member, they being by Common Law to absent themselves; and by Common Law to make Proxies to Vote for them. They are freed from all Arrests, Outlawries, Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have liberty to hunt in any of the King's Forests or Parks, to take one or two Deer, coming or going from the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and to have Wine free from Impost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Persons may not be seized for Contempt but their Temporalities only; and their word only is to be taken, and their Certificate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Tryal of Bastardy, Heresie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And such respect has been shewed their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that an Offence by a Clergyman to his Bishop is called <hi>Episcopicide,</hi> and punished as Paracide, equal to petty Treason.</p>
                        <p>Every Bishop may qualifie as many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains as a Duke: They are all Barons and Peers of the Realm, and have place in the upper House of Parliament, as afore noted, and take place according to Seniority of their Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except <hi>London, Durham,</hi> and <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who precede by Statute made in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
                        <p>It will not be amiss to speak somewhat of the Immunities common to all Ecclesiasticks, as well Commons as Lords Spiritual, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                        <p>All Suffragan Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, Prebends, Rectors, and Vicars have priviledge, some by themselves, others by proxy, to sit and vote in the lower House of Convocation.</p>
                        <p>No Subsidy or other Tax can be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them without their own consent. No Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman may be compelled to undergo any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Service in the Commonwealth, nor to serve in the Wars, or to bear any servile Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. They are free from the King's Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Carriers, Posts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which they may demand a protection from the King, <hi>cum clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula nolumus.</hi> They are not obliged to appear at the Sheriffs Turns or Views of Frank pledge, nor are impanelled to serve upon Inquests at Assizes or elsewhere. If a Clergyman acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Statute, his Body shall not be taken thereupon; for the Writ runs, <hi>Si Laicus sit, &amp;c.</hi> Their Goods are discharged from Tolls and Customs (<hi>si non exerceant Merchandizas de eisdem</hi>;) but they must have the King's Writ to discharge them.</p>
                        <p>As the Clergymen are exempted from the Wars, being by reason of their Function, they are prohibited the wearing a Sword; so every man in the order of Priesthood is debarred the Order of Knighthood of the Sword, <hi>cum eorum militia sit contra mundum carnem &amp; diabolum,</hi> saith Sir <hi>Iohn Fern</hi>; yet laying aside their Cures, and also lying themselves to a secular life, they have been admitted. <hi>Dei natalin</hi> (saith <hi>Matth.

                     <head>OF BARONS. CHAP. IX.</head>
                     <p>AMONGST the Nobles and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Persons, Barons have the next place. And first, of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Degrees of a Baron in general: Secondly, of the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Name: Thirdly, of the Antiquity thereof, and of the divers uses in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Fourthly, of the Division, and the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the several kinds of Barons: And lastly, a Declaration of the divers and sundry Priviledges allowed them, and the rest of the Nobles, by the Laws of this Realm.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Definition or Description of a Baron.</head>
                        <p>IT is a certain Rule in Law, <hi>Definitiones in jure sunt periculosissimae; earum est enim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                              </gap> non subverti possunt</hi>; and therefore I do not often find any Definition or Description of a Baron delivered by Writers: nevertheless in this our Kingdom, it is my Opinion, that a Baron may be described in a generality, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable unto every special kind thereof in this manner.</p>
                        <p>A Baron is a Dignity of Nobility and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour next unto the Viscount: And the Books of Law do make a difference between Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, and Viscounts, which are allowed Names of Dignity, and the Baron; for they affirm, That such a Baron need not to be named <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Baron</hi> by his Writ; but the Duke, Marquiss, Earl, or Viscount, ought to be named by their Names of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cambden, fol.</hi> 1692. saith, <hi>That our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws do not allow a Baron one of the Degrees of Nobility:</hi> But I take it to be understood of Barons by Tenure, or Barons by Writ only: For the Title of a Baron by Patent is in his Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> adorned by the name of <hi>Status, Gradus, Dignitas</hi>; and therefore is requisite to be named: And such Dignities are a parcel of the Name of the Pohenor, as well as the Title and Style of a Duke, Marquiss, Earl, or Viscount. And although there may be conceived this Difference last mentioned between the Baron by Tenure or Writ, and the Baron by Patent; yet they being all Members of the higher House of Parliament, they are thereby equally made Noble, Honourable, and Peers of the Realm, as they are Barons, without any other distinction.</p>

                        <p>MAny Writers have laboured to place the Etymology and signification of this word, wherein (following too much their own Fantasies) they have bred much variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Opinion.

                     <head>CHAP. X. Barons by Tenure.</head>
                     <p>BArons by Tenure are those, which do hold any Honour, Castle, or Mannor, as the head of their Barony <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> which is Grand Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>eanty. And those Barons by Tenure are of two sorts, Barons Spiritual by Tenure, and Barons Temporal by Tenure. Of Barons Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual by Tenure sufficient is said, whereunto may be added, That it appeareth by all the ancient Writers of our Law, as <hi>Brittan, Glanvile, Bracton,</hi> and the rest, that the Archbishops and Bishops of the Realm in the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> days, as well during the time that the Realm was divided into divers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as also after the uniting of them into one Monarchy, were called to Parliament or Assemblies of State as Wisemen; not so much in respect of their Tenure, for in those days all their Tenures were by a Frank Almoigne; but especially for that the Laws and Counsels of men are then most currant and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and have a more blessed Issue and Success, where they are grounded upon the Law of God, the Root and Beginning of all true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom And therefore our wise and religious Ancestors called to their General Council, or <hi>Wittengemote,</hi> or Court of Wisemen (as they called it) those chief and principal persons of the Clergy, which by their places and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, by their Gravities, Learning and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, might best advise them what was the Law of God's acceptable will and pleasure, that they might frame Laws answerable, or at least wise not contrary and repugnant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                     <p>And touching the Temporal Barons by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, mention is made of them in the Books of Law, Records, and ancient Monuments of the Realm; and these Baronies were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncertain, and rentable at the pleasure of the King. But such incertainty was brought to certainty by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, chap.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bracton</hi> doth make express mention of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Temporal by Tenure; it shall be needful here again to remember the former assertion of <hi>Bracton,</hi> That the head of a Barony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to Daughters should not be divided by partition, which argueth likewise the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Barony. But let us descend to other Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> the Book-Case in the 48 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 30. Sir <hi>Ralph Everdon's</hi> Case; by which Case of Law 'tis most evidently proved that there are Barons by Tenure, which in regard of such their Tenure, ought to be summoned to Parliament. And furthermore, That there were or are Barons by Tenure, read the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Westminster</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 41. where the Fees of the Earl-Marshal and the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain are expressed, which are to be taken by them upon the Homage done of every Baron by Tenure, whether the Baron holdeth by a whole Barony, or by a less.</p>
                     <p>But here ariseth a Question; If a Baron by Tenure alien and grant away the Honour, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and Mannor holden by Barony, whether shall such Alien or Grauntee take upon him the State, Title, and Dignity of a Baron, or not? Or what shall become of such Dignity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage after such Alienation and Grant made? They which do deny that there are any such Baronies by Tenure, do use these as their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Motives or Reasons: First, If there be any Baronies by Tenure, then the Alience or Grantee of such Honour, Castle, and Mannor so holden, must hold by the same Tenure that his Grantor or Feoffer before held; but that was by Barony, therefore such Grantee must hold by Barony: And if such Grant or Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be made to persons Vulgar or Ignoble, then should such Tenure be made Noble, which were very absurd, and full of inconveniency; for <hi>Ornanda potius est dignitate domus, quam ex domo dignitas, utcunque quibus quaerenda est, ab iis honestanda. Milles peroration.</hi> 3. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is very evident and manife, stthat many ancient Mannors, which in old time were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Baronage, and were the head of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, are now in the Tenures of mean Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and others, who neither may, nor do challenge unto themselves in any respect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any Nobility, without the great favour of the King's most Excellent Majesty, who is the Fountain of all Honour within his Dominions. Thirdly, Some ancient Barons there are that have aliened and sold many of those Castles and Mannors which did bear the Name and Dignity of Baronage; and yet themselves do still retain, and lawfully keep their Estate, Dignity and Degree of Baron, and have been, and usually are, such Alienations notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, summoned nevertheless to the Parliament, and there do take and hold their ancient place accordingly.</p>
                     <p>To these Objections it shall be convenient, for the more easie unfolding the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ate of this Question, to exhibit certain necessary distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and upon them to draw true and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conclusions; and then to prove them by authority of Law, consent of Time, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Presidents: which done, the Answer will be presently made (as I conceive) to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the aforesaid Objections.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, If a Baron by Tenure, which holdeth any Castle, Honour, or Mannor by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage, do Alien o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> give the same away, he doth it either with or without a Licence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from his Majesty for the same. If he doth it without a Licence, then the Conclusion is certain. But by the Laws of this Realm the Barony, Honour, Castle, or Mannor so aliened
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50041:64"/>
without licence or consent, is for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>eited; and the same Honour, Castle, and Mannor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Barony, and so aliened, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>e seized in the King's hands; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>aid Forfeiture, and such Dignity and Estate no longer to be born and continue, but to be resumed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished in the Crown, from whence it was derived.</p>
                     <p>The reason therefore is notable, if we call to remembrance that which was formerly alledged out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> That Baronies are the strength of the Realm, and suffer no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they suffer also no alienation without the consent or licence of the Sovereign Monarch; for so should the Realm be infeebled, and base persons ennobled without desert of Vertue or Prowess: For where the thing so aliened is an Honour or Head of a Barony, it differeth much from the ordinary Tenure <hi>in Capite,</hi> whereof, if the Tenant make Alienation without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he is only to pay a Fine by the Statute of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. whereof also before the making of the Statute, there was diversity of Opinions at the Common Law after the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 31. And for further proof see <hi>Glanvile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, certain Lands being parcel of the Barony of <hi>Bremberway</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liened by <hi>William de Browse</hi> the Baron there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without the King's Licence, and in the Argument of the Case concerning the same, Judge <hi>Green</hi> delivered this for Law. First, That parcel of a Barony or Earldom of the King in chief cannot be aliened or dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred without his Licence; and if it be, it shall be seized, into the King's hands as forfeited, and the King shall be seized thereof in his own right again. In 43 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it was found by an Office, that <hi>William</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> had leased unto one <hi>Iohn Preston,</hi> for his Life, a Mannor which was parcel of the Mannor of the said Bishoprick without Licence, and it was resolved by the Judges, and others of the King's Council, That the same was forfeited; but by mediation of the said Council the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop submitted himself to the King, and made a Fine, and several <hi>Scire Facias</hi>'s issued out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that had received the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>its, to answer unto the King thereof. And thus much concerning Alienations of Baronies without Licence.</p>
                     <p>But on the other part, if a Baron by Tenure who holds any Honour, Castle, or Mannor by Barony, do grant or alien the same by Licence, I must again distinguish: for either such Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is made for the continuance of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, Honour, Lands, and Tenements in his own Name, Blood, and Issue Male; or else the same Alienation is made for Money or other Recompence, or otherwise to a meer Stranger: and hereof ensueth this second Conclusion or Assertion, That if such Alienation be made for the continuance of his Barony in his Name and Blood, or Issue Male (as many have made the like) then may such Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ue Male, together with the Barony (be it Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>e, Honour, or Mannor so hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>n) hold, and law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ully enjoy the Name, Style, Title and Dignity of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
                     <p>Moreover concerning the second Objection, It is very true that many ancient Mannors which were in times past holden by Barony, are now in the hands of Gentlemen, mean and ignoble by blood, who neither do, or may claim any Nobility or Honour thereby. But there hath been some former Gifts made by the King's Progenitors to such as they honoured in augmentation and support of their Honour, and for honourable Services, should thus come to the hands of mean personages, are twosold: First, For that such Mannors have been alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Licence unto such persons before spoken, of whom such Possessions alone cannot make Noble. Secondly, And that was usually such Mannors as were in ancient time holden by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, that have upon divers occasions come to the Crown, were extinct; and after the same Lands were given or conveyed to others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving other Services than those which at the first were due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>or the same, so that it was no marvel that some Mannors anciently holden by Barony, or other honourable Service, should now be holden in Soccage, or by other mean Tenure.</p>
                     <p>As to that which was thirdly Objected, That some ancient Barons there are which have ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and sold away those Castles and Mannors of which they have and do bear the Name and Dignity, and yet still themselves do retain and lawfully keep the Dignity and Degree of a Baron, and have been, and are called to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament notwithstanding such alienation.</p>
                     <p>To that I Answer, That it is true; but it proveth nothing against the former Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore for better satisfaction of this point, it is to be considered, that either such Barons are original Barons by Writ, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by Tenure. Barons by Writ (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect now in hand) are of two kinds; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such Writ whereby they are, or their Ancestors were first summoned, they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named by their own Names, or else there was addition given them of the principal place of their abode, which was done for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake, either to sever them from some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable person of the same Name; or else to give them such honourable Title by addition of the place, which place notwithstanding was not holden by Barony: And therefore if such a Baron do alien away that place which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently his Seat, he may nevertheless retain his honourable Title, no respect had of such place.</p>
                     <p>But if a Baron by Tenure do alien away the Honour, Castle, or Mannor holden by Barony unto a mean person not capable of Honour, and by sufficient Licence so to do; and after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienor which made such Alienation, be called
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50041:65"/>
by Writ to Parliament under the Title, or as a Baron to such Honour, Castle, or Mannor so aliened that away which he held by Barony. But thenceforth, after such Writ of Summons he is become a Baron by Writ, such Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notwithstanding, forasmuch as the Writ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth at the pleasure of the Prince, doth give unto him that Addition of Name and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>And thus much touching the Resolution of the said Question, and satisfaction of the said Objections, and of Barons by Tenure.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. Barons by VVrit, which is the second kind of Barons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the former Division of Barons.</head>
                     <p>A Baron by Writ, is he unto whom a Writ of Summons, in the Name of the King, is directed, to come to the Parliament appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a certain time and place to be holden, and there with his Majesty, the Prelates, and Nobility, to treat and advise about the weighty affairs of the Nation; which Writ is much to the effect of the aforementioned Writ in the Title of Earl, and which kind of Writ is as well directed to the Barons of Tenure, as by Creation by Patents: But those that are not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by Tenure, nor by Patent, and have only such Writs, after the receipt of such Writ, and place taken in Parliament accordingly, ought to enjoy the Name and Dignity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Antiquity of Barons by Writ only, and the first institution thereof, I find little or no mention before the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; and therefore I conceive that either the first, or at least the first frequent use of such Barons was had, and devised 49 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. in case of necessity, and upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable occasion: For in the disorder between the King and his Nobility in those troublesome Wars, where Seditions and Rebellions were stirred up by them against the said King, there were many great Battels fought, to the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of much Blood, of which said Rebellions the Right Honourable <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> was Ring-leader for the Defence of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties (as pretended) granted by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and Charter of the Forest (which are even to this day the principal Grounds of the positive Law, and are the most ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes now in use amongst us) And for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of other Constitutions and Ordinances then made at <hi>Oxford</hi>: And after divers Fields sought betwixt them at <hi>Northampton, Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Lewes,</hi> and other places; last of all was the Catastrophe of that Tragedy finished at <hi>Eveshalm</hi> or <hi>Easam</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> where the said Earl was slain, the King gained the Victory, and the rebellious Barons received their overthrow: Upon which presently ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Parliament holden at <hi>Winchester</hi> in <hi>Hantshire,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where such of the Barons as were slain in the Field against the King, and such others of them as were taken Prisoners, or made their escape by flight, were to be attainted, and disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their Estates. And the Number of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons who had continued faithful unto their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign being small, it was deemed a necessary policy, to supply the number of the diminished Barons with other persons of known worth, wisdom, and repute; by reason whereof there were called at those Parliaments the Abbots and Priors of the Realm, as well those that held not by Barons, as others; and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the most worthy Laity not holding by Barony; and these by means thereof were thenceforth Barons by Writ; but certain of the said Abbots and Priors, which held not by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, and thought it a burthen to their Houses, got themselves (upon Petition) afterwards to be exempted, as by divers Records thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the <hi>Chancery</hi> may appear.</p>
                     <p>This moreover is to be noted concerning the Writ of Summons to Parliament, that those Writs in form of their directions are divers, some directed by special Name of Barons, as <hi>Rex, &amp;c. Edmundo Baroni de Stafford, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanni Baroni de Graystock, Iohanni Baroni de Dudley, Edwardo Nevill Baroni Aberga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veny,</hi> as it was in the Reign of King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some other are summoned by Name of the party, with addition of the place (as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanni Strange de Knocking, Militi, Edwardo Gray de Groby, Militi, Iohanni le Scroop de Masham, Militi, Willielmo Souch de Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Militi</hi>) the chief Castle or Mannor of such Baron, which always stands afterwards for the head place of the Barony, whereof the said Baron and his Heirs shall be surnamed, and called, and shall continue that name of place, although he do alien away the same, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.) Some others are named with the Title of Lord, as Sir <hi>Hugh Bramsteed,</hi> by Writ of the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was styled <hi>Lord Veysey.</hi>

                     <p>But the Nature, Quality, and Addition of those Barons by Writ is aptly discovered by the debate of a Question moved often amongst men, and spoken of concerning the continuance and descent of a Barony by Writ; which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,

                        <p>First, <hi>Whether a Barony by Writ may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from the Ancestor to the Heir, or not?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Admit such a Barony may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, then, Whether it doth descend to the Heirs, although not so near as the Heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Admit it doth descend to the Heirs Female; then, Whether may the Husband of such an Heir Female take upon him the Name, Style, and Dignity of such a Barony in right of his Wife, or no?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those therefore that maintain the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that such a Barony shall not descend, do strengthen themselves with these or the like Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The first Argument, Whether a Barony by Writ may descend?</head>
                        <p>Nobility and Honour, which are given in respect of Wisdom, Connsel, and Advise, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend to any other person, or descend from one man to another; for it is a Rule in Law, That <hi>Privilegium personae personam sequitur, &amp; extinguitur cum persona</hi>: But such is the Dignity of a Baron; therefore it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that it should not descend from the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor to the Heir.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The second Argument.</head>
                        <p>Again, If the calling of the Parliament by Writ be the sufficient instrumental cause of such Nobility to the Ancestor, the not calling of the Heir is a loss of that Nobility: For if the Heir have defects of Nature in him, as Idiotsie, Frensie, Leprosie, or the like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is become unfit for Counsels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, for what reason should he enjoy that Dignity, whereof he is either unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or uncapable? for the effect hath no place where the cause faileth: and hereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that such Dignities of Baronies by Writ should not descend.</p>
                        <p>If on the contrary part, the Affirmation is thus proved. Honour, which is given in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Wisdom and Vertue of him on whom it was first bestowed, is not only a due recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for himself whilst he lived, but also a memorable Reward thereof to Posterity. The words of <hi>Cicero</hi> to this effect are most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>Homines bonos semper nobilitate favi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; quia utile republicae est nobiles esse &amp; homines dignos majoribus suis, &amp; quia va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere debet apud nos claros hujusmodi senes fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse, Ã¨ republica moveretur memoria &amp; mortuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Honor.</hi> Therefore this kind of Honour is Patrimonial and Hereditary; for things which are once granted unto a man by the King for his Honour, are not again to be returned to his loss and disgrace, or to his Heirs.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The second Argument.</head>
                        <p>Secondly, If the Infamy of the Father be a blot to the Posterity, as the Wiseman <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> affirmeth, The Children complain for an ungodly Father, they are reproved for his sake; and for that also the Law of the Realm doth corrupt the blood of the Posterity by and upon the Offence of the Ancestor; Reason would also be, that the Honour of the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor should be likewise Honour to the Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for contraries do also carry their contrary Reason. For the determination whereof 'tis to be noted, that diversity of Reason hath bred diversity of Opinion. Some there are that do speak, That the Dignity of a Baron by Writ is not discendable from the Ancestor unto the Heir, unless the Heir be likewise called by Writ to Parliament, and that then it becometh an Inheritance, and not before. But this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is repugnant to the nature of Descent, which for the most part doth carry a Patrimony descendable by act of Law presently upon the death of the Ancestor unto the Heir not at all. Wherefore the Custom of the Country, and the manifest Presidents do prove, that this kind of Baronies doth descend from the Ancestor to the Heir, and there needeth not any word of Heir in the Writ of Summons; only one President there is in a special Writ sometime directed to Sir <hi>Henry Bromfleet</hi> in the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, wherein he was styled <hi>Lord Veysey,</hi> and wherein there are these words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>Volumus tamen vos &amp; haeredes vestros de corpore vestro ligitime enatos Barones de Veysey existentes.</hi> Wherefore it is very true, that when the Heir of any such Baron by Writ is called to the Parliament, that his Descent of Honour is thereby established and approved of by the gracious Judgment of our Sacred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign: So it is also true, that if it shall stand with his Majesties pleasure, that such an Heir shall not be summoned at all, then that Nobility is much impaired, and in a manner extinguished in the censure of all men; for that it hath no other original but by a Writ of Summons, from the which by the Judgment of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Sovereign he is excluded.</p>
                        <p>As to the second principal point, Whether the Barony by Writ may descend to the Heir Female, it shall not be amiss likewise to shew the Reasons on either part, that by conflict of Argument the truth may the better be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                        <p>Those that maintain the Affirmative part, do say, That in reason the Sex of the Heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ought no more to barr her Dignity, than the Nonage of the Heir Male ought to barr him, though during his Nonage he be unable to do the Service. But as the Service of the one is for time forborn, so the Sex of the other

may at all times be supplied by the maturity of her Husbands Offices of Honour, which do much import the Commonweal, being passed by Inheritance, do descend to the Heir Female, as the Office of the High Constableship of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which descended unto the Daughter of <hi>Hum. de Bohun</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Essex.</hi> Also the Office of the Lord Steward descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</hi> The like may be said of the Office of Earl-Marshal, which descended by an Heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male to the House of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> All which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are as unsit to be exercised by a woman, as for a Woman to be summoned by Writ to the Parli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Many Noble Houses also in <hi>England</hi> do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and lawfully bear the Dignity of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage unto them descended by a Woman.</p>

                        <p>They which stand of the Negative part in this Controversie, do encounter their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Parliament, whereby the Baron by Writ hath his Original, is to call that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Worthy Person so summoned to the number of that Right, High, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Assembly, and to be a Judge, to sit, hear, and determine Life and Member, Plea and right of Land, if there shall come occasion: likewise to give Counsel and Advise in the most mighty Affairs of the Realm: But these things are convenient for the quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men; unfitting, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming the Sex of women.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ergo,</hi> having respect unto the scope and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpose of such Writs, such Inheritances should only descend unto the Heir Female.</p>

                        <head>The Second Argument contra.</head>
                        <p>Secondly, If it shall be answered, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Heir Female, to whom such Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is descended, be unfit in her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the accomplishing of these things; yet she may marry with one sufficiently able for her, and in her behalf to execute the same. This Answer will neither satisfie nor salve the inconveniences: For admit that such an Heir Female were at full Age at the death of her Ancestor, unmarried; for it doth lye in her own choice then whom shall be her Husband.</p>

                        <head>The Third Argument contra.</head>
                        <p>Thirdly, If such Husband shall be called by the right of his Wife, the Writ shall make some mention thereof; for otherwise it may well be taken that the Husband was chosen in his own person, and in behalf of himself, and not in regard of his wife, or such pretended Dignity descended unto him. But there was never such a Writ of Summons seen wherein the wife was mentioned. And if the husband of such a wife have been called to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is always by General Writ) not mentioning his wife, he is thereby made a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of himself by virtue of the said Writ.

                           </gap>e is no purpose to call the right of such Noble Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses into question. Howbeit, Secondly, this is to be observed out of the Presidents, and to be acknowledged of every dutiful Subject, That the King's Majesty is nevertheless at liberty to call to his High Council of Parliament, whom he shall in his Princely Wisdom think fit, which by his Majestie's Noble Progenitors have in former Ages likewise observed.</p>
                        <p>And therefore whereas <hi>Ralph</hi> Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> being a Baron by Writ, died without Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, having two Sisters and Coheirs, <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> the eldest, who married Sir <hi>Thomas Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> Knight, and <hi>Ioan</hi> the younger, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Sir <hi>Humphrey Butcher</hi> Knight, who was called to Parliament as Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and not the said Sir <hi>Thomas.</hi> Thirdly, It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That if a Baron by Writ die without Heir Male, having his Daughter, Sister, or other Collateral Heir Male that can challenge the Land of the said Baron deceased by any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient entail, or otherwise, the Title of such an Heir Female hath heretofore been allowed, as by the honourable Opinions and Relations of the Right Honourable the late Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Office of Earl-Marshal, signified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the late Queen, upon Petition of the Sister and Heir of <hi>Gregory</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> deceased, may appear.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, in the same Pedigree of the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> it was expressed, That <hi>Thomas,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> had issue <hi>Thomas</hi> his eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son, <hi>Ralph</hi> his Second, and <hi>Humphrey</hi> his third. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the eldest, died in the life of his Father, having issue <hi>Ioan</hi> Daughter and Heir, who was married to Sir <hi>Richard Fines</hi> Knight, and after <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> his Grandfather, and Father to the said <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Humphrey,</hi> died; after whose death <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, by his Letters Patents bearing date at <hi>Westminster</hi> the Seventh of <hi>November,</hi> in the Seventh year of his Reign, reciting the said Pedigree and Marriage, doth by his said

Letters Patents accept, declare, and repute the said <hi>Richard Fines</hi> to be Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and one of the Barons of the Realm. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, the said <hi>Humphrey Dacres,</hi> after the attainder of the said <hi>Ralph,</hi> and himself by an Act of Parliament, which was the first of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; And after the death of the said <hi>Ralph,</hi> and the Reversal of the said Act by another Act in the Twelfth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, the said <hi>Humphrey</hi> made challenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the said Barony, and unto divers Lands of the said <hi>Thomas</hi> his Father, whereupon both parties, after their Title had been considered of in Parliament, submitted themselves to the Arbitrement of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and entred into Bond each to other for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof; whereupon the said King, in his Award under his Privy Seal, bearing date at <hi>Westminster</hi> the Eighth of <hi>April, Anno Regni sui decimo tertio,</hi> did Award that the said <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Fines,</hi> in the right of <hi>Ioan</hi> his wife, and the Heirs of his body by the said <hi>Ioan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, should keep, have, and use the same Seat and Place in every Parliament, as the said <hi>Thomas Dacres</hi> Knight, Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and kept; and that the Heirs of the body of the said <hi>Thomas Dacres</hi> Knight, then late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> begotten, should have and hold to them and to their Heirs the Mannor of <hi>Holbeach.</hi> And further, That the said King <hi>Edward</hi> did Award on the other part, that the said <hi>Humphrey Dacres</hi> Knight, and the Heirs Males of the said <hi>Thomas,</hi> late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> should be reputed, had, named, and called the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of <hi>Gillesland</hi>; and that he, and the Heirs Males of the body of the said <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> then late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> should have, use, and keep the place in Parliament next adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath the said place, which the said <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Fines</hi> Knight, Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> then had and occupied.</p>
                        <p>And that the Heirs of the body of the said <hi>Ioan</hi> his wife shall have and enjoy, and that the Heirs Males of the said <hi>Thomas Dacres,</hi> late Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> should have to them and the Heirs Males of their bodies begotten, the Mannor of <hi>Iothington, &amp;c.</hi> And so note, that the name of the ancient Barony, namely <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesland,</hi> remained unto the Heir Male to whom the Land was entailed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover this is specially observed, If any Baron by Writ do die, having no other Issue than Female, and that by some special entail, or other assurance, there be an Heir Male which doth enjoy all or great part of the Lands, Possessions, and Inheritances of such Baron deceased, the Kings have used to call to the Parliament by Writ, as Baron, such Heir Male, omitting the Husband of the Issue of such Heir Female. And this also appeareth by a notable Controversie in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, between Sir <hi>Robert Willoughby</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer,</hi> for the Barony of <hi>Lattimer,</hi> which in effect was; The said Lord <hi>Brook</hi> did challenge the Barony of <hi>Lattimer,</hi> as Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The said <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi> did by his Answer shew, That after the death of the said <hi>Iohn Nevill</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi> without Issue, the said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was his Sister, and next Heir, and married unto <hi>Thomas Willoughby</hi> Knight, second Son of the Lord <hi>Willoughby.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, for that the said <hi>Iohn Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi> was dead without Issue, and that the next Heir was Female, did therefore call to the Parliament <hi>George Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> Knight, second Son of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> to be Lord <hi>Lattimer,</hi> as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin and next Heir Male of the said <hi>Iohn Nevill</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi>; which <hi>George</hi> was Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of the said <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the said <hi>Richard.</hi> In debate of which cause, the Question now in hand, namely, Whether a Barony by Writ may descend to the Heirs Female? was advisedly considered of by the King and his Nobility in Parliament, and in the end adjudged with the said <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi>; which President doth afford us two Judgments in this point: And in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, when the Writ was directed to the said Sir <hi>George Nevill</hi> Knight, whereby he was summoned as Lord <hi>Lattimer</hi> to the Parliament, and as Heir Male, and not the said <hi>Thomas Willoughby</hi> Knight, husband of the said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Heir Female. And the second Judgment was given in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, whereby the said Barony was adjudged to the said <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Latti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> coming out of the special Heir Male, against the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> descended of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Heir Male.</p>
                        <p>But here in this President before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of the Barony of <hi>Dacres,</hi> may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to encounter this Conclusion; for there was an Heir Female married unto Sir <hi>Richard Fines</hi>; who by the Declaration of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth, was Baron of <hi>Dacres</hi> in right of his wife. And there was also <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> the Heirs Males, before whom the Heir Female was preferred by the censure of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. This Objection is easily answered; for although <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth, through the Princely favour which he bore unto Sir <hi>Richard Fines,</hi> had declared him to be Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> in right of his wife; yet notwithstanding did <hi>Ralph Dacres,</hi> being Heir Male then unto the Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and by that name was attainted in Parliament <hi>Anno primo Hen.</hi> 4.</p>

                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50041:67"/>Wherefore the reason why the Heir Male could not be regarded was the said Attainder of the said <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As concerning the third Point, admitting such Descent to be to the Heir Female, when there is no Heir Male that may claim the same; for then doth this Question take place, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the husband of such an Heir Female shall enjoy the Dignity in right of his wife, or no? Wherein we are to rest upon a Resolution had and given to this special Question, which was in this manner.</p>
                        <p>In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, when Mr. <hi>Winby</hi> took upon him the style of Lord <hi>Talbois</hi> in right of his wife, having no Issue by her; The said King, assisted both by Civil and Temporal Lawyers, gave Sentence, That no husband of a Baroness, in her right, should use that Style and Dignity, until he had by her a Child, whereby she should become Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by Courtesie unto her Inheritance. The special Reasons that occasioned this Sentence, were two.</p>
                        <p>First, It should be convenient for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band this day to be a Baron and a Peer of the Realm, and to morrow, by the death of his wife, to become none, and without the default of the party.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If he had Issue by wife, and were entituled to be Tenant by the Courtesie of <hi>England</hi> of his wives Lands, if he shall not also bear the Style and Dignity of his Wives Barony, then should the Son, after the death of his mother, dying in the life time of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be a Baron and Lord without Land; for so the father should have the Land as Tenant by Courtesie, and the Son the Lordship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Land. And thus much said concerning the Nature, Quality, and Estate of a Baron by Writ, and for the Resolution of the several points and Articles of the Question proposed, may suffice.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. Barons by Patent, which is the third kind of Barons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the former Division of Barons.</head>
                     <p>THere is also a fourth means of Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> by Act of Parliament: but the first two mentioned, and this other by Patent, is most usual for the Honour of the King; for thereby the Donation doth proceed from his Majesty only, as from the Fountain of Honour: But when the Creation is by Parliament, the King ever is one, and may be said to be Donor.</p>
                     <p>A Baron therefore by Creation by reason of Letters Patents, is that noble Person whom the King, or any of his Progenitors, Kings of this Realm, have created Baron by such their Letters Patents, began in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Dignity of a Baron shall be of such continuance in Descent, or otherwise, as shall be limited in the <hi>Habendum</hi> in such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents contained: for it may be but for the life of him to whom it is given, or for term <hi>vanter vie,</hi> as some hold Opinion in the 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. for <hi>cujus est dare est disponere.</hi> It may be in special in our general Tayl; and this kind of Tayl was usual before the Statute made <hi>decimo tertio</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. by which Estate Tayl of Lands and Tenements was created, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Patent whereby <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, by these words; <hi>Habendum sibi &amp; haeredibus suis de corpore Margaretae uxoris sui, sorors Alexandri Regis Scotiae, procreatis, &amp; pro defectu talis exitus rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere in directis haeredibus dicti Huberti.</hi> And that Estates intayl are at this Day of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour by the said Statute of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> the second.</p>

                        <head>Answer.</head>
                        <p>The Case of the Lord <hi>Delaware</hi> lately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Resolution somewhat answerable to this Question: <hi>Thomas Delaware</hi> in the third of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, being in some displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with <hi>William West</hi> his Heir and Nephew, who was Father to <hi>Thomas</hi> late Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> and Grandfather to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi> that <hi>Nevis</hi> procured by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the said <hi>William West</hi> was; during his natural life only, clearly disabled to claim, demand, or have any manner of Right, Title, or Interest by Descent, Remainder, or otherwise, in or to the Mannors, Lands, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, or Hereditaments, Title and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Delaware</hi> his Uncle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the said <hi>Thomas Delaware</hi> died, and the said <hi>William West</hi> was in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> attainted of Treason by Verdict, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the said Queen; and afterwards by Parliament, in the time of Queen <hi>Elixabeth,</hi> was restored; and in the fourth year of her Reign was created Lord <hi>Delaware</hi> by Patent, and took place in Parliament accordingly, for that by the said Act of Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, he was excluded to challenge the former ancient Barony; and after he died. Now whether <hi>Thomas Delaware</hi> should take his place according to the ancient Barony by Writ, or according to his Father's Creation by Patent, was the Question. The Opinions of the late Queens Council, being his Majestie's Attorney General and Solicitor, were, That the acceptance of the new Creation by the said <hi>William West</hi> could not extinguish the ancient Dignity, for that he had not the ancient Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in him at that time of his Creation; but the Dignity was by the Act of Parliament 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. in the ballance of suspence or conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Law, and he thereby utterly disabled to have the same during his life, only so as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptance could not extinguish that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he then had not, nor could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Heir, who was not disabled by the Parliament 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. to claim the ancient Barony; which Opinion of theirs was seen and allowed by the then Chief Justice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Lord Chief Baron, and so signified to the Lord Keeper. But this to be noted by the Reasons made for the said Resolution, though if the said Sir <hi>William West</hi> had been Baron, and entituled, and in possession of the ancient Dignity, when he accepted the ancient Creation, the Law perchance might have been otherwise; but that remains as yet unresolved: Nevertheless the Rule is, <hi>Eodem modo, quo quid constituitur, dissolvitur.</hi> But by a Grant which is but a matter of Fact, a man cannot transfer his Title of Honour. And thus much concerning the Degrees of Barons within this Realm upon this occasion, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and direction of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to be handled. And in this place I think it not impertinent to mention one Case, which I met with in our Books of Common Law, concerning the Descent of a Title of Honour, whereof the Ancestor had Estate in Feesimple; there is a Maxim in the Law, <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessio fratris in feodo facit sororemesse haeredem</hi>: But if a man by any of the three means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid be created into a Title of Dignity to him and his Heirs for ever, and so have Issue by one wife a Son and a Daughter, and hath also a Son by a second wife; afterwards the Father dieth, and his eldest Son entreth into all his Father's Inheritances, and also enjoyeth the Titles and Dignities which his Father had, but dieth without Issue: In this Case the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall descend upon the younger Son, though he be but of the half blood to him that last enjoyed that Name and Title of descent, and shall not descend to his Sister of the whole blood. And yet in this case he shall only be her Brother's Heir of all his Feesimple Lands; and the reason thereof is, because <hi>possessio fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris</hi> is the name and sole cause which may give Title to her, his Sister, which faileth in this case of Dignity; for it cannot be said that her elder brother was in possession of his Title of Honour, no more than of his blood; so as neither by his own act, nor any act to be done by any other, did gain more actual possession (if so it may be termed) then by the Law did descend to him: and therefore the younger brother may well by the Law make himself Heir unto his Father of the Honour, that he cannot be heir unto his brother: So that this word [Possession] which is no other than <hi>pedis positio,</hi> extendeth only unto such things of which a man may, by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Having thus much treated concerning the Creations, and other things incident to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Nobility, I cannot omit some things concerning the sufficiency and ability of Estate, which the Law doth require to be in every of them, according to their several Dignities. The Common Law (which always will deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and conveniency be observed, considering the Charges and Dignities appertaining to these Degrees and Dignities, being Offices of principal Service to the King and Realm, both in War and Peace) hath ordered, that each of them ought to have a convenient Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inheritance in Land to support the said Dignity, which Supplies are as Sinews conjoyned in the same: For in Vertue and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> confesseth) all the old No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility consisted, and which two Properties maketh a good Complement; for <hi>utilior est sapientia cum divitiis conjuncta.</hi> Therefore a Knight's Fee which he ought to have is Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds Land by the year; a Baron's thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Knights Fees and a quarter; and an Earl's twenty Knights Fees. For always the fourth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50041:68"/>
part of each Revenues, which is by the Law held requisite for the Dignity, shall be paid to the King for the Relief. As for Example; the Relief of a Knight is five pounds, which is the one fourth of his Revenue, according to the Statute of the first of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second. The Relief of a Baron is One hundred Marks, which is also the fourth part of his Revenue. And the Relief of an Earl is One hundred pounds al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o, the fourth part of his Revenue. And it appears by the Records of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> that the Relief of a Duke amounteth unto Three hundred pounds. And this is the reason in our Books, that every of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is presumed in the Law to have sufficient Freehold <hi>ad sustinendum nomen &amp; onus.</hi> And to what value those ancient Fees in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, at this day do amount unto, most men are not unskilful in, <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>seventh part,</hi> 33. And in Cases of Decay of Ability, and Estate, as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores Romani amoti Senatu,</hi> so sometimes they are not admitted to the Upper House of Parliament, though they still keep their Title and Dignity.

                     <p>WHEN a Peer of the Realm, and Lord of the Parliament, is to be Arraigned upon any Trespass or Felony whereof he is indicted, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he hath pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> the King by his Letters Patens shall assign some great and sage Lord of the Parliament to be High Steward of <hi>England</hi> for the day of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, who before the said day shall make a Precept to his Serjeant at Arms, that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to serve him during the time of his Commission, to warn to appear before him Eighteen or Twenty Lords of the Parliament (or Twelve at the least) upon the same day. And then at the time appointed, when the High Steward shall be set under the Cloth of Estate, upon the Arraignment of the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and having caused the Commission to be read, the same Serjeant shall return his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and thereupon the Lords shall be called; and when they have appeared, and are set in their places, the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50041:69"/>
be done upon their Honour, without any Oath to be ministred upon them. And when all, or the greatest part of them, shall be agreed, they shall retire to their places, and sit down. Then the High Steward shall ask of the youngest Lord by himself, if he that is Arraigned be Guilty or not of the Offence whereof he is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and then the youngest next him, and so of the residue one by one, until he hath asked them all; and every Lord shall answer by himself. And then the Steward shall send for the Prisoner again, who shall be led to the Barr, to whom the High Steward shall rehearse the Verdict of the Peers, and give Judgment accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Antiquity and Original of this kind of Tryal, by the opinion of several Authors, is grounded from the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> so called, not in respect of the quantity, but of the weight of it. <hi>Coke</hi> to the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eight part, <hi>fol.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. beginning thus, <hi>Millus liber homo, &amp;c. nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale judicium parium suorum.</hi> But I take it to be more ancient than the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, as brought into the Realm with the Conqueror, being answerable to the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Laws, and agreeable with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom <hi>Feudale,</hi> where almost all Controversies arising between the Sovereign and the Vassal are tryed <hi>per Iudicium parium suorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if a Peer of the Realm, upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of Treason, do stand mute, or will not answer directly, Judgment shall be given against him as a Traytor Convict, and he shall not be prest to death, and thereby save the forfeiture of his Lands; for Treason is out of the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 33. <hi>Dyer</hi> 205. But if he be Arraigned upon Indictment of Felony, he may be mute. This priviledge hath some restraint, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the person, as in the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. As touching the person; first the Archbishops and Bishops of this Realm, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be Lords of the Parliament, if they be impeached of such offence, they shall not be tryed by the Peers of the Realm, but by a Jury of Knights, and other substantial Persons upon their Oaths; the reason thereof alledged is so much as Archbishops and Bishops cannot pass in the like cases upon Peers, for that they are prohibited by the Common and Ecclesiastical Laws to be judged of Life and Blood. Reason would that the other Peers should not try them; for this Tryal should be mutual, forasmuch as it is performed upon their Honours, without any Oath taken. And so by the way you may see the great respect the Law hath to a Peer of the Realm, when he speaketh upon his Honour, even in a case con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the life of a man, and that of a Peer; and therefore ought they much more to keep their Words and Promises in smaller matters, when they engage their Honour for any just cause or consideration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as touching these persons, no Temporal Lords, but they that are Lords of the Parliament, shall have this kind of Tryal; and therefore out of this are excluded the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son and Heir apparent of a Duke in the life of his Father, though he be called an Earl. And it was the case of <hi>Henry Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Son and Heir apparent to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> in 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. which is in <hi>Brook's Abridgment</hi> Treason, 2. Likewise, the Son and Heir apparent of an Earl, though he be called a Lord. And all the younger Sons of Kings are Earls by birth, though they have no other Creation; but shall not be partaker of these or other Priviledges incident to the Lords of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Those that are Barons, and of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> if upon the like Offence committed in <hi>England</hi> they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>England,</hi> they shall not have this Tryal by Peers, no, though they were born in <hi>England</hi>; for they received their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from a King of <hi>England</hi> of other Nations: But if the King of <hi>England</hi> do at this day cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate one of his Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> an Earl, Viscount, Baron, or other Peer of this Realm; or by his ordinary Writ of Summons under his Great Seal do call him to the Upper House of Parliament, and assign him a place, and to have Voice free amongst the Lords and Peers there assembled, he shall be partaker with them in all priviledges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thus much concerning the restraint of the Priviledges in respect of the persons 39 Ed. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And touching the manner of proceeding, it appeareth by the said Statute of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, chap.</hi> 29. That a Peer of the Realm shall be tryed by his Peers only, in case where he is indicted at the King's Suit of Treason or Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for the words of the Statute be <hi>Nec su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eum ibimus, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if any Appeal of Murther of Felony be sued by any common person against a Peer of the Realm, he shall be tryed by common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and not by his Peers.</p>
                     <p>And so was <hi>Fines</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> tryed in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of Murther. The Nobility of this Realm do enjoy this priviledge, That they are not to be impannelled on any Jury or Inquest to make tryal or inquiry upon their Corporal Oaths between party and party, for they may have a Writ for their Discharge to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff.</p>
                     <p>But it is a Rule in Law, <hi>Vigilantibus non dormientibus subveniant jura.</hi> For if the Sheriff have not received any such Writ, and the Sheriff have returned any such Lord on Juries, or in Assize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they thereupon do appear, they shall be sworn; if they do not appear, they shall lose their Issues 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and in such case they must purchase a Writ
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50041:69"/>
out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> reciting their priviledges, directed to the Justices before whom such No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons are so impannelled, commanding to dismiss him or them that were so impannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the said Pannel, <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 165.</p>
                     <p>This priviledge hath, in two causes, not been allowed, or taken place: 1. If the enquiry concern the King and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in any necessary and important degree or business of the Realm. And therefore divers Barons of the Marshes of <hi>Wales</hi> were impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled before the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to enquire of a notable outrage committed by <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> against <hi>Humphrey de Bohun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> and his Tenants in <hi>Wales,</hi> in the Twelfth year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First, where <hi>Iohn de Hastings, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond de Mortimer, Theobald Beardmoe,</hi> and other Barons of the Marshes, challenged their priviledges aforesaid, and much insisted upon the same. But it was afterwards answered by the Court, as by the words in the Record ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. The Barons aforesaid did persist in the Challenge, and in the end both the said Earls, between whom the said outrage had been perpetrated, submitted themselves to the King's Grace, and made their Fines. Secondly, This priviledge hath no place in case of necessity, where the truth of the case cannot otherwise come to light; for the words in the Writ in the Register are, <hi>Nisi sua praesentia ob ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam causam specialiter exigatur, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any Nobleman do bring an Action of Debt upon Account, in case where the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is to be examined (which is always intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be upon Oath) upon the truth of his cause, by vertue of the Statute of the fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. it shall suffice to examine his Attorney, and not himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath.</p>
                     <p>And this priviledge the Law hath given to the Nobility, That they are not Arrested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Warrant of a Justice of Peace for their good behaviour, or breach of Peace; nor by a Supplicavit out of <hi>Chancery,</hi> or from the <hi>King's Bench</hi>: For such an Opinion hath the Law conceived of the peaceable disposition of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, that it hath been thought enough to take their promise upon their Honour in that behalf. And as in Civil Causes, the like Rule doth the Court of Equity observe in Cases of Conscience; for if the Defendant be a Peer of the Realm in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> or Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> a <hi>Subpaena</hi> shall not be awarded, but a Letter from the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper in lieu thereof. And if he do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, no Attachment shall go out against him: For in the Fourteenth year of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> this Order and Rule was declared in the Parliament Chamber, That an Attachment is not awarded by Common Law, Custome, or President, against any Lord of Parliament. And if he do appear, and make his Bill of Complaint upon his Honour only, he is not compelled to be sworn. But by the Statute 5 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. it is enacted, That all Knights and Burgesses of Parliament shall take the Oath of Supremacy, and so shall Citizens and Barons of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> being returned of the Parliament, before they enter into the Parliament House; which Oath shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor, effect, and form of the same, as is set forth in the Statutue of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Provided always, that forasmuch as the Queens Majesty is otherwise sufficiently assured of the Faith and Loyalty of the Temporal Lords of her High Court of Parliament, therefore this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall not extend to compel any Temporal person of or above the Degree of a Baron of this Realm to take the said Oath, nor to incur any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty limited by the said Act for not taking the same.</p>
                     <p>If a Peer be sued in the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> in an Action of Debt or Trespass, and Process be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by <hi>Capias</hi> or <hi>Exigit</hi> against him, then he may sue out a <hi>Certiorari</hi> in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> directed to the Justices of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> testifying that he is a Peer of the Realm. For unless the Court be certified by the King's Writ out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> that the Defendant is a Peer of Parliament, if a <hi>Capias</hi> or <hi>Exigit</hi> issue forth against him, it is no Error, neither is it punishable in the Sheriff, his Bailiffs or Officers, if they execute the said Process, and arrest the body of such a Noble person; for it appertaineth not to them to argue or dispute the Authority of the Court. But if the Court be thereof certified as aforesaid, they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> which is in the Books of <hi>Entries</hi> in the Title of Error, <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>And there are two Reasons or Causes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no <hi>Capias</hi> or <hi>Exigit</hi> lieth against any Peer; one because of the dignity of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the other by intendment of Law. There is none of the Nobility but have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Freehold, which the Plaintiffs may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their payment or satisfaction. But a <hi>Capias</hi> or <hi>Exigit</hi> lieth against a Knight, for the Law hath not that Opinion of his Freehold. And if any of the Nobility happen to be so wilful, and not to appear, the Court will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Sheriff to return great Issues against him, and so at every default to encrease the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, as lately against the Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> hath been in practice.</p>
                     <p>By the ancient Laws of this Realm, before the coming of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, many good Laws were made for keeping the Peace; and amongst others, That all above the age of twelve years should be sworn to the King; which we in remembrance thereof do keep at this day in the view of Frank Pledge, or the Court Leet. But Noblemen of all sorts, are neither bound to attend the Court Leet, nor to take the Oath, as appeareth by <hi>Britan. c.</hi> 29. treating of the Court called the <hi>Sheriffs Tourn,</hi>

out of which the Leet to be extracted. And agreeable thereunto is the Statute of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, cap.</hi> 10. See the Lord Chancellor's Speech in the case of <hi>Postnati, fol.</hi> 78. If a Writ of Error be brought in Parliament upon a Judgment given in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> the Lords of the higher House alone, without the Commons, are to examine the Errors, <hi>ibid. fol.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p>In the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>fol.</hi> 26. in a Case concerning a Distress taken for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and Fees, the Knights of the Parliament are not contributary for such Lands as are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of their ancient Lordships and Baronies; but for other Lands they are. But there is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion made, If one which is no Baron, but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, do purchase any ancient Barony, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he shall be discharged of such Expences and Fees, or not? Which is not worthy the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning: For as Land holden by Villainous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice doth not make him a Villain or Bondman, which being free doth purchase the same, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by his Tenure he shall be bound to do such Villainous Service: So on the other side, Land that is holden by Barony doth not make the Villain or Ignoble which purchaseth the same, to be Noble, although the charge of such Tenure do lye upon him in respect of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>It is said in our Books, That a day of Grace, or by the favour of the Court, is not to be granted to the Plaintiff in any Suit or Action whereby a Nobleman is Defendant; because thereby a Nobleman should be longer delayed than the ordinary course of the Court is; and such a Lord is to have expedition of Justice, in respect that he is to attend the person of the King, and the Service of the Commonwealth: But if there be no Noble person to the Suit, the Judges do and may at their discretion, upon a motion, grant a day more of Grace o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than by the strict course of the Law the Plaintiff may challenge. <hi>Cambden, f.</hi> 169. writing upon this Subject, saith, <hi>Where a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman is Demandant, the Defendant may not be assoyned for the delay and cause afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</hi> To which I could also subscribe, but that the Book in the fifth of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>b.</hi> is otherwise adjudged: There the King brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> against a common person, and the Defendant was essoyned by a Rule of Court.</p>
                     <p>If any Peer of the Realm be Plaintiff or Defendant in any Action, real or personal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against any other, whereupon any Issue is to be tryed by a Jury, the Sheriff must return one Knight at the least to be of the Inquest; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon challenge made the whole pannel shall be quashed. Which by order of the Law is appointed to be done for honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to the person of that degree: For when a Peer of the Realm is party, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than when the Suit is between private persons; <hi>F. N. B. Title Challenge</hi> 115. 13. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> against a Bishop adjudged. But the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in the fourteenth year of the late Queen's Reign, and the parties did plead to an Issue, the <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Facias</hi> is awarded, which the Sheriff did return <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>rved, and a pannel returned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in which is no Knight named. The truth of which Case was, that after the return made, the Demand is published, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Queen and the Heralds to be Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in right and discent, although he had not been so reputed or named before; and also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time (that is to say) at the then last Parliament, the Tenant is made a Baron by Writ of Parliament, and then the Jury doth appear in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> did challenge the Array, because no Knight was returned: but it was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him by the Court, for the admittance of both parties is to the contrary, and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault can be laid to the Sheriff, for he had no notice of the honourable Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How much the Common Law hath always prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perpetuity in Lands and Tenements, you may see in <hi>Corbet</hi>'s Case, in the first part of <hi>Coke</hi>'s Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 48. and in many other Cases in the rest of his Books. As also <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 145. saith it is a principle in the Law, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Land in Feesimple may be charged with a Rent. But if the King's Majesty, upon a Creation of any Peer of the Realm, of what degree soever, do as the manner is by Letters Patent give unto any such new created No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman an Annuity or Rent for the support of his degree, which they call Creation-money; this is so annexed to the dignity, that by no Grant, Assurance, or any manner of Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it can be given from the Lord, but is still incident, and a support of the same Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>In all Cases wherein is any Suit, a Baron or Peer of the Realm is to be amerced no less than five pounds; but the amercement of a Duke is One hundred pounds.

Comites &amp; Barones non amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientur nisi per pares suos, &amp; non nisi secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum modum delicti</hi>; yet use hath reduced it into a certainty. As also by the same Statute it appeareth, that such Amercements should be assessed <hi>per pares suos</hi>: but that it were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to assemble Barons for so small a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, such Amercements in times past have been assessed by the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> who sometime were Barons of the Realm, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of; and so writeth <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tract. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 116.8.</p>
                     <p>Whereas by Statute 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. it is enacted, That the Subjects of this Realm shall not keep in their Houses or Families above the number of four Strangers born; nevertheless,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50041:70"/>
by a Proviso in the same Act, every Lord of the Parliament hath this priviledge allowed unto him to keep in his Family the number of six born Strangers.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was granted to the Nobility according to their degrees concerning Apparel; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by a Statute made in the first of the King that now is, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. all Laws and Statutes concerning Apparel are taken away.</p>
                     <p>Whereas by the Statute 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>Parl.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it is ordained, That the Justices of the Peace in every County, named of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> shall be resident in the Shires wherein they are Justices, there is a Proviso whereby the Lords and Peers of the Realm, named in such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, are excepted.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. amongst other things it is enacted, That in all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Case and Cases, where any of the King's Subjects shall and may upon his prayer have the priviledge of the Clergy, as a Clark Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, that may make purgation in all the Cases, and every of them, and also in all and every Cases of Felony wherein the priviledge or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Clergy is taken away by this Statute, wilful Murther, and poysoning only excepted, the Lords and Peers of the Realm having place and voice in Parliament, shall by vertue of this Act of Common Grace, upon his or their requests and prayer, alledging that he is a Lord or Peer of this Realm, claiming the benefit of this Act, though he cannot read, without burning in the Hand, loss of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or corruption of Blood, be adjudged, taken, and used for the first time only to all constructions, intents, and purposes as a Clark Convict, which may make purgations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other benefit of Clergy to any such Lord or Peer from thenceforth at any time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for any cause to be allowed, adjudged, or admitted, any Law, Custome, Statute, or other thing to the contrary notwithstanding. By this Statute a Lord of the Parliament shall have the benefit of his Clergy, where a common person shall not, <hi>viz.</hi> for breaking open an House by day or night, or for robbing any on the High-way, and in all other Cases excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, saving in wilful Murther and Poysoning, but in all other Cases, wherein Clergy is taken away by any Statute made since the said Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. he is in the same degree that a common and inferiour person: but the Court will not give him the benefit of this Statute, if he doth not require it. If a Lord of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament do confess his Offence upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, or doth abjure, or is Outlawed for Felony, it seemeth that in these Cases he may have the benefit of this Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; for that by the Statute 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 18. he, nor any other, need to make his purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but shall be forthwith delivered out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the Justices.</p>
                     <p>By the Imperial Constitutions, <hi>Nobiles non torquentur, &amp; Nobiles non suspendentur, sed decapitantur:</hi> and so it is almost grown into a Custome of <hi>England</hi> by the favour of the Prince; for it is rare to have a Nobleman exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in other form. Yet <hi>Thomas Fines</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of the South, in the 23<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and the Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> in the fourth of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were hanged.</p>
                     <p>At the Common Law it was lawful for any man, Noble or Ignoble, to retain as many Chaplains as they pleased for their instruction in Religion. But by a Statute made 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. a restraint was made, and a certain number only allowed the Nobility: And such Chaplains for their attendance have Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as by the Statute at large may appear, <hi>viz.</hi> every Archbishop and Duke may have six Chaplains, whereof every one may have, and purchase Licence of Dispensation, and take, receive, and keep two Parsonages or Benefices with Cure of Souls; and that every Marquiss and Earl may have five Chaplains; every Viscount or other Bishop four Chaplains; and every Baron and Knight of the Garter may have three Chaplains, whereof every one of them may purchase License of Dispensation, and take, receive, and keep two Benefices with Cure of Souls.</p>
                     <p>And forasmuch as the retaining of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains by Lords and Peers of the Realm is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; and nevertheless some questions have been concerning the true understanding of the said Statute Law, I think it not unnecessary to set down some subsequent Resolutions of the Judges touching some matters.</p>
                     <p>If a Bishop be translated to an Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or a Baron be created an Earl, yet in this case they can have but only so many Chaplains as an Archbishop, or an Earl might have; for although he hath divers Dignities, yet he is still but one person to whom the attendance and service should be done: So if a Baron be made a Knight of the Garter, or Lord Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> he shall have in all but three Chaplains, <hi>&amp; sic de similibus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if such an Officer allowed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to have one, two, or more Chaplains, do retain accordingly, and after he is removed from his Office, in this case he cannot be now Nonresident, nor accept a second Benefice of his Complement which was not full before his removing; and in that case it behoveth the Chaplain to procure a <hi>Non obstante,</hi> otherwise he may be punished for his Nonresidence.</p>
                     <p>So if any Earl or Baron do retain a Chaplain, and before his advancement his Lord is Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treason (as it was in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Westmoreland</hi>) after the said At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder such a Chaplain cannot except a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Benefice; for though his Lord be still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to Nature, yet after the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he is a dead person by the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the case to have priviledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or for his Chaplains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50041:71"/>If a Baron have three Chaplains, and every of them have two Benefices, and after the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron dieth; they shall enjoy those Benefices with Cure, which were lawfully settled in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But in this case, although the said Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains be resident upon one of his Benefices, yet now he is become punishable for being resident upon the other; for <hi>Cessante causa, cessat ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same Law is, if the Baron be attainted of Treason or Felony; or if any Officer be removed from his Office, <hi>&amp; sic de simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So if a Lord do one time retain more Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains than are allowed by the Law, the lawful number only shall have priviledge; and in this case which of them be first promoted shall have priviledge, and the rest are excluded; for <hi>aequali jure melior est conditio possidentis.</hi> If a Nobleman doth retain Chaplains above his number at several times, if any of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains die, the next that was retained shall not succeed, for his first retainer was void; and therefore in this case, it behoveth him to have a new retaining after the death of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, and before his advancement; for <hi>quod ab initio non valet, in tractu temporis non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valescit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Noble person retain such a number of Chaplains as is by the law allowed him, but afterwards the Lord, upon such dislike or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, do discharge any of them from their attendance or service, the Lord in this case can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain other (thereby to give them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge) during the life of them so retained and discharged. And the reason thereof is, because the first Chaplains were lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and by virtue thereof, during their lives, might purchase Dispensations to have advantage according to the Statute: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the discharge of their service and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance might give liberty to the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others, by such means he might advance Chaplains without number, by which the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute might be defrauded. And the said Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute must be strictly construed, <hi>Non-residents, &amp; Pluralities,</hi> as a thing prejudicial to the service of God, and the ordinary instruction of the people of God.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. it is enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect as followeth; Forasmuch as by quarrels made to such as have been in great Authority, Office, and of Council with the King's of this Realm, hath ensued the destruction of the Kings, and therefore the undoing of this Realm, so as it hath evidently appeared, when the compassing of the death of such as were of the King's true Subjects was had, the destruction of the Prince was imagined thereby, and for the most part it hath grown and been occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by malice of the King's own Houshold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and for that by the Laws of this Land, if actual deeds were not, there was no remedy for such false compassing, imaginations, and confederacies had against any Lord, or any of the King's Council, or great Officers in his Houshold; and so great inconveniences did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, because such ungodly demeanours were not strictly punished before that any actual deed was done; for remedy whereof, it was by the said Statute ordained, That the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Treasurer, or Comptroller of the King's Houshold for the time being, or one of them, shall have full authority to enquire by twelve discreet persons of the Check Roll of the King's honourable Houshold, if any person admitted and sworn the King's Servant, and his name put in the Check Roll, in any quality or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree whatsoever under the state of a Lord, do make any Confederacies or Conspiracies with any person or persons, to destroy or murther the King, or any Lord of this Realm, or any other person sworn to the King's Council, Steward, Treasurer, or Comptroller of the King's Houshold, that if it be found before the said Steward for the time being, by the said twelve men, that any such of the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as aforesaid hath confederated or conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as abovesaid, that he so found by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be put thereupon to answer, and the Steward, Treasurer, or Comptroller, or two of them have power to determine the said matter according to Law: And if he put in trial, that then he be tried by Oath of twelve discreet men of the same Houshold, and that such Misdoers have no challenge but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liace: And if such Misdoers be found Guilty by confession or otherwise, that the said Offence is adjudged Felony, and they to have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution, as Felons attainted ought to have by the Common Law.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute made in the second of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. Authority is given to the Sheriffs, and other the King's Justices, for the better suppressing of Riots, to raise <hi>posse Comitatus</hi>; and the same liberty doth in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law guide in many other cases: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the Sheriff may not by such Authority command the person of any Nobleman to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Service. But if the Sheriff upon a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicavit</hi> against a Nobleman in that case do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that he is so puissant that he cannot, nor dare not arrest him, the Sheriff shall be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously amerced for such his return: For by the Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> the King's Command is to all Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Counts, and Barons, and to all Leige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the County, to be aiding unto him in that which to his Office appertaineth; and therefore no person whatsoever can respit the execution of the said Writ of the King's: Also the Sheriff at his discretion may levy three hundred men, if need be, to aid him in that behalf.</p>
                     <p>The words of the great Charter of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, in the eleventh Chapter, are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>To every Archbishop, Bishop, Earl, or Baron coming to us, and passing by our Forest,

it shall be lawful for him to take one Beast or two by the view of the Forest if he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; or else he shall cause one to blow a Horn for him, that he seem not to steal our Deer.</hi> Although the Statute doth speak but of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Earls, and Barons, yet if a Duke, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss, or Viscount (which are Lords of the Parliament) be coming towards the King by his command, they also shall have the benefit of this Article.</p>
                     <p>So if the King send to any of the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid to come to his Parliament; or send for him by Writ of <hi>Subpoena</hi> to appear in the <hi>Chancery</hi>; or by Privy Seal to appear before his Council; or send for him by Letters Missive, or by Messenger, or Serjeant at Arms; in all these cases he shall have the benefit of this Statute, because that they come at the King's command. The same Law is, if a <hi>Scire Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> go out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> or <hi>Kings Bench</hi> to a Lord of Parliament: But if such Process go forth against a Lord to appear before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> or the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and he cometh upon the same, he shall not have the benefit of the Statute; for he doth not come unto the King; and the words of the Statute are, <hi>Veniens ad nos</hi>; And all the Process which are made out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> and <hi>King's Bench,</hi> are, <hi>Quod sit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram nobis</hi>; and so are the Process out of the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi>

                     <p>Also Lords which come to visit the new King after the death of his Father (though not sent for) shall have the same priviledge. And so that this Statute is a Warrant dormant to such Lords; which also is to be understood as well of their returning homeward, as of their coming to the King. And note, that this Statute doth extend to give Licence to kill or hunt in the King's Parks, though the Letter of the Statute be <hi>Transiens per Forestam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Oath of Supremacy is not imposed on the Peers of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>A Peer shall for his first Offence of Felony, though he cannot read, have the benefit of his Clergy, and without burning.</p>

                        <p>An Abbot, which was a Lord of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was impleaded, and he did pray pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to appear by an Attorney: and by the Rule of the Court he could not, because the Statute is general, and against it; but by a special Writ out of <hi>Chancery</hi> he might; and so in case where he doth pray to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For if a Lord of the Parliament, holding Lands of another in Feesimple, doth forbear and withhold to do, and pay his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Landlord, and that by the space of two years; whereupon he bringeth a Writ of <hi>Cessment</hi> (which is his Remedy given by Law) thereby to recover the Inheritance of the Land: But the said Lord, for the saving of Tenancy, being minded to pay all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages before Judgment given against him (as by the Law he ought to do) in this case he must come in proper person, and not by an Attorney.</p>

                        <p>When a Peer of the Realm is Arraigned in any Appeal of Felony, he shall not have that priviledge to be tried by his Peers (as in case of Indictment) but must undergo the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trial of Twelve men.</p>
                        <p>Also in case of Indictment, the Defendant (though a Peer) may not challenge any of his Triers: And the Judgment to be given against any Lord of Parliament in cases of Felony or Treason shall be no other, than according to the usual Judgment given against common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And their Execution (through the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace and Favour of the King) is behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>By Attainder of Felony or Treason is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Blood, so that their Children may not be Heirs unto them, nor to any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor. And if he were a Nobleman before, he is by the Attainder made Ignoble, not only himself, but all his Children; having regard unto the Nobility which they had by their Birth. And this corruption is so strong and high, that it cannot be salved by the King's pardon, or otherwise than by Authority of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>But here is to be observed, That Nobility is not a thing substantial, but mere accidental; for it may be present or absent, without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Subject whereof it doth depend; for experience sheweth, That the passing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Titles are restrained by exorbitant Crimes, when as Nature in the mean while cannot be thrust away. Wherefore, though the Lawyers do call Extinguishment of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which happeneth by such hainous Offences committed by corruption of Blood: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they use not this manner of phrase, as though Nobility were naturally and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Honour of Blood, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereditary Faculty; but because the right of Inheritance (which is by degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Blood directed) is by that means determined; and also in regard of the hatred and detestation of the Crime, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led corruption of Blood.</p>
                        <p>And here a Question may arise, Whether by Attainder of the Father the Blood be so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that the Son shall also be barred his Mother's Inheritance, who hath not transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or no?</p>
                        <p>They that maintain the Affirmative, say, That forasmuch as none can be procreated or ingendred according to the course of Nature, but of a Father and Mother, and must have in him two Bloods, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore the Law also faith, Those Bloods commixt in the person of a man in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriage, do constitute and make him an Heir; and that none can be Heir unto any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he hath both Bloods in him to whom he doth convey himself to be Heir. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heir of the half Blood shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, because he doth want one of the Bloods which should make him inheritable. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reason <hi>Britan. chap.</hi> 5. saith, <hi>If a man be attainted of Felony by Iudgment, the Heirs ingendred after the Attainder are precluded from all manner of succession in the Heritage, as well of the part of the Mother as of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; for <hi>ex leproso parente, leprosus genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur filius. And when the Father is attainted of Treason or Felony, the Blood, in respect whereof he is Inheritable, being corrupted, the same hath but half his Blood, that is, the Blood of his Mother in him without corruption.</hi> And with this doth agree <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Non valebit felonis generatio, nec ad haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem paternam, nec maternam; si autem an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te feloniam generationem fecerit, talis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio succedit in haereditatem patris vel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, Ã  quo non fuerit felonia perpetrata.</hi> Because at the time of his Birth he had two lawful Bloods commixt in him, which could not be corrupted by the Attainder subsequent, but only as unto that party who did offend.</p>
                        <p>But on the Negative part it is said, That the Law is not so penal against the innocent Child, as to prejudice him touching his Mothers Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, who also did not offend; or contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, especially in case where the Mother was seized of an Estate in Feesimple, either in Lands or Tenements, or Title of Honour. And this was the case (if I be not mistaken) of <hi>Philip</hi> late Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Attainder of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> his Father; for he had that Earldom in right of his Mother.</p>
                        <p>But they do agree, That if the Lands or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, or a Title of Honour, be given to a man, and to his wife in tayl who hath Issue: The Father is attainted of Treason, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, though this forfeiture of the Husband shall be no barr to the Wife concerning her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest by Survivorship; yet their Issue is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Statute 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and his Blood corrupted: For in that case the Heir must necessarily make himself Heir, as well of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50041:72"/>

For there is Adversity ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and agreed for Law between a disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance which doth imply a wrong, and a lawful Baron which doth imply a right: And therefore if Land be given to the Husband, and the Wife, and to the Heirs of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies begotten, and the Husband levies a Fine with Proclamation, or do commit High Treason, and dieth, and the Wife before or after Entry dieth, the Issue is barred, and the Comisee for the King hath right unto the Lands, because the Issue cannot claim as Heir unto both. And with this doth agree <hi>Dyer</hi> 351. <hi>b.</hi> adjudged. <hi>vide</hi> 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 32. <hi>Cott's Assize, Coke's eighth part,</hi> 27. where it is resolved, That the Statute 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. doth extend only unto Discontinuances, although the Act hath general words, <hi>or be prejudicial to the Wife or her Heirs, &amp;c.</hi> but the conclusion; <hi>if she shall lawfully enter, &amp;c.</hi> according to their right and title therein, which they cannot do when they be barred, and have no right, title, and interest. And this Statute doth give advantage unto the Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so long as she hath right; but it doth not extend to take away a future barr. Although the Statute doth give Entry without limitation of any time; nevertheless the Entry must attend upon the right: and therefore if the Wife be seized in Feesimple, and her Husband levy a Fine with Proclamation unto another, and dieth, now the Wife may enter by force of the Statute; for as yet that Fine is not any barr unto her, but her right doth remain, which she may continue by Entry; but if she do sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease her time, and the five years do pass without Entry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now by force of the Fine with Proclamation, and five years past after the death of her Husband, she is barred of her right, and by consequence she cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the Statute doth speak of Fine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not of Fine with Proclamation. If there be Father and Son, and the Father be seized of Lands holden <hi>in Capite,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by Knight's Service, the King doth cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Son Duke, Earl, or other Degree of Nobility, and afterwards the Father dieth, his Son being within the Age of One and twenty years, he shall be no Ward; but if the King had made him Knight in the life of his Father, he should not have been in Ward after the death of his Father, neither for the Lands descended, nor for his Marriage, though he be within Age.</p>

                     <p>THERE are also other Lords in Reputation and Appellation, who nevertheless are not <hi>de jure</hi>; neither can they enjoy the priviledges of those of the Nobility that are Lords of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Son and Heir of a Duke, during his Father's life, is only in courtesie of Speech and Honour called an Earl; and the eldest Son of a Marquiss or an Earl, a Lord: but not so in legal proceedings, or in the King's Courts of Judicature. But the King may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure create them in the life of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors into any Degree of Lords of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And according to the <hi>German</hi> Custom, all the younger Sons of Dukes and Marquisses are called Lords, but by courtesie only, which Title descends not to their Heirs.</p>
                     <p>A Duke, or other of the Nobility of a Foreign Nation, doth come into this Land by the King's safe Conduct, in which said Letters of safe Conduct he is named a Duke according to his Creation, yet that Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation maketh him not a Duke, &amp;c. to sue, or be sued by that name within this Realm, but is only so by Reputation.</p>
                     <p>But if the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or other Sovereign King come into <hi>England</hi> under safe Conduct, he, during his abode here, ought to be styled by the name of King, and to retain his Honour, although not his Regal Command and Power. And in this case may be observed by the way, That no Sovereign King may enter into this Realm without licence, though he be in League.</p>
                     <p>All the younger Sons of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and Earls by their Birth without any other Creation.</p>
                     <p>And if an Englishman be created Earl of the Empire, or some other Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the Emperor or other Monarch, he shall not bear that Dignity in <hi>England,</hi> but is only an Earl in Reputation.</p>
                     <p>A Lord or Peer of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> is not of the Nobility or Peerage of <hi>England</hi> in all Courts of Justice, although he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed a Lord, and hath priviledge as a Peer.</p>

But in <hi>France,</hi> by the Salique Law, the Sex is excluded from their Inheritance, by which they debarred the <hi>English</hi> Title to their Crown.</p>
                     <p>There are three kinds of persons capable of the Title and Dignity of Queen amongst us, and each of them different in Power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. The first is a Queen Sovereign, to whom the Crown descends by Birth-right, and is equal in power to a King, as before noted. She is her Husband's Sovereign, and he her Subject in <hi>England,</hi> although he were an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: So was King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and her Authority is included in the foregoing Chapter of Monarchy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not to be here repeated. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in Honour is the Queen Consort; and the third the Queen Dowager or Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>As from the benign influence of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Planet the Sun, all Creatures (by God's decree in the order of Nature) receive life and motion; so from the King (God's Vicegerent on earth) all degrees of Nobility take their advance and dignity: 'Tis therefore requisite the King should as far excel his Subjects in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Splendor, as doth the Sun the other Planets. And as the Moon is the mirror of the Sun, representing his Glory by Night; so the Queen Consort, the Counterpart of the Royal Majesty, shines amongst us, for whom, and for whose Posterity the Nation is bound to send up their Prayers to God.</p>
                     <p>The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> during the life of the King, hath as high prerogatives and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and liveth in as great state as any Queen in <hi>Europe.</hi> She is reputed the second person in the Kingdom; and the Law setteth so high a value upon her, as to make it High Treason to conspire her death, or to violate her Chastity.</p>
                     <p>She is allowed Regal Robes, Ornaments
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50041:74"/>
and a Crown of the same form, as an absolute Queen weareth, and may be (as formerly they were) crowned with Royal Solemnity; the performance of which Office properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Archbishop of <hi>York.</hi> And although their Coronations of late have been disused, yet they have as much honour, and enjoy the same priviledges, as if that Ceremony had been done. And the manner and solemnity at the Coronation of a Queen is at large set down in most of our Chronicles, and in particular in <hi>Holinshead</hi> and <hi>Stow,</hi> upon the splendid Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Anna Bulloign</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, to which I refer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>The Queen is permitted to sit in state by the King, and to keep a distinct Court from the King's, although she be the Daughter of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bless; and hath her Courtiers in every Office, as hath the King (though not altogether so many;) and hath her Yeomen of her Guard to attend her on foot, and within doors, and her Lifeguard of Horse for her state and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when she goeth abroad: She hath her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, Solicitor, and Counsel for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Law concerns, who have great respect shewed them, being placed within the Barr with the King's Counsel in all Courts of Judicature.</p>
                     <p>Although she be an Alien, and a Feme co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert during the King's Life, yet without any Act of Parliament for Naturalization, or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents for her Denization, she may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Lands in Feesimple; make Leases in her own Name without the King; hath power to give, to sue, and to contract Debts, which by the Law is denied any other Feme Covert; she may not be impleaded till first petitioned; nor is the formality of fifteen days Summons to the Defendant needful, if she be Plaintiff; nor can she be amerced, if she be Nonsuited in any Action; she may present by her self to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Benefice.</p>
                     <p>Anciently the Queens had a Revenue called <hi>Aurum Reginae,</hi> that is the Queen's Gold, which was the tenth part of what came to the King by the name of <hi>Oblata</hi> upon Pardons, Gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of late they keep to their Dowry, <hi>viz.</hi> Forty thousand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> besides fines upon the renewing of Leases; which said Dowry is as large as any Queens in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>The like honour and respect that is due to the King is exhibited to the Queen, as well by Foreigners as by the King's Subjects; as is also to the Queen Dowager, who looseth not her Dignity or Reverence, although she should marry a private Gentleman, as did Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Noble women by descent, Birthright, or Creation, remain Noble although they marry Husbands under that degree. Also any Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Earl or Viscount that continues a Virgin, or marrieth an Esquire, yet she retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Honour that sprung from her Parents, and shall take place accordingly, and be saluted by the Title of Lady.</p>
                        <p>If a Gentleman, Knight, or Peer marry a wife of ignoble Parents, she shall enjoy the Title, Name, and Dignity of her Husband, not only during his life, but when she is a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or afterwards married to an Ignoble person; but this is by the Courtesie (and not by the Law) of the Realm. Whereas on the contrary, let a woman of Blood and Coat-Armour marry a Yeoman or Churle that is Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, and hath no Coat-Armour, his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of Honour is in no respect ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and she shall retain the Honour, State, and Dignity she was born unto.

                        <p>If a <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> or other woman Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, be married to a Peer of the Realm, or to a Gentleman, and be not denizened, she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred all Priviledges and Titles due to her Husband; nor can she claim any Dower or Joynture from him by the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet in some things our Laws are wonderful kind to the Female Sex, especially <hi>procreandi causa</hi>: As thus; if a man and his wife separate for some fraud, or private loathing of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Bed, or the like, and so continue for some years; after which time the woman bringeth forth a Child, which though got by another man, and her Husband in all that time not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enjoyed her, yet if he live in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he must Father the Child; and if before that time he had no Child, that shall inherit his Lands, if entailed, or left without Will. Also if a Wife be with Child when her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dieth, and she marry another man before her delivery, the latter Husband must own the Child, which must be his Heir at Law if he were childless.</p>
                        <p>The Wives Dignities and Lands descend to her Heirs, not to her Husband; yet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to play the man, the Courtesie of <hi>England</hi> is such, that as the Wife hath the third part of his Estate in Lands for her Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, during her life if a Widow; so the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if he get his Wife with Child, and that Child be heard to cry, he shall enjoy all her Lands during his life.</p>
                        <p>The Wife can make no contract whatsoever, that shall stand good in Law, to the detriment of her Husband, without his consent; nor can she make a Will, or dispose of what she hath, whilst she is a Feme Covert; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Female Children are also by Law capable to give their consent to marriage at Seven years old; and the Lord's eldest Daughter is to have aid of his Tenants to marry her at that age, though she may dissent from this Contract when she comes to Twelve; but if at that Age she doth not dissent, she is bound for life: she may then make a Will, and dispose of Goods and Chattels by it. At Nine years of Age she is Dowable: at Fourteen she might receive her Lands into her Hands, and was then out of Wardship, if she were Fourteen at the death of her Ancestor; otherwise she was in Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship till she accomplished Sixteen years, and then she was free. At One and twenty she is enabled to contract or alienate her Lands by Will or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>If there be no Son, the Lands as well as Goods are equally divided amongst the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who are Coheirs.</p>
                        <p>In ancient times Women amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were thought worthy of enjoying pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favours and respect. And out of their great love and honour to the Mother of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Coriolanus,</hi> for diverting his fury which he threatned the Citizens to their ruin, for their ingratitude towards him, the Citizens grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Roman</hi> Dames the priviledge of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Segmenta Aurea,</hi> or Bordures of Gold and purple on their Garments: They were also permitted to wear gold Ear-rings; to have place on the way; and in memorial of the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, there was erected a Temple dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Female Fortune.</p>

                           <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> wife to <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth of <hi>France,</hi> as an ornamental Honour to several deserving Ladies, instead of the Military Belt and Collar, bestowed on them a Cordon or Lace, and admonishing them to live chastly and devoutly: and to put the greater esteem thereon, the surrounded her Escocheon of Arms with the like Cordon; from which Example it is now become the Custome for unmarried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to bear their Arms in form of a Lozenge, which are commonly adorned with such a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ioseph Micheli Marquez,</hi> for the further Honour of the Female Sex, gives an Example of the Noble women of <hi>Tortosa</hi> in <hi>Aragon,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> or <hi>Knights: For</hi> (saith he) <hi>Don</hi> Raymond, <hi>last Earl of</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona (<hi>who by right of his wife</hi> Petronilla, <hi>sole Daughter and Heir to King</hi> Ramiro <hi>the Monk, joyned his Principality to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Aragon) <hi>having in the year</hi> 1149. <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the</hi> Moors <hi>the City of</hi> Tortosa, <hi>who in a few months after laid siege to the said City, and reduced the Inhabitants to so great a strait, that their intentions were of surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it up to the</hi> Moors; <hi>but the women hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, for the diverting their ruin, put on mens Apparel, and by a resolute Sally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the</hi> Moors <hi>to raise the Seige. And the Earl, in acknowledgment of his thanks for this their Noble Act, as a reward of Honour, instituted an Order (not much unlike a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Order) into which were admitted only those brave women, and their Descendants. The Badge which he assigned them was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Fryer's Capouch, but of a crimson colour, which they wore upon their Head-clothes. Amongst the priviledges which this Earl granted them, they were to be freed from all Taxes; to have precedency of men in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings; and that all the Iewels and Apparel of their deceased Husbands should be their own, although of never so great value. And these women having thus purchased this Honour, deported themselves after the manner of Military Knights of those days.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To look further back, ancient Histories do take notice of the <hi>Amazons</hi> of old, whose Fame in Arms is sufficiently known.</p>
                        <p>Although Noble women may not sit in Parliament, in respect of their Sex; yet they are in Law Peers of the Realm; and all or most of the prerogatives before mentioned, which to the Noblemen are belonging, do appertain unto them.</p>
                        <p>But the Opinion of some men have been, That a Countess, Baronness, and other women of great Estate, cannot maintain an Action upon the Statute <hi>de Scandalis magnatum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Statute 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. speaketh but of Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and of the Chancellor, Treasurer, Privy Seal, Steward of the King's Houshold, and other Nobles, great Officers of the Realm; by which words they conceive that the meanings of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that Statute was only to provide in that case for Noblemen, and not for Noble women.</p>
                        <p>Also if any of the King's Servants within the Check-Roll do conspire the death of any Noble woman, it is not Felony within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Statute 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
                        <p>Honourable women, as before noted, are of three sorts, by Creation, by Descent, and by Marriage. And the King may create any woman into any Title of Honour at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and the King by his Letters Patents o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly read in Parliament, without any other Investure, did create <hi>Mary Fane</hi> Widow, the sole Daughter of Baron of <hi>Aburgaveny, Baronness de le Spencer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Noble women by Descent are, either those to whom the Lands holden by such Dignity do descend as Heir, and they are said to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, by Tenure; or by whose worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, to whom they were Heirs, was seized of an Estate descendable to them in their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Dukedoms, Earldoms, or Baronies; or those whose Ancestors were summoned to Parliament, for hereby also Inheritance doth accrew to their Posterities.</p>
                        <p>Noble women are also those, who do take to their Husbands any Lord or Peer of the Realm, although they themselves were not of any degree of Nobility.</p>
                        <p>Question and doubt hath been made, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if a man be summoned to Parliament, and afterwards die without Issue Male, the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Title of Honour may descend to the Heir Female. And many Arguments have been <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> in that case, which at this time I purposely omit, because I have before discoursed thereof in the Chapter of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Title of Honour descenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Heir Female by reason of a Tenure of her Ancestors, there needs no more doubt to be made than of Offices of Honour, the which do much support the publick wealth, and being of Estate of Inheritance, do descend to the Heir Female, if there be no nearer Heir Male: As the Office of High Constableship of <hi>England</hi> challenged in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Advise and Resolution of the Judges, as by a note of that Case extant, whereof <hi>Dyer</hi> in his Reports hath a memorial 205. <hi>b. Kelway, the Sixth of Henry the Eighth</hi> 170. <hi>b.</hi> which descended to the Daughter of <hi>Humphrey de Bohune,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> as before is declared. The Office of the Lord Steward descended to <hi>Blaunch,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in whose right <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> her Husband en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the same. The like may be said of the Office of Earl-Marshal, which descended by an Heir Female unto the House of <hi>Norfolk</hi>: All which Offices are as unfit to be exercised
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50041:75"/>
by a Woman, as for a Woman of Honour to be summoned to the Parliament. And when a Title of Honour doth descend to a Woman, if question in Law do arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the said Noble woman and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person, whether she be of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Nobleness or no, the Issue shall be tried by the Record thereof, and by the King's Writ it shall be certified, and not by a Jury of twelve Men, even as it should have been in case her Ancestor had been party.</p>
                        <p>Although the Laws of the Realm regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly do make all the Daughters (where there are no Sons) equally to inherit Lands and Tenements, and to be but one Heir to their Ancestor; yet it is not so in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Dignity and Titles of Honour: for Inheritances concerning matter of Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things in their nature participating of Superiority and Eminency, are not partable amongst many, and therefore must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity descend unto one, and that is to the eldest Daughter, Sister, Aunt, or Cosin Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and inheritable where there is no Heirs Males that may lawfully challenge the same. And so in this point is the Civil Law.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, there was a Judgment in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, touching the descent of the Earldom of <hi>Chester,</hi> after the death of the Earl, who died without Issue, his Sisters being his Heirs; which Judgment was, That the said Earldom should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongst the said Copartners as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands; and that the eldest should not have it alone. But this Judgment was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Erroneous, even in those times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was given: For <hi>Bracton,</hi> a Learned Judge, who lived in that Age, writeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, treating of partition between Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Case</hi> 24. by which it is evident, That Baronies and Dignities of Honour do by the Laws of this Realm descend unto the eldest Copartner; and the Judgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven once to the contrary thereof, <hi>Bracton</hi> doth rightly account to be unjust: His Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is notable; <hi>Forasmuch as the Honour of the Chivalry of this Realm doth chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the Nobility, Reason would not that such Dignity should be divided amongst Copartners, whereby through multitude of partitions the reputation of Honour in such Succession, and so divided, might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, or the strenght of the Realm, being drawn into many hands, with decrease of livelyhood by such partition, should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled.</hi> In which Resolution <hi>Britton,</hi> the Learned Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> (who compiled his Book of the Laws of this Realm, by the Commandment, and in the Name of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First) accordeth, <hi>Britton</hi> 187. And therefore, howsoever the Judgment was given, or whensoever, it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less very evident that it was soon redressed: For if it were given upon the death of <hi>Ralph,</hi> the last of that Name Earl of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who died about the Seventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third without Issue, the Writers of that time do testifie, that the Earldom of <hi>Chester</hi> came wholly unto <hi>Iohn Scott,</hi> the Son of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> and <hi>Maud,</hi> the eldest Sisters of the said <hi>Ralph,</hi> if it were given upon the death of the said <hi>Iohn Scott,</hi> who died about the Four and twentieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third without Issue; yet notwithstanding the said Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment stood in force, for that the said King assumed the Earldom into his own Hands upon other satisfaction made to the said Sisters, Copartners of the said <hi>Iohn Scott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Sisters are allowed no differences of Badges in their Coat-Armour, by reason that by them the name of the House cannot be preserved, but are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Inheritance equally, and are adjudged but one Heir to all intents and purposes whatsoever. And the knowledge of this point in these days is worthy to be enquired into; for this is to be observed out of Presidents, and to be acknowledged of every dutiful Subject, that the King can advance to Honour whom he pleaseth: And therefore whereas <hi>Radulph Cromwell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Baron by Writ, died without Issue, having two Sisters and Coheirs; <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldest married unto Sir <hi>Thomas Nevill</hi> Knight, and <hi>Ioan</hi> the younger married to Sir <hi>Humphrey Bowcher,</hi> who was called to Parliament as Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and not the said Sir <hi>Thomas Nevill</hi> who married the eldest Sister. And <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> the first and greatest Earl of <hi>Chester, Habendum si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi &amp; haeredibus adeo libere per gladium sicut iple Rex tenuit Angliam per tenorem. Hugh</hi> died without Issue, and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Earldom was divided amongst his four Sisters, and the eldest had not the Seigniory entire unto herself.</p>

                        <p>But a Noble Woman by marriage, though she take to her second Husband a man of mean Degree, yet she may keep two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, according to the Proviso in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Case</hi> 13. for and in respect of the Honour which once she had, <hi>viz.</hi> at the time of the Retainer: And every such Chaplain may purchase Licence and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Chaplains may not be Non-residents afterwards.</p>
                        <p>And forasmuch as the retaining of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains by Ladies of great Estate is ordinary, and nevertheless some questions in Law have been concerning the true understanding of the said Statute Law; I think it not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to set down subsequent Resolutions of the Judges touching such matters.</p>
                        <p>So long as the Wife of a Duke is called Dutchess, or of an Earl a Countess, and have the fruition of the Honour appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Estate, with kneeling, tasting, serving; so long shall a Baron's Widow be saluted Lady, as is also a Knight's Wife by the courtesie of <hi>England, quamdi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>If a Lady which is married come through the Forest, she shall not take any thing; but a Dutchess, Marchioness, or Countess shall have advantage of the Statute <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Forest.</hi> 12 <hi>Artic.</hi> during the time that she is unmarried.</p>
                        <p>This is a Rule in the Civil Law, <hi>Si filia Regis nubat alicui Duci vel Comiti, ducetur tamen semper regalis.</hi> As amongst Noble Women there is a difference of Degrees, so according to their distinct Excellencies the Law doth give special priviledges, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: By the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it is High Treason to compass or imagine the death of the Queen, or to violate the King's Companion. The King's Response is a sole person, except by the Common Law; and she may purchase in Feesimple, or make Leases or Grants with the King; she may plead and be impleaded, which no other married Woman can do without her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                        <p>All Acts of Parliament for any cause, which any way may concern the Queen, are such Statutes whereof the Judges ought to take Recognizances as of general Statutes: though the matter doth only concern the capacity of the Queen, yet it doth also concern all the Subjects of the Realm; for every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath interest in the King, and none of his Subjects within his Laws are divided from the King, who is Head and Sovereign, so that his business concerns all the Realm: and as the Realm hath interest in the King, so and for the same Reason is the Queen, being his Wife.</p>
                        <p>A man seized of divers Lands in Fee holden by Knight's Service, some by Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (that is by ancient Feoffment holden of others) and some other part holden of the King in posteriority; the King granteth his Seigniory to the Queen during her life; and afterwards the Tenant dieth, his Son within Age: in this case he shall have the Wardship of the Body, and have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative even as the King himself should have had.</p>
                        <p>The Queen Consort or Dowager shall not be amerced, if she be Nonsuited in any Action or otherwise; in which case any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, of what degree soever, shall be amerced: for in that case the Queen
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50041:76"/>
shall participate of the King's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                        <p>But the Queen shall not in all cases have the same prerogative as the King; as for Example, Petition is all the remedy the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath when the King seizeth his Lands, or taketh away his Goods from him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Title by order of Law so to do, contrary to the Opinion of some ancient Books, as you may see <hi>Stamford</hi>'s <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, Case</hi> 19. But no such Suit shall be made to the Queen, but Actions as against other Lieges of the King, according as the Case shall require: For by the same Reason that the Queen may be Plaintiff or Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Actions without the King, by the same Reason she shall be Defendant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the part taking of such Prerogatives as do appertain to the King.</p>
                        <p>Against the King by his Prerogative <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tempus occurrit</hi>; but it is not so with the Queen, 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>a.</hi> And plenarily by six months is a good Plea in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought by <hi>Philip Regina Anglia, ibidem fol.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>b. Stamford</hi>'s <hi>Prerogative, Case</hi> 18. <hi>prope finem.</hi> In the 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 6. it is thus to be read; <hi>Note that a Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was sued forth against the Queen in a Writ which she brought, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, though she be a person exempt.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless by this short Case following may be observed, That the Justices do not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer any proceedings in Law against the Queen (Wife or Widow;) but will hold with their Immunities so much as by Law they may.</p>
                        <p>A Writ of Dower was brought against <hi>Isabel</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and Mother to the then King; and the Court said to the Plaintiff, <hi>The Queen is a person of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency, and we are of Opinion that she shall not answer to the Writ, but that she should be sued unto by Petition.</hi> And thereupon the Demandant <hi>dixit gratis,</hi> and she prayed the Court to grant a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Action until another day, so that in the mean time she might speak with the Queen: But the Court would not agree to make a Continuance; but said, That upon her request they might give day <hi>prae re per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> and so it was done; for the Queen's Counsel would not agree to a Continuance, for thereby the Queen shall be accepted as answerable.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I suppose that I have digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from any former purpose for making mention in those Cases concerning the Queen Consort: For notwithstanding the intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Sovereign King, yet she is no other than a King's Subject, whether she be of a Foreign Nation, or a Native born; and though she be by the favour of the King solemnly crowned Queen, yet that is but a Royal Ceremony, and no essential Exception, whereby she may not from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be accounted in the rank of Noble Women. And this hath been proved by the effect in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, when some of the Wives, crowned Queens, have been Arraigned of High Treason, and therefore put to Trial by the Nobles of the Realm as her Peers.</p>
                        <p>The Wife of the King's eldest Son hath also some Prerogatives in regard of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of her Husband, which the Wives of other Noblemen have not: For by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Thrteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, it is High Treason to violate the Wife of the King's eldest Son and Heir.</p>
                        <p>Dutchesses and Countesses have special Honours appertaining to their Estates; as Kneeling, Tasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things are more appertaining properly to the Heralds, than to be here treated of.</p>

                     <p>ALthough I am not of the Opinion of some that vainly derive the Order of Knighthood from St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, whom they term the <hi>primier Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>; yet I may say that it is near as ancient as Valour and Heroick Vertue, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Original from <hi>Troy,</hi> which bred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble and Renowned Knights; amongst which were <hi>Hector, Troilus, AEneas,</hi> and <hi>Antenor.</hi> So among the <hi>Greeks</hi> were <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon, Menelaus, Peleus, Hercules, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes, Telamon, Vlysses,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whose Military and Heroick Acts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased unto them a never dying Fame. And the <hi>Romans</hi> took so great care for the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and advancement of Heroick and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Vertue and Honour, that they erected and dedicated Temples to Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and from the infancy of their Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Glory they instituted a Society of Knights, which consisted of a select number. And some there are that plead to have Knighthood take its rise from <hi>Romulus</hi>: For, say they, that <hi>Romulus</hi> having settled his Government in <hi>Rome,</hi> partly for Security, and partly for magnificence, erected or inrolled three Bands or Centuries of Knighthood or Horsmen; the first he called <hi>Romene</hi> from his own Name; the second <hi>Titience</hi> from <hi>Titus Tacitus</hi>; and the third <hi>Luceria,</hi> whereof mention is made by <hi>Livy.</hi> And this Inrollment consisted of Three hundred stout and personable men, chosen out of the chiefest Families, and were to attend him as his Life-guard, both in Peace and War, and were called <hi>Celeres,</hi> or <hi>Equites,</hi> from their personal Valour and dexterity in Martial Affairs.</p>
                     <p>And to add to the Honour of Knighthood, the <hi>Romans</hi> oft-times made the Knights Judges for the management of their Civil Affairs, yet continued they of the Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian Order.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> called their Knights <hi>Milites,</hi> or <hi>Miles,</hi> and <hi>Equites,</hi> or <hi>Equites Aurati</hi>; the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards, Cavalieri</hi>; the <hi>French, Chevaliers</hi>; and the <hi>English, Knights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Addition of <hi>Sir</hi> is attributed to the Names of all Knights, as Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and the like. And to Baronets the said Addition of <hi>Sir</hi> is granted unto them by a peculiar Clause in their Patents of Creation, although they are not dubbed Knights.</p>
                     <p>No man is born a Knight of any Title or Degree whatsoever, but made so; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>The Ensigns or Ornaments belonging to Knighthood are many, each Country or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom having those peculiar to it self: I shall name some of the chief.</p>
                     <p>To the Knights of the Equestrian Order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> was given a Horse, or a Gold Ring. The <hi>Germans</hi> gave the Badge of the Shield and Launce. The <hi>French</hi> anciently gave also the Shield and Launce (as <hi>Favin</hi> notes) but since they used the Equestrian Target.</p>
                     <p>Another Knightly Ornament is the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Belt, first made of Leather, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came to be richly adorned with Gold and precious Stones; and to this Belt was added a Sword. Other Ornaments were gilt or golden Spurs, and golden Collars of SS. But these have been for a long time laid aside; and instead thereof is only used Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing with a naked Sword to Knights Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, which I shall speak of when I treat of Knights Batchelors.</p>
                     <p>Many have been, and yet are, the Degrees and Order of Knighthood in Christendom, each Kingdom having some appropriated to themselves: which though many of them are now extinct; yet I shall touch upon them, as I find them Recorded by Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> in his Volume of <hi>Honour Military and Civil,</hi> and by <hi>Elias Ashmole,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> in his incomparable Volume of the <hi>Order of the Garter,</hi> to which I refer the Curious Reader for his further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And of these Degrees or Orders I shall first treat of those used amongst us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with that of the most Noble Order of the Garter; next with the Knights Bannerets; then with Baronets, this being their proper place according to precedency, although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing improper, as not being of any degree of Knighthood; next with Knights of the Bath; then with Knights Batchelors; and so conclude with those Degrees of Knighthood in Foreign Kingdoms and Countries.</p>

                     <head>KNIGHTS Of the most Noble Order of the Garter, OR S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> GEORGE. CHAP. XVII.</head>
                     <p>IT was the custome and policy of puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Princes in all Ages to invite and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themselves persons of Renown, and such Heroick Spirits were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with Remarks of Honour, (<hi>viz.</hi> eminent priviledges of Place, different Habits, and additional Titles) to distinguish them from the Vulgar, besides other opulent Rewards: And amongst those persons, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or excellent of merit were placed in a Superior Orb, that their Glory might be the more splendid to the World. Such were King <hi>David</hi>'s mighty men, the <hi>Satrapae</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> the Orders Military amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the many Institutions of Knighthood in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome: But of all Orders purely Military now extant, I must prefer this of St. <hi>George,</hi> which we call the Garter; not only because it is our own Nation, or that none are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted but Peers, but for the excellency of it self.</p>
                     <p>First, for its Antiquity; Secondly, for its glorious Institution by that Renowned King <hi>Edward</hi>; And thirdly, for the many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Kings, and Princes that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the said Fraternity.</p>
                     <p>First, I find it agreable to all Histories, that 'twas instituted by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Anno</hi> 1350. which was fifty years before the Instituting the <hi>French</hi> Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh; Two hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine years before <hi>Henry</hi> the Third devised the new Order of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> full Eighty years before the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> was instituted by <hi>Philip the Good</hi> of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>; One hundred and ninety years before King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth refined the Order of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and nine years before the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> begun the Order of the <hi>Elephant</hi>; which gives it clearly the pre-eminency before other Orders in point of Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50041:83"/>For the occasion of the pristine Institution you must know, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving engaged himself in a War with <hi>France</hi> (for the obtaining of that Crown which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on him in right of his Mother) thought fit to allure to his party all such Gallant Spirits as were Friends to <hi>Bellona</hi>; and to that end erected a Round Table in the Castle of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> in imitation of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> where they were exercised at Tilts and Tournaments, and Royally entertained with magnificent Feasts and other Princely Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to engage them unto him. But <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Vallois,</hi> who was in actual possession of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> countermined him by ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a like Table in his own Court, whereby he drew away many from King <hi>Edward,</hi> so that being disappointed in that Project, and yet proving victorious in his Arms against <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> at his Return he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the most eminent of those Heroick Knights that had born the brunt of the Day, and persevered in their Loyalty, with this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order, which consisted of Six and twenty, of which himself was one; being all persons of choice Endowments, of great renown in Chivalry, and such as should be bound by Oath and Honour to adhere unto him. And upon the death of any one of them, the place was to be supplied by another, elected by the King and his Successors, who are Sovereigns of the said Order, with the consent of the Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but now the Election is at the entire plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the King.</p>
                     <p>Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> are many Articles confirmed unto them, to which all that are enstalled Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, besides the forementioned Oath, <hi>viz.</hi> that whilst they shall be Fellows of the Order they will defend the Honour, Quarrels, Rights and Lordships of the Sovereign; that they will endeavour to preserve the Honour of the said Order, and all the Statutes made for the same, without fraud or covin, <hi>Quinam perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also esteemed most Honourable, there having been more Emperors, Kings, and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes of this one Order, than of all others in a manner in the World; which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is obtained by keeping precisely to the primitive Number, never exceeding Six and twenty; whereas all others of this kind have been so frankly communicated unto all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, that at last they lost their lustre and esteem in the World. Of this Order there hath been no less than eight Emperors, seven Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> two Kings of <hi>Scots</hi> before the Union, five Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> three of <hi>Naples,</hi> one of <hi>Poland,</hi> and two of <hi>Sueden,</hi> besides many Foreign Sovereign Princes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> The Order and Institution being Honourable, and by many Learned Pens sufficiently cleared from the envy of <hi>Froysart,</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> men; as also from the folly of <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> who favours the Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Story of the fair Countess of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who being a dancing with the said King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> let fall her Garter, which the King took up and tied about his Leg; at which the Queen being jealous, he gave this Motto, <hi>Honi sort qui mal y pense,</hi> that is, Evil be to him that evil thinks.</p>
                     <p>The Patron of this Order is St. <hi>George,</hi> a Man of great Renown for Chivalry; he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom at <hi>Lydda</hi> under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>; supposed by Dr. <hi>Helyn</hi> to have been martyrred at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Seat then of the Eastern Empire; and by others at <hi>Diosprilia</hi> or <hi>Lyddea</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> where he is said to be interred; whose Fame was so great in the World, that many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Monasteries were dedicated to him in the Eastern Countries, from whence his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem came into <hi>England,</hi> who celebrated to his memory the Three and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> with the rest of the Universal Church: But how long he has been honoured as Patron and Protector of <hi>England</hi> is disputable; Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> concludes before the Conquest; <hi>And 'tis no marvel</hi> (saith he) <hi>that so warlike a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should make choice of such a Souldier-Saint, known by the particular name of</hi> Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheophorus, <hi>of greater eminency in both the Eastern and Western Churches than any other Souldier-Saint.</hi> To this Tutelary Saint or Patron of Martial men King <hi>Edward</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himself and his Companions, called <hi>The Knights of St. George</hi>: And having both beautified and enlarged his Castle at <hi>Windsor</hi> to be the Royal Seat of this Order, he caused a solemn Proclamation to be made in <hi>France, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> to invite all Military Spirits to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend those Tilts and Tournaments which were intended to be kept, not only on St. <hi>George</hi>'s day then next ensuing, which was designed for the day of Institution, but for fifteen days before, and as many after; and that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of St. <hi>George</hi> might be still continued, he gave them for a part of their daily Habit the Image of St. <hi>George</hi> encountring with the Dragon or Devil, inchased with Pearls and precious Stones, appendant to a blue Ribon, continually to be worn about their necks.</p>
                     <p>As for the Habit of this Order, besides the <hi>George</hi> and Ribon before mentioned, and a Garter enamelled with Gold, Pearl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, with the Motto, <hi>Honi soit qui mal y pense</hi> embroydered upon it, which is fastned about the left Leg with a buckle of Gold, from whence they were called <hi>Knights of the Garter,</hi> and without these two Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments none of these Knights are to appear in publique; There also properly belongs to this Order a Cassock of crimson Velvet, and a Mantle and Hood of purple Velvet, lined with white Sarsnet, on the left shoulder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is an Escocheon of St. <hi>George</hi> embroidered with a Garter, within the Motto: The Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon is Argent, a Cross, Gules. But these
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50041:83"/>
to be worn only upon St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, and when it shall please the Sovereign to celebrate the Ceremonies of the Installations. To each Knight belongs a Collar of the Order made of pure Gold, weighing thirty Ounces of <hi>Troy</hi> weight, composed of Garters and Roses, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelled with Roses red and white; and since the coming of King <hi>Iames,</hi> there hath been an intermixture of Thistles; the Image of St. <hi>George</hi> enriched with precious Stones appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to it, to be worn over all the Robes at St. <hi>George</hi>'s Feast, and over their ordinary Cloaks, upon all such days on which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign is bound by Statute to make Offerings. Also besides these Robes and Ornaments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Founder, it was ordered by K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first, That all Knights should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wear upon their Cloaks or Coats, on the left side, a Star of Silver imbroidery, with the Escocheon of St. <hi>George</hi> within the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Center of it. But the Habit doth more lively appear by the Pourtraiture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the Habit of the said Order.</p>
                     <p>In some of these Habiliments these Knights are attired in publick, as the diversity of the occasion requireth; but always in their state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest Robes and richest Collars when the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of the Order are to be performed, that is, the celebrating of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Feast, and in the Act of their Installations, in the Free Chappel of St. <hi>George,</hi> built within the verge and limits of the Castle, at the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof was appointed a Dean, Prebends, and poor Gentlemen established, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with Stipends, by the Name of <hi>Knights</hi> (or <hi>poor Knights</hi>) <hi>of Windsor,</hi> who have provided for them Robes of Cloth according to them of their Order, who are to pray for the Order. Concerning the Ceremony of the Installation you are to know, that every Knight is bound to fasten an Escocheon of their Arms on a plate of Metal on their several Stalls, with an Inscription of their Names, Titles, and Honour, which they remove as they are advanced in order higher. And in this order they also advance their Banners, Swords, and Helmets, which are continually over their Stalls during their being of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that plate of their Arms being left unto the Stall in which they last sate; the Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken down to make room for such as succeed unto the deceased or higher removed Knights, touching which they are placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Seniority of their Creations, and not according to their Dignities and Titles of Honour; so that sometimes a Knight Batchelor hath place before an Earl or Duke; as not long since Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> Knight, Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Armory, had precedency of the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> besides Earls and Barons: only in honour to Strangers who are Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Sons or Brothers to such, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Rule of Order that they take place according to the quality of these persons; but this by a late Indulgence. Anciently if a King crowned came in place of a Knight Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor, he sate there without any difference; but this alteration was made, as 'tis supposed, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in reference to Foreign Princes; the rest continue in their Stalls where first seated; so that the Sovereign reserved to themselves the power once in their Lives (so saith the Statute) to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral translation of all the Stalls, except of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Foreign Princes, which order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to this day.</p>
                     <p>Much may be said in honour of this Noble Order: but it being so well and accurately treated of by that great Antiquary <hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> in a large Volume in Folio lately published by him, entituled <hi>The Institution, Laws, and Ceremonies of the most Noble Order of the Garter,</hi> that nothing more can be said thereof, which he hath illustrated with great variety of useful &amp; ornamental Sculptures; I shall therefore conclude by setting down the Heads of the several Chapters and Sections by him so learnedly treated of, recommending to the Reader the said Volume as a Work fit to adorn and enrich the Libraries of the most Curious.</p>

                     <head>OF Knights Bannerets. CHAP. XVIII.</head>
                     <p>THIS Degree of Knighthood, called by some <hi>Equites Vexilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii,</hi> or <hi>Chevaliers a Banier,</hi> is a most ancient Order, having been used in <hi>England</hi> ever since King <hi>Edward</hi> the First; and hath been always conferred on most deserving persons for their signal Valour, as I shall anon take occasion to speak of.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the Judgment of some Antiquaries, that these Bannerets were once used as a part of the three States of the Realm; and that it was the Custome of Kings hertofore to summon by Writ the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, with such other worthy persons of this Order as they thought fit to call to consult about the Publick Affairs of the Kingdom; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thus assembled were then called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that those Bannerets often serving their King and Country, in process of time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name of Barons, and were admitted into the Peerage, and had their Titles affixed to them and their Heirs. And this was the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suage and custome of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult their Affairs without the election of the Commons, as both <hi>Ethelred</hi> and <hi>Edwin</hi> did. But whether this be a truth, or only opinion, I leave to others to dispute.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is, they always retained some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Honour equal to the Nobility, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to bear their Arms with Supporters, which is denied to all others under the Degree of a Baron: Also they take place before all Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and Barons younger Sons; as also before all Baronets, and were of such esteem, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Knights Batchelors and Esquires have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under them.</p>
                     <p>This Order in <hi>France</hi> was Hereditary, but with us only for life to the meritorious person; yet esteemed a Glory and Honour to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The Ceremony of their Creation is most Noble: The King (or his General, which is very rare) at the head of his Army (drawn up into Battalia after a Victory) under the Royal Standard displayed, attended with all the Field Officers and Nobles af the Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Knight led between two renowned Knights or valiant Men at Arms, having his Pennon or Guydon of Arms in his Hand; and before them the Heralds, who proclaim his valiant Atchievements, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be made a Knight Banneret, and to display his Banner in the Field; then the King (or General) says unto him, <hi>Advances toy Banneret,</hi> and causeth the point of his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to be rent of; and the new Knight having the Trumpets before him sounding, the Nobles and Officers accompanying him, is remitted to his Tent, where they are nobly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>To this degree of Knighthood doth belong peculiar Robes and other Ornaments at their Creation.</p>
                     <p>A Banneret thus made may bear his Banner displayed in an Army Royal, and set his Arms thereon with Supporters, as may the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                     <p>Of this Order there is at present none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and the last I read of was Sir <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> made so after <hi>Edghill</hi> fight (for rescuing the King's Standard from the Rebels in that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel) who was afterwards flain in his said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service at <hi>Alresford</hi> in <hi>Hantshire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this degree of Honour Sir <hi>William de la More</hi> (Ancestor to the present <hi>Edward More</hi> of <hi>More-hall</hi> and <hi>Bank-hall</hi> in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr>) was advanced by <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince for his eminent Service done at the Battel of <hi>Poictiers</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <head>OF BARONETS. CHAP. XIX.</head>
                     <p>THE lowest degree of Honour that is Hereditary is this of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets, which was instituted by King <hi>Iames</hi> in the ninth year of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. They are created by Patent under the Great Seal, a form of which I shall here set down, which are generally all of one form; <hi>viz.</hi> to a Man and the Heirs Males of his Body lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; yet sometimes the Honour is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise entailed for want of Issue Male. And the Proeme or Argument of the said Patent being for the propagating a Plantation in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Vlster</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which the aid of these Knights was ordained, or for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Thirty Souldiers each of them in <hi>Ireland</hi> for three years, after the rate of eight pence sterling <hi>per diem,</hi> which at first was payed into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> at a lump, upon the passing their Patents; which with the Fees of Honour due to Officers, amounted to above One thousand pounds a Man.</p>
                     <p>Their Titles are to descend as aforesaid; and they have precedency before all Knights, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those of the Garter, Bannerets, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellors: they are styled Baronets in all Writs, Commissions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the addition of <hi>Sir</hi> is attributed unto them, as the title of <hi>Lady</hi> is to their Wives.</p>
                     <p>They are to take place according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the date of their Patents, and no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be created between Baronets and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
                     <p>At the first instituting of this Order King <hi>Iames</hi> engaged that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>

                        </gap>r Male should be extinct, there should never any more be created in their room, but that the title should diminish to the honour of them remaining. But afterwards a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ordained to fill up the vacant places, who had instructions also enacted, by which the Commissioners were impowered to treat with others that desired to be admitted into the said Dignity, which is now allowed without limitation; yet with this Proviso, that they be of good Reputation, and descended of a Grandfather at the least by the Father's side that bare Arms, and have also a certain yearly Revenue of One thousand pounds <hi>per Annum de claro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also ordained that they and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants, <hi>viz.</hi> their eldest Sons, attaining the full Age of One and twenty years, may receive Knighthood; and that they shall in a Canton, or in an Escocheon (which they please) bear the Arms of <hi>Vlster, viz.</hi> in a Field Argent, a sinister hand couped at the wrist, Gules. In the King's Army Royal they have place in the gross near the King's Standard, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed some peculiar Solemnities for their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
                     <p>Since the first Creation of Baronets in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there hath been several made after the like manner in <hi>Ireland</hi>; as also the Knights of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> in the <hi>West Indies</hi> by King <hi>Iames</hi> upon the like design, that is, for planting that Country by the <hi>Scotch Colonies,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <head>By the King. THE INSTRUCTIONS Within mentioned to be observed by Our COMMISSIONERS WITHIN NAMED.</head>
                        <p>FOrasmuch as We have been pleased to authorize you to treat and conclude with a certain number of Knights and Esquires, as they shall present themselves unto you with such offers of assistance for the service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Conditions as are contained in these Presents, wherein We do repose great trust and confidence in your discretions and integrities, knowing well, that in such cases there are so many circumstances incident, as require a choice care and consideration: We do hereby require you to take such course as may make known abroad both Our purpose, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given unto you, That by the more publick notice thereof, those persons who are disposed to advance so good a Work, may in time understand where and to whom to address themselves for the same; For which purpose We require you to appoint some certain place and times for their Access: which We think fittest to be at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Chamber at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> upon Wednesdays and Fridays in the Afternoon, where you shall make known to them (as they come) that those who desire to be admitted into the Dignity of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, must maintain the number of thirty foot Souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for three years, after the rate of eight pence sterling money of <hi>England</hi> by the day; And the wages of one whole year to be paid into Our Receipt, upon the passing of the Patent.</p>
                        <p>Provided always, that you proceed with none, except it shall appear unto you upon good proof, that they are men for quality, state of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and good reputation, worthy of the same; And that they are at the least descended of a Grandfather by the Father's side that bare Arms; and have also of certain yearly revenue in Lands of inheritance in possession, One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds <hi>per Annum de claro</hi>; or Lands of the old Rent, as good (in accompt) as One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> of improved Rents, or at the least two parts in three parts to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Lands, to the said values in possession, and the other third part in reversion, expectant upon one life only, holding by Dower or in Ioynture.</p>
                        <p>And for the Order to be observed in ranking those that shall receive the Dignity of a Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, although it is to be wished, that those Knights which have now place before other Knights (in respect of the time of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may be ranked before others (<hi>Caeteris paribus</hi>) yet because this is a Dignity which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50041:93"/>
shall be Hereditary, wherein divers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are more considerable, than such a Mark as is but Temporary (that is to say of being now a Knight, in time before another) Our pleasure is, you shall not be so precise, in placing those that shall receive this Dignity, but that an Esquire of great Antiquity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Living, may be ranked in this choice before some Knights. And so (of Knights) a man of greater living, more remarkable for his house, years, or calling in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, may be now preferred in this Degree, before one that was made a Knight before him.</p>
                        <p>Next, because there is nothing of Honour, or of Value, which is known to be sought or desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (be the Motives never so good) but may receive scandal from some, who (wanting the same good affection to the Publick) or being in other considerations incapable, can be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of envy to those that are so preferred, to cast aspersions and imputations upon them; As if they came by this Dignity for any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, but that which concerneth this so publick and memorable a work, you shall take order, That the party who shall receive this Dignity, may take his Oath, that neither he (nor any for him) hath directly or indirectly given any more for attaining the Degree, or any Precedency in it, than that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the maintenance of the number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in such sort as aforesaid, saving the charges of passing his Patent.</p>
                        <p>And because We are not Ignorant, that in the distribution of all Honours, most men will be desirous to attain to so high a place as they may, in the Iudgment whereof (being matter of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) there cannot be too great caution used to avoid the interruption that private partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may breed in so worthy a Competition.</p>
                        <p>Forasmnch as it is well known, that it can concern no other person so much to prevent all such Inconveniencies, as it must do our self, from whom all Honour and Dignity (either Temporary or Hereditary) hath his only root and beginning, You shall publish and declare to all whom it may concern, That for the better warrant of your own Actions, in this matter of Precedency (wherein We find you so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to avoid all just Exceptions) We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon view of all those Patents, which shall be subscribed by you, before the same pass Our Great Seal, to take the especial care upon Vs, to order and rank every man in his due place; And therein always to use the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar counsel and advice that you our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners shall give Vs, of whose integrity and circumspection We have so good experience, and are so well perswaded, as We assure Our self, you will use all the best means you may to inform your own Iudgments in cases doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, before you deliver Vs any such opinion as may lead Vs in a case of this Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our intention is (by due consideration of all necessary circumstances) to give every man that satisfaction which standeth with Honour and Reason.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, having now directed you, how and with what caution you are to entertain the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of such as shall present themselves for this Dignity, We do also require you to observe these two things. The one, That every such person as shall be admitted, do enter into suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bond or Recognizance to Our use, for the payment of that portion which shall be remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the first payment is made, which you are to see paid upon delivery of the Letters Patents: The other, That seeing this Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for so publick an Action is the motive of this Dignity, and that the greatest good which may be expected upon this Plantation, will depend upon the certain payment of those Forces which shall be fit to be maintained in that Kingdom, until the same be well established, the charge whereof will be born with the greater difficulty, if We be not eased by some such extraordinary means; we require you Our Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> so to order this Receipt, as no part thereof be mixed with Our other Treasure, but kept apart by it self, to be wholly converted to that use to which it is given and intended; And in regard thereof, that you assign it to be received, and the Bonds to be kept by some such particular person as you shall think good to appoint, who upon the payment of every several portion, shall both deliver out the Bonds, and give his Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the same. For which this shall be yours and his the said Receiver's sufficient Warrant in that behalf.</p>

                     <head>KNIGHTS OF THE BATH. CHAP. XX.</head>
                     <p>KNights of the Bath (so called from part of the Ceremony at their Creation) are commonly made at the Coronation of a King or Queen, at the Creation of a Prince, or of a Duke of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Thus at the Creation of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son of King <hi>Iames,</hi> Knights of the Bath were made; and at the Coronation of our dread Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, 68 were made, whose Names you will find in the ensuing Catalogue.</p>
                     <p>This Order was first erected, saith <hi>Froysard,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1399. by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who to add to the lustre of his Coronation, created 46 Knights of the Bath; and Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> thinks them more ancient: But that great Antiquary <hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> is of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the said King did not constitute, but rather restore the ancient manner of making Knights; for formerly Knights Batchelors were created by Ecclesiasticks with the like Ceremonies, and being thus brought again into use, and made peculiar to the Degree of Knights of the Bath, they have ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ince continued: and the better to maintain this his Opinion, saith, That they have neither Laws nor Statutes assigned them; neither are they to wear their Robes, but upon the time or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity for which they were created (except the red Ribbon which they are allowed always to wear cross their left Shoulder;) and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any vacancy their number (which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) is not supplyed.</p>
                     <p>They are created with much noble Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and have had Princes and the prime of the Nobility of their Fellowship. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner of their Creation is mentioned by many Authors, but most exactly described, and illustrated with Figures of all the Ceremonies, by the learned Hand of <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dugdale</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                        <hi>Norroy</hi> King at Arms, in his Description of <hi>VVarwickshire,</hi> to which laborious Peece I refer the curious Reader, borrowing from him, and some others, this small abstract of their Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>When one is to be made a Knight of this Order, at his coming to Court he is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received by the Chief Officers and Nobles of the Court, and hath two Esquires appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wait upon him, who convey him to the Chamber without more seeing him that day, where he is to be entertained with Musick; then a Bath is to be prepared by the Barber, who is to trim him; and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50041:103"/>
King being informed that he is ready for the Bath, he is by the most grave Knights there present instructed in the Orders and Fees of Chivalry, the Musick playing to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door; then they hearing the Musick shall undress him, and put him naked into the Bath, and the Musick ceasing, some one of the Knights shall say, <hi>Be this an honourable Bath unto you:</hi> then shall he be conveyed to his Bed, which shall be plain and without Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and so soon as he is dry, they shall help to dress him, putting over his inward Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Rus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et Robe with long sleeves, and a Hood like unto that of an Hermit; and the Barber shall take all that is within and without the Bath, with his Collar about his Neck, for his Fees: then shall he be conducted to the Chappel with Musick, where being entred, the Knights and Esquires shall be entertained with Wine and Spices for their favours done unto him; then they take their leaves of him, and he and his two Esquires and a Priest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms a Vigil till almost day, with Prayers and Offerings, beseeching God, and his blessed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make him worthy of that Dignity; and being confessed, he shall, with one of the Governours, hold a Taper till the reading of the Gospel; and then he shall give it to one of the Esquires to hold till the Gospel is ended; and at the elevation of the Host, one of the Governours shall take the Hood from the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire, and after deliver it again till the Gospel <hi>in principio,</hi> and at the beginning take the Hood again, and give him the Taper again in his hand, having a penny ready near the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick, at the words <hi>Verbum caro factum est,</hi> the Esquire kneeling, shall offer the Taper to the Honour of God, and a penny to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the person that makes him a Knight: This Ceremony being ended, he shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to his Chamber for some repose until the King's pleasure is known; and then he is dressed and attended into the Hall, which is ready for his Reception, being girded with a Girdle of white Leather without Buckles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Coif on his Head, Mantles of Silk over a Kirtle of red <hi>Tartarin,</hi> tied with a lace of white silk, with a pair of white Gloves hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ends of the Lace; and this Attire is the Chandlers Fees: Then he is conducted by the Knights on Horsback to the King's Hall, with his Sword and his Spurs hanging at the Pomel of the Sword, being carried before him; and the Marshal and Ushers meeting him, do desire him to alight; the Marshal shall take his Horse for his Fee: and being brought to the high and second Table, with his Sword being held upright before him, the King coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall doth ask for the Sword and Spurs, which the Chamberlain shall take and shew the King, who takes the right Spur and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it to the most Noble Person there, wishing him to put it on the Esquire, which being done, a Knight puts on the left Spur; then the King taking the Sword, which he girts about him, and putting his Arms about his Neck, saith, <hi>Be thou a good Knight,</hi> and after kisseth him; then he is conducted to the Chappel, and kneeling with his right hand lying on the high Altar, he promiseth to maintain the Rites of Holy Church until his death; and ungirting his Sword with great Devotion he offereth it there to God; then at his going out the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Cook, who is there ready to take off his Spurs, shall say, <hi>I the King's Master Cook am come to receive thy Spurs for my fee, and if you do any thing contrary to the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (which God forbid) I shall back your Spurs from your heels.</hi> Then he is conducted again into the Hall, where he shall sit at Table with the Knights; and being risen and retired into his Chamber, his Attire is taken off, and again clothed with a blew Robe, having on his left Shoulder a Lace of white Silk hanging, to be worn upon all his Garments from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till he have gained some Honour and Renown for some Feats of Arms, or some Prince or Lady of Quality cut that Lace from his Shoulder. After Dinner the Knights must come to the Knight, and conduct him into the King's presence, to return him thanks for these Honours, and so takes his leave of the King; and the Governours craving his pardon for any miscarriage, and claiming their Fees according to the Custom of the Court, also take their leaves of the Knight. I shall conclude this Chapter with giving an Account of the Knights made at the Coronation of his Majesty.</p>

                     <p>THE particular kinds of Services by which Lands of Inheritance are distinguished, are two; <hi>viz.</hi> Knights of Service, and Knights of Soccage.</p>

                     <p>And as Knights-Service-Land requireth the service of the Tenant in Warfare and Battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, so Soccage-Tenure commandeth the attendance at the Plough; the one by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood defending the King, or his Lord's life and person; the other by industry maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Rents, Corn, and Victuals his Estate and Family.</p>
                     <p>For Kings did thus order their own Lands and Tenements: one part they kept and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their own hands, and in them stately Houses and Castles were erected, and made for their habitations, and defence of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and of the Realm; also Forests and Parks were there made for their Majesties Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: One other part thereof was given to the Nobles, and others of their Chivalry, reserving Tenure by Knights Service: The third part was bestowed upon men of meaner condition and quality, with reservation of Soccage-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure. And in this manner the Dukes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles amongst their Menials and Followers dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated a great part of their Lands; <hi>viz.</hi> to their Gentlemen of quality, to hold by Knights Service, and to other of meaner condition by Soccage-Tenure.</p>

the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> hath in effect as followeth: Until the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the First (saith he) the Kings used not to receive Money of their Lands, but Victuals for the provision of their House; and towards the payment of their Souldiers wages, and for such like Charges, money was raised out of the Cities and Castles in which Husbandry was not exercised: But at the length, when the Kings being in parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, needed ready money for and towards the furniture of their Wars, and the Subjects and Farmers complained they were grievously troubled by carriage of Victuals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sundry parts of the Realm far distant from their Habitations, the Kings directed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to certain discreet persons, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regard to those Victuals, should reduce them into reasonable sums of money, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of which they appointed to the Sheriff, taking order withal that he should pay them at the Scale or Beam, that is to say, that he should pay six pence over and above every pound weight of money, because he thought that the money would wax so much the worse for the wearing.</p>
                     <p>And it was anciently ordained, That all Knights Fees should come unto the eldest Son by succession of Heritage, whereby he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his Ancestor in the whole Inheritance, might be the better able to maintain War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King's Enemies, or his Lords; and that the Soccage of Freehold be partable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Male Children, to enable them to encrease into many Families for the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>But as nothing is more unconstant than the Estates we have in Lands and Livings, even so long since these Tenures have been so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently mixt and confounded in the hands of each sort, that there is not now any note of difference to be gathered by them. <hi>Lambert Peramb. of Kent,</hi> 10. <hi>Et quia tale serviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um forinsecum non semper manet sub eadem quantitate, sed quandoque praestatur ad plus, quandoque ad minus; ideo eo quantitate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis servitii, &amp; qualitate fiat mentio in charta, ut tenens certum tenere possit, quid &amp; quantum persolvere teneatur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore the certainty of the Law in this case is, That he that holdeth by a whole and entire Knight's Fee must serve the King, or his other Lord, forty days in the Wars well and sufficiently arrayed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at all points: and by twenty days if he hold by a moiety of a Knights Fee; and so proportionable.</p>
                     <p>And in the Seventh of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 246. it was demurred in Judgment, Whether Forty days shall be accounted from the first day that the King did first enter into <hi>Scotland</hi>; but it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the days shall be accompted from the first day that the King doth enter into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> because the Service is to be done out of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>And they that hold <hi>per Regale servitium,</hi> are not to perform that Service, unless the King do also go himself into the Wars in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Person, by the Opinion of Sir <hi>VVilliam Earle</hi> Chief Justice of the <hi>Common Pleas, Irium Sept. Edw.</hi> 3. 246. but <hi>vide</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>tit. Protection</hi> 2. in which Case it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That seeing the Protector (who was <hi>Prorex</hi>) went, the same was adjudged a Voyage Royal.</p>
                     <p>Also before the Statute <hi>de quia emptores terrarum,</hi> which was made <hi>decimo octavo Edw.</hi> 1. the King or other Lord had given Lands to a Knight to hold of him by Service and Chivalry (<hi>scil.</hi>) to go with the King, or with his Lord, when the King doth make a Voyage Royal to subdue his Enemies, by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days well and conveniently arrayed for the War. In this Case the Law hath such regard to the Dignity of Knighthood, that he may find an able person to go for him, and the Knight is not compelled by his Tenure to go in person as ordinary Souldiers, who are hired or retained by Prest-money or Wages.</p>
                     <p>There hath been many and varying Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the contraries of a Knight's Fee, as you may read in <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>ninth Part</hi> 122. and there it is proved, that Antiquity hath thought that Twenty pounds in Land was sufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Degree of Knighthood; as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ancient Treatise <hi>De modo tenendi Parliamentum tempore Regis Edwardi, filii Regis Ethelred</hi>; which also doth concur with the Act of Parliament <hi>Anno primo Edw.</hi> 2. <hi>de militibus:</hi> by which Act of Parliament <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus militis,</hi> the Estate of a Knight was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the value of Twenty pound Lands <hi>per Annum,</hi> and not by any certain content of Acres. And with this doth agree the Statute of <hi>VVestminster, cap.</hi> 35. <hi>&amp; Fitz. Nat. Brev.</hi> 82. where Twenty pounds Land <hi>per Annum</hi> in Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage is put in equipage with a Knight's Fee. And this is the most reasonable estimation; for one Acre may be more worth in value than many others.</p>
                     <p>And it is to be observed, That the relief of a Knight, and of all Superiors that be Noble, is the fourth part of their Revenue by the year; as of a Knight five pounds, and so of the rest.</p>
                     <p>And because this Tenure doth concern Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in War, the Tenants are therefore called <hi>Milites Militia</hi>: for though the word doth properly signifie a Souldier, yet antiquity hath appropriated that name to the chiefest of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Profession. In our Law they are styled <hi>Milites,</hi> and never <hi>Equites</hi>; yet so, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> is taken for the self same that Chivalry is. <hi>Bracton fol.</hi> 79. maketh mention of Rode Knights, that is to say, serving Horsmen, who held their Lands with condition that they should serve their Lords on Horsback. And so by cutting off a peece of a Name (as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is to speak short) this name Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50041:109"/>
with us; for Armiger, <hi>scil.</hi> the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which is a Degree under the Knight, was in the Military Service to serve on foot.</p>
                     <p>Note, He that holdeth by a whole Knight's Fee, must be with the King Forty days well and compleatly arrayed for the War, which is to be understood to serve on Horseback. And in all Nations the name of this Dignity is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Horses; for the <hi>Italians</hi> call them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velieri</hi>; the <hi>Frenchmen Chivaleris</hi>; the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Regters</hi>; our <hi>Britains, Murgeghe,</hi> all riding; and in <hi>Latin</hi> we call them <hi>Equites au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati</hi>; for at their Creations, besides the Sword and Girdle, gilt Spurs were added for more Ornament. And when a Knight doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any offence for which he is by the Law to suffer death, the use hath been in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his punishment to degrade and deprive him publickly of his Honour of Knighthood (for it is but with life leas'd, or taken away, <hi>Mills</hi> 81.) by ungirding his Military Girdle, by taking away his Sword, and broken, his Spurs cut off with an Hatchet, his Gauntlets pluck't from him, and the Escocheons of his Arms reversed.</p>
                     <p>And in the Statute made 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. entituled an Act for Reformation of Apparel, It was permitted for Knights to wear a Collar of Gold, named the Collar of SS.</p>
                     <p>And although this Dignity of Knighthood had its original, and was given to men of War and Prowess; yet in all Successions of Ages, and in all Nations, the same also is bestowed upon men of Peace by the Sovereign Power to deserving persons, whereby the Service of the Commonwealth at home is made equal with that abroad: For as <hi>Tully</hi> saith truly, <hi>Parvi sunt arma foris, nisi est consilium domi.</hi> But Experience, the faithfullest Counsellor and best Mistress, hath made it manifest both in this modern Age, as well as in that of <hi>Tullie's,</hi> that the Camp hath bred more eminent States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and happily as good Politicians, as the long Robe: Perhaps for this Reason, one aims chiefly at Glory and Honour, which easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts admirers and favourers; the other at Riches and indirect Negotiations, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Envy and private Enemies.</p>
                     <p>He that receiveth the Dignity of a Knight kneeleth down, and then the King slightly smiteth him upon his Shoulder, and saith unto him these words in <hi>French, Sois Chivaler au nome de Dieu</hi>; and afterwards saith moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Avance Chivaler</hi>: See the Book of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour due to the Earl-Marshal for the making of Knights, 176. For a Knight is not made by Letters Patents, or by the King's Writ, as those of higher Dignity, but by the Sword; for this Honour is supposed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the sudden, and therefore is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the Sword, although the King may by his Letters Patents create a Knight.</p>
                     <p>Earls in ancient times had a power of Knighting; but now neither may the Prince, or any other of the Nobility, make a Knight, but only the King, or Lieutenant General by his Commission. No man is born a Knight, as he may be to Titles of Honour by Patent; but a Knight may be made assoon as a Child is baptized, except Knight Bannerets. Note the printed Book of Titles of Honour, <hi>fol.</hi> 218, 313. the first Knight. With us in <hi>England</hi> there are divers sorts of Knights, whereof <hi>Cambden</hi> 171. and <hi>Mills</hi> do write at large: But amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> there was but one Order of them, and they were next in Degree unto the Senators. And they who simply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Addition, be called Knights, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are in order ranked last, yet by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution they are first, and of greatest Antiquity; and the other Orders are but late Attributes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several inventions of particular Princes. And I do not remember that in our Books of Law I have read any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Order of Knights with Addition, <hi>viz.</hi> Knights of the Honourable Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Knights Bannerets, and Knights of the Bath. But in the Statute 12 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. it is enacted, That every Knight of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may have three Chaplains, whereof every one may purchase licence or dispensation, and receive, have, and keep two Benefices with cure of Souls: but they of this Order which I now treat of, are called Knights of the Spur, or Knights Batchelors.</p>
                     <p>Between Doctors of the Civil Law and Knights hath ever been question for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, since either of them hath been in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the Common-wealth: as may appear both by the Comparison that <hi>Tully</hi> maketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lucius Murena,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Publius Sulpitius</hi> a Lawyer, either of them standing for Consulship, in his Eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made for <hi>Murena</hi>; and many Disputes of <hi>Bardal</hi> and <hi>Bardus,</hi> arguing the Case <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con:</hi> which though it be disputable in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts; yet here in <hi>England</hi> it is without Controversie, and the precedency thereof is undoubtedly the Knights. But if they be both of equal degree of Knighthood, then it goeth by Seniority. The Opinion of some men late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath been, That Knights Lieutenants (that is to say) such Knights as either have been Ambassadors in Foreign Parts, or Judges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, may and ought to have, during their lives, precedency above men of their own rank after their Offices expire; and <hi>sub Iudice his est,</hi> not determined by Judgment. But admitting it so to be, by way of Argument in that case; yet the Heralds do deny that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> or Justices of the Peace, who have their limited Jurisdiction of Magistracy confined them: but the former are generally Magistrates throughout the Realm, and their employment concerneth the whole Commonwealth; and having the publick Justice and Honour of the whole Estate committed unto them, do more

                     <p>It appeareth in our Books of Law, that the highest and lowest Dignities are universal; for as if a King of a Foreign Nation come into <hi>England</hi> by his Majestie's leave (as it ought to be) in this case he shall sue and be sued by the Name of a King; So shall a Knight sue or he sued by the name of a Knight, wheresoever he received that Degree of Honour: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it is as if a Duke, Marquess, Earl, or other Title of Honour given by any Foreign King or Emperor, yea, although the King by his Letters Patents of safe Conduct do name him Duke, or by what other Foreign Title of Dignity he hath; For Experience teacheth that Kings joyned in League together by a certain mutual (and as it were a natural) power of Monarchs (according to the Law of Nations) have admitted one anothers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Subjects, and Ambassadors graced with the Title of Knighthood. Therefore though a Knight receive his Dignity of a Foreign Prince, he is so to be stiled in all Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings within <hi>England.</hi> And Kings were wont to send their Sons unto their Neighbour Princes to receive Knighthood at their hands, thinking that it was more honourable to take Arms of some other, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Malcombe</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> unto our <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and our <hi>Edward</hi> the First unto the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> to take of them Military Arms: For these terms and phrases they used in that Age for the Creation of a Knight.</p>
                     <p>And Knights in all Foreign Countries have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver place and precedency according to their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority of being Knighted, which priviledge is denied to Noblemen; for be they never so ancient, in Foreign Countries they shall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as Puisnes. The Degree of Knighthood is not only a Dignity and Honour to the party, (for so it is termed in <hi>Brook</hi>'s <hi>Title Additions</hi> 44.) but an Honour to the Kingdom: And therefore it hath been an ancient Prerogative of the Kings of this Realm, at their pleasure to compel men of worth to take upon them that Degree upon payment of a Fine. But we see by Experience in these days, that none are compelled thereunto, and that is the reason, wherefore, if the Plaintiff be Knighted having the Writ, it shall abate, because he hath chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his name, and that by his own Act.</p>
                     <p>And for that cause also, by the Common Law, not only the King, but every Lord of a Mannor ought to have of every of his Tenants a reasonable Aid to make his eldest Son a Knight: And all Lands are subject to these Aids, except only ancient Demesne, and grand and petty Serjeanty-Tenures, as the Law hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And it was at the liberty of the Lord to make more or less of his Tenants by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law in this Case; but by the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the first, Chap. 35. it is put in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> forasmuch as before this time rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Aid to make ones Son Knight, or to marry his Daughter was never put in certain, nor how much should be taken, nor at what time, whereby some levied unreasonable Aid, and more often than seemed necessary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the people were sore grieved: It is provided that from henceforth, of a whole Knight's Fee, there be taken but Twenty shillings; and of Twenty pounds in Land holden in Soccage, Twenty shillings; and of more, more; and of less, less; after that rate. And that none shall levy such Aid to make his Son a Knight, until his Son be of fifteen years old; nor to marry his Daughter until she be of the Age of seven years: And of that there shall be mention made in the King's Writs formed on the same, when any will demand it.</p>
                     <p>And if it happen that the Father, after he hath levied such Aid of his Tenants, die before he hath married his Daughter, the Executors of the Father shall be bound to the Daughter for so much as the Father received for the Aid. And if the Father's Goods be not sufficient, his Heir shall be charged therewith unto the Daugher. And this Aid is so incident, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord do confirm unto the Tenant to hold by Fealty and certain Rent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease unto him all other Services and Demands; yet shall he have the Aid to make his eldest Son a Knight. But the King was not bound by the Statute aforementioned, because the King was not named in the Statute: Therefore by the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. the King's Aid were brought to a like value.</p>
                     <p>The intention of the Law is, That an Heir until the Age of One and twenty years, is not able to do Knights Service. But such a presumption of Law doth give place to a Judgment of proof to the contrary, as <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> saith, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By reason also that the Honour of Knighthood is so great, that it is not to be holden under by any; yet if the King do create such an Heir within Age a Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50041:110"/>
his Ancestor, he is made of full Age; so that when his Ancestor dieth, no interest, either in the Body, or in the Land, shall invest in the Lord; but the Knight may tender his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very as if he were of full Age: And in that case the King shall have <hi>primier Seisin,</hi> as if he had been One and twenty years of Age at the time of the death of his Ancestor, and not otherwise. For the Statute of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> doth not extend unto it; for the purview of it doth extend only when the Heir in Ward (<hi>infra aetatem</hi>) is made Knight, then <hi>rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net terra in Custodia, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when the Heir is made Knight in the life of his Ancestor, then the Custody cannot remain, which never had any inception or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                     <p>Also when the Heir, after the death of his Ancestor, within Age is made Knight, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tender made to him he within Age do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry elsewhere, yet he shall not pay the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his marriage; for by the making him Knight he is out of Ward and Custody of his Lord, for then he ought to be <hi>sui Iuris,</hi> and may imploy himself in feats of Arms for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realm, &amp;c. and therefore may not be within the Custody of another; and none shall pay any forfeiture, but when after any refusal he doth marry himself, during the time when he is under the custody and keeping of his Lord: And this doth appear by the Statute of <hi>Merton, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Si se mariturierit sine licentia Domini sui, &amp; ei conferet marita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium suum, &amp;c.</hi> which words cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood when he is out of Ward and Custody, no more than when he is married after the Age of One and twenty years. Note hereby, that the King may prevent his Grantee, or other Lords, of the double value by Knighthood: Yet in such case, presently after the Heir is made a Knight after the death of his Ancestor, the Lord may have a Writ <hi>de valore maritagii</hi> for the single.</p>
                     <p>Also by the ancient Common Law of this Realm, if a Villain be made a Knight, he is immediately infranchised: And if a Ribald, or a man of base birth and condition had struck a Knight, by the ancient Law he should have lost his hand wherewith he offended.</p>
                     <p>But in <hi>France</hi> it was anciently adjudged, that when the Lord of a Villain had Knighted his Villain, being a Gentleman he became free, and had his Honour law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by the Law Knights having Land may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon Juries in ordinary Trials between party and party, as other Freeholders may be. And therefore in a Challenge to the great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size under <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, one was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged <hi>pur ceo qu'il fait abaner;</hi> or as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment hath it, a Baronet; but it was not allowed: and the Reason is given; <hi>Car s'il soit Ã  Baner, &amp; ne tient pas per Baronie il serra en l'assise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the double parity of <hi>England,</hi> that is, of Barons, and all Dignities above them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peers of the Realm, and all other under them, are Peers amongst themselves; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that Dignity of Knighthood, they are reckoned amongst the Commons. And we daily see that Knights do serve in Parliament as Members of the Commonalty. Nevertheless the Sheriff in his discretion will not impannel Knights, but in special and great Causes: As in Cases of Indictments of a Peer of the Realm, they are to be enquired and found by Knights and Esquires, though their Trial shall be only by their Peers. And in 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Henry Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Son and Heir apparent of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> was attainted of High Treason, and was tried also by Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen, and not by Lords or Peers of the Realm, because he was not of that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by Creation.</p>
                     <p>Since the use of making every Earl first a Baron of some place (which began, as most Writers treat, about the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) it hath been a Custome to style their Heirs apparent Lords and Barons, with the Title of their Father's Barony (when Viscounts, or Baron's Heirs apparent are only styled Esquires;) but this is only a piece of Civility, and of meer fashion; yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of in Heraldry, with whom the Rule is, That the eldest Son of every one of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50041:111"/>
Degree is as of the next Degree under him, which may be applied to Dukes, Earls, and the like: But in Legal Proceedings they enjoy no such matter, nor have by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heirs Apparent any Prerogative of the greater Nobillty.</p>
                     <p>And in case where a Peer of the Realm is party Plaintiff or Defendant in any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Suit, if the Sheriff do not return one Knight at the least to be of the Jury, the said Noble Person may Challenge, and for that only cause quash the whole pannel.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute of <hi>Carlisle</hi> 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. it was enacted, That he who levied a Fine should appear in proper person, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that his Age, Idiocy, or other defect might be discovered by the Judges. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless upon Impotency, whereby he cannot come in Court, two, or one of the Justices, by the consent of the rest of the Justices, shall go unto him and take his Recognizance; and if but one of them go, he shall take a Knight with him, and shall certifie it in the Bench of Record, to the intent that all things inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the fine be examined by them, and then the fine may be levied. But after this good Statute, a worse Custom and Use hath come in place: For by a <hi>Dedimus potestatem</hi> out of <hi>Chancery</hi> to one Knight, and to a Justice of the Peace of the County in such cases, is procured and directed to a Knight and two others, who perhaps be neither Knights nor Justices, but perhaps men of small estimation, and unto two or three of them, without saying <hi>Quorum</hi> the Knight shall be one; and two of them without the Knight have taken the Recognizance of the Fine, <hi>ibid.</hi> 101. <hi>b.</hi> But great prejudice this practise of omitting the interposing of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Service of Knights in this behalf hath been to many, and scandalous to the Law of the Land, they sometimes taking Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances of a Fine from a Feme Covert, as if she were sole, and many times acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Justices. If a Tenant do lay an <hi>Essoin de morbo lecti,</hi> he may have a Writ out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> to warrant it, by which it shall be commanded to four Knights to view him; and if they see him sick, then they are to give him day, to the end of a year and a day. Note the Register, <hi>fol.</hi> 177. <hi>b. Quod Coronator non elegatur nisi sit miles in, &amp;c. juxta formam Statuti Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>It is a received Opinion, that Knights are excused from attendance at Leets, and <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. is cited to prove it. And by a large understanding of the intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge, chap.</hi> 10. For the ancient Common Law had such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Degree of Knighthood, that they, nor their eldest Sons, were compelled to find Pledges in the Leet or Law-days; for the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge</hi> aforesaid was not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductiva novae Legis,</hi> for it was before the Conquest. And the Common Law is not by this Statute abridged. And by the Book called the <hi>Mirror of Iustice,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Preface to <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>ninth part,</hi> it is said that Knights are excepted: And so it appears that the practice was as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as immediately after the making of that Statute of <hi>Marlbridge</hi>; and <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Practica</hi> is a principal way and form of Interpretation of Laws.

                        <p>I shall here set down the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Knights about the year of Christ 500, near which time King <hi>Arthur</hi> Reigned in <hi>England,</hi> as I find it in Sir <hi>William Segar's</hi> Book of Honour Military and Civil, <hi>page</hi> 53. where he saith, That a Prince being minded to make a Knight, commanded a Stage or Scaffold to be erected in some Cathedral Church in his Kingdom, or some spacious place near unto it, to which place the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was brought to receive that Honour; and being come, was forthwith placed on a silver Chair, adorned with green Silk. Then it was demanded of him if he were of a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Body, and able to undergo the Travel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Souldier; also whether he were a man of honest conversation, and what credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witnesses he could produce to affirm the same. Then the Bishop or chief Prelate of the Church took the Bible, and holding it open before the Knight in presence of the King and all others, spake these words; <hi>Sir, you that desire to receive the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, swear before God, and by this Holy Book, that you shall not fight against this mighty and excellent Prince that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth the Order of Knighthood upon you, unless you shall be commanded so to do in the service of your own King; for in that case, having first yielded up the Collar, Device, and other Ensigns of Honour now received, it shall be lawful for you to serve against him, without reproach or offence to all other Companions in Arms. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doing you shall incur Infamy, and being taken in War, shall be subject to the pains of death: You shall also swear with all your force and power to maintain and defend all Ladies, Gentlewomen, Widows, Orphans, and distressed Women; and you shall shun no adventure of your person in any War where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you shall happen to be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Author further saith, That this Oath being taken, two of the chief Lords led him to the King, who presently drew forth his Sword, and laid it upon his Head, saying, <hi>God and St.</hi> George (or what other Saint the King pleaseth to name) <hi>make thee a good Knight.</hi> Then came to the Knight se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Noble Ladies attired in white, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt a Sword unto his side; which being done, four Honourable Knights put on his Spurs. These Ceremonies being past, the Queen took him by the right Arm, and a Dutchess by the left, and led him to a rich Seat placed on an Ascent, where they seated him, the King sitting on his right hand, and the Queen on his left; then the Lords and Ladies also sate down upon other Seats three Descents under the King: And being all thus seated, they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

with a Delicate Banquet or Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so the Ceremony ended.</p>

                        <p>DEgrading of Knights is not very custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Examples being seldom found, it being used only for great and notable Facts and Offences against Loyalty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; as absenting themselves dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from their King's Service; for leaving their Colours, and flying to the Enemy; for betraying Castles, Forts, and the like hainous Crimes.</p>
                        <p>The manner of Degrading a Knight hath been as followeth: When a Knight had been found thus disloyal or corrupt, he was to be apprehended, and armed Cap-a-pe, as if he was going to the Wars, was to be placed upon a high Scaffold made for that purpose in the Church; and after the Priest had sung some Funeral Psalms, as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at Burials, as though he had been dead, first they take of his Helmet to shew his face, and so by Degrees his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: then the Heralds proclaiming him a disloyal Miscreant, with many other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to declare him Ignoble, he was thrown down the Stage with a Rope; and this was done about the time of King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> as is affirmed by <hi>Mills, fol.</hi> 84.</p>

                     <head>KNIGHTS OF THE Round Table. CHAP. XXII.</head>
                     <p>THE Founder of this ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood was <hi>Arthur</hi> King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who reigned about the year of Christ 516. whose Valour was so great and admirable, that many now living do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the same rather fabulous than real. This Noble King having, as Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, driven out of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Norway, Scotland,</hi> and the greatest part of <hi>France</hi> (where at <hi>Paris</hi> he was crowned) and returning home, lived in such great Renown, that many Princes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knights came from all Parts to his Court to give Evidence of their Valour in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Arms. Upon this he erected a Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Knights, which consisted (as some say) of Four and twenty; others, a greater Number; amongst whom he himself was Chief: And for the avoiding of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies for taking place when they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he caused a Round Table to be made, from whence they took their Name; which said Table (if you will believe the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Winchester</hi>) hangs up in their Castle, where they used to meet; and the time of their meeting was at <hi>Whitsontide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Into this Society none were admitted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Britains</hi> or Strangers, but such as did make sufficient proof of their Prowess and Dexterity in Arms, and such as were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their Vertue and Valour.</p>
                     <p>The Articles which they vowed to keep, were; To be always well armed, both for Horse or Foot Service, either by Land or Sea; and to be always ready to assail Tyrants and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; To protect and defend Widows, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Children; and to relieve all that are in necessity: To maintain the Christian Faith, contribute their Aid to Holy Church, and to protect Pilgrims: To advance Honour, and suppress Vice: To bury Souldiers that wanted Sepulchres: To ransom Captives, deliver Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and administer to the cure of wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers, hurt in the Service of their Country: To Record all Noble Enterprizes, to the end that the Fame thereof may ever live to their Honour, and the Renown of the Noble Order.</p>
                     <p>That upon any complaint made to the King of Injury or Oppression, one of these Knights, whom the King should appoint, was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the same. If any Foreign Knight came to Court, with desire to shew his Prowess,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50041:113"/>
these Knights ought to be ready in Arms to answer him. If any Lady, Gentlewoman, or other oppressed or injured person, did present a Petition declaring the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Injury was done here or beyond Sea, he or she should be graciously heard, and without delay one or more Knights should be sent to make Revenge: And that every Knight, for the advancement of Chivalry, should be ready to inform young Lords and Gentlemen in the Orders and Exercises of Arms.</p>
                     <p>For what I can find, there was no Robe or Habit prescribed unto these Knights; nor can I find with what Ceremony they were made; neither what Officers did belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the said Order, except a Register to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord all their Noble Enterprizes.</p>
                     <p>Not to pass over this Noble <hi>Arthur,</hi> give me leave to repeat what I find mentioned of him by Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> in the said Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This valiant Prince, not confining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the narrow limits of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, left the Government thereof to the management of his Cosin <hi>Mordred,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Journey, or rather Conquest (for in all places he found Fortune to favour him) And after his many Victories gained of the <hi>Saxons, Scots, Norwegians, Romans, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> and <hi>French</hi>; in the end, being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Honour, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> but found <hi>Mordred</hi> a Traitor, as usurping the Government, and obstructing his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But all that he could do was in vain; for being landed, he fled to <hi>London,</hi> but the Citizens refusing to give him Entrance, he went into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where King <hi>Arthur</hi> gave him Battel, which proved unfortunate to them both, for <hi>Mordred</hi> was slain by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was also desperately wounded; and after this wound (as some say) he was never found alive or dead, which made the Poets to feign that he was taken up into the Firmament, and there remaineth a Star amongst the Nine Worthies: Which phansie is founded upon the Prophesie of old <hi>Merlin,</hi> which was his Counsel, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Prophet; who for many years before affirmed, That King <hi>Arthur,</hi> after a certain time, should resuscitate and come unto <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> to restore the Round Table. He wrote this Epitaph:

                     <p>According to <hi>Andrew Favin,</hi> there was an Order of Knighthood called <hi>Knights of St. Thomas,</hi> which was instituted by King <hi>Richard</hi> the First, after the surprisal of the City of <hi>Acon,</hi> and consisted of all English men. Their Patron was St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>; their Garment was white; and their Ensign was a red Cross charged in the midst with a white Escallop. But <hi>A. Mendo</hi> believeth that these Knights were rather some of those which joyned themselves with the <hi>Knights Hospitallers,</hi> for that they wore the same Habit, followed the same Rule, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the same Customes as did the Knights of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Acon.</hi>

                     <p>And from hence 'tis believed that this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der took its rise, which was about the year of our Lord 810.

                     <p>The principal Ensign of this Order is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Collar composed of Thistles, intermixed with Annulets of Gold, to which hangs the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> with his Cross, and this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigraph, <hi>Nemo me impune lacessit.</hi> But for their common Ensign they wore a green Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, to which hung a golden Thistle crowned with an Imperial Crown, within a Circle of Gold, with the said Epigraph.</p>
                     <p>Their grand meeting was annually on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, in the Church of the Town so called; and during the Solemnity of the Feast, these Knights (which were in number Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, in allusion to our Saviour and the Twelve Apostles) were richly apparelled, and in their Parliament Robes, having embroidered on their left Shoulders St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Cross within a blew Rundle, and in the Center of the said Cross was a Crown composed of Golden <hi>Flower de lis.</hi>

                        <p>THIS Order of Knighthood is held to be the most ancient of all those Orders that took their beginning in the Holy Land; and is said to be instituted about the time that the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was regained from the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> which was in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1099.</p>
                        <p>Some Authors say, That <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was the first Instituter of this Order; but <hi>Favin</hi> saith that it was <hi>Baldwin</hi> the first King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who made the Regular Canons (which then resided in a Convent near adjoyning to the said Sepulchre) Knights of the said Order, whose chief Duty was to guard the Holy Sepulchre; to relieve and protect Pilgrims; to fight against the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi> and Infidels; and to hear Mass eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. The Armorial Ensign belonging unto them was two red Crosses united into one.</p>
                        <p>When the Christians were expelled the Holy Land, these Knights settled themselves at <hi>Perugia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>: But by the Bulls of Pope Innocent the Eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1484. they and all their Goods were annexed and joyned to the Knights Hospitallers, then residing at <hi>Rhodes.</hi>

                        <p>SOmewhat before the Christians took the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> certain Christian Merchants of <hi>Naples,</hi> who traded to these parts, obtained leave from the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> (who had then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof) to dwell near the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of Christ, and to erect a small House for the entertainment of themselves and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and called it <hi>The Hospital of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>; together with a small Oratory dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> After that the number of Christians increasing, they built another House for Women, and dedicated it to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>; and at length they built a more large House, which they dedicated to St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the others being too small for the entertainment of Strangers that thither came for Devotion, and here they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and cured the diseased amongst them. And for their Religion, Charity, and Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they began to become eminent; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving took St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> for their Patron, they obtained the title or name of <hi>Brethren Hospitallers of St.</hi> John Baptist <hi>of</hi> Jerusalem: Then received they the regular Habit of black, with a white Cross on the Garment near their left Shoulder, and vowed Obedience, Poverty, and Chastity.</p>
                        <p>This Order is said to be first instituted in <hi>Anno</hi> 1099. by one <hi>Gerard</hi> of the Province of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> a man of a holy life, and had large priviledges conferred upon them by King <hi>Baldwin</hi> the first, who created them Knights, and permitted them to use Arms, and to fight against the <hi>Sarazens</hi> and Infidels for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Christian Faith, and to be Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Holy Sepulchre. At this time they acknowledged their Obedience to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; but growing in wealth, they obtained the favour of the Pope to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from their Obedience, and was by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth received under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papal See.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gerard</hi> being dead, they elected one <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> for their Rector or great Master, to whom authority was given that he should govern and command all Knights of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wheresoever dispersed. This <hi>Gerard,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had digested and enlarged their Laws and Institutions, divided that whole Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Classes; to wit, Knights, Ecclesiasticks, and Servants: And since which time the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Great Masters have much added to their Priviledges and Dignities; and his Title is now <hi>The Illustrious Prince of</hi> Malta <hi>and</hi> Goza.</p>

                        <head>Knights Templars.</head>
                        <p>ABout the year 1118. <hi>Hugo de Paganes, Godfrey de St. Omer,</hi> with seven other Gentlemen, out of Devotion went into the Holy Land, where they determined to erect, and enter into a Brotherhood; and being come to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they consulted what they should do (though to the hazard of their Lives) that should be a service acceptable to God, and praiseworthy of men: And being informed that in the Town of <hi>Zaffo</hi> there resided ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thieves that used to rob the Pilgrims that resorted to the Holy Sepulchre, they resolved to make the passage more free by destroying or dispersing these Robbers. And for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of these Gentlemen in so good an undertaking, the King assigned them lodgings in his Palace adjoyning to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, from which place they were called <hi>Knights Templars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the King and Patriarch finding their Actions very successful, furnished them with many necessary Provisions: And although their charitable Service made them acceptable unto all, yet for the first Nine years they were in so great a strait, that they were forced to take the Charity of well disposed people; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there resorted unto them many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, so that their number was much encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there being all this while no Habit or Order assigned them, Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> at the request of <hi>Stephen</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> prescribed unto them an Order of Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were to wear a white Garment; and Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> added thereto a red Cross; and in the presence of the said Patriarch they made their Vows of Obedience, Poverty, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, and to live under the Rule of Regular Canons of St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> Being thus entred into an Order, they elected an Head or Great Master; and in process of time, through the daily encrease of their number, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous enterprizes, not only for securing the passages, but also for waging War both by Sea and Land against the Infidels, they became highly favoured of the Christian Princes, who
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50041:115"/>
assigned to them great Revenues to be spent in God's Service; and in process of time they became exceeding wealthy and powerful, so that they grew proud, and withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Obedience of the Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and joyned with the Pope. But in the end they found not the favour from the Pope as they expected; for by him, or through his consent, upon some infamous crimes charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against them, their Lands and Possessions were seized upon, and otherways disposed of, their Order suppressed, and they themselves imprisoned, condemned, and cruelly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but according to the Opinion of many Authors, they were unjustly accused by subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Witnesses, meerly to gain their Revenues, which according to Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> were exceeding great, having no less than Sixteen thousand Lordships in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                        <p>THis Order at the first Institution was only a Brotherhood of Religious Monks, and became an Order of Knighthood in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> being first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a most charitable account, to wit, to take care of persons infected with the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie (which was a Disease very frequent in the Eastern parts) by reason of which they were separated from the Society of men; and had assigned to them a famous Hospital in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> called St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> for the reception of Lepers.</p>

                           <p>THIS Order was instituted by <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> for the Re-conquest of the Holy Land, the overthrow of the Enemies of Christ, and the advancement of the Catholick Faith amongst the Eastern people.</p>
                           <p>In the chief Convent of the Holy Chivalry (which was to be beautified with stately Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, as Palaces, a Castle, a Church; and to be richly endowed, and in common amongst them, that they might the better follow the Exercise of their Arms, and other Duties) all things of publick Concernment were to be heard and debated in the presence of the King by five sufficient Counsels. The two principal Officers of the Chivalry were, first the Grand Justiciary, who had the disposal of all chief Offices and Places, and to whom belonged the Judgment of all criminal Affairs, and next the Grand Bailiff, who was to administer both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Criminal Justice; besides several other Officers of a lower degree, as the Potestate, the Senator of the General Chapter, the Ten Executors of Justice, and the Charitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries, &amp;c. And for their better living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Order, they were to vow Obedience, Poverty, and Conjugal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity.</p>
                           <p>The Habits which these Knights were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wear, was a civil coloured Cloth Coat, which should reach down half way their

legs, which was to be girt about them with a Girdle of Silk or Leather about two fingers broad, a red Cap, and over the said Coat a Mantle of white Cloth or Stuff, with a red Cross of Cloth or Serge about two fingers broad, which was on the Breast from the top to the bottom, and so round the Waist.</p>
                           <p>The number of these Knights were to be about One thousand; and each Knight was to have his Esquire armed at all points, with three Varlets; one to carry his Helmet and Launce, another to carry his Mail, and the third to lead his Sumpter; and in time of Peace two or three Horses and Servants, according as the Ability of the Chivalry would allow. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Order was erected upon so good a Design, yet no great progress was made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for it died almost in its birth.</p>

                           <p>THIS Order was erected by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh in <hi>Anno</hi> 1469. whereinto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with others the most principal Peers of his Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> did enter. And the Reason that did occasion the King to erect this Order, was in memory of an Apparition of St. <hi>Michael</hi> upon the Bridge of <hi>Orleance,</hi> when that City was besieged by the <hi>English</hi>; at which time (as Histories relate) lived a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Maiden called <hi>Ioan,</hi> of so rare a Wit and Valour in Arms, that she was reputed more than a mortal Creature, leading an Army her self in the Field against the <hi>English</hi>; for which good Service, when the <hi>English</hi> had vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Army, and took her Prisoner, they in Revenge caused her to be burnt for a Witch in the Market place of <hi>Orleance,</hi> in which place is since erected a Conduit to her Memory.</p>
                           <p>This Order is ornified with a great Collar, whereto hangeth the figure of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> The Sovereign of this Order is the <hi>French</hi> King and his Successors.

                           <p>The reason why this Order was so called, was from a great many neat shaped Horses cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Genets,</hi> of which a great part of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Chivalry was said to consist: But others say it took its name from the great store of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Furs</hi> taken amongst the Spoils of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.

Their Habit was a white Cassock, and a Mantle of a russet Colour; and for their Badge they wore a purple Cross Pattee on their Breasts. They are commonly called <hi>Cavaleri de Madona</hi>; and because they had no Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, but dwelt at their own Houses with their Wives and Children at ease and plenty, they were termed <hi>Fratres Gaudentes.</hi> They were obliged to fight against Infidels, and to protect Widows and Orphans.</p>

And for the further adoration of the Cross, after his Triumphal Entrance into <hi>Rome</hi> upon his Victory over <hi>Maxentius,</hi> he erected many Crosses with Inscriptions: and in the principal part of the City he caused his Statue to be set up, holding a Banner of the Cross with an Inscription.</p>
                           <p>Their Ensign was a Collar of Gold, to which was fastned a Cross of the same form, and thereunto the figure of St. <hi>George.</hi>

                           <p>Of this Order <hi>Constantine</hi> elected Fifty of the Noblest Persons in his Empire, to whom he gave the Standard of the <hi>Labarum,</hi> and likewise a Collar of Gold; and constituted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Laws to be observed by the said Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which were confirmed by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the First, who assigned to them the Rule of St. <hi>Basil, Anno Dom.</hi> 456. which said Order hath been since confirmed by divers succeeding Popes and Emperors.</p>

                        <p>The principal Degree of these Knights were those that had the crown of their Hair tied with a small red Ribon, with a rich Plume of Feathers, from which hung so many Branches and Rolls of Feathers upon their Shoulders, as they had performed worthy Exploits in War.

                        <p>The Order of the Grey Knights had their Hair cut round about their Ears, were not so much honoured as the former, and when they went to Wars, were armed but to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                        <p>All these Degrees of Knights had their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments in the King's Palace, which were distinguished by their several Ensigns: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the honourable Priviledges that they enjoyed, they might carry Gold and Silver, wear rich Cotton, and Shoes after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, and use painted and guilt Vessels; all which were prohibited the common people.</p>
                        <p>The Order of Knighthood of the Blood Royal in <hi>Peru</hi> were of great esteem for their approved Valour; for before they could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the said Degree, their Manhood was sufficiently tried; as in managing the Dart, Lance, and other Military Exercises; also in Leaping, Wrestling, Running, Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. in all which if they were not very expert, they were thought unworthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so great an Honour: But being found worthy to be admitted, divers Ceremonies were used at their Creation; as putting on them fine Shoes and Breeches; boreing of holes in their Ears; giving them an Ax; and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Heads with Flowers, &amp;c. all which was forbidden the common people.</p>
                        <p>And the Peruvian Lords at their solemn Feasts at <hi>Cusco</hi> used to dedicate their Children to Honour, adorning them with Ensigns, making holes in their Ears, and anoynting their Faces with Blood, in token that they should be true Knights to the <hi>Ingua.</hi>

                     <head>OF ESQUIRES. CHAP. XXV.</head>
                     <p>ALTHOUGH by the Civil Law there be no Gentlemen of Title under Knights, but all the rest went under the name of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet with us there are in this rank which have names of Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, whereby they are in Degree above the rest, as Esquires and Gentlemen, all which give Ensigns of Coats of Arms, and thereby are distinguished from the meaner People; in which respect <hi>Bartoll's Tract de Ensignes</hi> calleth them Noble: but yet of weak Nobility; for it hath no further Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in it, than it makes them differ from the baser sort of People.</p>
                     <p>Of these two sorts of Gentlemen with us, the Esquire hath the Priority. But it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if an Esquire be named Gentleman, or a Gentleman called an Esquire, it is no Offence or Fault in Legal Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Esquire seemeth by the common Name we give him in Latin, to have his Original either for that he carried the Armour of the King, Duke, or other great Personage; as we read not only in Scripture, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> had their Armour-bearers; but in Poets and other profane Stories, we find that <hi>Troclus</hi> was <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Armour-bearer, and <hi>Clytus Alexander</hi>'s the Great; whereupon some write, that he whom we call <hi>Armiger</hi> in Latin is a Footman, that with a Spear, Shield, or Head-piece follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an armed Knight in Battel; or rather, as some other suppose, it is the Footman arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Field: But howsoever the words be taken, this is sure, That those men were of good accompt in the old time, as those that won themselves Credit out of War; and so their Estimation remaineth in their Posterity. And as those were in times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so are these which are in our days, as descending for the most part from their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ancestors: And our Books of Common Law doth distinguish them thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Knighthood is a Dignity, but Esquires and Gentlemen are but Names of Worship: And <hi>Brooks</hi> in the Abridgment of that Case, Title <hi>Nosman de Dignitie,</hi> 33. saith, <hi>To be a Knight est gradus; but to be an Esquire or Gentleman est status; for Gradus continet status in se, &amp; non Ã¨ contrario.</hi> Concerning the word Worshipful, read in the printed Book of <hi>Titles of Honour</hi> the first Part, <hi>fol.</hi> 124. <hi>&amp; sequentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In times past every Knight had two of these waiting upon him, who carried his Murrion and Shield; and as inseparable Companions, they stuck close to him; because of the said Knight their Lord, they held certain Lands in Escuage, like as the Knight himself did of the King by Knights Service.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50041:144"/>The beginning of giving Arms in <hi>Europe</hi> amongst Christians is supposed from the Holy Wars; for the Turks paint them not: And so with us about <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time they became here more firmly established: And when the Prince enobled any, he usually gave them the particular of his bearing in Blazon. <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> in his Preface, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. where you may also see an Example in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</p>
                     <p>But now there are five distinct sorts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squires observed; and those that have been already spoken of are now in no request. Of these sorts the principal at this day are the eldest Sons of Viscounts and Lord; next are all Noblemens younger Sons; then are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted those that are select Esquires for the King's Body; the next are Knights eldest Sons successively; in a fourth rank are reckoned those unto whom the King himself together with the Title giveth Arms, or createth Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires by putting about their Necks a Silver Collar of SS. and in former times upon their Heels a pair of white silvered Spurs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at this day in the Western part of the Kingdom they be called White-spurs, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from Knights who were wont to wear gilt Spurs; and to the first begotten Sons only of these doth this Title belong. In the fifth and last place be those that have any superiour publick Office in the Kingdom; as high She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Justices of the Peace, &amp;c. or serve the King in any worshipful Calling. At the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of Kings and Queens Knights of the Bath are made, men of worth and honourable blood, to the end that their Majesties may be accompanied in their own Honours, every of which Knights having two Gentlemen to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in that Ceremony, who are ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (by that Service) enabled to be Esquires during their lives.</p>
                     <p>But the name of Esquire in ancient time was a name of Charge and Office, and first crept in amongst other Titles of Dignity and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (so far as ever I could observe) in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; <hi>vide</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith de Republica Anglorum, fol.</hi> 26. where he saith, <hi>That the Esquire is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Order of the Commonwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Serjeant of the King's Kitchin may bear the Name and Addition of Cook or Esquire, according to the Opinion of <hi>Newton</hi>: But <hi>Ienne</hi> saith, <hi>Such Officers of his Majestie's Houshold would be much grieved if they should be named by their Trade or Office.</hi> Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that case the Writ may be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. For the Statute is, That he should be named of the Town, Degree, State, Condition, or Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and when he was named Cook, he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Statute, for he hath named him by his own name of Mystery; and yet he may be in that case an Esquire, and a Cook.</p>
                     <p>If a man be an Esquire or Gentleman only by Office, and loseth the same, he loseth also that title of Gentility.</p>
                     <p>Note, That an Esquire or Gentleman is but an Addition to satisfie the said Statute; but names of Dignity are parcel of the name. And thereupon if a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> be against <hi>Iohn a Stiles</hi> Yeoman, and recovery is had, whereas the Tenant was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet the Recovery is good. The same Law where a Release is made to <hi>Iohn a Stiles</hi> Yeoman, who is a Gentleman; and where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is given by the party, where it needeth not by the Law (being no Dignity) it is void. So if a deed be made to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the name of a Yeoman; for there is a great difference between Deeds and Writs.</p>
                     <p>If an Esquire be to be Arraigned of High Treason, he may and ought to be tried <hi>per probos &amp; Legales homines,</hi> that may expend Forty shillings of Freehold, or be worth One hundred pounds in the value of Goods: And so the Statute that doth speak of men of his condition hath always been put in ure, <hi>Dyer</hi> 99. <hi>b.</hi> Note a Knight hath no other priviledge by Statute or Common Law.</p>
                     <p>The King may make an Esquire by Patent, <hi>viz. Creamus te Armigerum, &amp;c.</hi> Note the Preface to the printed Book of <hi>Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> 5. <hi>b. &amp;</hi> 318.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>statute</hi> 21. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things it is enacted, that the <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sons</hi> born in Wedlock of every Knight being <hi>Spiritual men,</hi> may every of them purchase License or Dispensation, and receive, take and keep two <hi>Parsonages,</hi> or <hi>Benefices</hi> with cure of <hi>souls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Sons</hi> of any <hi>Knight,</hi> and heir apparent of an <hi>Esquire</hi> is priviledge to keep <hi>Greyhounds, setting Doggs,</hi> or <hi>Nets</hi> to take <hi>Pheasants</hi> or <hi>Partridges,</hi> though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispend ten pounds in his own right, or in his Wives right of Estate of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or of the value of thirty pounds of <hi>Estate</hi> for life.</p>
                     <p>By the precedent discourse of <hi>Knights Batchelors</hi> we understand, that all persons by the common Law are compellable to take the degree of Knighthood, or to fine, if they are possest of such an Estate as the King and his Council shall judge fit to maintain that Port in their Country. And his annual Revenue deemed fit for that Dignity, and the fines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon such as refused, we find in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories and Statutes to vary with the times; and certainly the best Esquires, or at least none under the Reputation of Gentlemen were compelled, although 'twas at the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: And therefore 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. <hi>Stat. de Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> the Parliament (saith <hi>Sanderson</hi>) more for ease of the Subject, than profit of the King, limited it to such as had Twenty pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> and better; and afterwards 'twas raised to Thirty pounds, and a plentiful Revenue in those times, when a Dowry of Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50041:144"/>
pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to a Queen, was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great impoverishment to the Crown and Kingdom:) but the East and Western part of the World being laid open to the Merchants, money began to be more common, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Land to its value; so that in the reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First Forty pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> being the rate set for such as ought to be made Knights, or to fine, many Farmers, Leaseholders, Merchants, Inholders, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were called in, whereby above 100 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds was brought into the Exchequer: Notwithstanding which divers persons made Friends, and took the Degree of Knighthood, which occasioned the extinguishment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tax; For many Esquires by birth, wealth, and education, who bore the chiefest Offices of Honour and Trust in the Commonwealth, disdained to stoop or give place to those new dubbed Knights, countenanced the Complaints of the common people against the Law it self as a grievance, and prevailed so far in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Parliament, to get it repeal'd, as you may see 17 <hi>Car. chap.</hi> 20. Since which time the difference between the Degree of Knighthood, and Dignity of an Esquire, consists only in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a double rate in the Pole Tax, and priority of place, which (as I before noted) is often slighted; unless he be sufficiently qualified by Birth, Parts, or other generous Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or are Knights of the Field, who are never abridged of their merited Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquired according to the original Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Degree amongst all Nations.</p>
                     <p>And we see our Parliament men, our She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Justices of the Peace, and the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commanders, and Captains of Cavalry and Infantry, for the most Esquires at their first Election. By the Statute 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. the Knights of the Shires shall be notable Knights, or else notable Esquires or Gentlemen, born in the same Counties for which they are chosen. See the Statute for the preservation of the Game 22 and 23 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. by which, and many other Statutes, they are equally priviledged with Knights and other persons of higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. To represent therefore an Esquire, as now defined, is no easie task; but according to the ancient Rule, I take him for a Foot-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
                     <p>The Atchievement of an Esquire differs from the Knight Batchelors only in the Helmet, as you may here observe. I shall also give you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examples of Esquires, and amongst the rest the Atchievement of my Honoured Friend <hi>Robert Logan</hi> (vulgarly written <hi>Login</hi>) Son and Heir to <hi>Iohn Logan,</hi> Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Idbury</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> who was of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient House of <hi>Restalridge</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ruined for their Loyalty to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>: He succeeded his Father at <hi>Idbury,</hi> was High Sheriff of the County; a man eminent for his Virtue and Learning (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whose prayers this Manuscript was found) exemplar in his life for Charity and Conversation.</p>

Master, and shall be taken for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for true it is with us, <hi>tanti eris aliis, quanti tibi fueris:</hi> And if need be, a King at Arms shall grant him a Patent for a new Coat, if that there is none that of right doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto him from his Ancestors; and if so, confirm that upon him. But some men make a question, whether this manner of making Gentlemen is to be allowed of or no: And it may seem that it is not amiss; For first, the Prince loseth nothing by it, as he should do if it were in <hi>France</hi>; for the Yeoman or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is no more subject to Tail or Tax in <hi>England</hi> than the Gentleman: But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, in every payment to the King the Gentleman is more charged, which he beareth with content; and in any Shew, Muster, or other particular Charge of the Town or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where he dwelleth, he is at a greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the preservation of his Honour: And for the outward shew, in all respects he deports himself like a Gentleman: and if he be called to the Wars, whatsoever it cost him, he must appear well accoutred, have his attendance, and shew a more manly Courage and tokens of a generous Education, by which means he shall purchase a greater Fame. For as touching the Policy and Government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is not those that have to do with it, which will magnifie themselves, and go above their Estates, but they that are appointed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, &amp;c. are persons tried and well known. See Sir <hi>Thomas Smith Repub. Angl. Chap. of Esquires and Gentlemen.</hi> In the five and twentieth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Case was, That whereas it is required by this Statute of the first of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, Chap. 5. That in every Writ, Original Process, &amp;c. in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Exigit</hi> shall be awarded, that Additions should be given unto the Defendant of their Estate and Degree, &amp;c. And the Case was, That one was a Yeoman by his Birth, and yet commonly called and reputed a Gentleman; and yet it was adjudged, That a Writ might be brought against him with the addition of Gentleman, for so much as the Intention of the Action is to have such a Name given by which he may be known: This is sufficient to satisfie the Law, and the Act of Parliament; for <hi>nomen dicitur, quia notitiam facit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if a Gentleman be sued by addition of Husbandman, he may say he is a Gentleman, and demand Judgment of the Writ without saying (and not Husbandman;) For a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be a Husbandman, but he shall be sued by his Addition most worthy: For a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of what Estate soever he be, although he go to plough and common labour for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet he is a Gentleman, and shall not be named in legal Proceedings Yeoman, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, or Labourer.</p>
                     <p>If a Gentleman be bound an Apprentice to a Merchant, or other Trade, he hath not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lost his Degree of Gentility.</p>
                     <p>But if a Recovery be had against a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the name of a Yeoman, in which case no Action is necessary, then it is no Error: So if any Deed or Obligation be made to him by the name of Yeoman.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Capias</hi> go against <hi>A. B.</hi> Yeoman, and if the Sheriff take <hi>A. B.</hi> Gentleman, an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of false imprisonment lieth against the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff: But if <hi>A. B.</hi> Yeoman be Indicted, and <hi>A. B.</hi> Gentleman be produced, being the same man intended, it is good.</p>
                     <p>If a man be a Gentleman by Office only, and loseth the same, then doth he also lose his Gentility.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute 5 <hi>Eliz. chap.</hi> 4. intituled <hi>An Act touching Orders for Artificers, Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Servants of Husbandry, and Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> amongst other things it is declared, That a Gentleman born, &amp;c. shall not be compelled to serve in Husbandry. If any Falcon be lost, and is found, it shall be brought to the Sheriff, who must make Proclamation, and if the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come not within four Months, then if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inder be a simple man, the Sheriff may keep the Hawk, making agreement with him that took him: But if he be a Gentleman, and of Estate to have and keep a Falcon, then the Sheriff ought to deliver to him the said Falcon, taking of him reasonable costs for the time that he had him in Custody.</p>
                     <p>A Commission is made to take Children into Cathedral Churches, &amp;c. one in anothers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where Children are instructed to sing for the furnishing of the King's Chappel: These general words, by construction of Law, have a reasonable intendment, <hi>viz.</hi> That such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who be brought up and taught to sing to get their living by it, those may be taken for the King's Service in his Chappel, and it shall be a good preferment to them; but the Sons of Gentlemen, or any other that are taught to sing for their Ornament or Recreation, and not merely for their livelyhoods, may not be taken against their Wills, or the consent of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Friends. And so it was resolved by the two Chief Justices, and all the Court of Star-Chamber, <hi>Anno</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Case of one <hi>Evans,</hi> who had by colour of such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents taken the Son of one <hi>Clifton</hi> a Gentlemen of quality in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who was taught to sing for his Recreation; which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> for the same offence was grievously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                     <p>And to the end it may withal appear, what Degrees of Nobility and Gentry were in the Realm before the coming of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and by what merits men might ascend, and be promoted to the same, I will here set down the Copy of an <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Antiquity, which you may read in <hi>Lambert</hi>'s <hi>Perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Kent, fol.</hi> 364. and Englished thus:</p>

And if a Scholar so thrived through Learning, that he had degree and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ, he was thenceforth of Dignity and Peace so much worthy, as thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, unless he forfeit, so that he the use of his Degree remit.</p>
                     <p>It is observed, That the <hi>Saxons</hi> out of all those Trades of life which be conversant in gain, admit to the Estate of Gentry such only, as encreased by honest Husbandry or plentiful Merchandize. Of the first of which <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth, that there is nothing meeter for a freeborn man, nor no man fitter to make bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Souldier: And of the other, that 'tis prize-worthy also, if at the length, being satisfied with gain, as it hath often come from the Sea to the Haven, so it changeth from the Haven into Lands and Possessions. And therefore whereas <hi>Gervasius Tilburiensis</hi> in his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> accounted it an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing of a Gentleman to occupy <hi>publicum mercimonium,</hi> common buying and selling; it ought to be referred to the other two parts of Merchandize, that is to a Negotiation, which is retailing and keeping of an open shop, and to a Function, which is to exercise Mercery, or as some call it, to play the Chapman, and not to Navigation, which (as you see) is the only laudable part of all buying and selling.</p>
                     <p>And again, whereas by the Statute of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta, chap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Merton, chap.</hi> 7. it was a discouragement for a Ward in Chivalry, which in old time was as much as to say a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to be married to the Daughter of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess; I think that it ought to be restrained to such only as professed Handycrafts, or those baser Arts of buying and selling to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by. But to shew how much the case is now altered for the honour of Tradesmen, it may be remembred, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth thought it no disparagement to him, when he quitted his Queen, to take <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Thomas Bullen,</hi> sometime Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to his Wife.</p>
                     <p>The Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. which was made in the Thirteenth of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, was procured especially at the desire of Gentlemen, for the preservation of their Lands and Hereditaments, together with their Surnames and Families; and therefore one calleth this Statute <hi>Gentilitium municipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>; and the Lawyers call it <hi>Ius Taliatum &amp; Taliabile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Children only of Gentlemen were wont to be admitted into the Inns of Court, and thereby it came to pass, that there was scant any man found (in former ages) within the Realm skilful and cunning in the Law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were a Gentleman born, and came of a good House; for they, more than any other, have a special care of their Nobility, and to the preservation of their Honour and Fame: For in these Inns of Court are (or at leastwise should be) Vertues studied, and Vices exiled; so that for the endowment of Vertue, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning of Vice, Knights and Barons, with other States and Noblemen of the Realm, place their Children in those Inns, though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to have them learned in the Laws, nor to have them live by the practise thereof, but only upon their Parents allowance.</p>
                     <p>You have heard how cheap Gentility is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the Common Law: but if you look more strictly unto the perfection thereof, you will find it more honourable; for Gentlemen well descended and qualified, have always been of such repute in <hi>England,</hi> that none of the higher Nobility, no nor the King himself, have thought it any disparagement to make them their Companions. Therefore I shall set down the priviledges due unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of Honour, as I find them collected out of Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi> Sir <hi>William Segar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> in his Analysis of Honour, and other good Authors: It is thus found.</p>

                     <p>Many other are the Priviledges due to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, which I forbear to repeat, referring the Reader to the Books before cited.</p>
                     <p>For the protection and defence of this Civil Dignity they have three Laws: The first, <hi>Ius agnitionis,</hi> the right or law of descent for the kindred of the Father's side: The second, <hi>Ius Stirpis,</hi> for the Family in general: The third, <hi>Ius Gentilitatis,</hi> a law for the descent in Noble Families, which <hi>Tully</hi> esteemed most excellent; by which Law a Gentleman of Blood and Coat-Armour perfectly possessing Vertue was only priviledged.</p>
                     <p>To make that perfection in Blood, a Lineal Descent from <hi>Atavus, Proavus, Avus,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> on the Fathers side was required; and as much on his Mothers line; than he is not only a Gentleman of perfect Blood, but of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors too. The neglect of which Laws hath introduced other sorts of Gentleman, <hi>viz.</hi> men that assume that Dignity, but are neither so by Blood nor Coat-Armour: which style only hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them to an unruly pride, which indeed is but rude and false honour, termed by Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne Apocriphate,</hi> and debarred of all privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gentility.

                     <head>OF YEOMEN. CHAP. XXVII.</head>
                     <p>THE Yeomen or Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (for so are they called of the Saxon word <hi>Zemen,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Common) who have some Lands of their own to live upon: For a Carn of Land, or a Plough Land, was in ancient time of the yearly value of five No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and this was the Living of a Stokeman or Yeoman: And in our Law they are called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> homines,</hi> a word familiar in Writs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests. And by divers Statutes it hath been enacted, That none shall pass in any Inquest unless they had forty shillings Free-hold in yearly Revenue, which maketh (if the most value were taken to the proportion of moneys) above Sixteen pounds of currant money at this present: And by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz. ch.</hi> 6. every Juror must have Forty pounds Lands. In the end of the Statute made 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 15. concerning the Election of Knights for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it is ordered and expresly provided, That no man shall be such Knight, which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the degree of a Yeoman.</p>
                     <p>It appeareth in <hi>Lambert</hi>'s <hi>Perambulation of Kent,</hi> 367. that this Saxon word <hi>Telphioneman</hi> was given to the Theyne or Gentleman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his life was valued at One thousand two hundred shillings; and in those days the lives of all men were rated at certain sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: To the Churle or Yeoman, because the price of his head was taxed at Two hundred shillings. Which things, if it were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set forth in sundry old Laws yet extant, might well enough be found in the Etymology of the words themselves, the one called a <hi>Twelve hundred man,</hi> and the other a <hi>Twyhind</hi> for a man of Two hundred. And in this Estate they pleased themselves, insomuch that a man might (and also now may) find sundry Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though otherwise comparable for wealth with many of the Gentile sort, that will not yet for that change their condition, nor desire to be appareled with the title of Gentry.</p>
                     <p>By the Common Law it may appear in 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>de Militibus,</hi> and 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>a.</hi> men that had Lands to the value of Twenty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> were compellable at the King's pleasure to take upon them the Order of Knighthood; and upon Summons there came a Yeoman who might expend a hundred Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> and the Court was in doubt how they might put him off; and at last he was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because he came the second day.</p>
                     <p>By this sort of men the trial of Causes in the Country proceedeth ordinarily; for of them there are greater number in <hi>England</hi> than in any other place, and they also of a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful livelyhood; and therefore it cometh to pass, that men of this Country are more apt and fit to discern in doubtful Cases and Causes of great examination and trial, than are men wholly given to moil in the ground, to whom that Rural exercise engendreth rudeness of wit and mind. And many Franklins and Yeomen
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50041:149"/>
there are so near adjoyning, as you may make a Jury without difficulty; for there be many of them, that are able to expend One or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds per <hi>Annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As in the ancient time the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> were elected a <hi>Censu</hi>; and as with us in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Nobility, respect is had to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, by which their Dignity and Nobility may be supported and maintained. So the Wisdom of this Realm hath of ancient time provided, that none shall pass upon Juries for the trial of any matter real or personal, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any criminal cause, but such as besides their Moveables have Lands for estate of life at the least to a competent value, lest for need or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty such Jurors might easily be corrupted or suborned.</p>
                     <p>And in all Cases and Causes the Law hath conceived a better Opinion of those that have Lands and Tenements, or otherwise are of worth in moveable Goods, that such will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or omit nothing, that may any way be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their estimation, or which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their Estates, than it hath of Artificers, Retailers, Labourers, or such like; of whom <hi>Tully</hi> saith, <hi>Nihil proficiuntur, nisi ad modum mentiuntur.</hi> And by divers Statutes certain Immunities are given to men of Quality, which are denied to the Vulgar sort of People: Read hereof amongst other, 1 <hi>Iac. cap.</hi> 127.</p>
                     <p>By the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 27. amongst other things it is enacted, That no Yeoman should take or wear any Livery of any Lord upon pain of imprisonment, and to make Fine at the King's will and pleasure.</p>
                     <p>These Yeomen were famous in our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers days for Archery and Manhood; our Infantry, which so often conquered the French, and repuls'd the Scots, were composed of them, as are our Militia at present, who through want of use and good discipline are much degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their Ancestors valour and hardiness.</p>
                     <p>As the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy have certain priviledges peculiar to themselves; so have the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> beyond the Subjects of other Monarchs.</p>

                     <p>To him that is imprisoned may not be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> if it be desired; and if no just cause be alledged, and the same be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the Prisoner is to be set at liberty. By <hi>Magna Charta</hi> 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. no Souldier can be quartered in any House except Inns, and other publick Victualling-houses, in time of peace, without the Owners consent, by the Petition of Right, 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. No Taxes, Loans, or Benevolences can be imposed but by Act of Parliament, <hi>idem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Yeomanry are not to be prest to serve as a Souldier in the Wars, unless bound by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, which is now abolished: Nor are the Trained Bands compelled to march out of the Kingdom, or be transported beyond Sea, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by the Law of the Kingdom ought to be done: Nor is any one to be compelled to bear his own Arms, finding one sufficient man qualified according to the Act aforementioned.</p>
                     <p>No Freeman is to be tried but by his equals, nor condemned but by the Laws of the Land.

                  <head>THE SECOND PART OF Honour Civil: CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>ALL Chronologers and Antiquaries do agree, that in the Infancy of the Worlds Creation, men had no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation other than Woods, Groves, bushy Thickets, Caves, and Concavities in Rocks and Sandy Grounds to shelter themselves from the wind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which places they fenced about with sticks, heaps of stones, or the like, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from ravenous Beasts, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would annoy them. Then by degrees (as the World increased, and Inconvenience being the Mother of Invention) they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves small Hutts; from Hutts they came to build Houses, and to cohabit in Hamlets or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and from thence sprang up Towns, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Castles, and Fortified Places. Then the Inhabitants of one City or Place waged warr against those of another, and the Victorious enlarged their Territories, and made them their Tributaries; and thus increasing in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants, formed to themselves a Civil Government, and growing in Riches, some studied one Art, and some another, some addicted themselves to Traffick, whilst others imployed their time in Martial Affairs. And what are Cities in these our days, but the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, habitation, and receptacle of worthy, ingenious, wealthy, and munificent brave men; which made <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Quint</hi> much to glory that he was a Citizen of <hi>Ghent.</hi> And <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, in answer to a Letter of the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> wherein he declared his many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, styled himself only <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and Burgess of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then that Cities are of such renown, and the Inhabitants thereof so signal in Coat-Armour, as having such a mixture and affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Gentry, it will be necessary that in this Treatise we take notice of our Cities and chief Towns Corporate (being places of such concern to the Nation) as to their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Governments, Courts of Judicature, Magistrates, their Armorial Badges belonging as well to the said Cities and Towns, as to their several Incorporated Companies in <hi>London:</hi> And first with <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>This famous City, when under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Britains, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> was destroyed by the <hi>Danes</hi>: but <hi>AElfred,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> having reduced the whole Land to one Monarchy, repaired and re-peopled it, and committed the custody thereof to his Son in Law <hi>Alhered</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose decease it returned to King <hi>Edward,</hi> sirnamed the Elder, who had it governed under him by <hi>Port-Graves,</hi> or <hi>Port-Reves,</hi> which in divers Records are styled <hi>Vicecomites, Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counties,</hi> or <hi>Sheriffs.</hi> In the first of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the first, the Citizens obtained to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by two Bailiffs or Sheriffs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtained to have a Mayor for their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Magistrate, the first of which was <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwyn</hi> a Draper, who was constituted, and so continued four and twenty years.</p>
                     <p>The City within the Walls and Freedom thereof is divided into six and twenty Wards, and the government thereof committed to the care of as many grave Citizens of good repute and quality, which are Aldermen, each of which having the overseeing of his respective Ward. And besides these Aldermen, there are two Sheriffs which are annually chosen, as also a Lord Mayor, who according to his degree and seigniority of being Alderman after Sheriff, is by the consent of the Citizens (that is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-men of each Company) yearly elected; and these are clothed in Scarlet Gowns, and wear Gold Chains; and as Coadjutors, every Alderman hath his Deputy of the Ward, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Common-Councel-men.</p>
                     <p>This City by their Charter hath ample and large Priviledges and Immunities granted unto it, which hath been confirmed and enlarged by most of our Kings and Queens; as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Acts and Ordinances for the regulation and better government of the several Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Companies, and the Members thereof, so as they are not repugnant to the Law of the Nation, and detriment of the King; they have also the power of keeping of Courts, holding Pleas, Assizes, and Goal Delivery; with the punishment of Offenders by Fine, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Death, as occasion requireth. The Citizens are not constrained to go out of the said City to warr, without an emergent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to suppress a Foreign Invasion; they may pass Toll-free throughout all <hi>England</hi>; they have a Common Seal, and Armorial Ensigns of Honour; and for Recreation have Free-warren or Liberty to hunt about the said City; with many other Immunities too tedious to set down.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Royal Affrican Company</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was by his Majesties great prudence and care, for the general good of this Nation, and of his Foreign Dominions and Plantations, erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Company, and is likely to prove the most beneficial Trade that belongs to his Crown, as well by the Commodities Exported and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as by the <hi>Negro</hi> Trade.</p>
                     <p>The Goods of English growth Exported are, Sayes, Perpetuances, Broad-clothes, Welsh-plains, and other Woollen Manufactures in great abundance, besides quantities of other English Goods and Stuffs; the large consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof doth not only enable the Tenant the better to pay his Rent, and maintain his Family, but also sets many thousands of poor people at work, in making, dying, and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of these Stuffs and Clothes: And together with these Goods of English growth, are also sent vast quantities of Foreign Goods, chiefly imported by our <hi>East-India</hi> Company, by which his Majesties Customes, the wealth of his People, and the Navigation of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are much encreased.</p>
                     <p>The Foreign Commodities Imported are, Gold, Elephants-teeth, Wax, Hides, and other Commodities almost all as good as gold.</p>
                     <p>And as to the benefit of the <hi>Negro</hi> Trade, it is such, that by it all the <hi>American</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are yearly furnished with great quantities of Slaves, not elsewhere to be had; by whose labour, and the Planters industry, the King and his People are very much enriched.</p>
                     <p>The bounds of this Companies Trade are large, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Sally</hi> in <hi>South-Barbary</hi> to <hi>Cape Bona Esperanza</hi> inclusive.</p>
                     <p>The Voyage out and home is short, usually within the compass of a year. Many ships and seamen are constantly employed in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Service; who for the securing their Trade, have at a very great expence erected several Forts and Factories all along the Coast of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> without which the Trade cannot possibly be preserved to this Nation; and for that very reason this Trade cannot be managed but by a Company and a joynt Stock; for no private person will undergo the Charge of Forts and Factories abroad, besides such as Venture one Voyage, and perhaps no more, do usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the cheapest way in their Exports, and will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50041:155"/>
not have that care to send so good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable Commodities as a Company who are constantly to trade thither will, who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged so to do, as well for supporting the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their trade, as for bringing our English Manufactures into a better reputation than those of our Neighbours, which this Company hath really effected in several Commodities formerly bought in <hi>Holland,</hi> as Sayes, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Knives, &amp;c. being now all Exported of our own make.</p>
                     <p>And of this difference in and between the Commodities send by the Company, and those sent by private Traders, the Natives of <hi>Guiny</hi> (who are a sagacious people) are very sensible by the ill-dealings they have met with in that kind from some private Traders, which hath been a thing very disadvantageous to our English Manufactures and Trade: but these mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>APPLEBY</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Aballaba</hi>) was a City in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the chief Town in <hi>Westmerland</hi> (as it remains still) at, and before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest; insomuch that the County took Name from it, and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the <hi>County of Appilby.</hi> It is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally reported concerning this place, That it was under the Jurisdiction of a Mayor, when <hi>London</hi> was only govern'd by a Bailiff; which how true it is, I shall not concern my self; but the beginning of the Majoralty of <hi>London</hi> (formerly governed by <hi>Portgraves</hi>) is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoned from the first year of <hi>Richard</hi> the First: and <hi>Appleby</hi> had a Charter from <hi>Henry</hi> the First (who was Son to the Conqueror) of very great Priviledges confirm'd by King <hi>Iohn</hi> (as is yet to be seen) and all the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> successively. It continued a place of great account till 1176. (the 22 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2.) at which time it was utterly destroyed by the incursion of the <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>William</hi> their King, as appears from a Stone in the School-Garden-House. And it should seem then, in regard of its Loyalty and Sufferings, this King took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion upon it, and (in all probability) build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Church dedicated to St. <hi>Lawrence</hi>; and for their Arms gave them his own Coat, with an honorary distinction, Gules, three Lions passant guardant in Pale, crowned, Or, with this Inscription on their Seals, <hi>SIGILLVM COMMVNITATIS BVRGII DE AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PILBY</hi>; and on the Reverse St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> on the Grid-Iron, kept down by force, and burning in the Flames, from which ariseth a Flag or Standard with three Lions (as before) and the Devise this, <hi>HIC IACET LAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENTIVS IN GRATICVLA POSITVS,</hi> to shew it resisted even unto

fire. Now this King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second was the first (as all Antiquaries agree) who bare for his Arms three Lions; and therefore it must needs be a great honour to the place, and undoubted sign or token of its Loyalty (a quality for which it now is, and ever was famous) that he should signalize it with his own Coat, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished only by an honourable addition of three Crowns. And though Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> (whose footsteps <hi>Speed</hi> followeth) tells us, out of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Newburg, That</hi> William <hi>King of the Scots took this place and</hi> Brough <hi>by a sudden surprise, a little before he himself was taken at</hi> Aulnwick <hi>in</hi> Northumberland (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true); yet they are all mistaken in this, <hi>That these two places were not recovered till King</hi> John's <hi>time</hi>; for 'tis certain, The Scots (after the Country had got themselves into an Array) were beaten back, and their King taken Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And 'tis certain also, that though King <hi>Iohn</hi> did bestow them on <hi>Robert de Veteripont</hi> for his good service; yet he recovered them not from the Scots, for they came into his hands (<hi>propter transgressionem factam per Hugonem de Morevilla</hi>) by reason of the forfeiture of <hi>Hugh de Mervil</hi> (a great man in those parts and the same (if I mistake not) that killed <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi>) as was given in upon Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition taken at <hi>York, die Iovis proximo post mediam quadragesimae Anno Regni Regis Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardi</hi> 3.</p>

(as appears by Records) <hi>die Martis in festo Sancti Stephani Martyris</hi> (which was about the eleventh of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second) it was so burn'd down and wasted by the Scots, that of that Rent, upon several Inquisitions found and returned, there remained to the King only two Marks <hi>per Annum,</hi> so that nine parts in ten were utterly destroy'd.</p>
