            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Having been so often with M. <hi>Walker</hi> that I could take notice of his great Care that his Account of the Siege of <hi>Derry</hi> should give as little Offence as possible, do think it a piece of Justice to him, to let the World know how far his Intentions were from contriving that Book, as is given out, to the Injury of any Party. He knew very well some Dissenters of his own Country had insinuated into their Friends here,
<pb facs="tcp:60518:3"/>
That they and their Brethren were the People that did the Work in <hi>Derry,</hi> and that all others were but Cyphers in the whole Action. Notwithstanding this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would rather take occasion by his private Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to reprove them, than express their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in Print, and therefore he gave them, particularly their Ministers, the fairest Character he could; and when he gave the Printer a List of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Clergy, he order'd a Title to be prepared for a List of the Names of the others, and did make all the Enquiry he could, for fear they should think his omitting them, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to make them inconsiderable there; but not finding any way to be inform'd, he was forced to dismiss the Book without their Names; but if he had thought it material, he was willing enough to oblige them, and did stay some days for some Papers of theirs, they sent him word they desired might be inserted, but he heard nothing more of them. After the printing of the Book he was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Reproaches, which he has indured all this while, 'till his Silence was
<pb facs="tcp:60518:3"/>
counted an Argument of his Guilt, and that 'twas said, <hi>He knew well enough how he had wronged them.</hi> He was still wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to pass by all this, 'till the Scandal grew too heavy for him, and they interpreted the Book as a Design to set up a Party, and the like, and to interest a Country that he loves in their quarrel. They very well understand his Behaviour in <hi>Ireland,</hi> how far it was from any warmness or severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them there; and I do appeal to them, Whether his affection to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation (where he had his Education and some Honor done him) as well as Favor to themselves, and Charity to some of them, has not formerly been a disservice to him.</p>
            <p>But since they have animated their Friends here, and been such ill Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to put them out of Temper, when all things are preparing, with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calmness, for an Accommodation, he does think himself obliged to undeceive those People that are lead by such Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mistakes, that may put them into a new Ferment, and Di<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:60518:4"/>
of all good Men of their Moderation and Willingness to Unite with us. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> would think himself the unhappiest Man alive, if he should contribute any thing to so great a Mischief; and to clear himself, has at last been perswaded to write this <hi>Vindication,</hi> in which he is forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and rebuke with some Authority and Resent, but hopes none will take it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but those he intended it for of his own Country; and such he hopes will be caution'd by it to find some other way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending themselves to the Friendship and Charity of their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> than by increasing their Jealousies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting new Distances among Persons of the same Christian Profession.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE ACCOUNT OF THE <hi>Siege of Derry.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MAster <hi>Walker</hi> being very sensible how ready some People have been to take advantage of some Omissions in his Book of the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>London derry,</hi> and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, not only into very angry Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on himself, but to a Disparagement of those Actions Providence was pleas'd to interest him in, to the preservation of the Place, thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self under some obligation to publish this <hi>Paper;</hi> not so much to establish his own Reputation, as to assert the Truth of His Account, and to do every Man right (as near as he can) that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it: And the rather, because he does without vanity believe it some Disservice to the King, to suffer those things to lye under any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60518:5"/>
Doubt or Aspersions, that have been done for His sake; and because he finds some that are Enemies to the Government, very industrious in running down that Business, to make it little in the Opinion of the People, and to discourage the Kings Subjects in his Service, and from the like Undertakings.</p>
            <p>Others he sees, that are very well pleas'd with the late happy Change, but by their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness to Mr <hi>Walker,</hi> are too easily seduc'd into the like Prejudices, and do unawares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Ridiculing <hi>That</hi> and other great Providences, that have attended these Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that are a mighty support to all Good Men in their approbation and love of the present Constitution.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> hopes, that under these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations He may be allowed the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any <hi>Prejudices</hi> against him, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, at least, to satisfie those Readers that have us'd him with such Severity, that the very Errors of the Printer are all accounted to him; the importunity and forwardness of those Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did get the Book out of his hands much sooner than he intended, so that it was neither so perfect nor correct as it should have been; but he considered it was all plain Matter of Fact, and so did require less Art in the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Method: And his aversness to make any thing publick, and the load of Business then upon him, made him very unfit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it against the Assaults of Criticks, or the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60518:5"/>
Reproach of those that were not his Friends. He was indeed very uneasie to find so many Mistakes of the <hi>Press,</hi> (which he <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dered to be Corrected) and was too willing to excuse them to himself, to avoid further labour, by flattering himself most People would be so kind, to give him those Common Allowances that persons may pretend to, that are not us'd to such Adventures.</p>
            <p>To omit things of lesser moment. the first thing complained of was that <hi>Insinuation</hi> (as they call'd it) in the Preface, <hi>By what Hand he would defend and maintain both, &amp;c.</hi> By which Expression our <hi>Irish Dissenters</hi> would incense their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and will have it, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> intended to exclude them from their Just pretentions to the Credit of the Service done the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> by their means and Interest.</p>
            <p>God forbid he should go about to do so great a Wrong to any Party; for it is not his business, no more than in his power, to set up one Party, or to pull down another. It would please him much better to see some Expedient that might Unite them both. But his Intelligence from <hi>England</hi> was not so good, that he could understand all the Proceedings at that time, or be now so exact to distinguish between the Merits of one Man or another; and when by Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the Work was done, he was too well pleased to be troubled with any Curiosity of that kind. Indeed he owns the little Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60518:6"/>
he had, did afford great Characters of the Writings and Sufferings of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Men under Popery, thô the <hi>Gazets</hi> were commonly fill'd with <hi>Addresses,</hi> yet there was sometimes room left for such Accounts; but for want of Correspondence with any of the other Communion, he did not hear of the Books, nor had accounts (he has since met with) of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of their Great Men against the Common Enemy. He did understand some of them were seduced into the Councils of the late Reign, that were never design'd for their good or ours; but he always had Charity to think, They closed with that and such like opportunities, and indur'd the Favors of that Government, with intention to do good Service to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as well as to themselves in particular.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is not willing to argue upon such Matters, thò he must needs own, whether from the Accounts he had from <hi>England,</hi> or the great esteem he had for those Great Men there, or the willingness most people have to favour their own Principles, or from his Observations in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he did not think he did wrong to any by that Expression, but rather believ'd, that he should find all People convinc'd of the Truth of it; and that the strength and interest of the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> lay in the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> the late Reign he thought had determin'd that Point; but however, when he is better inform'd, he will be very willing to retract, and if in the mean time he has done wrong to any, will as heartily beg their pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60518:6"/>
These things, when Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> consider'd them, might very well incline him to use, at least so innocent an Expression on behalf of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But he thinks fit to deal a little more plainly in the Matter, so that whatever he says of this Nature, will, he hopes, be more easily excus'd: He does confess, that in the writing that Book, he thought it necessary for him, with as little Offence as possible, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that he was a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not without the greatest Charity and Tenderness for his fellow Christians. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Contrary was averr'd so positively, and generally receiv'd all over the Kingdom, and prevail'd so much, that all the good Services at <hi>Derry</hi> were wholly appropriated to that Party, with great wrong to the other; he does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himself extreamly obliged to their People, and he will never, while he lives, neglect any Opportunity of doing them Justice; but he knows they themselves would not desire any Character that should exclude their Fellow Sufferers; and however the Matter may be disputed here, it was never Contended at <hi>Derry.</hi> And as for his own share, how much soever it may injure him in his Advantage or Reputation; and though they may think themselves kind in their making him one of their Opinion, and design him Honor by it, for which he is very thankful to them, knowing very well that his known kindness and zeal for the <hi>Scotch</hi> might give some colour to those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses yet it cannot give him any fair Character to suffer himself to be represented a Person that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60518:7"/>
would act so contrary to his Profession, <hi>That he could dissemble to such a degree with God and his Church;</hi> therefore he hopes all People will be willing to pardon him if he shews some aversion to such an Imputation, and is desirous to avoid the Reproach of so fickle and unconstant a Man. Besides this, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> was not a little concern'd to see some of his Countrymen, of another Communion, so forward in establishing themselves the great Contrivers and Promoters of the King's Service and Interest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he would not say any thing that should reflect upon their Number or Quality or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances there, that may make them seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for such an Undertaking; he knows well what to attribute to them on those Accounts, and it would be wrong to others to flatter them; he would rather advise them to more Moderation, and less Partiality, and they will find very little Reason to continue those Pretensions. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable they were in <hi>Derry</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> may be allow'd to judge: For the better Sort, he knows them so Modest, they will not contend for them, they being all good Churchmen; and as for others, they may be deceiv'd in their Accounts of them, for many thousands deserted the Garison, and took Protections from the Irish; and what sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they were, they might inform themselves if they please, and find reason enough to abate of their Severity against Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> for denying the Credit of that whole Affair to their Friends or Party. But one thing Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> desires leave to recommend to them, to consider their own Temper and Constitution, and ask themselves the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60518:7"/>
Question, <hi>If they were in</hi> Derry, <hi>and were the greater number, and more considerable, whether they would have chosen Church of</hi> England-<hi>men their Governors, and been contented with so moderate a share of the Church, and in the Afternoons, and have suffer'd others to have the property in it, and to enjoy it all the rest of the week?</hi> This, one should think, would convince them where it was the Power and Number lay, unless the Air of <hi>England</hi> does dispose men to more Modesty than other Countries, which Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> would be glad for their sakes it had that virtue. These things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> does not see what reason they have to quarrel so much with him, <hi>That he did not give their Ministers a higher Character;</hi> After he had pass'd the Church of <hi>England</hi> men so slightly, how could he in Justice to them say more for the others? the wrong certainly, if any, was to the other side; but that he could make more bold with his Friends, and they had been used to dispense with him on the like Occasions, he gave them the credit of an equal Care; and though their Friends here, out of Complement to themselves, may expect a greater Character, he does not doubt but they are well pleas'd with it, if they are in the same Temper he left them, and are not warm'd by the Resents on this side the Water, and the Letters sent them. In their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at <hi>Derry,</hi> they were not only an Example and Credit, but a Reproach to their Brethren now in <hi>England,</hi> for the Good of the Publick; they could lay aside their Animosities and Distinctions, and not contend for any thing, but were satisfied

with the bare liberty of their own Service on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> in the Afternoon in the Church, which being the safest place, and most convenient for Assemblies, would have been great Cruelty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, as well as Mischief to the rest, to expose their Friends to the danger of other places. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> thought fit to make some addition to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by some Reflexion on two others of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent behaviour, a liberty very common to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and explain things by their contraries: As for Mr. <hi>Os.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is concern'd he had any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to name any to their disadvantage, but he did it with that notion that he had of him in the Garison, and those of his own Profession there, and thought it would on that account give the less Offence, but he could not easily forget the effects of his Letter which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had shar'd in to his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that Clause of the Letter wherein my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> threatens to Massacre all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish by sacrificing them to the Rabble, made it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material to insert it. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will be very ready to give that Gentleman all opportunity of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himself, and shall make him all imaginable satisfaction, if he has done him wrong. He has heard of the Gentlemans good Intentions in his proceedings, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is sorry they were no better understood, that he might clear him from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of those Mischiefs his management and advices brought upon that part of the Kingdom; but it is hard to serve too such Masters, the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> and the <hi>Irish;</hi> if he was not more industrious and serious, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is too sure he was more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in his Service to the latter, by his impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60518:8"/>
not only on the meaner sort, but on some of the best quality. As for the other Gentleman. Mr <hi>W.</hi> thinks they do themselves a great deal of right, that they do not seem concern'd for him; and since Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is so much their Care, he is sorry he plac'd his Resentments no better but joyn'd them together, that are of so different a Character among those (they say) they are better known to; tho' he thinks it advisable they should not put him upon justifying himself any further in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Another thing that the same People think a great wrong to them, is, <hi>The not naming the Non Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Ministers.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows they might very justly reproach him if he had designedly omitted it; but he really professes, he was not only unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Names, but, tho' he took some pains to inquire into them, could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and tho he has since that desired a Friend to make a more narrow search for them among that have reflected on him on this account, he finds them still more teady to reproach him, then able to inform him better. But that this Omission was not cut of any prejudice to the Gentlemen, is very evident from the care he hastaken of them before and since that in his Recommendations of them to an equal Reward with those of his own Communion; and tho' some idle persons have insinuated his wilful neglect of them, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests against it: But if it were not more out of regard to them, than those that concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much for them, he should not think he were obliged to give them this satisfaction But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60518:9"/>
they might have prevented this themselves if they had pleas'd, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> having waited several days for some thing he understood they would have inserted, and they are not strangers to this them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and therefore have the less reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Mr <hi>Walker</hi> in that matter, since they took so little care to inform him, when they had such Opportunity to do it, and may have the like again if they please.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is sorry he has any Occasion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to insist upon such little things as these for his Vindication; he little expected to meet such Usage and Reflexions any where, except it had been in an Irish Camp: And he does very much wonder how it proves to the Reputation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of those People that would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so considerable in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to shew themselves Enemies to him that contbuted all he could to the defence of it, and their Interest in it, some will be apt to think 'tis a sign they had not much to thank him for. But if he had committed some Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs or Faults, he had more reason to expect from such, that they would have conceal'd or excus'd them, than that they should be so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious in exposing either him or them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> understands he is further accused for his neglect of naming those that died in the Service of <hi>Derry,</hi> his Silence in that is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their Widows and Children. But in hopes those that complain of him in this matter have some charitable Intention towards them, and want Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s direction, he does promise
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60518:9"/>
them he will publish a List of them as soon as he can make it perfect, and will in the mean time dispose their Charity, if they please to contribute to their Relief, with the best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he can. Others, he thinks, that have no such Occasion (and are not Relations) may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense with his neglect herein, and he has no reason to satisfie them. He did make an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in the Book for his not being more particular in the Character of the Dead, as well as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which he thought would excuse him to all but those that will never be pleased; and he did not make any Provision against the Cavils of persons of that disposition. But all that were at <hi>Derry,</hi> by the King's Favour, have been largely consider'd, at the instance of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and they shall be his constant Care as long as he lives, and he will never be wanting in doing all the right and service he can, which he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obliged to, not so much to avoid any mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, or to humor those that find fault without any design of Friendship to him or to them, but out of a just sense he always must retain of their Courage and Sufferings in that cause he engaged them in.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> does think he should be very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to take notice of all their Exceptions; but every little thing is advanced by their industry so much to his disadvantage, that he is forced to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flle, as all Men must do that speak for themselves, and to take notice of another Quarrel they have against him about Colonel <hi>Philips,</hi> he could not well contrive how to omit the naming of him upon such an occasion, without doing him the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60518:10"/>
greatest wrong; and as to that Letter which they say is a downright Forgery, after he had seen it in the Hands of Colonel <hi>Philips,</hi> in two several Papers, acknowledged under Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s own hand, one of which Papers has not only been seen, but is subscribed to by his very Accuser, he thinks he had Authority e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to mention it. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> does wonder with what Forehead any man can dare to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the World such Impudent Falshoods; and what Designs such men can have, that they drive on with so little regard to Truth or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty? He is sorry he cannot pass by such things without Resentments.</p>
            <p>Others, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> understands, reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some Passages of his Book, not writ with that Gravity that may be expected from him: He must confess ingenuously, That the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was so great betwixt Acting and Writing that Story, that he had much ado to forbear shewing it was some Entertainment to him to feel the Alteration, and so many Comical Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages occurr'd to him, that he had since time to laugh at that if they had not been very Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, he had disobliged his Reader to a greater degree in that particular; but Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> thought himself amongst his Friends, and so has us'd a little freedom; but since he has been mistaken, he will take care to make his next Discourse more Stoical and Austere. But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> does wonder how they come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all this management from a man they had represented with so different a Character: But Persons that take such liberty, sometimes forget themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60518:10"/>
For (that) Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was very inconsiderable, alas! He did nothing, Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> was the Man, and such like stuff has been as common, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Discourses of these Men. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has not been wanting in doing Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> right, his Skill and Conduct was of that advantage to the preserving of that place, that he cannot do him too much honor, but Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s value for him is sufficiently testified by his care of his Widow and Children, yet (if Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> may put them in mind of it) the Letter writ from <hi>Derry</hi> to the King, subscribed by the Officers in Colonel <hi>Baker</hi>'s life time, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s name being the first, shews him to be a Man of some Consequence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and if it had pleased God Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> had lived, other things would have been said for Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that it is not proper for himself to enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>The next Grievance is, That Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has concerned himself more than he needs with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Cunningham:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is of another opinion, and thinks it was a peice of justice he owed himself and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to explain the necessity he was under to take that Government upon him; for he well knows it did ingage him in some Actions, that without such a necessity, he could not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, being obliged by his Coat to be a Man of Peace. And some ancient Canons are so severe upon Clergy-mens taking Arms, that they have been pronounced irregular upon doing it; but at the same time, Clergy-men are allowed to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the privileges of Mankind, and of all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60518:11"/>
Creatures in the World, they all may defend themselves, and there may such necessity lye upon them, that it is their duty to do it: we do not want Examples of the best sort to make this out, and if they failed, there is so much Reason to back that practice, that he is a <hi>Felo de se</hi> that neglects it.</p>
            <p>The old Canonists, indeed do look upon it as a great absurdity for Clergy-men to meddle with Arms, or to ingage themselves in War: and <hi>Gratian</hi> is a little more particular, and states the case of a Clergy-Man in a Siege, and under those Circumstances that he cannot well avoid annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Enemy. The <hi>Judaical</hi> Notions that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians retained in those days, made them look on such a one as polluted, and therefore he has some Penance injoyned him, or sometimes only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him: though some proceed to that severity upon this very Foundation, that such a person must forbear exercising his Function for some time. And all this is done to distinguish that Sacred Office from other Professions, and to discourage those that are set apart, and Dedicated to the more pure service of the Altar, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themselves in any other imploys; and therefore you find those Laws, not only forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clergy-men to turn Soldiers, but also forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to turn Merchants or Lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this with the greatest reason; for God has a property in such Persons, as he has also in Places, and Times, set apart for his Worship, and they ought not to be put to any other use. But <hi>Grotius</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60518:11"/>
brings the matter to a short issue, and after allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, speaks of this very Law that obliges a Clergy man to that degree. <hi>Quae tamen lex, ut omnes ejus generis summae necessitatis exceptione in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligendae,</hi> that in cases of the greatest necessity it is not binding, and that that, and all Laws of that kind, are to be understood with exceptions in cases of great necessity, for in such cases he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the same Man still, and is discharged of all manner of guilt or impurity.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> thinks his Case has all the Authority that the greatest necessity in the World can give to any Action, the lives of thousands, besides his own, were at stake, his Religion that is dearer than them all, and the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> equally dear to him, next door to an utter Extirpation out of that Kingdom, not to speak of the danger of others: how can any imagin, there should be an Obligation upon any Man that can exempt, or excuse his unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in such a Case? Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> confesses such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances would have better become persons whose Profession it was to do them, and he would never envied them the Imploy; but since the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came to his share, and God Almighty has bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed him with success in his Undertaking, he hopes they will be the more willing to excuse him; and to make it easie to them, that it might not be too great a favour to him, he thought fit to shew the occasion of his first taking the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Town, or rather to shew the necessity that threw it upon him, which he is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60518:12"/>
he cannot justifie without reproaching others.</p>
            <p>Another thing that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is upbraided with, is that his Account is very imperfect, and for that matter he will not dispute with them; for it is impossible it could be otherwise, or that the little time and convenience he had to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in such a thing could prevent it; he is the more willing to allow this, because two very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things occur to him, which at the writing of that Book he had forgot, and being so considerable in demonstrating that Providence that attended the defence of that Town, and that was so remarkable in our Deliverance, he begs leave to insert them in this Paper.</p>
            <p>In the Account of the Siege, you may find that people every day going out of <hi>Derry,</hi> the Enemy by that means had constant intelligence, and we had reason to be under great apprehension, and concern, more especially for our Ammunition, we considered how to preserve that, and having a great quantity in Mr. <hi>Camsy</hi>'s Cellar, we removed it to another place: the very next day after we removed it, a Bomb broke into the Cellar, and if our Powder had been there, we had certainly been destroyed.</p>
            <p>Another thing of as great moment was omitted, and that was a Bomb from the Enemy broke into a Cellar near <hi>Bulchers</hi> Gate; some had the Curiosity to examin what mischief it had done, and there they saw seven Men lying dead, that had been working at a Mine unknown to us, that if it had not been for so miraculous a Countermine, might have gone on in their Work, and have ruined us.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60518:12"/>
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> will not say, but there may be other as considerable things omitted, but they may too nearly concern Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> himself, and it would not become him to sound his own praises, no more than to reproach others.</p>
            <p>There are many other things objected against Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> but he does not think them worth the notice, and especially since they come from <hi>Papists</hi> and disaffected persons, whose interest it is to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie not only him, but all the Kings Friends, and make them despised, and to put a slight upon every thing that God is doing for the King and our Religion against theirs, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has done his part against them already at <hi>Derry,</hi> and for any thing that they can do to him here, he is as little concerned now, as he was at that time, because he cannot doubt but it will meet with the like success.
<q>
                  <l>—Quid enim quamvis infida levisque</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> understands that some people have a new quarrel to him, about a Book writ in his Defence, he thinks himself not at all accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any thing in that Pamphlet, having never seen it before it was Printed: he is obliged to the Gentleman for his care and concern for him; but he knows he cannot pretend to the Character he gives him, and would never have let such a thing pass if he had known it, and he hopes the World will be so kind to believe him a Man of less vanity than to suffer himself to be commended at such
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60518:13"/>
a rate. This he hopes will clear him of another imputation from the account the Gentleman is pleased to give of his losses, as if he were privy to this, and instructed the Author to lessen the Kings favour and bounty to him, which he knows does not only exceed his losses, but his merit too, but if it had been below both (as much as he owns it above them) he hopes few will think him so ridiculous and ungrateful, after he was so willing to lose all, and himself too, in his service, but will be satisfied with what is said already in his Defence; that he was altogether unacquainted with the Printing that Book, yet knows very well the Author did intend to Justifie Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and that being his Friend, and provoked by the discourses he met reflecting on him, he writ those Observations, but is well assured without any design of exposing Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to any constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his disadvantage, but Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> thinks his refusing such generous offers as have been made him, does demonstrate he has not served only for gain and interest; and his leaving his four Sons in that Service, shows he has still the same Zeal for it.</p>
            <p>All this put together, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> cannot but admire, what it is he has done that should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige people so much, that he has been so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, that they should be so industrious in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spattering him upon such little occasions: if he knew his fault he would be glad to rectifie it, and save them that labour, and till he does know it, he cannot think them so just or kind
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60518:13"/>
as he expected to find them, to one that has done them all the service in his power, and since they do him the honor to say God was pleased to make him an Instrument of some good to them, they have (one should think) the less reason to be angry at it. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has not taken this pains to satisfie them, or to establish himself in their esteem, as if it were so great a discouragement to want their good opinion; he does not know whether it would be for his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to have it, for there is a woe against him of whom all men speak well, and he is very well pleased to want that mark, and he knows that no Man can be so innocent, but he must endure reflection and abuses, and that therefore the Slanderers Throat is called an open Sepulchre, like Death, that all Men must submit to, and in such cases Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is not so unreasonable to desire to be singular, only as he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to get any Reputation by Writing, so he had some hopes he should not lose any. And he has not writ this, not that he thinks he has so great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to justifie himself, as to satisfie others, and that he thinks he ought in Justice to all those poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and People, that were concerned with him in <hi>Derry,</hi> to keep up the Reputation of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that they may never receive any stain from the Dirt, or Scandals any envious Persons can throw upon them, to prejudice them in the Kings favour or sense he has been so often pleased to express of their Fidelity and Courage, as well as their Sufferings in his Service, and particularly in this following Letter.</p>
