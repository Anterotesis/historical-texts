            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And therefore, for a more further diſcovery of the Actors and Conſpirators, in the late buſineſſe touching the death of the moſt high and mighty Monarch King JAMES; this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcourſe doth fully remonſtrate, and herein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſet down both the actors and their actions in this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Declaration</hi>

            <div type="declaration">
               <p>THE Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being in Spain, advertiſed by Letters, how that the King began to cenſure him in his abſence freely, and that many ſpake boldly to the King againſt him, and how the King had intelligence from Spain, of his unworchy carriage in Spain; and (how the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hamilton</hi> (upon the ſudden newes of the Princes departure) had nobly reprehended the King for ſending the Prince with ſuch a young man without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in ſuch a private and ſudden manner, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Nobility or Councel therewith, wrote a very bitter letter to the Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> conceived new am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious courſes of his own, and uſed all the deviſes he could to diſguſt the Princes mind of the match with Spain, ſo far intended by the King, made haſt home; where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he came, he ſo carryed himſelf, that what the King commanded in his Bed-Chamber, he controlled in the next: yea, received Packets to the King from forraign Princes, and diſpatched anſwers, without acquainting the King therewith in a long time after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116280:3"/>
Whereat, perceiving the King highly offended, and that the Kings mind was beginning to alter towards him, ſuffering him to be quarrelled and affronted in his Majeſties preſence; and obſerving, that the King reſerved my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> to be a rod for him, urging dayly his diſpatch for <hi>France,</hi> and expecting the Earl of <hi>Gondomor,</hi> who as it ſeemed, was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, and wonderfully credited by the King, &amp; would ſecond my Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi> his accuſations againſt him. He knew alſo that the King had vowed, <hi>that in deſpite of all the Divels in Hell, he would bring the Spaniſh match about again, and that the Marqueſse of</hi> Inicoſa <hi>had given the King bad impreſſions of him, by whoſe</hi> Articles of Accuſation, <hi>the King himſelf had examined ſome of the Nobility and Privy Councell, and found out in the examination, that</hi> Buckingham <hi>had ſaid after his comming from</hi> Spain, <hi>That the King was now an old man, it was now time for him to be at rest, and to be confined to ſome Park, and to paſſe the reſt of his time in hunting, and the Prince to be crowned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more the King urged him to be gone to France, the more ſhifts he made to ſtay, for he did evidently ſee that the King was fully reſolved to rid himſelfe of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherein he held him.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116280:4"/>
                  <hi>it, it will coſt me my life:</hi> with divers other ſpeeches to that effect.</p>
               <p>In like manner alſo the Counteſſe of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> my Lord of Buckingham's mother, upon the Friday after, the Phiſitians being alſo abſent, and at dinner, and not made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her doings, applied a plaiſter to the Kings heart and breaſt; whereupon he grew faint, ſhort breathed, and in a great agony. Some of the Phiſitians after dinner returning to ſee the King, by the offenſive ſmell of the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, perceived ſomething to be about him hurtfull unto him, and ſearching what it ſhould be, found it out, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that the King was poiſoned.</p>
               <p>Then Buckingham entering, commanded the Phiſitians out of the room, cauſed one of them to be committed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to his own chamber, and another to be removed from Court; quarrelling with others of the Kings ſervants in his Majeſties own preſence, ſo farre that he offered to draw his ſword againſt them in His Majeſties preſence. And Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinghams mother kneeling down before His Majeſtie, cried out with a brazen face, juſtice, juſtice; Sir, I demand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of your Majeſtie. His Majeſtie asked her for what? For that which their lives are no wayes ſufficient to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; <hi>for ſaying that my ſonne and I have poyſoned your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</hi> Poyſoned me! ſaid he; with that turning himſelf ſwouned, and ſhe was removed.</p>
               <p>The Sunday after, His Majeſtie died; and Buckingham deſired the Phiſitians who attended His Majeſtie, to ſigne with their hands a writ of teſtimony, that the powder which he gave him was a good and ſafe medicine; which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
               <p>Buckinghams creatures did ſpread abroad a rumour in London, that Buckingham was ſo ſorry for His Majeſties death, that he would have died, that he would have killed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116280:4"/>
himſelf if they had not hindred him; concerning which, I purpoſely enquired after it, of them that were neare him at that time, who ſaid; <hi>That neither in the time of His Majeſties ſickneſſe, nor after His death, he was more moved, then if there had never happened either ſickneſſe or death to His Majeſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One day when his Majeſty was in great extremity, he rod poſt to London to purſue his ſiſter in law to have her ſtand in ſack-cloath in S. Pauls for adultery. And another time in his Majeſties agony he was buſie in contriving and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a marriage for one of his coſens.</p>
               <p>Immediatly after his Majeſties death, the Phyſitian who was commanded to his chamber was ſet at liberty with a Caveat to hold his peace, the others threatned if they kept not good tongues in their heads.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time the Kings body and head ſwelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure, his hair with th the skin of his head ſtuck to the pillow, his nailes became looſe upon his fingers, and toes.</p>
