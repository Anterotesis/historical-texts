         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS Natural for Perſons in
diſtreſs to flye ſomewhere
for aſſiſtance; That's a
Principle Ingrafted into the very
Being and Conſtitution of Men,
and in many particulars may be well
enough juſtify'd and allow'd; but
then my Lord, there is a very great
<pb facs="tcp:98295:3"/>
difficulty in chooſing out the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and Repreſenting the Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;
and truly, I'm afraid our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
in thoſe Points have been the
cauſe why ſo many good Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have prov'd Inſucceſsful. That
I have made a right Election of the
Perſon I am well aſſur'd, both from
your Lordſhips Character of a good
as well as of a great Man, and Lord
Mayor of <hi>London:</hi> So that if the
things are well Repreſented, which
<hi>I</hi> humbly ſubmit to your Honours
Judgment, and withal are Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in themſelves, and neceſſary to
be redreſs'd, why then I preſume
there is but ſmall grounds to ſuſpect
the ſucceſs. As for the Papers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they are indeed what they
pretend to be, the Letters of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in Priſon to a Member of
Parliament; who, if he had not
been call'd off from us, by a haſty
<pb facs="tcp:98295:3"/>
fate, had long ſince attempted the
Regulation of <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Goals,</hi> but
Sir, this great work (tho there have
been ſome advances made towards
it) is yet unfiniſh'd, and the Poor
Debtors and Priſoners do now more
then ever, labour and ſtruggle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Wracks and Tortures of
theſe unmerciful Wretches. My
Lord, I need not aggravate the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to you, they're bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
indeed, and but too bad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; So that as things are now,
the Regulations of Priſons, and the
ſuppreſſing the Inſolence and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigance
of <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> would be a work
almoſt as Meritorious as that of your
great Predeceſſor, Sir <hi>William
Waller</hi> and deſervedly Entitle for your
ſake, the Lord Mayor of the City
of <hi>London,</hi> to another Character and
Sword of Honour for ever. I would
not ſpend your Lordſhips time in
<pb facs="tcp:98295:4"/>
uſeleſs flattery, or Complement your
Honour Infinitely above 'em both;
only this I muſt ſay, that ſince your
Lordſhips Election, the drooping
Genius of the City is ſtrangely
Reviv'd, and Men and things have
put on a new Face. But Sir, ſhort
Books ſhould have but ſhort Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or rather none at all, neither
had I given your Honour the trouble
of this but upon ſome particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
Well my Lord, conſidering the
whole Circumſtance, and eſpecially,
the Errand theſe Papers come
upon, <hi>I</hi> cannot much dread your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of 'em, and withal, that
you will Pardon their Author, who

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE chief Arguments that urged me to
Publiſh the following Letters are, breifly
theſe two; firſt, to let the World ſee what kind
of Creatures <hi>Bayliffs, Goalers</hi> and pretended
<hi>Solicitors</hi> are, and then to direct 'em how to
manage themſelves, and to Fence and Guard
againſt 'em with the moſt ſecurity, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
how far they'll Anſwer this Deſign, muſt
be left to the Judgment of thoſe that think
them worth their peruſal, only with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the matters here related are no
Chymerical Notions or Forgerys, but pure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact and Truth; Indeed, there is here
and there a ſupernumerary expreſſion inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt,
to make the diſmal Relation go down a
<pb facs="tcp:98295:5"/>
little the more gratefully, but ſtill the main
and ſubſtance of the matter is kept within the
bounds of every Days Practice and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
That there will be ſome out-crys againſt
them, is not to be doubted, and eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Bayliffs,</hi> or ſome ſuch kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who perhaps may be ſo impudent to
charge them with falſehood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what if
they do, conſidering the Teſtimony of ſuch kind
of People is but an indifferent Evidence at
beſt, eſpecially when they'r Witneſſes in their
own Caſe, I think I need not trouble my ſelf
much about that matter; the other part of my
deſign is to propoſe a medium, how theſe Great
and Intollerable grievances may be rectified and
redreſt, or at leaſt, if I fail in it my ſelf, to
ſet ſome better Heads to work about it.</p>
            <p>For I'm confident, as caſes ſtand, theſe
matters require a very ſpeedy redreſs. The
Evil Practices of <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> &amp;c. Being now
one of the greateſt miſeries of the Nation, but
eſpecially of this Town, and muſt grow every
Day worſe and worſe, till at laſt they become
intollerable.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I had receiv'd your Letter,
wherein you are pleas'd to command
me to give you the beſt Account I
was able of the Villanous Practices
of <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and their Aſſiſtants; the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Priſons in General, and the Miſeries and
Calamities of Poor Debtors in their reſpective
Confinements, I muſt confeſs, my wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to bleed a freſh, and truly at firſt ſight I
could not chooſe but think, but that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
was very like that of Queen <hi>Dido</hi> to <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
when ſhe deſir'd him to give her tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>,
this Notion from a very few ſecond thoughts was
ſoon ſuperſeded by another, which I ſince am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
was far more agreeable both to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and Deſign. I quickly foreſaw that a
Perſon of your Extraordinary Character could
not be guilty of the Barbarous Vanity, to Inſult
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98295:6"/>
and play upon the Agonys of the Unfortunate,
but rather that you had ſome good Deſign, after
you were fully Inſtructed in theſe kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to Propoſe an Expedient to your Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Houſe for the putting theſe Affairs
in a better Poſture. This is indeed a work well
Becoming an Engliſh Gentleman, eſpecially one
of the great Repreſentatives of the Nation; And
truely 'tis a ſubject both of our wonder and
ſorrow, that it hath unluckily hap'ned to lie
ſo long Unattempted. 'Tis pitty ſure that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that is the Miſtreſs of the beſt Laws as well
as the beſt Religion in the Chriſtian world,
ſhould ſuffer ſuch a dangerous Contagion to rage
ſo long in her very Heart and Bowels, without
Endeavoring by ſome means or other to ſuppreſs,
or at leaſt to curb the Diſtemper. Well, Sir, I
am Mightily Affected with your Generous Deſign,
and ſince you have been pleaſed to pitch upon me
to give you this Ungrateful Relation, you may
Depend upon't, I ſhall do it very fairly and
Impartially, and only Declare to you the pure
matters of Fact, and ſuch other Occurrences that
have fall'n within the Compaſs of my own dear
bought Experience; but then Sir all this will be
too much to be drawn into the narrow Compaſs
of one letter; and therefore for method ſake I'll
Divide it into particulars, and ſo continue it from
Poſt to Poſt till I have finiſh'd the whole.</p>

            <head>LETTER II. In which is an Account of the baſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Baylifs in General, and the
Villanous tricks and Stratagems they uſe to
extort Money both from the Debtor and
Creditor.</head>
            <p>BAYLIFFS in General are a ſort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Wretches made up of the Dregs and
Refuge of Mankind; they are commonly a
kind of Beaſts of Prey, that for their Iude and
vitious behaviour are Baniſh'd from the ſober
Converſation of their fellow Creatures; and
ſure then 'tis great pitty that ſuch vermine as
theſe, which ought rather to be Chain'd up and
driven out from the reſt of the World, ſhould
be let at large, and withall Entruſted with a
priviledg that Entitles them to a larger oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
then ordinary, to Tranſact and Propagate
their Villanous Practices. Sir, I hope you will not
miſtake me; I am not Declaiming againſt or
Arraigning the Office of a Bayliff, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that Execute it. I confeſs 'tis highly Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
there ſhould be ſuch kind of Officers, and
truely 'twould be morally Impoſſible for the
<hi>Nation</hi> to Subſiſt without ſome body to Execute
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98295:7"/>
the Law in ſome Caſes, but then 'tis very hard
that none, or at leaſt very few but Profligate
Rogues and Canibals ſhould be ſingl'd out for
ſuch an Employment. I'm confident (with
Submiſſion to better Advice) there might be a
Medium found out to put the Management of
this Affair into ſober hands, which would not
only be a very great advantage to poor Debtors,
but likewiſe a Conſiderable eaſe to Creditors,
and a Benefit to the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> in General.
Sir, I think it will be needleſs to trouble you with
the ſtrange kind of tricks, they uſe, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſtratagems and devices they have to get
Men into their Clutches; that's ſomething For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to my Purpoſe, and therefore I will not
Inſiſt upon't; But rather proceed to ſhew you how
Baſely and Villanouſly they uſe them when they
have once got them</p>
            <p>To go on then, when the Maſter <hi>Bayliff,</hi>
or <hi>Officer</hi> (as he terms himſelf) has got the
Writt; why then according to the Nature of
the perſon that is to be Arreſted, he immediately
whiſtles for two or three Dogs, or Followers, that
are always Lurking about his Houſe upon ſuch
occaſions; and out he goes, and having bon'd
or Nab'd this Defendant (as they call it) why
then their next Buſineſs is to run him to a Spung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Houſe, which is commonly one of their own;
and having ſixt him there, if they perceive
he's a ſtranger to their Managements, and under
any kind of fear or Apprehenſion of 'em, then
they turn in to him a Kennel of deep mouth'd
<hi>Hell Hounds,</hi> that eat and Drink upon him at
Diſcretion; and in the interim another party of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98295:7"/>
Curr's are ſent out to hunt the <hi>Town</hi> to try if they
can find any more Creditors that they can by
any means Incline or ſeduce to enter their actions
againſt him; and ſo having ſufficiently gorg'd
themſelves, the Maſter of the Ceremonys call's for
the Reckoning, which the poor Priſoner is forc'd
to pay; be it what it will; and then under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of removing him out of ſight, &amp;c. They
Conduct him to one of their ſtrong Rooms,
which they have for ſuch purpoſes. There the
Wretch is left alone, and what's worſe, if he call's
for Pen, Ink &amp; paper to ſend to any of his Friends,
'tis ten to one but they open his Letter, and ſend
or not ſend it as they find it will beſt anſwer
their Ends. Well, but he muſt not continue in
this kind of Separation long neither, before one
of the Gang is ſent up to him, who under pretence
of a great deal of Civility and Compaſſion to his
misfortune, wheedles and Cajoles him into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Circumſtances: Which he directly
Relates to a Cabal of Rogues below, who are
all the while debating which way they may
make the moſt of him. Having thus furniſh'd
themſelves with the Nature of his Abilitys, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
another of the ſurlieſt Curs in the whole Kennel is
ſent again to him to put him in mind of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Cuſtom they have, i. e. Civility Money;
this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> with a kind of Unmannerly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
Repreſents to him the diſmalneſs and
charge of going to Priſon, and withall let's
him know that if he doth not Inſtantly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with the <hi>Officer</hi> for his liberty to ſtay there,
That he will in a little time call a Coach and
carry him away; and thus having work'd him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98295:8"/>
up to the higheſt Pitch of Diſpair and fear, he
leaves him. After theſe two have Finiſh'd their
Managements, the <hi>Officer</hi> in Chief ſoon makes his
Appearance. Come Sir, ſays he, what do you
intend to do? I dare not keep you, beſides, if I
durſt, I muſt live by my buſineſs, I can't keep
my Servants and my ſelf to wait upon you for
nothing. You know our Methods, and if you
have a Deſign to ſtay here to night, why then
let me ſee ſome Money from you. Here the poor
Man is again forc'd, to ſpeak in their own Dialect,
to Lug out, and gives him what he has, or at
leaſt what this Unmercifull <hi>Governour</hi> is pleaſed
to extort from him; upon which Conſideration
he's Admitted to the favour of being ſtrongly
Lock'd and Barrocaded up for that night in a
Priſon, which in all points is equall, and in ſome
worſe then that which according to Law, he
ought to be carryed to; but ſtill they have not
done with him neither, the next that Attacks
him is the good Miſtreſs of the Houſe, but ſhe
like an honeſt Conſcientions Woman doth not
want much of him, only ſix or ſeven Shillings
which the <hi>Officers</hi> men have Drunk below, and two
Shillings for his Bed, and then ſhe'll lay on the
ſheet's; well there's no Remedy, but this muſt be
pay'd too as well as the reſt, or elſe after all, he
muſt to Priſon. Well Sir, to make as ſhort of
this ſad Relation as I can, upon theſe and ſome
other Terms of the like Nature, he's at laſt
Lock'd up till the next morning, and then they
begin to play the former Game over again, till at
laſt finding that they have Wrack'd him as far
as the Nature of the thing will bear, they then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98295:8"/>
come to him, and in good Earneſt tell him that
there are other Actions againſt him, and that
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs</hi> he can raiſe Money to remove himſelf to
the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> he muſt after all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to go to Priſon. From this ſhort Account
I Preſume you will be able to Judg at the Miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Condition of thoſe poor Wretches, whoſe
Misfortunes have thrown them into the Jaws of
theſe kind of Vermine. I ſhall therefore only
trouble you with two or three lines more to ſhew
you likewiſe how they abuſe the Perſon's that
Employ em, and ſo take my Leave till the next
<hi>Poſt.</hi> And this they do Cheifly two ways. Firſt,
by taking Money to Arreſt the <hi>Perſon</hi> that is
the Debtor; and after, accepting a <hi>Bribe</hi> from the
<hi>Creditor,</hi> &amp;c. this is a Cheat ſo common among
them; and ſo well known to every body, that hath
been forc'd to make uſe of them, that I think I
need not Enlarge upon it. 'Tis an Act that they
pride themſelves in, and look upon it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
point of Honeſty and Civility; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that I have heard one of the Chiefeſt
Maſters of the <hi>Order,</hi> with a kind of vanity,
acknowledg, that if he did not get more by Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Creditor,</hi> then he did by <hi>Arreſting</hi> the <hi>Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
he could not get bread by the Employment.</p>
            <p>The other Trick that they uſe to Cheat the
<hi>Creditor</hi> out of his money, and Sometimes out of
his Debt too, is to Perſwade him to lay his
Action, notwithſtanding he knows the <hi>Debtor</hi>
is reſolv'd to bring a <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> nay, I have
known ſome Cunning <hi>Debtors</hi> my ſelf in ſuch a
caſe, give a <hi>Bayliff</hi> a Liſt of all the <hi>Creditors</hi> they
were Apprehenſive would give them any Trouble,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98295:9"/>
with Directions to go to them and get them
to enter their Actions againſt them, under the
Notion, that when once they had made themſelves
Priſoners in the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> they
would not then think them worth any further
trouble. In ſhort, the Villanous Devices, and the
Baſe and Inſolent Behaviour of theſe ſort of
<hi>People,</hi> have render'd 'em one of the Greateſt
Grievances of the <hi>Nation,</hi> but of this <hi>Town</hi> more
Eſpecially. Sir, I Appeal to your own and to the
thoughts of every Conſidering Man, whether it
be not a ſad <hi>Proſpect</hi> to ſee whole Herds of theſe
kind of <hi>Creatures Ranging</hi> about the <hi>Town</hi> with
Swords by their ſides, exactly Anſwering the
<hi>Devils Character, Going about ſeeking whom they
may Devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To wind up this Unpleaſant Narrative; 'Tis
Doubtleſs a very Unlucky caſe that the <hi>Executive</hi>
part of the <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be committed to ſuch
<hi>Hangmen</hi> as theſe. Indeed I can give no other Reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, but that the <hi>Nation</hi> hath been yet Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Inconveniency that attends upon it, or
rather have thought it a trifle not worth their
Notice. But Sir, ſince you have been ſo Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly

I will not at all queſtion but you will ſoon bring
it to a Happy Iſſue.</p>

            <p>Their chief buſineſs here (as in all other

or his Deputy at the Execution of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
as well as to ſerve his Warrants and levy
his Executions; and for this formerly they had
their ſetled Fees and Allowances; and withal,
inſtead of their Swords and Battoons, which
they march with now, were oblig'd to carry
only a White Wand in their hands, to diſtinguiſh
them from other perſons. How this good Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
came to be worn out and diſcontinued. I

the meaner ſort of people are

            <p>Well Sir, when one of theſe ſort have Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Deſcription of Newgate, together with their
manner of Government, &amp;c. as it relates to
Debtors.</head>
               <p>Newgate (as I ſaid) is the chief Priſon for the
County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for Debtors, as well as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
and Traytors, and is divided into Three
different Stations or Degrees. The firſt is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>the Preſs-Yard,</hi> whither none but perſons that
have Money to pay extravagant Prizes for their
Lodging and Entertainment are admitted. The
Second is the Common Side, where the Rogues
and Thieves, Whores and Pick-Pockets, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſome Miſerable Debtors, are all Jumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one among another, and truly make a very
deplorable ſight indeed. The Third is the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſide, to which miſerable place (for I cannot
name it without a great deal of Agony and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order)
my Misfortunes brought me. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it was thus: About a twelve monthago
One of theſe Sparks took me up upon an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98295:10"/>
and finding that I knew their Tricks
too well to be impos'd upon, he forthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
me to <hi>Newgate:</hi> I think 'twas about ten of
the Clock at Night before I reacht my New
Quarters. He had no ſooner thruſt me into the
Lodg, but <hi>Cerberus</hi> the Turn-Key, with a great
many other Dogs of Lower Stations came how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and grinning about me. Their firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
was, <hi>Sir, have you any money? If not, you
muſt go on the Common Side.</hi> Tho I was not
much terrified with their Threats and Oaths,
however I told them, <hi>If they wonld give me Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till the morning, to enquire into the Cuſtom of the
Place, I would be conformable.</hi> Well, with much
ado and a great deal of Swearing, Curſing and
Hectoring, they unlock'd the Door that leads up
to the Debtors Apartment: but here I was in a
worſe ſtate than before; being left in the dark
upon a diſmal pair of Stairs, not daring to ſtir a
foot for fear of tumbling into ſome hole, and
breaking my Neck: and to mend the matter too,
comes one of the Dogs that brought me thither,
and inſults over me for not compounding with
the Officer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, Sir, between this and the
nauſeous ſtink that came down the Stairs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I had much ado to ſupport my ſelf; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I was forc'd to do it for an Hour at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I could perſwade any body to come to my
aſſiſtance upon any terms. At laſt comes an under
Turn-Key, and with a great deal of Indifference
and more Impudence, ask'd me what I'd have? I
found now 'twas no time to urge Juſtice or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
to him; and therefore in ſhort I told
him, <hi>If he would change my Station, I would gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98295:11"/>
him to his ſatisfaction.</hi> Here he began to ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
a little, and withal told me, <hi>That their Cuſtom
was to Lock up all their Doors at Eight of the Clock
exactly; which were not to be opened again but upon
particular Conſiderations; but however, for half a
Crown he'd open the Door of the Debtors Hall, and
turn me in there, where I ſhould find a bed and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
With this I ſoon comply'd; and ſo in he
lets me; but withal leaves me in the dark again:
but here I had not been long before one of the
Priſoners calls to me; and finding me to be a
ſtranger and a Debtor, ſtrikes a Light; by the
help of which I got a view of my new Lodging;
which I muſt own to you was dreſs'd up with ſo
many wretched and deplorable Circumſtances,
that in the whole Accounts of my Life, I never
met with any thing like it: In this <hi>Common Hall</hi>
(as they call it) were 12 beds at leaſt, and two
perſons in every one of them. Where ſome lay
naked, others with ſhav'd Heads without any Caps
upon 'em, and moſt of them taking Tobacco;
which together with the Smoak and Stink, made
ſuch a diſmal Spectacle; that I defie any Poet or
Painter to fancy or deſcribe the like: However,
Sir, there was no Remedy, but here I muſt ſtay;
and truly, as caſes ſtood, I was pretty well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
I was here too. To make as ſhort of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as I can, I walk'd in this Noble Hall till
Morning, when about 7 my Chamber-fellows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to turn out of their reſpective Kennels, and
came to me to demand their <hi>Garniſh,</hi> which they
told me was 6 <abbr>s.</abbr> and 8 <abbr>d.</abbr> This truly I paid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any grudging, and they ſpent it as freely in
good Bread and Cheeſe, and Ale and Beer; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98295:11"/>
to make me ameuds, drank my Health, and
wiſh'd me an happy Enlargement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Twould
make a man wonder indeed to ſee with what
Cheerfullneſs and Courage ſome of theſe poor
Wretches undergo this miſerable conſinement,
and how many hard ſhifts &amp; ſtratagems they are
forc'd to uſe, to get half a Crown againſt <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
night, to pay for their beds, to prevent being
turn'd over to the <hi>Common ſide,</hi> among the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
as they certainly are upon the firſt default.
But to proceed: this Ceremony of the <hi>Garniſh</hi>
was no ſooner over, and indeed it did not laſt
long, but I was call'd to another, <hi>i. e.</hi> to come to
pay my Entrance Fees, and for my Enrollmant,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, as near as I remember, was either 8
or 9 <abbr>s.</abbr> more. Upon the whole, I found my charge
of walking in the Hall for a Night was about 20 <abbr>s.</abbr>
which I hope you'll be pleas'd to remember in its
proper place. Well, Sir, I continued ſtill walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Hall till about 3 in the afternoon, and
had ſtruck up an agreement with a man in a ſhire
to Enkennel with him at night; but my Creditor
coming in the interim, and diſcharging me, that
Adventure went off. However, I did what I
could to equip my ſelf as far as my ſtay would
give leave, with the nature and manner of the
place. I went thro' all the Debtors Diviſion, and
found it all over ſo Diſmall and wretched, that
it almoſt put me out of conceit with Mankind,
to think they could be ſo exaltedly cruell and
barbarous to Creatures of their own Species.
But now my Diſcharge being come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One of the
Curs that bark'd and ſnarl'd at me but the
very laſt night, comes up to me ſhaking his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98295:12"/>
Tall, and fawning upon me. <hi>Sir your Diſcharge
is come, and Mr T—would deſire you to walk
into the Lodge;</hi> where Mr Clerk of the papers
meets me, and wiſhes me Joy of my Liberty,
but withall tells me there's a ſmall matter to
be pay'd firſt, only Seventeen ſhillings more
for Fees; and ſo I may goe whither I pleaſe,
This new Demand of Fees I confeſs Diſturb'd
me more then all the reſt; however I found a
down right denyall would not do, and therefore
thought 'twould be beſt to plead Inability; but
'twas all one, this plea was no better then the
other; all the anſwer that I could get was, that
they never truſted any body, and that I muſt
ſend out for money, and in the Interim return
and take a turn or two more in the Hall. Truly
with his leave I did not care for walking any
more in the Hall neither; and ſo after a great
deal of Wrangling and Swearing, I made up
the matter for ten and Six pence. But ſtill,
before I muſt have my <hi>Quietus,</hi> the Groom of
the Chambers muſt be ſatisfied too; and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was half a Crown for Sheets. Says I, <hi>Friend,
I had no Sheets; I have not lain down ſince I came
into your Territories. That's all one to me,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>you might if you wou'd; and I won't loſe my Fees by
you.</hi> I muſt confeſs I could not chuſe but ſmile at
this, tho indeed it vext me too. However, to be
quit of them all, I threw him a ſhilling; and ſo
we parted. Sir, that I may not treſpaſs too far
upon your patience, I'll ſtop here, and trouble
you with the Remainder of this Adventure the
next Return.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving, as I told you in my laſt, ſatisfy'd
and diſcharg'd my Obligations to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Governours, I had ſtill a Curioſity to
inſpect a little further into the Conſtitution and
Rarities of this Famous Citadel; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to carry on my deſign, I took one of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the body to the Tavern, and told him
I had a great inclination to be a little more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Manners and Conditions of their
Houſe, and withal told him, that if he would
do me the favour to ſhew me the Reſt, I would
greatify him for his paines; with this he readily
compli'd, and immediately goes and fetches the
Keys, and leads me firſt into the Common Side;
where I muſt confeſs to you I was encounterd
with ſo many diſmal Objects, and ſo many
amazing Scenes of horrid miſery, that I cannot
begin my Relation of 'em without the deepeſt
Reluctancy and Concern. In one part lay
an heap of Rogues and Theives, in another a
Clump of Whores and Pick-Pockets, and in a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98295:13"/>
Third a Strange Cluſter of Whores and
Rogues Jumbl'd together, and here and there
a poor miſerable Debtor was ſcatter'd amongſt
'em, who for want of money to pay his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Rent, was turn'd over from the other ſide.
Some were almoſt naked, others almoſt ſtarv'd;
ſome were ſwearing, drinking and blaſpheming,
others howling and yelping, and lamenting their
wretched condition, whilſt others were laughing
at 'em, and deriding 'em. In ſhort, there was
ſuch a conſtant ſmoak, ſuch an unwholeſome and
contagious ſmell; ſuch a wild Herd of Rude Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnres,
and ſuch an unaccountable confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
among them, that I was forc'd to ſpeak to
my Guide to haſten me out from 'em as faſt as
he could. The next place he led me to was the
Maſter Felons Apartment: This indeed was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than the former, and but a little; but
hither none are admitted but thoſe that have
money. Here I confeſs they did not look quite ſo
deplorable, but bad enough too, and I think their
Manners and Behaviour, if poſſible, are worſe
than the other. Well, Sir, I had ſoon my belly
full of all theſe kind of Curioſities; and ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
him to let me have a ſhort view of the <hi>Preſs-yard,</hi>
and then I'd have done with him. When I
came there, I muſt own I was ſomething ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to find ſuch a great alteration both in the
place and perſons. The place it ſelf was well
enough, only a little obnoxious by an ungrateful
ſtink, which I ſuppoſe might be deriv'd to it from
the Common Side: The perſons had moſt of 'em
the Looks and Carriage of Gentlemen; and, to
give 'em their due, behav'd themſelves with a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98295:13"/>
great deal of Courtiſie and Civility to me as a
Stranger. My Guide would have ſhewed me the
Lodgings and the Keeper's houſe; but theſe I
thought were hardly worth my trouble, and ſo
I deſir'd him to go and take another Pint and I'd
diſcharge him. While we were drinking our
Pint, I ask'd him ſeveral Queſtions, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
concerning the management of Priſoners
that were under cloſe Conſinement; he told me
<hi>that was good buſineſs indeed, and two or three for
a time were enough to ſet up a Waiter in an Alehouſe,
but</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that's a Myſtery we muſt not diſcloſe,</hi>
and ſo I preſs'd him no further. I ask'd him
likewiſe the nature of their buying off their
Fetters, and what might be the ordinary
Charge of that? He told me, <hi>they always
meaſured that by the Ability and Circumſtance of
the Perſon they were to deal with, and had Irons
of ſeveral ſorts and ſizes for that purpoſe.</hi> I was
puting ſome other Queſtions to him concerning
the Fees of the Officers of their Family, their
Way of Government, and Rules of ordering
condemned Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but here he ſmelt me,
and ſo to avoid all future Diſcourſe with ſome
kind of Concern and Jealouſie that I had drawn
him too far into a Confeſſion and Diſcovery of
their Secrets, he left me.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I have done with my lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Deſcription of that famous Priſon, and
yet but only given you a ſhort inſight of the
Calamities of thoſe unfortuuate Wretches that
are forc'd into it. I don't doubt but there are
many more aggravating Circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it, ſufficient to make it one of the

However, I am very well aſſured that I have

urge him, if he has any Bowels, to contribute
his Aſſiſtance towards the Redreſs of it. But
I know the Relation will fall into good hands;

original Conſtitution of this Court, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do to enquire into it; only, as I am
told, this Court at the beginning was only
appointed to determine Cauſes and Differences
between the King's Servants; and that by little
and little it hath crowded it ſelf into the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it hath now got; and truly I am very
much inclin'd to be of this Opinion, becauſe I
cannot find that there is any regular Method
eſtabliſhed for their Proceedings, eſpecially in
the great Caſe of taking of Bail, which is
generally made to the Jaylor, and is ſo odd a
kind of Practice, that it ſeems to me as if
they were at a loſs for ſome body to do this
Office for them, and ſo were forc'd to make
uſe of the Jaylor. What was the original
Practice and Conſtitution of this Court, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
I am not Maſter of, neither doth it much
matter as to my Purpoſe; but this I know by
woful Experience, that there are more villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Actions commited by the Bailiffs that
belong to it than by half of the Kingdom
beſide.</p>
            <p>'Tis a moſt incredible what a ſtrange number
there is of this ſort of Creatures, ſome ſay
Fifteen hundred, ſome a great many more;
in truth, I believe there may be a thouſand of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98295:15"/>
them that are <hi>Commiſſion Officers,</hi> beſides <hi>Subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns</hi>
and <hi>Cadres,</hi> viz. <hi>Followers</hi> and <hi>Setters.</hi> I
have heard a Gentleman ſay, that hath been
long acquainted with them, that <hi>if 'twere
poſſible to bring 'em to a general Rondezvouze
they could muſter at leaſt Three thouſand choſen
Men, able to draw Swords upon Occaſion.</hi> Now
Sir, who can reflect upon this ſtrange Multitude,
and withal conſider that they are turn'd looſe
to prey upon the meaner ſort of People only;
(for they hare rarely any Buſineſs with any but
ſuch) but muſt ſoon imagine they muſt needs
make a very ſtrange Havock and Deſtruction
among them. Sir, I'll trouble you with a ſhort
Relation that happen'd within the Compaſs of
my own Experience: ſome time before my
Misfortunes broke in upon me, the Perſon in
whoſe houſe I lodge was ſeized by one of theſe
Parties for a ſmall Debt of about Thirty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
that was in diſpute between him and a
Neighbour; the Man was as honeſt a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Man as any in the Street, and his Word
I believe would have went for a hundred Pound
in any part of the Town. Well, but for all
this, theſe Sparks had got him, and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this worthy Court muſt not be broken
upon any account; he muſt either pay the money
together with the charge of the Writ and the
Arreſt, or give Bail, or go to Priſon. Upon which
he ſent for me and another Friend, and ſo we
ſign'd a Bail-Bond of 5 <abbr>l.</abbr> to indemnify Mr. <hi>C—L</hi>
—, who is the Mr. of the Goal. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
for the Bail-Bond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho I fill'd it up my
ſelf (for as I remember never a one of thoſe could
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98295:15"/>
write) was 4 <abbr>s.</abbr> and 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> and 3 <abbr>s.</abbr> and 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> more,
which they had ſuck'd up in the interim, made
8 <abbr>s.</abbr> for this Job: but what was worſe, my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
being unskill'd in theſe ſort of Practices, &amp;
not Feeing an Attorney, according to the Rules
of their Court, the very next <hi>Friday,</hi> which I
think was but about 3 days after this Bail Bond
was aſſign'd, and upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the former Partizan, with a ſtronger
Detachment came and beat up all our Quarters.
Here was my Landlord, his Friend and my ſelf,
all arreſted at the Suit of Mr. <hi>C</hi>—<hi>L</hi>—,
and kept in ſtrict Durance for the weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of 30 odd ſhill. Well, to make up
the matter, we ſent for the Plantiff, who would
have took his Money and given a Diſcharge,
but that, it ſeems, would not do now, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were turn'd, Mr. <hi>Chriſtophea Lowman</hi> was
the Plantiff, and he muſt be comprehended in
the Articles of Peace, or the War muſt go on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there were ſeveral new Fees to be paid, both
to the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Priſon,</hi> before we could come
to a ſeparate Treaty. In ſhort, the <hi>Commander
in Chief</hi> told us we muſt give good Guarrantees
to anſwer the Damages that ſhould be awarded
againſt us, and that it was not in the Directions
of his Commiſſion to come to any other Terms.
Well, there was no Remedy but we muſt ſend
for ſome ſubſtantial Houſekepers to give <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Bail</hi> to the <hi>Keeper's Actions,</hi> or elſe we
muſt every one of us, <hi>in propria Perſona,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to take a Turn over the Water. To
make ſhort of the Matter, we gave freſh Bail,
which together with the Spunging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amounted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98295:16"/>
to about 14 <abbr>s.</abbr> more. Now Sir, I appeal to your
ſelf whether this be not a very hopeful meſs of
Law, when 6 or 7 Perſons muſt be engag'd, nay,
expos'd to ſuch a barbarous Gang of Miſcreants
as theſe for the poor Sum of 30 <abbr>s.</abbr> But to finiſh
my Relation, my Landlord told me, that <hi>beſide
the Debt, he was above</hi> 3 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>out of Pocket before he
made a perfect end of the Bus'neſs.</hi> It ſeems the
Pretence of this Court at the Original was to
recover <hi>ſmall Debts</hi> at eaſie Rates, and to bring
them to a <hi>ſpeedy Iſſue,</hi> this 'tis true was the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretence that this Court at firſtgot a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
by, and this they pretend ſtill; but
how well it anſwers thoſe Ends, I think any
man may judge from the Relation aforeſaid, as
well as from the Sequel of their Practice in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
'tis true, I think, their Writs for 99 <abbr>s.</abbr> coſt
but 2 <abbr>s.</abbr> 4 <abbr>d.</abbr> and thoſe for 39 <abbr>s.</abbr> ſomething leſs;
but what then? they make them Returnable
every Court-Day, which is once a Week, and
commonly too they crowd in 3 or 4 Names into
every one of them, ſo that when every thing is
conſidered, the Charge of a Writ, and a Suit in
that Court, is as expenſive as in any Court in
<hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> in a Caſe of Debt. But, Sir, it
doth not agree with my Deſign to give you a
particular Hiſtory of their whole Practice and
Proceedings, but only ſome curſory Hints to
let you ſee in ſhort what a Cluſter of Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
attend it. As for their Bailiffs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I cannot think of a Name bad enough to call
'em by; <hi>they are the very Sink and Outcaſt of
Bailiffs themſelves, a ſort of Creatures ſo Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
Wild and Deſpicable, that ſome of the better
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98295:16"/>
ſort of the Maſters of this Order are aſhamed to herd
with 'em.</hi> And is not this then a very diſmal thing,
that ſuch a prodigious Multitude of theſe intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Vermine ſhould be ſuffered to prey about
among the poor People as they do, and to run in
common with them, carrying about Lyes, and
ſetting them upon little Quarrels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they
may force their own Trade, and get an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to lay their Venomous Paws upon 'em;
what a ſad Object is it to ſee 4 or 5 of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
luging and tearing a poor Wretch, firſt to
the Spunging-houſe, and then to their Jayl,
for an inconſiderable Debt of 10 or 20 <abbr>s.</abbr> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
leaving the miſerable Wife and Children
to <hi>beg</hi> or <hi>ſtarve,</hi> or <hi>to be kept upon the Pariſh
Charge in the Interim:</hi> This is the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of every Day; and indeed 'tis almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
to be reported, how many honeſt
Tradesmen and Labourers, poor Widows, aud
the like, have been perpetually ruin'd and undone
by their Villany. But, Sir, I believe my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of theſe Matters will be as unpleaſant
and ungrateful for you to read as they are for
me to write, and therefore I'll leave 'em in the
Middle, and ſo carry you to their Priſon and
ſhew you a few of the Miſeries there too, and
then ſhut up till the next Opportunity.</p>
            <p>This Jayl is almoſt of the ſame Nature with
<hi>Newgate,</hi> &amp; conſidering 'tis a common Receptacle
for Felons &amp; Pyrates as well as Debtors, you muſt
believe 'tis ſeldom without good ſtore of Gueſt.
For my part when I ſaw it, I muſt own I was
much amaz'd at the Multitude that was there,
which, as one of the Priſoners told me, was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98295:17"/>
about 160, and near 100 of 'em for ſmall Debts
under 5 <abbr>l.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I was making my Obſervations, I was
accoſted by one of the moſt deplorable Objects
I ever beheld, <hi>a Woman almoſt naked and periſh'd,</hi>
who, as ſhe told me, had been kept in there
17 months, <hi>for only calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr.</hi> B.... <hi>the
Bailiffs Wife Whore</hi> Here they live all together
promiſcuouſly all Day, till at Night the Keepers
drive 'em into their reſpective Holes and
Caverns. As near as I remember, ther's no
Allowance at all for Debtors that are brought in
by the Marſhals Writs, ſo that unleſs they have
Money to ſubſiſt themſelves, they muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſtarv'd to death. Juſt as I was making
my Exit one of their Partymen brought in an
Old Gentlewoman, whereby I had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſeeing the Garniſh Ceremony perform'd.
I think they demanded in the whole 6 <abbr>s.</abbr> i. e.
1 for Footing, the other 5 for Garniſh; but
what was worſe, it ſeems ſhe had been a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
at the Bailiffs Houſe before, who had not
left her a Farthing to help her ſelf; ſo that the
poor Matron begg'd heartily of her Fellow
Priſoners to be excuſed in that Point, but all
would not do, they call a Jury immediately
upon her, and from a very ſhor Conſideration
bring her in <hi>Guilty to the Value of 6 <abbr>s.</abbr>
               </hi> and that
unleſs the Maſter of the Cellar would take her
Word ſhe muſt prepare to ſtrip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, Sir,
I would not tire you with theſe melancholy
Curioſities neither; I have ſaid enough, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to let you ſee what kind of Court and
Government this is; there are, indeed, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98295:17"/>
of other things that might be mention'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> the extravagant Fees and Demands of the
Jaylor and Turn-Keys, and the Tricks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the Waitors to extort Money from the
poor Priſoner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have detain'd you too
long already; and therefore I'll take my leave
for to night.</p>

            <head>LETTER VI. In which is a Relation of the Behaviour
and Practices of the Serjeants and Yeomen
belonging to the Two Compters, together
with the Reſpective Practice of theſe Courts;
and alſo a ſhort Account of the Priſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the City of London.</head>
            <p>SErjeants are generally a ſort of over grown
Bayliffs, and in their Nature and Practice the
very ſame as they are: Indeed they pretend to a
Kind of Superiority, both in their Morals and
Honeſty, beyond the reſt of the Brotherhood;
but truly in the courſe of my Misfortunes I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found them to be Creatures exactly of the
ſame Temper and Species. Their buſineſs is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to attend upon the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs
at their Reſpective Courts at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> at the
<hi>Seſſions Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> and at the time
of Execution of Criminals, and at all other times
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98295:18"/>
and places, according as they are commanded; in
conſideration of which they have a Gown, and
ſome other Fees and Immunities allowed 'em;
but this, tho it was Originally the chief buſineſs
for which they were intended, is become now
but only the Shell and Husk of the Office: the
Sweet and Profit of it conſiſts in the Execution
of Actions and Detachments, and 'tis by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Demands and Advantages they make
from thence that ſeveral of 'em get conſiderable
Eſtates in a few years. I knew one of them inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately,
that in leſs then 12 years purchaſed 200 <abbr>l.</abbr>
               <hi>per ann.</hi> Land of Inheritance; How he got it, I
need not inform you; but it ſeems there was
ſome Grumbling in his Gizzard afterwards;
for, in a deep Diſguſt and Diſſatisfaction, he
quitted the <hi>Worthy Occupation,</hi> and turn'd <hi>Quaker,</hi>
and <hi>in a little time became one of the powerfulleſt
Holders forth in the whole Town.</hi> Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
commonly buy their places of the Mayor or
Sheriffs, and ſo do the Yeomen too, which are a
ſort of Under Vermine that are joyn'd to 'em
to help 'em in their Managements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
generally march out in ſmall Bodies, ſeldom
more than two in a Party, <hi>viz.</hi> a Serjeant and a
Yeoman, unleſs it be upon great Expeditions;
ſuch as are the <hi>Storming of a Shop,</hi> or <hi>the Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barding
of a Warehouſe,</hi> or as it was in former
Days before a Peace was concluded between
them and their Old Enemies the <hi>Alſatians.</hi> Now
I think there's none but the <hi>Knights Templers</hi>
hold out againſt them, and there truly I ſaw
t'other day a ſtrong Party of 'em handled very
ſcurvily. The manner of it was thus; <hi>It ſeems
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98295:18"/>
they had undertaken upon very large Conſiderations
to lay violent Hands upon a certain Gentleman that
had thrown himſelf into the</hi> Temple <hi>to ſecure his
beſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Effects, and accordingly finding him in a place
where they thought they might make their Attacks
upon him with leaſt hazzard, they fell on with a great
deal of Fury and Reſolution, but truly the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
perceiving the Enemy upon the Walls, and
withal knowing how dangerous it was for him to
quit his Faſtneſs, immediately gives the Alarm, the
Sentinels ſoon took it, and in a very few minutes
a ſtrong Party from the Garriſon came to his Relief;
the Fight at firſt was very bloody and obſtinate, and
ſeveral ſwinging Baſtinadoes were exchanged on
both ſides, but then the later being every moment
recruited with freſh Forces, the former were forc'd
to retreat with a runing Fight and leave their Booty
behind 'em, and what was worſe, two of 'em were
taken Priſoners, which according to an ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
in that Garriſon were forthwith taken to the
Pump, and from thence to the Houſe of Office,
and there I'll leave them and go on with my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Theſe Sparks are indeed a limited Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and withal, are prohibited to arreſt
any Freman for any Debt under 40 <abbr>s.</abbr> They
have a <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi> in the City of
<hi>London</hi> for ſuch purpoſes, where <hi>ſmall matters</hi>
are determined with a great deal of Eaſe and
Moderation; but then for the Foreigners they
have no Regard to them, one of them rather
than fail may be bon'd and held to Bail for 9 <abbr>d.</abbr>
and what's worſe, be forc'd to give the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that does him this Kindneſs, 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> for his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98295:19"/>
Reward, or elſe he'll put him in the Compter.
'Tis true, the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs do
often take 'em in Conſidertion, and ſometimes
diſplace them for their Villany and Extortion;
but for all that, I'm confident they generally
want to be new regulated as much as thoſe
that belong either to the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> or to the
Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> They have their Pretences
and Artifices to wrack and ſcrew Money from
their Priſoners, under the Notion of Civility as
well as they; they have their Spunginghouſes
and Spungers too, as they have: they can betray
the Creditor, and trappan and deceive the
Debtor as they can; in brief, they can Swear,
Lye, Hector, Domineer and Cheat as well as
the beſt of 'em all, and are in the main a very
lewd, diſſolute and diſorderly Gang. Sir, I
would not ſeem in the leaſt partial, or to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Men and Things <hi>worſ' than they are:</hi> I muſt
confeſs there are divers of 'em, that, abſtracted
from their Office, as Times go now, may paſs
Muſter well enough; but then conſider them in
their Function, and there's ne'er a Barrel the
better Herring, they're all of 'em of a Peice;
Money's the grand Game they all Hunt, and
have it they will, and they matter not which
Way. As to the Rules of their Courts and
their Methods of Proceedings, I muſt own,
they are in a great many Particulars very Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Expeditions, and withal, I believe,
formerly a Suit might be commenc'd and carried
quite thorow for a very ſmall Charge, but then
they have well improv'd the Buſineſs here of
late, and drawn up the Fees of their Reſpective
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98295:19"/>
Offices to that unaccountable height, that a
ſmall Debt is intirely ſwallowed up before the
Cauſe is half determined. There are ſeveral
things which upon a general Enquiry will require
a Regulation; but for peace ſake I won't men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
'em, only theſe two I cannot paſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
their <hi>Juries,</hi> and their <hi>Foreign Pleas.</hi> As to
their <hi>Juries,</hi> I cannot help being a little out of
humour with ſome of 'em, eſpecially with their
<hi>Cauſecatchers.</hi> I mean <hi>thoſe Worthy Citizens that
have got Eſtates by being</hi> Jurymen, <hi>and attend upon
it as their ordinary Employment:</hi> I'm affraid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there's very often ſome Daubing in thoſe
Caſes, and that too many of them know which
Way the Caſe will go before they hear either
the <hi>Court</hi> or the <hi>Evidence.</hi> I'm told there's a
<hi>a particular Set of 'em,</hi> who to make Matters
eaſie and equal among themſelves have wiſely
agreed, <hi>that each ſhould have his Caſe in his turn.</hi>
This would be worth enquiring into upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
but at preſent 'tis out of my Road. And
then for their <hi>Foreign Pleas,</hi> 'tis a barbarous
thing, that they ſhould wink at, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
Perſons to enter their Actions, fee Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
and perhaps run through the whole charge
of their Courts, notwithſtanding they know
that if the Defendant joins Iſſue, and pleads that
his Debt was contracted out of the Verge of
their Juriſdiction, the Plantiff muſt be <hi>nonſuit,</hi>
and ſo not only looſe all his own Charges, but
likewiſe be obliged to pay his Adverſary's too.
Well Sir, to make as ſhort of theſe Matters as I
can, they are an equal Compoſition of <hi>good and
bad,</hi> and if their Rates were reduc'd to their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98295:20"/>
Ancient Cuſtom, we might e'en let 'em reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Umbrage of an Old Proverb, that <hi>when
the Old is gone ſeldom comes a better.</hi> But then
in the ſecond Place, for their Priſons, there
indeed ther's Work enough both for Pity and
Regulation: Indeed they are not ſo often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with Thieves and Highwaymen as
they are at <hi>Newgate</hi> and other Jayls, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
that, I ſee very little Difference; their
Fees are very extravagant, and their <hi>Turnkeys</hi>
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Officers</hi> ſtrangely inſolent and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful;
and for their <hi>Common Side,</hi> which the
poorer Sort are conſin'd to, 'tis as fulſom and
nauſeous, and their Beds and Lodgings as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
and wretched as any of the reſt, <hi>Newgate</hi>
itſelf not excepted: 'Tis true, if a Man has
Money he may be furniſh'd with a tolerable good
Lodging in either of the <hi>Compters,</hi> and ſo he
may in any other Priſon about Town; but if his
hard Circumſtances turn him in common among
thoſe that are expoſed to live upon the Charity
and Cuſtoms of the Houſe, why then, were it
lawful to wiſh the Miſery and Deſtruction of an
Enemy, we could not conſine him to a place
better adapted for this purpoſe than the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Side</hi> in one of theſe Jayls. Beſide the two
<hi>Compters,</hi> there is another Priſon belonging to
the City of <hi>London,</hi> i. e. <hi>Ludgate;</hi> but thither
none but <hi>Freemen</hi> and <hi>Clergymen</hi> are admitted.
This is the beſt Priſon about <hi>London,</hi> both in
Regard to its Endowment and Government,
and yet here too, as I'm told, they have lately
ſwell'd their Fees to a very ſtrange Bigneſs. In
ſhort, the Jayls all over <hi>England</hi> want to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98295:20"/>
ſurveyed, and to have their <hi>Fees</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi>
fix'd, their <hi>Endowments</hi> reſtor'd, and their
Ancient Cuſtoms and Immunities new ſettled
and reſtabliſht.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving in my former Letters given you a
curſory Account of the baſe <hi>Practices</hi> of
the Bailiffs and Serjeants in general, and hinted
to you ſome of the moſt common and material
Miſcarriages of the <hi>London</hi> Priſons, I ſhall now
lead you a little further, and briefly expoſe to
you another Sort of Viperous Creatures, which,
if poſſible, are of a Nature and Diſpoſition
more venomous and dangerous than the former.
Theſe are a kind of Vermin that paſs upon the
World under the Character of Sollicitors, and
uſually derive their Original from Superannua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bailiffs, or from other Outcaſt Wretches,
that in Knaviſh Suits and contentious Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
have conſumed their Eſtates, and ſo, are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98295:21"/>
forc'd to turn Rogues and Trappanners to get
their laſt Bread; the Places of their Rendezvous
were formerly the <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> but thoſe
Conſtitutions being happily diſſolved, they
have ſince been forc'd to Range at venture about
Town. The chief Places they frequent now
are the <hi>Kings-Bench Walk</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where
they ply conſtantly, but in Term-time eſpecially,
that they may be ready to help an honeſt Client
upon Occaſion; or at the Grates of the <hi>Compters,
Marſhalſea, Newgate,</hi> and other Jayls, where under
Pretence of a great deal of Knowledge in the
Tricks and Turns of the Law, they inveigle
poor Wretches that are ready to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch at every
Deceitful Twig for Liberty, to fix their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Dependance upon 'em. Sir, it would
be the Work of a Volume to deſcend into Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and trace theſe Varlets through the
whole Courſe of their Villanous Practices, I
will only therefore, as in all my former, take
notice of a few of their moſt practical and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Rogueries, from whence you may well
enough judge of all the reſt. Their chief Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is Perjury, and this they do to an Hairs
breadth; for ſo much an Oath, they'll ſwear you
through a whole Cauſe, and, what to an honeſt
Man looks a little ſtrange, do it ſo nicely and
exactly, and withal join the Circumſtances and
Evidence ſo well together that I defy the beſt
Counſel of 'em all to catch or trap 'em in it;
but then the Perſon that uſes them had beſt take
care too, for if he ſtops his Hand and does not
feed 'em on, or gives 'em any Diſguſt, 'tis ten
to one but they turn Tayl, join the contrary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98295:21"/>
Party, and by ſome Knaviſh Stratagem or other
come off from what they ſwore before, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
turn a Witneſs on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>This is very ordinary amongſt 'em, and to
be a good proficient in this uſeful Art of
<hi>Changing of Sides,</hi> they eſteem among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be one of the moſt profitable and
commendable Qualifications belonging to their
Order. Another Inhuman piece of Knavery
they have (as I mentioned before) is to cheat
and deceive poor Priſoners: If they can once
paſs the Gates and get in among 'em, they'r ſafe
enough; and firſt, to initiate themſelves, they
put on the Looks and Behaviour of Hypocrites,
pray and cant nay, rather than fail, ſhed ſome
Crocodiles Tears which they'r always provided
with to colour their Villany. When they have
drawn any of the poor Wretches into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
why, then the firſt thing they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
'em with is, the mighty things they
have done for Priſoners in Diſtreſs, and all, as
they inſinuate, in pure Pity and Commiſeration
to their Condition, without the leaſt Reward
or Expectation of Profit or Advantage. Here
they pretend they have ſuch a Judge that is their
particular Friend and never denies 'em any thing,
ſuch an Attorney is their Relation, and will do
their Buſineſs almoſt for nothing; ſuch a Judge's
Clerk they have obliged by ſeveral Kindneſſes
and Services, and that the Marſhal of the <hi>Kings
Bench</hi> and Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> are ſo much their
Slaves and Vaſſals that they dare not oppoſe
any thing they requeſt of 'em. By ſuch kind of
Lyes and Shams as theſe, back'd by their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98295:22"/>
Cants and Formalities, 'tis great Odds
but ſome of 'em are catcht. Well, when he
finds he has a Bite, he firſt gives him a little more
Line that he may have time enough to pouch
the Bait, and when he perceives he's ſufficiently
hamper'd he prepares by little and little to
draw him to Land. Here he muſt be call'd aſide
forſooth, and enjoined Secrecy under the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of his Kindneſs, and withal, ſolemnly
conjured to make an ample and true Diſcovery
of all his Concerns, by Vertue of which he gets
fully Inſtructed which way to ſteer his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the moſt Advantage; when he has
ſounded him to the very Bottom and finds that
his Eſtate or Effects will anſwer, he propoſes in
conſideration of ſome ſmall Matter, which they
won't fall out about, to procure him Bail. This
he can do well enough, for they have always
belonging to their Gang ſome honeſt charitable
Houſekeepers that for a valuable Conſideration
will bail a man at any time; what if they are
not in Strictneſs of Law worth double the Debt?
'tis all one they'll ſwear they are, and then
there's no refuſing, but their Bail muſt be taken.
And here their Came begins, when they have
Bail'd the Perſon, and got him intirely into
their own Clutches, then Mr. Solicitor opens
the Nature of the Caſe to him. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>you ſee what we have done for you, you are now at
Liberty, and free from the Diſmalneſs and Expence
of a Priſon and let looſe again into the World, and
all this is done for you by perfect Strangers; but
then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I know you are a man of Sence and
Gratitude, and ſo I need not trouble you with the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98295:22"/>
Nature of the Obligation:</hi> Here he calls him aſide
and directs him what kind of Offers he ſhould
make to 'em; if he ſays he hath no Money,
ſays he, you muſt raiſe what you can, and give
'em your Note for the reſt; well, when this is
complied with, then one of his Worthy Bail
begins his part in the Management; Sir, ſays
he, we find you are a very honeſt civil Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and you may depend upon it, that if you
ſhould at any time fall into any ſort of trouble, if
you ſend for us we'll come and deliver you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately:
That we will, ſays the other Cannibal,
but then, conſidering the Gentleman's an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Stranger, I think he ought to give us ſome
kind of Security to indemnify us; this is agreed
to without doubt, and ſo a Bond and Judgment,
without either Limitation or Defeaſance, are
forthwith Sign'd and Sealed, and then they
have done with him for the preſent; but ſtill
the worst part is behind; 'tis ten to one but by
ſome Villanous Stratagem or other they get
themſelves arreſted upon his Account, and then
they have a good Pretence to fall upon him with
their Judgment and ſweep away all he has, and
ſo the poor Man is ruin'd and undone for ever.
But in the ſecond place, when this cruel Varlet
finds the Circumſtances of the Priſoner too
bad, and dangerous for him to be Bail'd, and
that there's nothing to be made of him by that
experiment, then he tryes another, and adviſes
him to bring a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and remove
himſelf to the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and he'll
go and compound with the Marſhall or Warden
(both which he perſwades him he has at his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98295:23"/>
beck) for his Liberty, and withal, rather than
fail, urges him to ſell or pawn his Goods,
Cloaths, or Working Inſtruments to raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to defray the Charge. When he has brought
this <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> for which he exacts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
twice as much as the real Expence of
the thing is, and hath fix'd him in one of theſe
Places, he certainly leaves him there to get his
Liberty how he can, unleſs he finds he can
make a clandeſtine Bargain, and cheat him out
of 2 or 3 Guineas more by ſome new ſort of
Artifice: But then, in the third place, if he
find the Priſoner too poor and too far in Debt
to be Bail'd, and that his Condition is ſo very
miſerable and low that he cannot by any manner
of means raiſe Money to remove himſelf, then
he poſſeſſes him that the Action is wrong
laid, and if he will ſummons the Plaintiff before
a Judge, by Virtue of a particular Intereſt
there, he need not queſtion but he'll have him
diſcharg'd; upon which Motive the poor
Wretch parts with all that he has in the World
that ſhould aſſiſt him in his miſerable Conſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and gives it to him to encourage him to
haſten the Buſineſs, which when he has once
got into his perfidious Paws, 'tis a thouſand to
one if ever he comes near him any more.
Well, when by ſuch kind of Tricks as theſe
they have render'd themſelves ſo hateful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to all the Priſons about Town, that
they dare not come near any of 'em for fear of
their Pumps or Houſes of Office; then they
ſteer to the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and endeavour to crowd
themſelves into the Company of condemned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98295:23"/>
or their Friends and Relations, and
tell 'em that if they can raiſe any Money,
they can make an Intereſt at Court to
get their Friend a Pardon or at leaſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve
<hi>ſine Die;</hi> this has been a very uſeful
part of their Practice formerly; indeed 'tis a
little blown upon at preſent, and truly I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
that many a miſerable Creature hath been
deceived not only out of his Money but his
Soul too by it. Sir, their Tricks and Villanies
are numberleſs, and 'twould amuſe a ſober Man
to think what exalted Lying and Impudence
they impoſe upon the World; how ſtrangely
and myſteriouſly they twiſt themſelves into
the Secrets and Affairs of poor Debtors, and
then how barbarouſly and perfidiouſly they ſell
and betray them to their Creditors. 'Tis
methinks one of the greateſt Riddles that this
Town affords, how ſo many thouſands of 'em
do to ſubſiſt. I'm confident I have ſeen a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at a time ſcouring among their Clients, the
Whores and Thieves at <hi>Hicks's Hall,</hi> at a Seſſions,
and ſome of them in pretty good Habits too.
Well Sir, I will trouble you with them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
In ſhort, you ſee that each of theſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Solicitors is a Compoſition of Solid and
Subſtantial Villany, a Wretch ſo compendiouſly
wicked, dangerous and deſpicable, that in my
Opinion the Suppreſſing of them would be a
Work of equal if not greater Conſequence, than
that of Bailiffs and the Regulation of Jayls.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE <hi>Fleet</hi> and <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> are the two
Chief Priſons in <hi>England,</hi> and provided
with ſeveral eminent Priviledges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
above the reſt. The <hi>Fleet</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
is a well built convenient Houſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
with good Water, a Conduit, a
Chappel where there is conſtantly Prayers
twice a day, handſom Lodgings and Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſo many other Conveniencies that
at firſt Sight it appears to a Stranger rather
like a College than a Jayl. The <hi>Kings Bench</hi>
is much of the ſame Kind, enjoys the Benefit
of large Rules, good Rooms and a Bowling-Green,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if things were honeſtly
and ſincerely managed, an Unfortunate Man
might wade through his Conſinement with a
great deal of Comfort and Satisfaction in either
of them. I ſuppoſe indeed, it was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
deſign in granting theſe Priſons ſo many
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98295:24"/>
Immunities beyond others, to fit 'em for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries
for ſuch Perſons whoſe Misfortunes
had deprived 'em of their Liberty; but then,
here's the Misfortune on't, the Government
of 'em too often falls into ill Hands, and then
all theſe Advantages ſignifie nothing. As to
the Governors themſelves they're commonly
Gentlemen, and Men of Parts, and I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
for one or two of 'em, they're above a
little Kraviſh Trick or Deſign; but then they're
peſter'd with ſo many devouring Officers, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
and Hangers on, that if the Priſoner
be not firſt inſtructed in the Nature and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Vermine, 'tis ten to one but they
devour him. I was once intimately acquainted
with the Chief Perſon that had the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Fleet;</hi> and truly I took the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to tell him my Sentiments concerning the
Irregularity of his Houſe, and what a noiſe it
made, and how it was reſented in the World;
upon which he frankly told me he was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there were ſeveral things tranſacted that
ought not to be, and what was worſe, as Caſes
ſtood then, it was out of his Power to remedy
them; and withal, he told me with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that amongſt all that great Herd he had
conſtantly depending and preying upon him,
there was not two that he knew, upon whoſe
Honeſty and Integrity he might abſolutely rely,
and indeed I found his Words true; for in a
little time after, he narrowly eſcaped being
eat up by his own Dogs: but Sir, this is a little
Foreign to your Queſtion, and ſo, if you pleaſe
to pardon the ſhort Digreſſion, I'll go on with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98295:25"/>
your Deſign. When a Priſoner hath brought
his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and is removed from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Priſon, to the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the
Waiter or Tipſtaff, that receives him from the
Jaylor at the Judges Chamber, carries him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to one of theſe Places, or at leaſt to ſome
Place near, if he has a mind to compound for
his Liberty, without going into the Gates;
when this Ceremony of Compounding is over,
and he hath given Bond and Judgment to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie
the Warden or Marſhal, and Security
if he has any; why then, he's honour'd with a
little bit of Paper, which firſt delivers him out
of the Talons of the Scoundrel that waits upon
him, and withal allows him the Liberty to walk
into the Rules, <hi>alias</hi> whither he pleaſes; but yet
for all his haſte, there's ſomething elſe for him
to do before he muſt march; next comes the
Gentleman of the Papers, and he muſt have 25 <abbr>s.</abbr>
for the Fees of the Servants of the Houſe, &amp; 44 <abbr>s.</abbr>
more for his Commitment Fee, and then he may
move, and yet 'tis very hard if Mr. Waiter parts
with him without half a Piece for his Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
no, no, that muſt be done too, or elſe that
Gentleman's highly diſpleaſed, and <hi>God Dam
him, he'll be even with him;</hi> and ſo he certainly
will, for they are the curſedſt Vermin in the
whole Gang; but I intend to have a Touch with
'em all by and by, and ſo I'll let him alone till
I come at him among the reſt.</p>
            <p>But now the Priſoner hath paſt all theſe Pikes
he may go home, and how long muſt he ſtay
there? why, till he's arreſted again, or till
the Officers in Chief, or ſome of the Subalterns
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98295:25"/>
want to ſpeak with him, and then a Runner is
diſpatcht to him, to bring him along with him,
with Inſtructions to tell him there's a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
come, or that there has been a Plaintiff threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to ſue the Office, and they muſt underſtand
him a little better, and have better Security, or
elſe he muſt go into the Houſe. To make ſhort
of the Story, 'tis Ten to One but this is all a
Device and Contrivance between a Waiter and
ſome little pretending Officer, to get half a
Piece, or a Guinea, to equip him at Night with
a little Wine and a Supper. But then if they
find he will be terrified by ſuch kind of Projects,
for the future, they'll ſuck him with a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and take their Rounds till every One hath
had his ſnack of him. In ſhort, Sir, as Caſes
ſtand now, I cannot ſee what kind of Liberty
this can be they pretend to allow a Priſoner. If
his Debt be upon <hi>Main Proceſs,</hi> why then he
may be Arreſted again, and ſo muſt be forc'd to
bring a New <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> or go to another
Jayl. If he be under <hi>Execution,</hi> why then if the
Creditor meets him out of the Rules, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
falls upon the Office for an Eſcape, and
the Office conſequently upon the Security; and
then 'tis ſome odds but there's 2 or 3 undone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bargain. But as Caſes ſtand with me,
I muſt not dive too deep into their Secret Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory:
I know enough to ſerve my own turn:
and I ſuppoſe I have ſaid enough too to let any
Rational Perſon ſee the Expence and Danger
he's expos'd to from this kind of Freedom. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I cannot tell how far it may ſuit with ſome
Perſons Circumſtances and Conveniency more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98295:26"/>
than others: however, in the main, I am very
confident there muſt be more Coſt than Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and that the Advantage in general, can
never anſwer the Charge.</p>
            <p>And now I wou'd have done with 'em, but
that I have forgot to pay my Reſpects to a few
honeſt Gentlemen, that perhaps wou'd take it in
dudgeon, if I ſhould miſs 'em, I mean their
Worthy Waiters. Theſe are, 'tis true, but the
Fag-end of the Corporation; but for all that,
they'r Perſons of Conſiderable Power now and
then. I would not ſpend much time upon 'em
neither, and therefore I'll have done with 'em
as ſoon as I can. The buſineſs of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is to wait upon Priſoners when they go
out upon their Day-Rules, and to fetch in thoſe
that are Eſcap'd, if they can catch 'em, and to
run of Errands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are indeed the uſes
they are deſign'd for; but truly the Gentlemen
being ſenſible of their own high Qualifications
and Merit, have wiſely found out ſome other
Employments: ſome ſet up for Wardens and
Marſhals, ſome for Tipſtaves, ſome for one sort
of buſineſs, and ſome for another: ſo that in
ſhort, they have almoſt drawn in all the Second
hand matters of both the Priſons into their own
hands. One of the worthy Knights of this
Order, not long ſince, did me the honour of
his Company, once a Fortnight, for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time together, and, as he ſaid, came every
time with directions from the Warden to bring
me into the Houſe; but for half a Crown and a
Quartern of Brandy, we ſtill made up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and parted good Friends. Well, Sir, to ſum
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98295:26"/>
up this Relation, <hi>The Fleet</hi> and <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> with
all theſe Inconveniencies, are ſtill the beſt Priſons
in the Kingdom: And truly, if a man finds his
Circumſtances are like to continue him a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for any conſiderable time, I think he cannot
lay out 40 or 50 <abbr>s.</abbr> better than to remove himſelf
to one of 'em; here he'll be ſecure to find good
Company, good Lodging, and the Opportunity
of a Chappel, and indeed every thing conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
with a little prudent Management, to
ſweeten the bitter Draught, and make the Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous
Conſinement go down a little the more
eaſily.</p>

Irregularities and Evil Practices of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Jayls, are in all Caſes equal, and in
ſome worſe than thoſe at London.</head>
            <p>WELL, Sir, to draw as faſt as I can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Concluſion of this Unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Task: I ſhall in this only trouble you
with a few ſhort Reflections upon what I have
ſaid in my former, together with a haſty View
of the Miſeries and Oppreſſions of poor Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in their Conſinements in Countrey Jayls.
As to what I have ſaid in general, you may
depend upon it for Truth; moſt of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Occurrences are Matters that I have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Experienc'd my ſelf, or been an Eye-Witneſs
of in others. I well knew your Deſign,
in giving your ſelf and me this Ungrateful
Trouble, would not admit of Trifles, and
therefore I only ſingled out ſome of the moſt
material Paſſages, and leapt over all the reſt
that I thought were any ways Trivial or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
In my Expreſſions, I confeſs, I have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98295:27"/>
now and then us'd a little Freedom and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
but then it was no where but when I
had a Wretch, or ſome baſe Action to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
that I wanted a Name or Title to call
'em by. And for my Method, 'twas the beſt I could
think of upon ſuch ſhort warning. Beſides, I
conſider'd I was to write Letters, and not
Books, and ſo confin'd to comprehend what I
had to ſay in as narrow a compaſs as I could.
Sir, I will not trouble you with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Apologies. I have given you, in as few
Lines and Words as I thought the Nature of
my Relation would bear, a Diſmal Account of
the Sufferings of poor Priſoners; firſt from the
Tyrannick and Inſolent Uſage they are expos'd
to from Bayliffs in general; and then laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſome of the Grievances and Hardſhips,
and but ſome of them neither, which they are
forc'd to under go in their Reſpective Jayls and
Confinements belonging to this Town. And
now, Sir, I will only make a ſhort turn into the
Country, and take a tranſitory View of the
State of the Priſons and Priſoners there, and
then trouble you no further upon the Subject.
The Villanies of Bayliffs and Jaylors is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemick
Diſtemper, and hath unhappily ſpread
it ſelf over the whole Nation; and truly I think,
when every thing is conſidered, rages with as
much Violence in the Country as it does here
in Town. In the Country the Bayliffs have
Commenc'd the Villainous Methods of Spung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Civility-money; Nay, they have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
the Practice of betraying the Creditor,
and bringing the Debtor under Contribution:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98295:28"/>
There they Ride Lords and Maſters, Inſult and
Hector even the Gentry and Clergy, and the
Common People, eſpecially. Thoſe that are in
Debt are their very Slaves and Vaſſals, and
ſtand in more awe of 'em than they do of their
Juſtices of the Peace. There they live at large,
have no body to curb or inſpect their Inſolence;
but are in a manner let looſe, like Mad Dogs, or
rather like Wolves and Vultures, to ſnap at and
prey upon every thing they come nigh. There the
poor Priſoners are forc'd to bear the ſevere U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
and Hardſhips of their Keepers and Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and have no body to pity or hear their
Complaints, or at leaſt no body to redreſs their
Grievances, or to comfort or ſupport them in
their Agonies: There's no Judge there, nor
no Tipſtaff in the Country to take theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
Wretches into Cuſtody; but they are leſt
intirely to the Guidance of their own Pride, ill
Nature and Avarice, to Inſult and Domineer,
Fetter, Confine, Cheat and Impoſe upon their
wretched Captives how they pleaſe: And truly
their Behaviour in general is inhuman and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
enough; and what's the greateſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of all too, their diſtance from <hi>London,</hi>
hath render'd their Removal by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>
almoſt impracticable. Sir, I have been a little
Curious in theſe Affairs, and, as Occaſion offer'd,
have now and then made it my Buſineſs to pry
into theſe unpleaſant Myſteries, and indeed thro
the whole Courſe of my Obſervations I never
found any thing that could diſtinguiſh the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Bailiffs and Jaylors and the ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Priſons in the Country from theſe in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98295:28"/>
Town, unleſs it be that the former are attended
with greater Hardſhips and Severities.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I have done with the Subject,
and ſhall only put you in mind of One Thing
more, and take my leave. The Crys and
Groans of theſe Miſerable Wretches have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
taken Wing, and diſpers'd themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Face of the whole Kingdom: Whether
they'll ſtop here or no, I cannot tell; but this
I know, That if there is not ſome ſudden means
uſed to redreſs their Grievances, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
they will aſſail Heaven too, and call
as loud for Vengeance from thence, as they
do for Pity and Aſſiſtance here.</p>

to give you my poor Thoughts how both the

theſe kind of Vermine; and then in anſwer to

            <p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> therefore, for the Creditor, when
things are come to that unhappy paſs that he's
forc'd to uſe Extremity, I paſſionately adviſe
him never to deliver the Writ out of his hands
or ſuffer the Bailiff out of his Sight till he
has done his Buſineſs; for if he does, 'tis ten
to one but he's betrayed, and at once looſeth
both his Debt and Charge. The Writ is the
general Baſis upon which they build their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Rogueries; when they once get that, they
are thorowly equip'd either to betray the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
or compound with the Debtor, and they
may both depend upon it that for a ſhilling
advantage they'll be falſe to either Party. And
then for the Debtor, let him take this with him
too, that altho by a large Bribe and Promiſe
or ſomething like it, he dearly purchaſes their
Forbearance for once or twice, whenever he
ſlacks his hand the Peace is broke and all the
former Kindneſſes are forgot, and the Word
is then, according to the common Cry, <hi>Bail,
Jayl or Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, when they have got
him into their Clutches, I caution him as a Friend
not to be decoy'd by 'em into a Spunging-houſe,
but if he finds he can't comprehend the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in a very ſhort time, to repair directly to
Priſon, for tho that be a very melancholy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
'tis the leſſer Evil of the two and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the better to be choſen. They may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that this will expoſe him to diſgrace and
to the reſt of his Creditors, and put him to
Charge and what not, but this is all but a Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
Blind and a Trick. They make it their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98295:30"/>
Buſineſs to do that for him as ſoon as they have
got him. Beſides he's no longer welcom with
them than his Money laſts, and when they have
wrack'd him out of what he has, he muſt march
to Jayl after all. The only Objection that I
know of, is the extravagant Fees of the Jaylor,
and can there be no remedy found out to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it? That's ſtrange indeed! I know the grand
Pretence is, That their Priſoners are very
numerous, and that they are forc'd to keep a
great many Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then, muſt this
be all thrown upon the Wretched and Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Why, where's the Juſtice and Humanity
of that? For my own part I tremble to think
of theſe things, and certainly they muſt be the
Subject of a great deal of Wonder and Sorrow
to any body that will give himſelf the Trouble
to Reflect upon 'em. Well Sir, to give you my
haſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoughts of the whole Matter; This
infections Diſtemper ſpreads it ſelf ſo faſt that
unleſs Care be taken, and proper Medicines
apply'd to ſuppreſs it, it will at length ſwell
into a general Contagion. But then how this
may be done, is the great <hi>Query.</hi> Why, very
eaſily certainly; Let but the Fees of the Bayliffs
be ſetled, let them be prohibited under ſevere
Penalties, to detain any perſon in their Cuſtody
above ſuch a time; Let their Swords be taken
from their ſides, and their Battoons out of their
hands, and their White Wands reſtor'd in their
places: Let their Number be reſtrain'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and honeſt men put into the Office; and
that part of the great Work's done, And then
for Priſons, let there be but a general Survey
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98295:30"/>
made, their Ancient Liberties and Immunities
reſtor'd, and Commiſſioners appointed to inſpect
into their Indowments, and inquire into their
Irregularities in general, let their Fees be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht,
and a Copy of 'em fixt continually upon
each of their Gates, I'm confident a great many
of the Miſeries of theſe unfortunate Wretches,
would vaniſh in an inſtant; and good Old Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
<hi>England</hi> lie no longer under the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reflection of being the moſt ſevere and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyleſs
to her Priſoners, of any other Nation in
the Chriſtian World. But, Sir, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the buſineſs, and I don't doubt but your Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and Charity will urge you on till you have
happily brought it to an end, which will at once
entitle you to the bleſſings of both Worlds, to
the Prayers of the Priſoners and Captives, to the
Thanks and Praiſes of the Debtors and Creditors,
and to the good Wiſhes and Commendations of
all, but eſpecially of,</p>
