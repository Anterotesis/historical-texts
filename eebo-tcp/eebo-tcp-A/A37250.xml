            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER my Duty remembred unto you, and my Mother, with my bleſſing to my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and my love unto all my friends: This is to certifie you, that I, my wife, and my brother are very well, and deſire to heare from you by theſe Bearers. As concerning our voyage, was this Sunday; being the twentieth day of February, wee looſed from Mynhard with all our men:
<pb facs="tcp:64403:3"/>
On the Tueſday following wee landed in Yohell, there we remained untill the firſt of March, then wee had a Command from the Lord Preſident of Munſter to march away towards Dungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, a Port Towne ſcituated by the Sea ſide, the which the Rebells had taken about a moneth before we came there. On Wedneſday night wee came neare it, but by reaſon of the ill weather that night we were inforc't to returne backe to a Towne called White Church.</p>
            <p>The next morning wee advanc'd towards the Towne with our Regiment of foot, and foure Troops of Horſe, and came before it about ten of the Clock in the morning. Then wee ſent a Trumpeter and ſummoned the Towne; and their Anſwer was, that they would come out and fight with us. Then wee drew our men into Battalia, and ſo wayted about an houre, but no enemie came: Then did wee ſummon them the ſecond time; and their Anſwer was, that they would not yield, but ſtand upon their guard within the town. The Trumpeter returning with this Anſwer, we immediately ſent two Troops of Horſe, and two companies of foot to aſſault the Towne, the which they did very bravely, and after ſome two houres fight, they were relieved with as many more: the which did aſſaile the towne ſo hotly that they did kill a number of the Rebells, and ſet fire on one of the gates: and whilſt the Rebells were a putting out of the fire, our men gained one of the
<pb facs="tcp:64403:3"/>
other Gates, and entred the Towne. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells perceiving this, forſook the Walls, and retreated all into ſtrong ſtoned houſes, and there maintained ſight a great while, but in the end, they were conſtrained for to yield, with their lives onely ſaved, and ſo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be ſent out of the Towne, the which was granted, and they went away that night. Then we placed ſtrong Guards in all the Towne for that night.</p>
            <p>On the morrow we ſummoned the Caſtle for to yeeld; but they Anſwered us againe by their ſhot: ſo wee aſſaulted the Caſtle the ſame day twice, but were forced to retreat with the loſſe of onely one man.</p>
            <p>The night drawing on, all that night was ſpent with exchange of Shot on both ſides, but little hurt done on either ſide. The next day they ſent to us by one of their Captaines, his name was <hi>Butler,</hi> that wee would give them leave to march out with their Armes, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, they would deliver up the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>So there was a Counſell held about it, and it was agreed on by my Lord and the reſt, that by reaſon we wanted Beere and other proviſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they ſhould. So the next day, being ſaturday, and the fifth day of March, they marched away their Armes, and Colours flying. And ſome two houres after, we left the Towne, and
<pb facs="tcp:64403:4"/>
marched after them, they on the one ſide of the water, and we on the other.</p>
            <p>Wee left in the Caſtle a Garriſon of threeſcore Souldiers. Then wee marched back againe to a towne called Capperquin, where wee lay that night in the towne.</p>
            <p>I have left my Brother with Captaine <hi>Thornton,</hi> and have preferred him to be his Barber, and to wait on him in his Chamber. His Captaine is left for to command that towne and Caſtle as their Garriſon, with their Company, which conſiſteth of an hundred men.</p>
            <p>The next day we marched towards Cork, and that night wee lay at a Caſtle of my Lord <hi>Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores.</hi> The next day we marched towards Cork, and we heard by the way, that the enemy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt us with eight thouſand men: For all that wee marched on, and came to Cork that night, where I remaine as yet, untill wee doe goe unto our Garriſon of Kinſale, when I know not, by reaſon that my Lord of <hi>Muſgrave</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and Kinſale, and we are not of ſufficient ſtrength to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>The Rebells doe increaſe dayly, but if ſtrength comes over in any time, wee make no queſtion, by the aſſiſtance of the Lord of Hoſts, who is the giver of all victory, but to reduce this Province to her former ſtate, for the Rogues are very coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and dare not doe any thing but on great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that is, five to one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64403:4"/>More Newes have I none as yet, but that wee are all well, and deſire to heare from you by this Bearer. You may direct your Letter to Kinſaile to me, to Sir <hi>Charles Vavaſour</hi> my Colonell. Pray ſend me word how my Children doe, and how you all do.
