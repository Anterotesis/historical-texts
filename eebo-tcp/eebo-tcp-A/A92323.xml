         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath been and is the grand deſigne of Sathan, the old deceiver, to raiſe up ſtrong and complicated oppoſitions againſt the work of Reformation; And we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that he faſhions his ſnares and deceipts ſo curiouſly, and twiſts and inſinuates himſelf ſo ſubtilly, that he makes uſe of the very Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that work, at once to hinder and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine it. It is a damp to our ſpirits to conſider that the ſun of glory, which had advanced it ſell ſo far in this our Meridian, ſhould go back ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Nations: and that from ſuch ſplendid hopes, as once there were, by reaſon of groſs and thick interpoſitions, it ſhould tend almoſt to an univerſall Eclipſe. We know not, where the remora and Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, nor is it our purpoſe to fix the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any: But we lay our hands upon our hearts, and accuſe our own vanity and folly, and uneven walkings, that have been the cauſe of depriving us of ſo rich a mercy. We cannot but with grief take notice of the unhappy diſunions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that have been, and are yet amongſt thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168540:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->who ſhould cloſe together in moſt intimate oneneſſe: For the diviſions of the people of God there are at this day great thoughts of heart; and we muſt not ſo much as hope for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Halcion days, untill they return and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each other in love and harmony. It is too too evident, that the malignant party are buſie, and combining together to enſlave us; and they have now freſh blooming hopes, that this is their time to appear for the bringing back of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Line, and for the raiſing of themſelves up again in our downfall. Nor could they have ſuch ſtrong confidences, were they not confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with that ſoure, ridgid, diſcontented party, whom nothing will pleaſe, unleſſe they can glut themſelves by ſetting their foot on our necks: Who though they once conteſted againſt that old Royall Intereſt, yet now they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fancy a laſting ſettlement, but by recalling him in again upon their own terms. This flame alſo is blown up by thoſe, who whet their biting and imbittered tongues for miſchief againſt us, who prepare ſcourges for our backs. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we walk in a track different from them, and ſeperate from them and the world, in things of ſpirituall concernment; they are enraged, and deviſe deviſes againſt us, and ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to erect their own Dominion in our cruſhing and extirpation. The great Engine, which all parties make uſe of, to gratifie at once this their Ambition and enmity, is, the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, conteſts, and diviſions, that are unhappily <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->Corn in the Feild, not bound up in ſheaves; whileſt we are dwelling in diſtinct Iſlands, not entertaining commerce with each other: And whileſt we ſpeak, or rather babble out different voices &amp; languages, to our own confuſion, &amp; the diſhonour of our Maſter. Is it not then high time to awaken, and to raiſe our ſelves from the bed of ſloth and ſecurity? Should we not unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love and ſweetneſs? Should we not humble our ſelves before our God? Should we not pray? believe, confer, and take counſell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as in the dayes of old, when the bleſſed preſence of the Lord was like freſh ſprings of water in our ſouls? Should we not conſider from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our firſt works, and remember the loves of our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity? Theſe we think, are things proper and ſuiteable unto the preſent times we live in. Surely, we are begirt with dangers from all ſides: ſurely, the judgments of the Lord are already gon out againſt us; and they ſound a loud and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alarum in our ears: If we yet be ſtupid, and not take warning, and return unto the Lord, we may juſtly expect the full viols of his wrath to be emptied out upon us. In ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary day, as this is, we conceive, that there is a more than ordinary duty incumbent on us. The moſt fine gold is become dimme, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the mixture of much droſs: The moſt glorious cauſe, which at the beginning brake forth freſh and vigorous, and appeared like a Bride decked with ornaments, is now become ſullied, being faded in its beauty; and is ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->and miſhapen with a ſtrange dreſſe, we had almoſt ſaid, with the attire of an Harlot, that we have at once both loſt our ſelves and our full-grown hopes, whileſt in vain we endeavour to finde it. We have been all made drunk, as it were with ſweet wine, through the confluence of earthly enjoyments, and delights: And we have not onely deſerted the work put into our hands, but we have ſo blemiſhed it, that we have given our Adverſaries advantages thereby, as well to blaſpheme, as to rejoyce. It is as hard now to know what we have to doe in this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full juncture, as it is eaſie to ſee; that we are out of the way, and have loſt the foot-ſteps of that glorious preſence, which heretofore conducted us. We will open our very hearts unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can ſay, through grace, that we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep a good conſcience, void of offence both towards God, and towards man. We muſt needs ſay, that we would not have the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Kingdome of our Lord Jeſus ſlighted and neglected: We would not have ſuperſtitions and falſe worſhips creep up again, and appear in publique, uncontrouled; We would not have the Conſciences of our fellow-brethren burden'd, and under the yokes of rigid impoſitions: We would not have Tyranny, Oppreſſion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, ſo much as ſeen amongſt us in any of their ſhapes and appearances; We would not have the prophane ſpirit of the world gratified in their exceſſes, and in their paſtimes not ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a well-guided Common-wealth; we would not have the juſt Liberties of the Nation trampled on by any, nor under the footſtool of an Arbitrary diſpoſall: If in theſe things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->we are ſorry, and if we are convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we ſhall amend. Sure we are, it was once the main deſigne, to extirpate every thing that ſtood in the way of a through Reformation. It was once the great principle, that ſwayed our actings, to advance the beſt things, and to entruſt the management of them in the hands of the beſt, and moſt upright perſons. But how far we have warped, and deflected from theſe things. Let all ſober unprejudiced ſpirits, that doe not willingly ſhut their eyes, be the judges. Be not diſpleaſed then, that we call upon you to ſtand in the good old way, and to return into that path, where the Lord met you and owned you, and diſplayed his marvellous loving kindneſſes, and his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant excellencies before your eys. Remember that the Vows of God are upon you; if through your remiſneſſe and inadvertency ruine over take us, we ſhall have an hiding place in the chambers of divine love, in the midſt of thoſe deſolations: But what comfort you can have, that you have not diſcharged the duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on you, in this day of danger, whileſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was in your hands to do it; we now lay it upon your Conſciences to conſider, before it is yet too late. The Lord poure out upon us richly the ſpirit of love and of unanimity; the ſpirit of courage and of activity, the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and zeal; that the ſun of glory may again viſite us, and aſcend unto its perfect height and ſplendour: That we may doe worthily for God, and for his people in our generations: And that the undoubted Rights and Liberties of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be fixt upon the laſting durable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Truth and Righteouſneſſe.</p>
