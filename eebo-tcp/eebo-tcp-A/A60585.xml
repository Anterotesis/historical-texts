            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Ephes. 4. Ver. 5.</bibl>
               <q>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is sad to consider, how that <hi>Christianity</hi> has suffered more by the Factions and Feuds of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> themselves, than by the Fury of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Adversaries; that Schism has done more Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Church of God than all the Persecutions of the <hi>Heathen Roman</hi> Emperours, who made it their business to abolish and destroy the very name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> out of the World; and that <hi>Christians</hi> should treat one another with that despight and Malice, as if good Nature and Charity, and a mutual forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were things of meer indifference: As it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened between Churches of different Communions in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> and in these <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the World since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> either because they would not own an Usurpt and pretended Universal Authority, or else because of some little disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Opinion, or the Usage, or Non-usage of a Ceremony, which every particular Church, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon, and in conjunction with the Civil Power, has a right to Ordain and Constitute, and which all its Members are Obliged to conform to, out of a Principle of Conscience. For hitherto must be referred, as to their chief and proper Causes, all those horrid Tumults and Separations of Parties, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98211:4"/>
have so much distracted the Peace of the Church from its first Beginnings and Infancy to this day, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever blancht over by some with subtilty and Artifice of Wit, and by others with pretensions of Zeal, to colour their Ambition and their Pride, and to render their ill Designs the more plausible and successful. Here it is (for I cannot be so unjust and partial, as to charge the <hi>Romanists</hi> only with the fault, though they are deepest in the Guilt, and more blameable than the rest) that all take Sanctuary, and think to justifie their ill will one to another this way; that they, from whom they divide and separate themselves, entertain different Notions of some points of Religion, though perchance they be not Essential to the Faith; or else use other Rites in their Religious Worship, which yet may be as decent, and as useful, and as significant, as if this were to renounce <hi>Christianity,</hi> and to forsake the Communion of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>How has this fond Opinion broken <hi>Christendom</hi> into pieces, and shut Unity and Peace out of it! Private Passion, and a false Zeal corrupting our Judgments and Practises so far, that instead of joyning in the same Publick Worship and Service of <hi>Christ</hi> our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Saviour,</hi> and Living together in Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Love, we can scarce think well one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we are afraid of one anothers Company, in a Church at least, as if it were Infectious; we use most unjust and most unchristian Censures; we malign and hate one another to the Death, and, as much as in us lyes, we send one another to Hell by our evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable surmises, and by peremptory Sentences of Excommunication.</p>
            <p>To prevent which dismal and bloody effects of Schism, the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98211:4"/>
lays down and prescribes a Method, which would prove most effectual, if we understood our Duty and our Interest so much, and had but the Honesty and the Conscience to put it in practise and execution; which is, <hi>to walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith we are called,</hi> v. 1. That is, to adorn the Doctrine of <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> with a suitable Conversation, and as it becomes true followers of <hi>Christ,</hi> to live up to those Excellent Rules and Institutions which he has Publish'd, and not only to make an outward Shew and Profession of <hi>Christianity,</hi> but to justifie and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Truth and Power of it by the Example and Practise of the severest Virtues; and especially in this great Instance of it, <hi>With all Lowliness and Meekness, and Long-suffering, to forbear one another in Love,</hi> v. 2. That is, to make some <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </gap>—as in that Excellent Speech of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Bishops, upon the breaking up of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> just before their departure to their respective Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses: In <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in his Life, <hi>Lib. 3.

That is, to maintain this Spiritual Communion with all Peaceableness and Moderation; as being all Members of <hi>one Body,</hi> the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> actuated by <hi>one Spirit, and called together in one Hope of our Calling,</hi> v. 4. That is, by virtue of the same common <hi>Christianity,</hi> all alike pretending to the hopes of the same common Salvation; all Disciples of the same <hi>Lord,</hi> and initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the same <hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>Baptism.</hi> So long as there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98211:5"/>
is no breach made upon the Articles of Faith, and the form of sound Doctrine is retained in its full sense and meaning, there can be no just cause for Censure and dis-union: All other differences of Opinion in Matters of Doctrine should be tolerated and forgiven, if they have no evil influence upon Religion, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Government; if there be no Schism or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in practise or behaviour, and so long as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith is preserved entire, and kept inviolate, there being as but <hi>one Lord,</hi> so but <hi>one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which words I shall endeavour to make good these three following Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> is to be derived only from the Revelations of <hi>Christ. One Lord, one Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Unity of Faith only respects the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all, who are <hi>Baptized,</hi> and consequently are by this Sacrament of initiation admitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Communion and Society of <hi>Christians,</hi> are to make Profession of this Faith. <hi>One Faith, one Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is to be derived on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Revelations of <hi>Christ. One Lord, One Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is not in the Power of Humane Wit, how prying and industrious soever, to raise it self up to the Contemplation and Knowledge of Supernatural Truths without the assistances of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grace, is no disparagement to our Reason to acknowledge; it being the effect of an irrational Pride, and a foolish and idle Presumption to think otherwise: And particularly, that the Mysteries of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98211:5"/>
               <hi>Christian</hi> Religion lye out of our reach and ken, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this unhappy Proof, that upon their first publication at that time, when all the Treasuries and hidden recesses of Nature were thrown open, and laid common, when nothing seemed to escape the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of bold and industrious Enquirers; and when the Studies of Philosophy seemed to exalt Reason to the highest pitch and degree of Perfection that it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, they stood amazed at the strangeness of this <hi>New Doctrine,</hi> not agreeing with their Principles, and no way to be accommodated to any of those numerous <hi>Hypotheses</hi> which they had taken up; and from this amazement they soon advanced to a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and violent Opposition of it, andused the utmost Forces of their Wit and of their Eloquence, and of their Learning, to deride, and decry, and suppress the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther growth and spreading of it. And the <hi>Jews</hi> too, though they daily turned over the leaves of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> which pointed out in part those Glorious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Secrets of <hi>God,</hi> which were to be made in the times of the <hi>Messias,</hi> were so besotted and wrought upon by the suggestions of a gross Fancy, and an ill-grounded Prejudice, that neither the exact and punctual fulfilling of those Prophesies, even in their minutest Circumstances, nor continued Miracles wrought before their Eyes, the highest and most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional grounds of Credibility, could prevail upon them to admit a Doctrine, which was so much above their mean apprehension of things, and seemed to thwart and cross and contradict those Foolish <hi>Idea's</hi> and Childish Fancies, wherewith they had so long pleased themselves.</p>
            <p>The World was now to be Instructed with a better and more Heavenly Doctrine, and all just motives of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98211:6"/>
perswasion were used and proposed to satisfie their Reason, and to work them up to a full belief of it, enough to lay the whole blame of their Infidelity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves. The Will of <hi>God</hi> was Revealed by <hi>Christ</hi> in plain and easie Propositions, without the least Ambiguity: And the Authority wherewith they were proposed, rendred them Infallible; for how could they well doubt of, or deny the truth of a Doctrine, which they saw attested and confirmed by Omnipotence?</p>
            <p>The ground then of our Faith is the Revelation of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Christ. My Doctrine is not mine,</hi> says our Blessed <hi>Saviour, but his that sent me, St.</hi> John 7. 16. And <hi>He that sent me is true, and I speak to the World those things which I have heard of him, St.</hi> John 8. 26. <hi>And as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things,</hi> v. 28. <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you,</hi> Chap. 15. v. 15. <hi>And I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them,</hi> Chap. 17. v. 8. He is the <hi>Author and Finisher of our Faith:</hi> He it is, who Commissioned his <hi>Apostles</hi> to Publish the Doctrine which he first taught, from him, and in his Name, to go about the World, and make Proselytes to his Religion, and Proclaim the Saving Virtues and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Cross, and the Glories of his Resurrection. And what one of the number says concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Celebration of the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our <hi>Lord, 1 Cor. 11. 23. I have received of the Lord that which I have delivered to you,</hi> is to be said of the whole complexion and comprehension of the Articles of Faith. This was their Profession, wheresoever they went; there was no mixture of their own Fancy and Invention in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98211:6"/>
the case; <note n="a" place="margin">St. John 14. 26. &amp; Ch. 16. 13. 1 St. John 1. 1.</note> they were Infallibly secured from the least Error in their Doctrine by the Guidance of Gods Spirit; <hi>That which was from the beginning, which they had heard, which they had seen with their Eyes, and which they had looked upon, and their hands had handled concerning the World of Life,</hi> they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and nothing else: <note n="b" place="margin">Nobis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ex nostro arbitrio indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere licet, sed nec eligere, quod aliquis de arbitrio suo induxerit.

1. That no Doctrine can or ought to be proposed, as an Article of Faith, but what <hi>Christ</hi> has Revealed, and what the <hi>Apostles</hi> from him have declared in their Preaching, and in their Writings.</p>
            <p>All Articles of Faith relying upon the Revelation of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> as we cannot deny <hi>such a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which</hi> God <hi>has given of his Son, without making him a Lyar,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> speaks, first <hi>Epist. 5th. Chap. 10th. ver.</hi> So nothing more can be required of us, than to believe that, and that only, as necessary and with a Divine Faith, which he has been pleased to Reveal: <note n="a" place="margin">Hanc tibi fossam determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit ipse, (Christus) qui te non vult aliud credere, quam quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituit, ideó<expan>

            <p>Now, because <hi>Christ</hi> did not leave behind him a System or Body of Articles in Writing, (most of which refer to himself, that is, as well to that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or transcendent Excellencies of the Divine Nature; as that <hi>He is the only Begotten Son of God, Begotten of the Father before all Worlds,</hi> and God <hi>of the same Substance with the Father,</hi> and the like, which were to be the Fundamentals of his Religion) but left the business of propagating a Church, which he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98211:7"/>
had Founded by his Blood, to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> to them we are to have recourse, <note n="o" place="margin">V. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullianum <hi>de Praescript. haeret.</hi> Cap. 21.</note> as to the Infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of his Mind and Will.</p>
            <p>Here then is to be the Tryal of a Doctrine propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to us, as a Matter of Faith. Is it any where to be found in the Discourses of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the History of the Gospels? Did the <hi>Apostles</hi> teach it their first Converts? Is it agreeable to, or found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon true <hi>Apostolick Tradition?</hi> Is this Tradition un-interrupted, and derived down pure from the first Ages of the Church? Was it received universally by the whole number of <hi>Christians</hi> in their time? Is it any where to be met with in their Writings, either in express terms, or by a just, and clear, and necessary consequence? For though the Doctrine of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Religion was Preach'd and received before any word of the <hi>New Testament</hi> was Penned; yet to say, the <hi>Apostles</hi> taught many Points of Doctrine, which they did not put down in Writing, and much more, such Points, as consequentially overthrow and destroy the plain sense and letter of the Text, is a very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and scandalous Supposition: And besides, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to the Scriptures, which contain in them all Points necessary to be believed, is confuted by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, who pretend to fetch Proofs of their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied tenents out of them: There having been that great Veneration shewn to the Inspired Writings in all Ages, that Hereticks, and other kind of Innovators have chosen rather to bend and warp the Scripture, and pervert its true sense and meaning in favour of their tenents, than not seem to have the Countenance of its Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That since the times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the Sealing up of the Canon of Scripture, no New Doctrine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98211:8"/>
can or ought to be added as Essential to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>For all which is Essential to the Faith was delivered by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to the Church at first, otherwise the Rule of Faith had been imperfect, and would have had something wanting to its completion, to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in after-times; which is to cast a slur and a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish upon those first Ages of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which were fully Instructed in all things fit and necessary for <hi>Christians</hi> to know and believe by the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without the stamp of whose Authority no Doctrine could be Authentick. For what ever was believed as necessary, derived only from them, as the Instruments, which <hi>Christ</hi> made use of to convey his Doctrine to the World; which they did fully, and carefully, and successfully by the mighty aids of his Spirit, according to the trust reposed in them. They establish'd the belief of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion in the hearts of the Faithful: They concealed nothing of the mind and will of God. Churches were formed and modelled according to their direction and command; and <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government with the inferiour and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Orders settled for the better preservation of Unity and Communion. The Faith of <hi>Christ</hi> was professed and acknowledged, as they taught and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it. Their Writings were among them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeing in all things with what they had Preach'd, and were to be the standing Monuments of the will of <hi>Christ,</hi> Registred by their Pens, to direct all succeeding Generations of <hi>Christians</hi> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and in their practise. After their Decease no new Revelation was to be expected, only a delivering down of the same <hi>Apostolical</hi> Doctrine to after-ages, in which the Faith, nay, the Curiosity of all <hi>Christians</hi> ought to acquiesce.</p>
            <p n="3">

3. That it is not in the Power of the Church in general, much less of any particular Church, of what denomination soever, to lay down any Doctrine, as necessary to be believed in order to Salvation, but what is expresly revealed, or clearly deduced out of the writings of the New Testament, and was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the first Ages of <hi>Christianity.</hi> For if so, they must pretend to the same Authority, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce clear and convictive Evidences of such Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make them credible, and lay an Obligation upon the Consciences of all <hi>Christians</hi> to receive their Propositions under the grievous penalty of otherwise disobeying the voice and will of <hi>God.</hi> This dotage indeed <hi>Montanus,</hi> and such kind of <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> have been guilty of: But their pretensions were rejected as dreams of folly, arising from mis-interpretations of Scripture, as if there were to be new Revelations made in after-times by way of super-addition and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, (into which errors they were led by their pride and conceitedness, and an ill habit and temper of body) and the Authority of the Scriptures, and the Praescription of the precedent Ages were justly objected against them. <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently treating of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the 32 Chapter of his <hi>Commoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium.</hi>
               </note> All that the Church can pretend to is only this, not to define and make a new Article of Faith, but only to declare what before was revealed and acknowledged, though not so clearly understood, till the iniquity of the times made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Church in a general Council to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her Authority in the determination of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith. And where this pretence is true, her Authority ought to be submitted to, and her Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals embraced: That is, if the Doctrine proposed be the just and natural result of an Article of Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly revealed in the Scripture, and understood in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98211:9"/>
that manner, and acknowledged as such by the first <hi>Christians,</hi> Contemporaries and Successors of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> and constantly received from that time down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the generality of <hi>Christians.</hi> For the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of a few after the first and general reception of a necessary truth is not considerable; who through prejudice, or out of design to raise troubles in the Church, or out of Ambition to be the Chiefs of a Faction, or through a pretended dissatisfaction at the Mysteriousness of it, or through wantonness of Wit and Humour, have been so obstinate, as not only to refuse to make the same acknowledgment, but to maintain the contrary with violence.</p>
            <p>To all which, that is, to Scripture, Apostolick Tradition, and universal consent, the Fathers Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the four first General Councils had regard in their determinations against the Hereticks of their time. They only fixt what was Catholick Doctrine, and what was believed in the Ages before they were born. They founded their Declarations upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and universal Tradition: And to silence all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and to prevent Schism, and to direct their own and after-times in the belief and understanding of the great Mysteries of Faith, they reduced the Doctrine of it, as it lyes scattered in several parts of Scripture, into a form of plain and intelligible words, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged themselves in the explication of it, as we shall see anon: <note n="a" place="margin">

Whatever therefore the Church believes or proposes to be believed, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be founded upon such a Revelation; and consequently, that Doctrine, if it be of Faith, must Originally derive from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> the Doctrine of Faith being nothing else but what <hi>He</hi> and They from Him have delivered, and consequently, one and the same, <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever:</hi> That is, in all Ages. Now, into the Unity of this Faith, and wherein it consists, I shall enquire, in the next place, which brings me to</p>
            <p>The second Proposition, That the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> only respects the Fundamentals of the <hi>Christian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>In order to the clearing of which, I will premise these two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was a form of words containing a brief Summary of the Principles of the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in the Apostles times. This seems to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed in the writings of the New Testament, and most probably may be the same with the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or the <hi>good depositum or Doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his trust;</hi> which undoubtedly refers to the grounds and fundamentals of Christianity, purely and abstractedly considered as the rule of Faith, to which he was precisely to adhere against all the noise and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98211:10"/>
clamours of vain and idly-curious talkers, and the contradictions of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> (the Hereticks of that Age, who not content with the express and plain Revelations of the Gospel, pretended to higher and greater degrees and measures of Divine knowledge) as is plain from 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 20. O</hi> Timothy, <hi>keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain bablings, and oppositions of Science, falsly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> It being most agreeable in the nature of the thing, if there were no places of Scripture to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and make out the supposition, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should, for the use of the new Converts, put the necessary Articles of Faith together into certain heads of Discourse, and that to these they should refer as to a <hi>Rule, Gal. 6. 16. Phil.</hi> 3. 16. as to <hi>a form of Doctrine,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. as to <hi>the first Principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> Heb. 5. 12. as <hi>to the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ,</hi> Heb. 6. 1. and <hi>as to the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jude v. 3. All which several circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are expressive of the same thing, and suppose those Doctrines, whatsoever they were, universally taught, and as universally acknowledged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>But <note n="o" place="margin">But of this see the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</note> whether this form be the same with that, which bears the name of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> (which undoubtedly in the main is very ancient, and most probably as ancient as their time; the Church, in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages indeed, to serve and maintain the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and necessities of Religion against the innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and assaults of Heresie, adding several clauses and expressions to it) is not here to be disputed at large.

There was a perfect agreement and harmony of Confessions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all who had embraced the Doctrine of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> The <hi>Christians</hi> here in <hi>Britain</hi> believed no otherwise than those at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and those in <hi>India,</hi> whom St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Converted, and all who lived in the intermediate spaces between those two vastly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant extreams, which were the boundaries of the then known World, exactly agreeing with both. Though they differed in Language, Customs, Laws, Behaviour, and way of Living, and were under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Governments, yet they all held the same thing: Which Argument is excellently handled by <hi>Irenoeus,</hi> in his <hi>1st. Book, 3d. Chap. adv.

Among that great variety of Opinions, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed every where, there were certain essential points of Faith, wherein they were all unanimous, and so long as they were held and maintained, a liberty of Judgment and Opinion was allowed in lesser matters, witness those Ancient forms before-mentioned, long before the Civil Power took the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its protection; which whosoever admitted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessed, was received into their Communion.

            </p>
            <p>Upon these two Suppositions I shall lay down these following Propositions: That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Diversity of Opinions in matters of Religion of less moment does not interrupt and dissolve the <hi>Unity</hi> of Faith.</p>
            <p>Opinions arise either from want of Evidence in the things themselves, which causes a fluctuation and unsettlement in the mind, as not knowing where to fix and rest; to which we yield a wavering kind of assent, more or less, according to greater or lesser de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Probabilities; or else from the weakness of the understanding, which not being able to take a comprehensive view of things, and resolve them into their first Principles and Original Causes; or for want of a sure Foundation, whether of Nature or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Authority, or Revelation, takes up with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and motives of assent, which fall short of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98211:13"/>
certainty, and which cannot quiet the mind, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it from all suspicion and fear of the contrary. And indeed considering the great variety of mens tempers and complexions, Education and Interests; and the greater or lesser degrees of Knowledge, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, Curiosity, and the like; there is a Moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, that Opinions should be one and the same. And where <hi>God</hi> has left a liberty, no Power upon Earth can oblige the Conscience and Understanding to admit them any otherwise than as Opinions: That is, either as true in their kind, but far from the Infallibility of Divine Revelations; or as <hi>piè credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia:</hi> Or as means and instruments of Agreement and Uniformity in Judgment, to prevent Schism and Confusion; so as yet no one particular Church shall prescribe to another, but leave each to its liberty of securing their peace and quiet by what Confessions they judge best for that end; and nothing be imposed as a matter of Doctrine, which thwarts the Ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Tradition of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. All truths are not fundamental and necessary to be believed with the same firmness of assent: For se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Propositions may be true and useful, and yet not necessary and essential to the Faith; the ignorance or dis-belief of which does not throw a man out of the Communion of the <hi>Church.</hi> The neglect of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction has been one great cause of the troubles and turmoils of <hi>Christendom,</hi> whilst fierce and eager Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants have been engaged in the defence of several tenents, which have no necessary dependance on the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> and which are not determined in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by reason of their difficulty, and the various apprehensions and prejudices of men not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98211:14"/>
like ever to be fully and satisfactorily decided; and which indeed are but niceties and trifling subtilties in comparison; while they put a greater value upon them than the nature and matter of them will bear; and whilst they Sacrifice Unity and the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the grand and real concerns of Religion to Passion and Humour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Much less are doubtful Consequences and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Opinions to be admitted and reckoned in the number of <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> At first certainly, and for several Ages together, there was no great subtilty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to be a good <hi>Christian.</hi> The Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christianity were not Laborious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext: Nothing was required but a firm assent of the mind to a few Propositions, whose matter indeed was Mysterious, but what had the highest ground of Credibility to make the assent to them just and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but when once a bold Curiosity, and an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and an over-affected subtilty made men depart <note n="p" place="margin">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98211:14"/>
The result was, that they were the worse Christians; more talkative and curious perhaps, but less strict and Religious, and Charitable; nay, less knowing than they were before they let loose the Reins to their fancy, and leapt over those boundaries which <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> had set.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whatsoever was not Fundamental in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, cannot be so now. If it be a true way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that it was revealed by <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and as such, imposed by them upon their <hi>Proselytes,</hi> without the embracing of which they could not be <hi>Christians;</hi> and that it is to be found in the writings which they left behind them, either expresly or by necessary consequence: Then the contrary also, that is, whatsoever is not found in their writings, either directly, or by just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence, and was not proposed to the first Believers, cannot be Fundamental; and consequently no one is bound to believe any Doctrine, but what was then revealed, and afterward acknowledged by the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and what-ever proposal is made by the <hi>Church,</hi> is no farther to be believed, than as it is consonant to the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> this declaration not being of it self suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but as it is founded upon <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Apostolical</hi> Authority. How had the Peace of <hi>Christendom</hi> been still preserved, if these Rules had been followed and kept in after-ages? That is, if new Opinions, whereof some are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to which the <hi>Christian Church</hi> was a stranger for several Centuries of Years, and all uncertain at the best, if meer fancies, to which Superstition and Ignorance have given Birth; and if the niceties and subtilties of the <hi>Schools,</hi> and things impossible to be

throughly known, and matters of meer speculation, that tend to the disservice of Religion, and do not slow in the least from its Principles, had not been adopted Articles and Points of Faith, (all which we justly object to the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> and made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary conditions of Communion. How might we have adorsed before the same Altars, and <hi>gone together to the House of God as Friends;</hi> and have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Mysteries of the <hi>Body and blood of our Saviour,</hi> if they had not determined the manner of the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and brought in a new Doctrine, which contradicts the whole circle of Sciences, and the sense and experience of all mankind; and tyed all others to believe an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense of the words of the <hi>Institution?</hi> making the differences irreconcileable by their <hi>Trent</hi> Canons, and shutting out all possible hope of Peace, till <hi>God</hi> shall open the eyes of the <hi>Christian Princes</hi> of <hi>that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> to see the fallacies and cheats of the <hi>Court,</hi> and the errors and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to call a free and truly General <hi>Council,</hi> to debate the differences which are now on foot, to the great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of <hi>Christianity,</hi> upon the Principles of Scripture, Primitive Antiquity, and genuine Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and which considerations of Worldly Interest and Grandeur keep up; this being the only way left to restore Unity to the divided <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>

he thinks this a just reason, because it is a set form; that she holds nothing as necessary and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Faith, but what was held so in the first Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and can be proved out of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> that she rejects no Tradition that can prove it self to be <hi>Apostolical;</hi> that she receives the Articles of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> held Anciently for such, in their received sense, and as they are laid down in the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> and admits all, who receive them, into her Communion; that her determinations of Opinions in her Articles are modest, and far from the high-flown pretence of Infallibility, and designed as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Union; that she is willing to communicate with <hi>Christians</hi> of what <hi>denomination</hi> soever, where the terms of the <hi>Communion</hi> are Lawful, so as it may be done without sin, without prejudice to truth, and the Fundamentals of <hi>Church Government</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by universal Practise and Canons of Councils, and without violating the Rights and Priviledges of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as well as her own in particular. Let the <hi>Romanists</hi> single out any one of her professed Tenents, which she holds as essential to <hi>Faith,</hi> and necessary to Salvation, which is not exactly agreeable to the first Antiquity. They cannot deny, that she holds nothing amiss herein; only they pretend, that she does not hold enough: That is, that we reject Transubstantiation, and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints and Angels, Worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; that we do not admit the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the visible Head and Monarch of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that it is necessary to Salvation to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, and the like: All which are meer Fancies and Usurpations. But if the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were in the right, if a good Life (for that is a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental

and most necessary point of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and without which all our belief, be it never so Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, will signifie nothing) added to an entire and found Faith, carried them to Heaven, we may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; it is enough for us to follow them and tread in their steps: We retain the same Faith; the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> conformed it self to their Practise and Example. Our <hi>Church</hi> has been the great Eye-sore of <hi>Rome</hi> ever since, and especially of late, when they had such mighty hopes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, to which the froward and perverse humour of the Non-Conformists, and chiefly the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Faction, the Original and source of all our Church-divisions, have given so great advantage. So that the Wise and most Learned King <hi>James,</hi> of Blessed Memory, may seem to have been a Prophet in this too, That if ever the <hi>Pope</hi> were brought into <hi>England,</hi> it would be upon the back of a <hi>Puritan,</hi> as well as in that remarkable saying, No Bishop, no King; the truth of which was most sadly justified and made out in the late most bloudy and unnatural Wars, and by the most horrid Murder of the best of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, whose Righteous Soul must needs be troubled (if any thing of pity, which is a troublesom Passion, can be supposed to reach the Blessed) at our present Distractions, and the dismal consequences of them. They envy her Beauty and Order, the discreet Piety of her Service, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and exactness of her Discipline, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicalness of her Government, and the flourishing of her Universities. This makes them rage and swell, and for want of better Proofs and Arguments, accuse and arraign, as guilty of Heresie and Schism, and Innovation, the purest and most <hi>Apostolical Church</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98211:16"/>
of the World. But wise and considerate men are not to be frighted out of their Senses, and out of their Religion with hard and big words, and with reproachful Language. The dissolute and debauched may easily be reconciled, as the new word is, to a Religion that is so favourable to them, and gives them hopes of going to Heaven after a careless and wretched Life, if upon a Sick Bed they begin to be afraid, and profess a little sorrow, and can but send for a Priest, and be Absolved; and the ignorant and weak may be wrought upon by little tricks and pieces of Sophistry, and cheated and trapanned out of a <hi>Church,</hi> the Doctrine of which they did not throughly understand. For it is impossible for one who understands aright the Grounds and Principles of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> upon which this <hi>National Church</hi> proceeded, ever to renounce her Communion, unless he first makes Shipwrack of his Honesty as well as of his Conscience, and is swayed wholly by Worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and interests. But we need value their Censures the less, not only because they are unjust and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, but because they involve the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in the same guilt with us, and all the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> this day in the World, that will not own that grand Fundamental <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> the <hi>Pope's Jurisdiction,</hi> and be content to receive their <hi>Christianity</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledge all her determinations to be truly and really, as they in the ordinary Court-stile call them, <hi>Apostolical.</hi> Let us in the name of <hi>God</hi> justifie the Doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> by the strictness and exemplariness of our Lives, as well as by Arguments and Discourses of Reason. Let us <hi>reform</hi> our selves not only from the Errors and Superstitions, but from the Vices that are

too commonly practised in <hi>Catholick Countries,</hi> as they call them, though thanks be to the great industry and kindness, and charity of their <hi>Missionaries</hi> of late, they would be content, I will not say (though perhaps I might justly enough) make it their business, that Atheism and Profaneness, and Debauchery should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the Land, rather than that the name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should be any more in remembrance. In times of such defection to <hi>Socinianism</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> on the one hand, and to Fanaticism on the other, let us take heed to our selves, that we be no way byas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or wrought upon to desert the purity and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> as it is taught in this <hi>Church,</hi> in any one point of it; and withal let us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider and remember, that it is not enough to believe it with our hearts, unless we make open and publick profession of it with our Mouths: Which brings me</p>

See more to this purpose in the same Author at large.</note> But then it is evident, that in this one Proposition the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Creed</hi> is virtually contained, and that it draws necessarily all the other along with it, and that this general belief was deduced into its severals afterwards; and that for a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and particular enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the Articles of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> we are to have recourse to the <hi>Apostolical writings,</hi> in which they confirm the new <hi>Christians</hi> in the Faith which they had been taught to believe and acknowledge. By all which it may appear, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Divine Faith in general is necessary to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Christian, and that without it we, to whom the <hi>Gospel</hi> is Preach'd and made known, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend either to <hi>Christianity,</hi> or to any hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, as the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Where this Article of the <hi>Resurrection of Christ from the dead</hi> supposes the rest, and is here expresly mentioned, as the confirmation of the truth of <hi>Christ's</hi> Mission and Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a very grievous Error to fancy, that it is a matter of meer indifference what our belief is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98211:18"/>
in particular, and that it is enough, that we believe that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> without obliging our selves to believe all the just and necessary consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Proposition, meerly because that one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Act of Faith qualified the first Converts for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; when that only is mentioned, as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Basis of all the rest, and does Necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the other Doctrinal Points, that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we are obliged to profess our belief of the whole Doctrine of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as it lyes in the writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which is the Rule of Faith, and as out of them it is briefly summed up in the <hi>Creeds,</hi> the explication which the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> has made of that Rule. So that as on the one hand after this acknowledgment, it is unjust to demand a more particular and distinct account or catalogue of the <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be believed in order to Salvation; (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient for the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in all Ages, which was so in the first) so on the other hand, to believe less, and to reject any part of the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and teach the contrary, is justly chargeable with the guilt of Heresie, and is not the effect of wariness, but of pride and obstinacy. The <hi>command of God</hi> to believe the Testimony <hi>that he has given of his Son,</hi> and the revelations of his will, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Authority,</hi> on which they are founded, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Arguments to move us to assent to the truth of them, though the matter of them be so far above our comprehension. They are Mysteries, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily must be such, and therefore are to be adored and submitted to, with that humility, that befits Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conscious of their own weaknesses and faileurs,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98211:19"/>
and of the infinite and incomprehensible Majesty and perfection of <hi>God.</hi> And if this troubles them, they may as well murmur, and quarrel, and find fault with the dispensations of Providence, as obscure and un-intelligible: There is enough to satisfie all, who will be content with just Proofs of it, though not to take away all possible doubt: and by this means they must side with the followers of <hi>Epicurus</hi> in their idle and foolish, and impious attempts to raze the very notions of a Deity, out of the minds of Men, and extinguish and destroy all <hi>Religion</hi> out of the World. This is not imposing upon them, or doing violence to their Reason, as they object, only upon this pretence, because the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are not as evident and clear to their understanding, as visible objects are to the Eye in a clear and full light: For then they would cease to be matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and lose their name, and fall under the comprehension of <hi>Science.</hi> And indeed so long as they retain this unreasonable Principle, that all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> are to be tryed and judged by the narrow Rules of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and natural Reason (which can be no proper <hi>medium</hi> of proving things only knowable by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they may well pretend that 'tis not in their own power to change their Opinions, and that 'tis not possible for them to bring their understandings to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. But can they hope, that this should ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their pertinaciousness, and excuse them at <hi>God's</hi> Tribunal? Is it not to be feared, that the unjust pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which they entertain, arise from a perverse will, and from obstinacy and pride, and peevishness, and not from any dissatisfactoriness at the inevidence and incertainty of the grounds and motives of their Credibility? It is only <hi>God</hi> who can convince such
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98211:19"/>
men by the mighty influences of his Grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move these prejudices, which obstruct the reception of his truth, to whose Mercy we leave them. For us, <hi>let us hold fast our Profession of Faith without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for God is faithful who hath called us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Truth.</hi> If you understand aright the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the Principles of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> it is impossible for you to be debauched and perverted either by <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or <hi>Sectary.</hi> All their pretended demonstrations (for error and delusion are usually very bold and confident) are meer Sophisms and Arguments of deceit, tricks, and artifices of Wit, without any foundation of true Reason in the one, or of <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> in the other. If, as I said before, the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians</hi> went to Heaven, you may be assured of the same hope of Salvation in the Communion of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> if you add to a sound Faith the practises of a Vertuous, and Holy, and truly <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Life; and if you perform the Vows you made at your <hi>Baptism,</hi> and renew every time you receive the most blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and so adorn the <hi>Primitive Faith</hi> with Primitive Purity and Holiness.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And so in several other places he refers not only to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith in general, but to a fixt and known rule of it: As <hi>lib. 1. cap. 19.

Nusquam transferentes regulam, neque errantes ab artifice, neque abjicientes fidem—</hi>This rule of Faith is called some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by him, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or little body or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of Articles, containing the sum and substance of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. <hi>Tertullian</hi> does also often mention the <hi>regula fidei,</hi> as a thing every where known and acknowledged; as in his Book against <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> in the beginning, <hi>de praescript. cap. 13.

                  </gap>) &amp; irreformabilis;</hi> and is the same with what he calls soon after, <hi>Lex fidei,</hi> or the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Law of Faith, which admits of no change; whereas the Church has a Power in matters of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Discipline and external behaviour, to make what alteration shall be judged most suitable to the rules of Piety, Prudence, Decency, and to variety of Circumstances of places, and times, and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. <hi>Hâc lege fidei manente, caetera jam disciplinae &amp; conversationis admittunt novitatem corrections, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante scilicet &amp; persiciente us<expan>

                  </expan> in finem gratiâ Dei.</hi> Thus in general there was an explicite rule of Faith,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98211:20"/>
or form of words in their times, who lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the second Century.</p>
            <p>That this form was the same in the main with what we call the <hi>Apostles</hi> Creed, is next to be made out, which I shall do by laying down the words and Articles of that Form. I begin with <hi>Irenaeus, l. 1. c. 2. Ecclesia per universum orbem usque ad fines terrae semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, &amp; ab Apostolis, &amp; à Discipulis eorum accepit eam fidem, quae est in unum Deum Patrem omnipotentem qui fecit Coelum, &amp; terram, mare, &amp; omnia quae in eis sunt; &amp; in unum Jesum</hi> Christum, <hi>filium Dei, incarnatum pro nostrâ salute, &amp; in Spiritum Sanctum, qui per Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas praedicavit dispositiones Dei, &amp; adventum, &amp; eam, quae est ex Virgine generationem, &amp; passionem, &amp; resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionem à mortuis, &amp; in carne in Coelos ascensionem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecti</hi> Jesu Christi <hi>Domini nostri, &amp; de Coelis in gloriâ Patris adventum ejus, ad recapitulanda universa, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitandam omnem carnem humani generis.</hi> Here is an explicite acknowledgment of the Doctrine of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, received all the World over by all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox <hi>Christians,</hi> wherein they profess to believe in one <hi>God</hi> the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things which are therein: And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; that he was born of a Virgin, suffered, rose from the dead, ascended into Heaven, and that he shall come again in the glory of the Father, and that he shall raise the dead; and in the Holy Ghost. It is not here undertaken to be proved, that it is the same in every expression of it; for that is variable; or in all its clauses, several of which were added in after times for wise and just reasons and ends mentioned before by <hi>Rufinus.</hi> But it is evident, that the beginning was ever the same, the Article of one God, Almighty,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98211:21"/>
maker of the World, or of all things, or of Heaven and Earth: For they were not confined to a Phrase, and the explication was various: And then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows the Article concerning our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Son of God, our Lord—this Solemn Profession being so common and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, that the Fathers who refer to it, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thought it unnecessary oftentimes to repeat any more than the beginning, the rest being easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. So, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Cùm teneamus nos autem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam veritatis, id est, quia sit unus Deus, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, qui omnia condidit per verbum suum &amp; aptavit, &amp; fecit ex eo, quod non erat, ad hoc, ut sint omnia</hi>—lib. 2. cap. 43. <hi>Nunquam transferentes regulam, neque errantes ab artifice, neque abjicientes fidem, quae est in unum Deum, qui fecit omnia.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 45. <hi>Hi &amp; eam, quae est in unum Deum, qui omnia fecit, fidem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram custodiunt, &amp; eam, quae est in Filium Dei, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionem adaugent, qui tantas dispositiones propter nos fecit:</hi> And to the same effect <hi>cap.</hi> 62. <hi>Omnia er constant, &amp; in unum Deum Omnipotentem, ex quo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, fides integra, &amp; in Filium Dei Christum Jesum Dominum nostrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He supposes all along, that this Confession of Faith and particular form, agreeable to what we find in the Creed, was handed down in the way of Tradition from the Apostles. Thus, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. speaking of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> he says, that in his Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> he did <hi>annuntiare quam in recenti ab Apostolis receperant traditionem, annuntiantem Unum Deum, Omnipotentem, factorem Coeli &amp; terrae:</hi> But more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and fully in the <hi>4th. Cap. Quid autem si neque Apostoli quidem Scripturas reliquissent nobis, nonne oportebat ordinem sequi traditionis, quam tradiderunt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98211:21"/>
iis, quibus committebant Ecclesias? Cur ordination assentiunt multae gentes Barbarorum, quorum fortassè aliqui qui in Christum credunt, sine chartâ &amp; atramento Scriptam habentes per Spiritum in cordibus suis salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp; veterem traditionem diligenter custodientes, in unum Deum credentes, fabricatorem Coeli &amp; terrae, &amp; omnium, quae in iis sunt, per Jesum Christum Dei filium. Qui propter eminentissimam erga figmentum suum dilectionem, eam quae esset ex Virgine, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem sustinuit, ipse per se hominem adunans Deo, &amp; passus sub</hi> Pontio Pilato, <hi>&amp; resurgens, &amp; in claritate receptus in gloriâ, venturus salvator eorum, qui sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantur, &amp; judex eorum, qui judicantur, &amp; mittens in ignem aeternum transfiguratores veritatis &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Patris sui &amp; adventûs sui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this form or rule <hi>Tertullian</hi> plainly alludes in his Book against <hi>Praxeas,</hi> making it as Ancient as the first Preaching of the Gospel by the <hi>Apostles, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Nos verò &amp; semper &amp; nunc magis, ut instructiones per Paracletum, deductorem Scil. omnis veritatis, unicum quidem Deum Credimus, sub hûc tamen dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satione, quam Oeconomiam credimus, ut unici Dei sit &amp; filius sermo ipsius, qui ex ipso processerit, per quem omnia facta sunt, &amp; sine quo factum est nihil.

            <p>
               <hi>Novatianus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyter, who lived about the Year 240, thus begins his Book <hi>de Trinitate. Regula exigit veritatis, ut primò omnium credamus in Deum Patrem &amp; dominum omnipotentem, id est, verum omnium perfectissimum conditorem.</hi> Cap. 9. <hi>Eadem regula veritatis docet nos credere, post Patrem, etiam in Filium Dei, Christum Jesum dominum Deum nostrum, Dei filium, hujus Dei, qui &amp; unus &amp; solus est, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor scilicet rerum omnium; ut jam &amp; superius expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est.</hi> Cap. 29. <hi>Sed enim odorationis &amp; fidei aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, digestis vocibus &amp; literis Domini, admonet nos post hoc credere etiam in Spiritum Sanctum.</hi>

            <p>That the <hi>Apostles</hi> made a Creed, and that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the limitations laid down above, is that Creed; both History and Tradition justly induce us to believe, and it appears hence, that it is a meer Fancy and conjecture of <hi>Vossius, dissert. prima de tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus symbolis, Sect.</hi> 24.

            <p>This must be before the Year 352. in which Pope <hi>Julius</hi> dyed: And <hi>Marcellus</hi> himself, who had been made Bishop in the Reign of <hi>Constantine,</hi> as appears by his Subscription to the <hi>Ancyran</hi> Council, which was held some few Years before that at <hi>Nice,</hi> only lived to the Year of Christ 373. So that these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances sufficiently demonstrate, that this <hi>Apostolical</hi> form was used in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church before the Year 400, which is the assertion of <hi>Vossius, pag.</hi> 18.

            <p>It will be altogether impertinent to alledge, that this is to be understood of the Creed, as now we have it, <hi>totidem syllabis:</hi> For this no one ever thought of; but the question is double, whether the Apostles made a form of Faith for the use of the new Converts, or no; and whether this form is not the same in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, notwithstanding those few insertions and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, which were made before it was thus fixt. For the affirmative of both which, we have positive Proofs, and nothing of any moment is alledged by <hi>Vossius</hi> to invalidate either them or the Tradition of the Church. All his other Arguments are such as these; that if the <hi>Apostles</hi> had agreed upon any form, St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who wrote their <hi>Acts,</hi> would not have omitted it, or at least, some of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves would have transcribed it into their <hi>Epistles.</hi> But the

Again, he pretends, that no Ecclesiastical Writer or Council make mention of it. To the former part of his Assertion we oppose the Authorities of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Novatianus,</hi> St.

               <hi>Eusebius Pamphili,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laestine,</hi> proposed a Creed, or form of Faith to the Emperour and <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, which, he says, he had received from the <hi>Bishops</hi> his Predecessors, and had been taught and Catechized in, and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of at his Baptism, according to the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church.

If the form of the old <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Creed were entirely extant (part of which we have in the Liturgy of St. <hi>James)</hi> the matter would then be put out of doubt; for that it was more contracted than that form, which St. <hi>Cyril</hi> about the Year 350 explained in his Learned

            <p>The form which <hi>Eusebius</hi> presented to the Emperour and Council, was thus. <hi>We believe in one God, the Father, Almighty, Creator of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God, God of God, light of light, life of life, the only begotten Son, the first-born of every Creature, begotten of God the Father before all Worlds, by whom all things were made, who for our Salvation was Incarnate, and conversed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; he Suffered, and rose the third day, and ascended to the Father, and he shall come again with glory to Judge both the quick and the dead—We believe also in the Holy Ghost—</hi>I do not pretend to say, that this was the old form used from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for it is plain from the very contexture, and from the omission of some Clauses by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, that they lookt upon this as interpolated. It being certain and undoubted, that there was an old <hi>Apostolical</hi> form, or form used from the very beginnings of <hi>Christianity</hi> to be profest at Baptism, the Bishops of the chief Sees thought themselves at liberty to explain or add, as they judged most proper for the time wherein they lived; which is the true Reason, as I must intimate again, why the forms are so various. And especially when we consider, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of Baptism, the chief design of this Profession of Faith made at the receiving it, was an explicite acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each of the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity: And accordingly here the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed stops (for that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called so, ought, upon the account of the several additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be called the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Creed.) Though that in some other old Creeds were added the Articles of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Flesh, and of everlasting Life, appears from the <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>If this should be allowed him, which has no other Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but his own conjecture, yet we may hence conclude, that both the Eastern and the Western Churches may well and justly pretend to derive their forms from the Apostles: Which must be understood as to the ground of each Creed, and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. For that the Apostles did Pen every word, or every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed, which now bears their Name, was never pretended or asserted by any one: Nay, the contrary is now, and was Anciently acknowledged, and the variety of forms in the chief <hi>Apostolical</hi> Sees, used according to the exigence of the times, is a convincing Proof. But this doth not hinder, but rather suppose; that there was a short Form proposed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as the Ancient Writers have asserted: And that the old <hi>Oriental Creed,</hi> and the old <hi>Roman</hi> are almost in expression, but wholly in effect, the same, and consequently <hi>Apostolical.</hi>
