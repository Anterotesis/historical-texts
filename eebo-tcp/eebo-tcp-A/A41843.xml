            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But as to all these, wee shall intreat you rather to consider, 1. His age, and that his gift was but in the very moulding and breaking (as wee speak) in the point of order and method, when the Lord was pleased to call him home from his work. 2.

things is not to be wondered at. And indeed, though these things be good in themselves, and worthy to be looked to in their own place, yet for a Minister of the Gospel, in all Auditories, and upon all occasions, to pin up every purpose to such a method, and insist into such a measure of Explications and Criticismes upon words, it is but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etter himself, and to starve his people. 5. Consider the dulnesse of the most part of hearers in this age, and how hard a thing it is to awake a sleeping world, and to get them but to think that it doth concern them to hear in earnest; And possibly it was not a small piece of spiritual wisedome in him, (and it may be not unfit to be imitated by others) to begin or end all his Sermons with an awakening word concerning Heaven, or Hell, or Iudgement, and the danger of chois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil, and refusing the good. 6. For digressions, the truth is, that his soul was so filled with such longings after Heaven, and Glory, and so inflamed with the love of Christ, (especially towards the latter end of his race) that when he fell upon these subjects, upon which (ye will see) most of these digressions are, he could not well contain himself, nor easily bring off his own spirit! A thing not unusual to the Saints in Scripture. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit such things might seem somewhat singular (in the time) and not so coherent; yet now we have grounds to apprehend that they were often strong influences of the Lords Spirit, stirring up a lamp (as it were) into a sudden blaze, that was not to burn long in his Church.

But now we shall detain you no longer, only this we may assure you of, That although these Sermons are neither so exact, nor so full as doubtlesse they would have been, if they had come from the Authors own pen, yet as we dare say, they were studied with Prayer, Preached with Power, and backed with Successe; so also, if ye shall read them with consideration, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with Prayer, and Practise with diligence, ye shall neither find your time nor pains ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, but shall have cause to blesse the Lord for this amongst other helps that he hath given, for making you meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light. That it may be blest to this end, is the earnest desire and prayer of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the work of the Lord,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His everlasting Gospel (in which there are drawn so many precious draughts and divine lineaments of the transcendent beauty of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour, and of the riches of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable grace) is a most precious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, not onely because it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain most absolute and sublime precepts and commands, in the exercise and obedience of which, we do not only attain unto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pitch in holinesse, but likewise, because it containeth most rich and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, in the possession and fruition of which wee are advanced to the highest pinacle of eternal blessedness, this is clear in the grace of Faith; for what doth more purifie the heart and stamp it with the Image of the invisible God then this grace of Faith? And what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107527:8"/>
richer promises are annexed to any duty then to this duty of believing, to wit, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and fruition of God. So that if we have dwelt fourty dayes at the foot of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and had been under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est discovering and condemning power of the Law, we may yet come with boldnesse to mount Sion, and there imbrace Jesus Christ, who is <hi>the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to such as believe;</hi> Upon which Mount hee standeth holding forth the golden Scepter of his peace, desiring us to imbrace him, and is crying out that word in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 1. <hi>Behold me, behold me.</hi> O may wee not sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Angels, and these twenty four Elders about the Throne, to help us to wonder, that ever such a command as this came forth, that wee should believe on the Name of the Son of God, after that wee had broken that first and primitive command, <hi>That we should not eat of the forbidden tree:</hi> Was not this indeed to make mercy rejoyce over judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And O may wee not wonder at the precious oath of the everlasting Covenant, whereby he hath sworn, <hi>That hee delighteth not in the death of sinners?</hi> What (suppose yee) were poor <hi>Adams</hi> thoughts when at first the Doctrine of Free-grace, and of a crucified Christ Jesus a Saviour, was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him in Paradise? What a divine surprisal was this, that heaven should have preached peace to earth, after that earth had proclaimed war against heaven? Was not this a low step of condescendency? to behold an offended God preaching peace and good will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107527:8"/>
to a guilty sinner; What could self-destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adam</hi> think of these morning and first discoveries of this everlasting Covenant? Christ, as it were, in the morning of time giving vent to that infinite love, which was resting in his bosome and precious heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world was laid. Wee know not whether the infinitenesse of his love, the eternity of his love, or the freedom of it, maketh up the greatest won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; But sure, these three joyned together, make up a matchlesse and everlasting won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Would any of you ask the Question, What is Christ worth? Wee could give no answer so suitable as this, it is above all the Arithmetick of all the Angels in heaven, and all the men on earth, to calculate his worth, all men here must be put to a divine <hi>non plus;</hi> This was <hi>Iobs</hi> divinity, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. 13. <hi>Man knoweth not the price of wisedome.</hi> And must not Jesus Christ who is the precious object of Faith, and wisedome of the Father, bee a supereminent and excellent One, who hath that Name of <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> not onely ingraven on his vesture, (which pointeth out the conspicuousnesse of his Majesty) but even also upon his thigh, to point out that in all his goings and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee proveth himself to bee higher then the Kings of the earth? And howbeit the naked proposing of the object doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, yet if once our souls were admitted to behold such a sight as Christ in his Beauty and Majesty, and to bee satisfied with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine rayes of his transcendent glory, then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107527:9"/>
certainly wee should finde a blessed necessity laid upon us, of closing with him; for Christ hath a sword proceeding out of his precious mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>h, by which hee doth subject and subjugate his own to himself, as well as hee hath a sword girded upon his thigh, by which hee judgeth and maketh war with his enemies. Wee confesse it is not only hard, but simply impossible to commit a Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole in commending of him; His worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes so far above our expressions, and our expressions alwayes so far beneath his worth, therefore wee may be put to propose that desire unto him, <hi>Exalt thy self, O Lord, above the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now to our purpose, being at this time to begin our discourse upon that radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and precious grace of Faith, wee intend to speak of it under this twofold notion and consideration: First, We shall speak of it as it is justifying, <hi>or as it doth lay hold upon the righteousnesse of a crucified Saviour, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing application of the precious promises in the Covenant of free grace, which wee call justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</hi> And in the second place, we shall speak a little-unto Faith, as <hi>it doth lay hold upon Christs strength, for advancing the work of mortification, and doth discover the personal excellencies of Iesus Christ, by which wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the work of holinesse and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sormity with God, which wee call sanctifying Faith.</hi> However, it is not to bee supposed, that these are different habits of Faith, but different acts flowing from the same saving habit, laying hold and exercising themselves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107527:9"/>
upon Christ in different respects, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse ends. Now to speak upon the first, we have made choice of these words. The Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the former verse, hath been pointing out the precious advantages of the grace of obedience, and of keeping of his commands; that such a one hath, as it were, an arbitrary power with God, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many precious returns of prayer: As likewise, that one who is exercised in the grace of repentance, is Gods delight: which is included in this, that he doth these things that are well pleasing in his sight. And now in these words hee doth, as it were, answer an objection that might bee proposed, about the impossibility of attaining these precious advantages, seeing his commands were so large, and that hardly could they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. This hee doth sweetly answer, by setting down in this one verse a short compend or breviary both of Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>viz. That wee should love one another,</hi> which is the compend of the Law: and, <hi>The we should believe on the Name of His Son;</hi> which is the compend of the Gospel; And by this he sheweth the Christian, that there are not many things required of him, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining these excellent advantages; but if he exercise himself in the obedience of these two comprehensive commandments, he shall find favour both with God and man. And as concerning this precious grace of Faith, Wee have, 1. the advantages of it implied in the words, and clear also from the scope, as (no doubt) all the commands have infinit advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107527:10"/>
infolded in their bosome, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to a Believer, by his practising of them. And, 2. the excellency of it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth in the words, in that it is called, <hi>His command,</hi> as if hee had no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but this. (And the Greek particle is here prefixed, which hath a great deal of emphasis and force in it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) But, 3. There is this also, the absolute necessity of this grace, holden forth here in this word, <hi>His Commandment:</hi> as if he would have said, by proposing of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I do set life and death before you, and that ye would not conceive that it is an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and indifferent thing for you to believe, or not: But be perswaded of this, that as an infinite advantage may constrain you to the obedience of it, so absolute necessity must perswade you to act that which is of your everlasting concernment. And lastly, Yee have the precious Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon which Faith (which is justifying) doth exercise it self, and that is upon the Name of the Son of God; And (no doubt) Faith is that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grace, which doth elevate the soul unto a sweet and inseparable union with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is that golden and precious knot, that doth eternally knit the hearts of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious friends together. Faith is that grace that draweth the first draughts of Christs precious Image on our hearts, and by love doth accomplish and perfire them. Now Faith taketh hold not onely on the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, that hee is a God of truth, and that in him there is no lie: but likewise it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107527:10"/>
taketh hold on the omnipotency of God, that hee is one to whom nothing is too hard: and on the infinite mercy and love of God, that hee is one who doth delight to magnifie this Attribute above all his works: And these are the three great pillars of justifying Faith. From the first, it answereth all these objections of sense, which do ordinarily cry forth, <hi>Doth his promise fail for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi> And that with this one word, <hi>If hee hath once purposed it, hee will also do it,</hi> and if hee hath once <hi>spoken it, hee will also make it come to passe.</hi> From the second, it answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all these objections that may arise from carnal reason and probability, which tend to the weakning of his confidence; And these do oftemtimes cry out, <hi>How can these things be?</hi> But Faith laying hold upon the omnipotency of God, <hi>it staggers not at the promise,</hi> but is strong <hi>in the Faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And it is the noble and divine exercise of this Heroick grace of Faith, that these objections of reason and probability, which it cannot answer, it will lay them aside, and yet close with the promise. Which was the practice of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>considered not</hi> his own body being weak, nor the barrennesse of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb. As likewise, it was the commendable practice of that woman, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. who not being able to answer the second trial of her faith from reason, yet notwithstanding, Faith made her cry out, <hi>Have mercy upon mee, O Son of David.</hi> And from the last, a Christian doth answer all the arguments of misbelief,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107527:11"/>
which do arise from the convictions of our unworthinesse and sinfulnesse, which makes us oftentimes imbrace that divinity of <hi>Peters,</hi> Luk. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>Depart from me, for I am a sinful man.</hi> But Faith taking hold on the infinite mercy and love of Christ, it answereth all with this, He walks not with us according to that rule of merit, but according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and golden rule of love and boundlesse compassion.</p>
               <p>But before we shall speak any thing unto you of these things, wee would a little point out some few things to be known as previous to these: we shall not dwell long in pointing out the nature of justifying Faith, it is that grace whereby a Christian being convinced of his lost estate, and of an utter impossibility to save himself, he doth flee to the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ; and unto him who is that precious City of refuge, and there doth abide till our High Priest shall die, which shall not be for ever. Or if ye will, it is a sweet travelling of the immortall soul, betwixt infinite misery, and infinite mercy, betwixt an utter impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to save our selves, and a compleat abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in him to <hi>save to the uttermost,</hi> betwixt abounding sin, and superabounding mercy. Hence Faith is often holden forth to us in Scripture, under that notion of coming, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him.</hi> And we may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107527:11"/>
say by the way, that if once a sinner could be brought to this, to count all his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse but filthy rags, and to belive that a man is as really justified before God, by imputed righteousnesse, as if it were by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holinesse; surely such an one were not far from the Kingdom of God. Neither shall we stand long to point out this unto you, that it is your duty to believe, for it is clear, not only from this place, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.</hi> Matth. 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi> Joh. 14. 1. <hi>Ye believe in God, belive also in me.</hi> Isa. 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he that hath no money, Come, buy without money and without price.</hi> But Oh! it's a great misery of many (and that which may be a subject of perpetuall lamentation) that we can neither be subject to the Law, as commanding, to obey it, or as threatning, to believe it; Nor, to the Gospel as promising, to imbrace it, and sweetly to receive it. O but that primitive temptation and delusion whereby <hi>Sathan</hi> did deceive our first father, is that whereby he yet seeks to catch and delude many souls, <hi>viz.</hi> That though we eat of the forbidden fruit, and walk in the vain imaginations of our own hearts, yet he doth suggest this to us, that we shall not die, but shall once be as God. This is <hi>Sathans</hi> great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

further, wee shall propose these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</p>
               <p>First, That the Gospel hath laid no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in our way of closing with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partaking of the effects of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on the contrary, sheweth that the great impediment is our want of willingnesse, which wee lay in our own way: as is clear from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But, to make this more clear, wee would have you knowing this, that all the qualifications annexed to this Commandement of Faith as that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. speaketh out the qualifications rather of these that will come than of all these that ought to come; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107527:12"/>
and knots should be sweetly loosed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider, that though we should pray the on half of our time, and weep the other, yet if we want this noble grace of Faith, the wrath of God shall abide on us. What are all the works of these hypocrites, and these g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>string acts of Law-sanctification, but a plunging of our selves in the ditch, untill our own cloaths abhorre us; Therefore it is, that after the Prophet <hi>Zachary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hath made mention, in the 12. Chapter of his Prophesie, of making <hi>bitter lamentation for him whom wee have pierced, as for an only Son;</hi> Yet in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 13. Chapter, he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Fountain opened to the house of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>for sin and for uncleannesse:</hi> Which may intimate unto us, that, although we have washed our selves with our own tears, yet there is use of the bloud of Christ, and that we must bee washed in that fountain, even from our <hi>own righteousnesses, which are but as filthy rags.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Consider that great and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous sinfulness that is in this sin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif, we will strain at a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at, but many will easily swallow down this Camel: we will tith Mint and Anise, and fast twice in the week, but neglect faith and love, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are the weightier things of the Law. And indeed, there are these things which speak out the sinfulnesse of unbelief. 1. That when the holy Ghost is sent to convince the world of sin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 9. he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107527:13"/>
pitched upon this sin, as though there were no other sin of which the world had need to be convinced; <hi>He will convince the world of sin, because they believe not on the Son of God:</hi> and (no doubt) there is more sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in that sin, than in many breaches of the Morall Law, it being a sin against match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse love, and against that which is the remedy of sin. 2. That it is called by way of eminency, disobedience, as is clear from Heb. 4. 11. <hi>Lest any of you fall after the same example of unbelief:</hi> or as the word may be rendered, <hi>Lest any of you fall after that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of disobedience,</hi> Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 3. That among all these that shall be eternally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, these that are guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of this sin of unbelief, they are put in the first place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. And, 4. that unbelief doth contradict and deny these three precious and cardinall Attributes of God. 1. Doth not unbelief contradict his faithfulnesse, and make him a liar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Doth it not contradict the infinitenesse of his power. And, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the infinitenesse of his love: and supposeth that there is something too hard for him, which his power cannot reach, nor his infinite love overcome. We may reduce many of our questions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings of his good will, to this original, <hi>viz.</hi> to the disputing of his power. No doubt, if we belong to him, we shall once sing that note of lamentation over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our unbelief, <hi>This is our infirmity, for changes are from the right hand of the most High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107527:13"/>And lastly, to enforce this precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Faith, consider that it is <hi>His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> which speaketh forth this, that we must not take an indulgence or dispensation to our selves, to believe, or not to believe at our pleasure. And is it not a strange thing, that Christians are lesse convinced of the breaches of the Commandements of Faith, then of other commands? They think misbelief to be but a <hi>Zoar,</hi> a little sin. And it proceedeth either from this, that the convictions of other sins (as the neglect of prayer, or the sin of swearing, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting adultery) do arise from a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: (for there is somewhat of natures light to make us abominate and hate them, when yet the light of nature will not lead us to the convictions of the sinfulnesse of misbelief, it being a Gospel and more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sin) Or it proceedeth from this, that unbelief doth ordinarily passe vail'd under the vizard of some refined vertue, as humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and tendernesse, though that rather it may be said, that it is pride and ignorance, cloathed with the garments of humility. And no doubt, Christ doth account it obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Commandement of Faith, the greatest act of humility, as is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. where it is called submission, they <hi>submitted</hi> not <hi>to the righteousnesse of God,</hi> Or else it proceedeth from this, that we conceive that the commandment of Faith, is not of so large extent as other commands, and so doth not bind us to the obedience of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. But know this, that it shall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107527:14"/>
of the world, that they have not believed on the Name of the Son of God: And no doubt, but it is Sathans great design and cardinall project, to keep us back from obedience to the commandement of Faith, and that we should not listen to the precious promises of this everlasting Gospel, but should reject the counsel of God against our selves, and refuse his precious and divine call.</p>
               <p>The second previous consideration that we would give, shall bee to show you what are the causes that there is so much disputing of our interest, and so little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving, that we are unstable as water, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our own excellency, spending so much of our time in walking under a cloud and are so seldom admitted to read our names i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

from the want of the real and spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of our desperate and lost estate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Jesus Christ, and that our unspeakable misery is the want of him; which is clear from <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more to thee:</hi> And it is evident from <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16, 18. That such a delusion as this doth overtake many, that they can reign as Kings without Jesus Christ, and that they can build their happinesse, and establish their eternal felicity upon another foundation. But, O that we could once win to this, to believe what we are without Christ, and to believe what we shall be in the enjoyment of him; with the one eye to descend and look upon these deep draughts, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of iniquity hath imprinted upon your immortal souls, and withall to reflect upon the wages of sin, which is death; and be constrained to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone:</hi> And with the other eye to ascend and look to that help that is <hi>laid upon One that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What a rediculous thing is that poor complement, that these deluded sinners used to Christ, I <hi>pray you have us excused?</hi> And is it not the world the great plea and argoment, that they make use of, When they will not come and make use of Christ?</p>
               <p>IV. There is this lastly, which doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct ones coming to Christ, their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to be denyed to their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: Which is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 23. And wee conceive if once these two were believed (which are the great Tropicks, out of which all these arguments may be brought to perswade you to imbrace Christ) to wit, the infinite excellency of His person on whom we are to believe, and the infinite losse that these do sustain, who shall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejected of him. We might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to entertain a divine abstractednesse and holy retirement from all things that are here below, and to pitch our desires alone upon him, <hi>who is the everlasting wonder of Angels, and the glory of the higher House.</hi> O did we once suppose the unspeakable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these whose Faith is now advanced unto everlasting felicity and fruition, and hath entered into that eternal possession of the promises: might we not he constrained to cry out, <hi>It is good for us once to be there?</hi> Christ weepeth to us in the Law, but we do not lament: and he pypeth to us in the Gospel, but we do not dance: He is willing to draw us <hi>with the cords of men, and with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107527:18"/>
the bonds of love, and yet we will not have him to reign over us.</hi> May not Angels laugh at our folly, that wee should so undervalue this Prince of love, and should contemn him who is holden in so high esteem and reverence in these two great Assemblies that are above, of Angels, and of the spirits of just men made perfect? Christ hath now given us the first and second Summonds, the day is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the sad and wofull summonds shall be sent against us, of <hi>departing from him, into these everlasting flames,</hi> out of which there is no redemption: and this shall be the cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of our misery, that we had once life in offer, but did refuse it; And though there were four gates standing open toward the north, by which we might have entered into that everlasting rest, yet we choosed rather <hi>to walk in the paths that lead down to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take hold of the chambers of hell.</hi> O but there are many that think the Gospel cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly devised fables and foolishnesse, (they being unwilling to believe that which sense cannot comprehend, nor reason reach) and this is the reason why the Gospel is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, but is rejected as a humane invention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a morning dream, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THere are three great and cardinall mysteries, in the unfolding of which, all a Christians time ought to be spent. First, There is that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and everlasting mystery of Christs love and condiscendency, which those intellectual spirits, the Angels, are not able fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Secondly, There is that woefull mystery of the desperate deceitfulnesse and wickednesse of the heart, which no man was ever yet able fully to fathom and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. And, thirdly, there is that precious mystery of that eternal felicity and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that is purchased unto the Saints, that once they shall reign with Christ, not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years only, but throughout all the ages of everlasting and endless eternity: so that there is this difference betwixt the Garden of everlasting delights, that Christ hath purchased to the Saints, and that first Paradise and Eden wherein man was placed: There was a secret gate in the first, thorow which a man that had once entered in, might go out again; But in this second and precious Eden, there is no accesse for going out. And all that is to be known of these three mysteries, is much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107527:19"/>
comprehended in this, to know that they cannot fully be known; <hi>Paul</hi> was a blessed proficient in the study of the first mystery, and had almost attained to the highest Classe of knowledge, and yet he is constrained to professe himself to bee ignorant of this: Hence is that word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>That ye may know the love of Christ, which passeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> And is it not a mysterious command, to desire people to know that which cannot be known? The meaning whereof we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be this in part, that <hi>Paul</hi> pressed this upon them, that they should study to know that this mystery of Christs love could not be known. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed proficient in the knowledge and study of the second mystery, he had some morning and twilight discoveries of that, and yet though in some measure he had fat homed that deep; yet he is constrained to cry out, chap. 17. vers. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And indeed, that which <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of Kings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 3. may well be said of all men in this respect, <hi>The heavens for heighth, and the earth for depth, and the heart of man is unsearchable.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also was a blessed proficient in the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the third mystery, having some mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and twilight discoveries of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised rest, and was once caught up to the third heavens, and yet when he is beginning to speak of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. he declareth all men to be ignorant of the knowledge of this profound mystery of mans blessednesse, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107527:19"/>
cryeth out, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And if there bee any thing further to bee known of these mysteries, the grace of Faith is found worthy among all the graces of the Spirit, <hi>To open the seven seals</hi> of these great deeps of God. Is not the grace of Faith that whereby a Christian doth take up the invisible excellency and vertue of a dying Christ? Is not Faith that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace by which a Christian must take up the sports and blemishes that are within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? And is not the grace of Faith, that precious grace that placeth a Christian upon the top of mount <hi>Pisga,</hi> and there letteth him see a sight of the promised Land? And doth open a door in Heaven, thorow which a Christian is admitted to see Christ sitting upon His Throne? And Faith hath not only a kind of Omnipotency; as is clear, <hi>That all things are possible to them that believe:</hi> but it hath a kind of Omnisciency, and all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it can take up and comprehend the greatest mysteries of heaven, according to that word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 5. <hi>He that seeketh the Lord shall understand all things,</hi> As if hee said, there is nothing dark to a believing Christian, as there is nothing impossible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> believing Christian. As likewise, Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that grace that must take aside the vail that is spread over the face of a crucified Christ. And Faith is that precious spy that goeth forth, and taketh up these wonderfull excellencies, that are in him. The grace
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107527:20"/>
of love, as it were, is born blind, and it hath nothing wherewith to solace it self, but that which is presented unto it by this noble and excellent grace of Faith.</p>
               <p>Now before wee shall speak any thing to these things that wee did propose to speak of it at the last occasion: wee shall yet speak a little unto some things which are necessary to be known, for the distinct up taking of the nature of justifying Faith; which is the great commandement of this everlasting Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and that which wee would first speak to shall be this. What is the reason and ground that the Gospel conveyance of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and life, (and of the excellent things of this everlasting Covenant) should be through the exercise of the grace of Faith? For it is not said in the Scripture that repentance justifieth, that love justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, or that mortification justifieth; but it is Faith only that justifieth, and it is Faith by which a Christian inheriteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, so that is clear, that Faith is that Conduit-pype, through which are conveyed to us the great blessings of this everlasting Covenant.</p>
               <p>I. And the first ground of it is this, it is through <hi>Faith, that all our blessings may be known to be by love, and by free and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace;</hi> as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. While the Apostle is giving a reason why the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is conveyed to a Christian through Faith; <hi>It is of faith</hi> (saith he) <hi>that it might be of grace:</hi> for if the inheritance were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to a Christian through a Covenant of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107527:20"/>
Works, then these spotlesse draughts of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, and of unsearchable grace, should not be written on our inheritance, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. And it is that great designe of Christ, to make his grace conspicuous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying salvation to us through Faith.</p>
               <p>II. There is this second ground likewise of it, that all the promises and blessings of this everlasting Covenant might be sure and stedfast to us, therefore they are conveyed to us through the exercise of the grace of Faith; as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>They are of Faith</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they might be sure:</hi> or as the word is, <hi>that they might be settled,</hi> when the promises of life and of eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were conveyed to us through mans obedience, were they not then most uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unstable? But is not heaven your everlasting crown now, stedfast unto you, seeing you have that golden pillar of Christs everlasting righteousnesse to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Faith, and the strength of your confidence in the day of need?</p>
               <p>III. There is this third ground why the promises and excellent things of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are conveyed to a Christian through the exercise of Faith, that all boasting and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation might be excluded, according to that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>By what law is boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded? Not by the law of works, but by the law of Faith.</hi> And certainly, seeing Christians have all the great things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conveyed to them through the exercise of Faith; think yee not, that this shall be your first song when yee shall be within the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107527:21"/>
gates of that new Jerusalem? <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thee doth belong the glory of our salvation.</hi> O what a precious dignity were it, but for one half hour to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear these spotlesse songs that are sung by these thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy Angels, that are round about His Throne! Doth not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that sweet singer of Israel, now sing more sweetly no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he did while he was here below? Doth not deserted <hi>Heman</hi> now chaunt forth the praises and everlasting song of him that sitteth upon the Throne? And doth not afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> now sing sweetly after his captivity is reduced, and he <hi>entered within that land, where the voice of joy and gladnesse is continually heard?</hi> Would ye have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Heaven? I could give it no tearm so suitable as this, Heaven is a rest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rest, for though there remain a rest for the righteous, yet <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>These four beasts that stand before the Throne, they rest not night nor day, crying, holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty;</hi> yet there is much divine quietnesse in that holy unquietnesse that is above.</p>
               <p>IV. There is this last ground why the blessings of the Gospel, and life and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse are conveyed to us thorow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Faith, that the way to attain to these things might be pleasant and easie; we are certainly perswaded, that the way of winning to Heaven by a Covenant of Works was much more unpleasant and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. But is it not an easie way of <hi>entring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107527:21"/>
into the holy of Holies,</hi> to win unto it through the exercise of Faith? <hi>Are not all wisdoms wayes pleasantnesse, and are not all her paths peace?</hi> Was not that just self-denial in one, that said, he would not take up a Crown though it were lying at his foot. But oh that cursed self-denial doth possesse the breasts of many; so that though that Crown of immortal Glory and eternal blessednesse be lying at your feet, yet ye will not imbrace it, nor take it up. Is not the hatred of many to Christ covered with deceit, and therefore, <hi>Your iniquity shall be declared before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that what we have spoken upon this, might be more clear, and that the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustifying Faith be not mistaken, We would have you taking notice of these things.</p>
               <p>1. That the grace of Faith doth not justifie Christian, as it is a work; or because of any inherent excellency and dignity that is in this grace, above any other graces of the Spirit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the precious object of it, the righteousness of Christ. And to clear this, we would only have you knowing this, That Faith doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifie, as it closeth with Christ; but not because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap>ity or worth in the act of Faith, in closing with Christ that can be the foundation of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustification, else it were to confound that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious decreet of free grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107527:22"/>2. There is this that we would have you all knowing; That Faith is not the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Justification, (as Justification is taken in an active sense,) though it is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Justification, as it is taken in a passive sense: and the ground of this conclusion is this, because it is impossible that any action in man can be an instrument of any action in God: And therefore that phrase that you have so ordinarily spoken of, <hi>That Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,</hi> it is thus to be resolved, <hi>That we are justified by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There is this that we would have you knowing, that betwixt a Christians closing by Faith with the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, and the justification of a sinner, I say, there is no natural and indispensible connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two: but onely there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of divine appointment, and of free grace, though we conceive there is a natural aptitude in the grace of Faith, to lay hold on the righteousnesse of Christ, more then there is in any other grace of the Spirit, as ye may see there is a more natural aptitude and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the hand to receive then in any other organ of the body.</p>
               <p>4. There is this also that we would have you knowing, that a Christian in his first clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Christ, Christ (considered as cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) is the immediate object of his Faith, and not Christ considered in his personal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. Hence it is often in Scripture, that Christ as crucified, is holden forth as the immediate object of justifying Faith; as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5, 24, 25. And the ground
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107527:22"/>
of this assertion is this, because that it is the formall object of justifying Faith, which doth formally justifie the sinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and on which Faith doth immediately lay hold as a ransome to satisfie justice, and as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in which the soul dare venture to be found when it shall stand before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of God; And certainly, this is Christ as obedient to the death of the crosse. And it is likewise clear, that the thing which doth engage the soul to Christ, is not onely because he is good in himself, but because he is good to us.</p>
               <p>5. And there is this lastly, that we would have you knowing, That though faith doth alone justifie, yet Faith doth not justifie being alone: Hence is that which we have so often in Schooles, <hi>Fides justificat solum, licet non solitariè,</hi> that Faith justifieth alone, though not being alone; as <hi>Iames</hi> doth speak, <hi>Faith without works is dead, and is of no effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which secondly we shall speak to, shall be this; To point out to you some differences betwixt justifying Faith, which is in a real Believer, and temporary Faith which is in an Hypocrite, and one that is destitute of that everlasting hope, though he do pretend to have it.</p>
               <p>And first, That there is such a thing as temporary Faith, is clear from <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13. It is said there of some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That they believed for a season,</hi> yea, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13. It is said of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (who was in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, and in the bond of iniquity) <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:107527:23"/>
And these in <hi>Ioh</hi> 2. 23. <hi>When they did behold the miracles, they believed on Iesus Christ:</hi> and yet we conceive, that their faith was not sincere, and so this was not saving Faith. And indeed ye may see a difference betwixt these two in the very name <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> for this is such a Faith as doth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long with him that hath it, but doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and passe away; for as this is certain, <hi>that an hypocrite will not always call upon God, Iob</hi> 27. 10. So that is also certain, that a hypocrite will not alwayes believe in God. I tell you, that the longest time a hypocrite doth keep his Faith, <hi>Iob</hi> hath set down in his 18. Chap. vers. 14. <hi>Their hope</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall bring them to the king of terrours, and then it shall be rooted out of them and their tabernacle;</hi> their faith will bring them no further then the gates of death, and then their faith will flee away as a dream, and evanish as a vision of the night.</p>
               <p>II. There is this difference likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, That temporary Faith, it clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with Christ as a Saviour, and for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but it closeth not with Christ as a Prince, and for Sanctification; but justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith taketh Christ as well for a Prince, as it taketh him for a Saviour: and if <hi>Solomon</hi> did discern who was the true Mother of the childe by that, that she who would have the childe divided, was not the mother of the childe; so we may say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they who would divide Christ in his Offices, it is an evidence that they are not among these who are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made partakers of the Adoption of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107527:23"/>
there is somewhat of this pointed at in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 66. where that which made many who were his disciples (and did once believe) desert him, was because of the hardnesse of his command, <hi>This is an hard saying, who can hear it?</hi> And it is certain that it is a greater difficulty for a Christian to take Christ as a Prince, then as a Saviour: for by that he must make an absolute resignation of himself over to Chrrst, never to be reduced. O when saw you such a sight of Christ, that ye were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to cry our (without a complement) to him; <hi>Truly I am thy servant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi> O were ye never <hi>ravished with one of his eyes,</hi> nor overtaken <hi>with one chain of his neck?</hi> Believe me, they who see him thus, do believe that <hi>His commands are not grievous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. There is this difference, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith is attained unto, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Law, but justifying Faith is not attained to without some measure of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Law: this is clear, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 5. where speaking of these temporary believers, it is said of them, <hi>that the fruit did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spring up, &amp;c.</hi> Are there not some (it may be here) who think they do believe, and yet were never in any measure trembling under the discovering &amp; condemning power of the Law? Is not that a mystery, that one should bring forth without travelling? And is not this a mystery in Christianity, that one should believe before he hath found the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs of the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>birth. I am afraid of this, that many of us have taken up our Religion at our foot: for there are many who take up Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107527:24"/>
Religion take them up. But would ye know the properties of a Christians Faith? <hi>It is a begotten Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 2. and not a Faith that is taken up at our pleasure: And I would only say these two things to you, be perswaded of this, that hypocrisie may be spun with a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p small threed: so that the most discerning Christian cannot take up that desperate enmity that is in them. How long did <hi>Iudas</hi> lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k under the name of a Saint, even with these that were most discerning? And there is this that we would say, that among all these <hi>that shall be eternally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> Hypocrites in Sion shall have the bitterest cup of Divine indignation presented unto them. Hence it is, that Christ, when he would tell the worst company that one shall have in hell, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes this: ye shall go to that place where hypocrites and sinners are: and so it would be of your concernment, that by the candle of the Lord ye would <hi>search the inward parts of the belly, before ye go down to the grave with a lie in your right hand; a deceiving heart having turned you aside.</hi> We confesse it is sad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these anxious disappointments that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in those dayes shall once meet with.</p>
               <p>IV. But there is this last difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt justifying Faith, and temporary Faith, That there are three precious effects of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, which a temporary believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not win to.</p>
               <p>1. To be denyed to all his enjoyments and attainments, and walk humbly under them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107527:24"/>
for we may say, that it is impossible for an hypocrite to be denyed to his enjoyments, he maketh such a deity of them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships them, or rather he worshippeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in them. There are three great graces that a hypocrite doth pursue after, (though he rather seeketh them as gifts than as graces:) Knowledge, Prayer, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And though it be but little that he can attain of any of the three, (or rather nothing in a saving way) yet least of all can he attain to the last, yea, we may judge that there is alwayes within his bosome a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conviction, that he could never win unto that gracious grace of humility. O could ye never win to this, to count your own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse as filthy rags, and to rejoice alone in the righteousnesse of a crucified Saviour? I would press this upon you by the way (O Christians of this generation) forget your perfections; and remember your imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; have a holy oblivion of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, but have a Divine remembrance of your short comings, look more to what is before unperfected, nor to what is behind, and thus shall you evidence true justifying Faith.</p>
               <p>2. It is an effect of justifying Faith to be under some constant and Divine impression of the preciousnesse of Jesus Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that word, 1 Pet. 2. 7. <hi>To you who believe, Christ is precious;</hi> It is not said, that Christ was precious, or shall be precious, but it is said, <hi>He is precious,</hi> which doth import, (as we use to speak) a continued act; Did ye
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107527:25"/>
never know what it was to dwell twenty four hours under the impression of the matchlesse excellency and precious worth of a crucified Saviour? I will pose you with this. Are there not some here (and elsewhere) that passe under the notion of Saints, that never knew what it was to dwell half an hour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these high and elevaring thoughts of the preciousnesse of Jesus Christ? So that wee professe we cannot tell whether we shall call him precious or undervalued: but wee may conjoyn these two names together; that he is precious (and yet) undervalued Christ.</p>
               <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By true justifying Faith, a Christian winneth to mortification of his invisible and predominant lusts, which is impossible for a temporary Believer to win to. And is there not a great difference betwixt an Idol when it is cast out, and an Idol when it goeth out? I will tell you the great mortification of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, the devil was living in them as one that was a black one, and now hee cometh again and transformeth himself into an Angel of light: He was living in them before by his spirit of prosanity, and now hee liveth in them by the spirit of hypocrisie, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting of these things that were never clear attainments, while it is the noble dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>To purifie the heart.</hi> But are there not many here who never knew what it was to mortifie one lust for Christ? Can such a delusion overtake you O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>athiests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ye shall reign with Christ, if ye die not with him? There is an opinion vented in these dayes, that there may be repentance in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107527:25"/>
heaven, and I think it would seem that the Christians of this age have much of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we are so little in repentance while we are here below: but know that Faith and Sanctification are two inseparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And let me tell you, if ye would know the compend of the precious exercise of Faith? It is this, Faith hath three great things, that it perpetually contemplates and views. 1. Faith looketh to the promise, and there it doth rejoyce and rest upon it. 2. Faith looketh to the duties that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and there it cryeth out, <hi>Here am I, I will obey and hearken unto the voice of the word.</hi> And, 3. Faith looketh to the crown, and there it doth exult and sweetly rejoyce in divine expectation. And O what a sight is that, to behold that everlasting Prince standing at the end of our race, having a crown in his right hand, with this Motto ingraven on it, <hi>Hee that persevereth to the end shall be saved?</hi> And what a Faith suppose yee shall it be thought when wee shall get on that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Crown of blessednesse? What think ye is the exercise of these that are above? O heaven, heaven, if we did know it, would we not be in a holy extasie of desire, till we were there! And blessed be he eternally, that hath purchased that precious felicity to us.</p>
               <p>Now we shall at this time shut up our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, by speaking a little to these things, in which a Christian doth ordinarily meet with assurance of his interest in God, and is put to the divine actings of the grace of Faith, for there are some sealing times to a Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107527:26"/>I. The first time of the sealing is, after the mortification of some predominante lust and idol, then they are admitted to read their names in these precious and ancient records of heaven, and to see (in these Books) their unworthy names written by the hand of that everlasting Prince. This is clear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, that no man knows, saving he that receiveth it.</hi> And from that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Believe mee, more mortification would make more believing, but would ye know the original of misbelief? It is the want of exercise of spiritual mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our lusts. I know not where the most part of us intendeth to lodge at night, but this is certain, that wee live with much contentment with our lusts, and these predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant idols that doth so much possesse us.</p>
               <p>II. It is readily a sealing time to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, when hee is admitted to the divine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of these satisfying delights that are to be found in Christ: When was it that the Spouse cryed out so often, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his?</hi> Was it not <hi>when she was brought to the banqueting house, and his banner over her was love?</hi> Believe mee, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with an absent Christ, would make more intimation (in a divine manner) of our peace with him: wee desire to blesse these that are above the reach of all these disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and questionings that wee are so much subject unto.</p>
               <p>III. This is a sealing time to a Christian, when hee is much in the exercise <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

Prayer, and of much conversing, and corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with God in that duty, as is clear from that word in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. when <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying at the evening oblation, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

would ye know the compend of a Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exercise of the Law: that it is the way to win to much establishment in the Faith, when once we begin to close with Christ. O Christians, would ye know that which maketh the superstructure and building of grace to be within you, <hi>as a bowing wall and as a tottering fence?</hi> (So that oftentimes y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are in hazard to raze the foundation) it is this, Yee were not under the exercise of the Law before your believing in Jesus Christ. There are some who do not abide three dayes at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and these shall not dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>II. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exercise of the Law, it maketh Christ precious to a mans soul. What is that which filleth the soul of a Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with many high and excellent thoughts of Christ? Is it not this, to have the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrating our Band, and putting us (as we use to speak) to the horn? that is, to have the Law cursing us, and using the sentence of condemnation against us. That which maketh us have such low and undervaluing thoughts of precious Christ, is, because
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107527:29"/>
the most part of us are not acquainted with the deep and serious exercise of the Law: that is a mystery to the most part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians practice. Ye know that there were four streams which went out from the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of God, into which man was first placed: And so we may say, that there are four golden streams, by which lost and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed man is brought back again to this Eden and Paradise of everlasting delights. First, there is the precious stream of Christs righteousnesse, by which we must be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And secondly, There is that stream of his Sanctification, by which we must be purified. Thirdly, There is that stream of the Wisedom of Christ, by which we must be conducted through this wildernesse wherein we have lost our way. And fourthly, There is that stream of Christs Redemption, by which we must be delivered from the power of our enemies, and must turn the Battel in the gate. It is by the Redemption of Christ that we shall once sing that triumphant song, <hi>O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> O but all these streams will be sweat and refreshing to a soul that is hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued by the Law. So long as we see not the uglinesse of our leprosie in the glasse of the Law, we have our own <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> that we think may do our turn: but when once our case is truly laid open to us, then will we be content to wash our selves in <hi>Iordan</hi> seven times.</p>
               <p>III. There is this advantage that waiteth on the deep exercise of the Law, that it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107527:30"/>
maketh a Christian live constantly under the impression of the sinfulnesse of sin. What is it that maketh sin exceeding sinfull to a Christian? Is it not this, He hath been fourty dayes in <hi>Moses</hi> School? And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the ground why such fools as we make a mock of sin, is, because we know not what it is to be under the power of his wrath and the apprehensions of the indignation of God.</p>
               <p>But now to come to that which we intend to speak of: We told you, at the first occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we spake upon these words, that there were many excellent things concerning the grace of Faith, holden forth in them. The first thing (which was holden forth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this radicall grace of Faith) was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite advantage that redoundeth to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an through the exercise of Faith, and giving obedience to this command: which we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be holden forth, not onely from the scope, but also from the nature of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And now to speak a little to the point, we shall propose these considerations, that may abundantly shew how advantagious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thing this excellent grace of Faith is.</p>

The first Consideration, that speaketh it, is this, That Faith maketh Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to a soul, according to that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To you that believe, Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> And we would have you knowing this, that Faith maketh Christ more precious to a soul, nor sense, or any other thing can make him. And first, Faith maketh Christ more precious nor sense, because the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107527:30"/>
which the grace of Faith hath of Christ, it is builded upon the excellency of his Person: but the estimation of sense it is builded upon the excellency of his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: so that, because he is such to them, therefore they love and esteem him. But that Heroick grace of Faith, it taketh up the excellency of Christs person, and that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him precious to them. Secondly, Faith makes Christ more precious then sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sense looketh to that love which Christ manifesteth in his Face, and in his Hands, and in his Feet: but Faith looketh to that love which is in his heart. Sense will cry forth, <hi>Who is like to thee? whose countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the Cedar: whose hands are as gold rings, set with Beryl, and whose legs are like pillars of Marble set in sokets of Gold.</hi> Sense will look to the smylings of Christ, and will wonder; it will look to his dispensations and actings, and will be constrained to cry out, <hi>Who is like unto thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But the grace of Faith solaceth it self in the Fountain from whence all these springs and sweet inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love do flow. Thirdly, Faith maketh Christ more precious then Sense; because Faith looketh not only to what Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, but unto what Christ is from eternity before time, and what Christ shall be unto eternity after time; But sense onely doth look to what Christ is presently. And ye must conceive, that the sweet travelling of Faith betwixt infinite love from eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and infinite love unto eternity after,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107527:31"/>
must make Faith to fall in a sea of wondering, and raiseth the thoughts to the highest pito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of desire and estimation. Fourthly, We may likewise adde, that the impression of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse of Christ, which sense maketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soul, it is not so constant, not so single, as that which faith doth make. O but the grace of Faith giveth the Christian a broad look of Christ, and letteth him see Christ cloathed with ornaments of Glory, and divine Majesty. Sense followeth Christ rather that it might see his Miracles; and Love, that it may be fed with Loaves; but Faith follows Christ for himself above all.</p>
               <p>II. The second consideration to speak the advantage of it, is, that the grace of Faith, it hath, as it were, an arbitrary power with God; so that <hi>whatsoever a Christian shall seek in Faith, hee shall receive it.</hi> It is the noble gift that was once given to Faith, that it should never seek any thing and bee denyed, according to that word in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ye shall receive it:</hi> And that word in Joh. 15. 7. <hi>Abide in me,</hi> that is, <hi>believe,</hi> and the <hi>promise</hi> is annexed to this, <hi>whatsoever ye shall ask, yee shall receive:</hi> And it is clear likewise from the preceeding verse to our Text, that if we obey this command of Faith, <hi>Whatsoever we shall ask of God, we shal receive it.</hi> And I would speak these two things to you from this. First, That oftentimes Christ putteth a blank in a Christians hand, who is much in the exercise of Faith, according to that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 32. Is there not an ample
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107527:31"/>
blank put into that mans hand, <hi>What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?</hi> Christ desireth him to fill up that blank with what he would; And secondly, There is this which is one of the greatest steps of Christs matchlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendency, that oftentimes when his own have sought in their presumption a blank to be put in their hand, Christ condescendeth to give it, according to that strange passage in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 35, 36. The two disciples who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this desire to Christ, We desire, say they, <hi>That whatsoever we ask, thou shall give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us,</hi> and presently that is answered, <hi>What will ye that I should do for you?</hi> Christ hath an infinite good will to satisfie the desires of his own: and that which yet more speaketh out Christs boundlesse good will, to satisfie the desires of all that belong to him; It may be cleared in that word, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 24. Where he chargeth his Disciples with this, <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> (saith he) <hi>have ye asked me nothing;</hi> ye must not suppose that <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> never sought a sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Christ, but the meaning of that expression is this, ye sought nothing in comparison of that, which I was willing to give, and which your necessity did call for at my hands, which ye should have sought.</p>
               <p>III. There is this third consideration to point out the advantage of Faith, It is that grace, that keepeth all the graces of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in life and exercise; Faith is that higher wheel, at the motion of which, all the lower wheels do move; If so wee may speak, Faith is that <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107527:32"/>
first moves and turns about all these lower graces of the Spirit, according to that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Adde to your faith, vertue, and to your vertue, patience, and to your patience, brotherly kindnesse.</hi> First, The grace of Faith keepeth in exercise the grace of Love, as is clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 17. where these two Graces are conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As likewise from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. compared with <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>Being justified by faith.</hi> Then this effect followeth upon it, <hi>The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts:</hi> And so it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Faith keepeth Love in Life. Faith (being the Spy of the soul, and that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer, and precious Messenger) it goeth out, and bringeth in objects unto Love, Faith draweth aside the vail, and love sitteth down and solaceth it self in the discoveries of Faith. Secondly, The grace of Faith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it keepeth the grace of Mortification in exercise: as is clear not only from <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 6. but from 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>This is our victory whereby we overcome the world, even our faith;</hi> And it is certain, that Faith keepeth morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in exercise, and advanceth holinesse, not only because of this, that Faith is that grace that presenteth to a Christian the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute purity and spotlesse holinesse of Jesus Christ: but also because it maketh them esteem their idols tastlesse as the white of an egge, and they become unto them as their sorrowfull meat. The best principle of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is this, the discoveries of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible vertues of Jesus Christ. That mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iseth from the lovely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the excellency of Jesus Christ, is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107527:32"/>
most real and abiding, as these waters which riseth from the highest springs are not onely constant, but likewise most deep and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Thirdly, Faith likewise hath influence upon mortification, as it doth take hold of that infinit strength that is to Christ, by which a Christian is inabled to mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ifie his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith likewise maketh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication <hi>of the bloud of sprinkling,</hi> by which wee are purified from dead works. Fifthly, Likewise the grace of Faith keepeth in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the grace of Humility, as is clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>By what Law,</hi> saith he, <hi>is boasting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded? It is not by the Law of Works, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> Sixthly, Faith keepeth in exercise the grace of joy, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy, and peace in believing:</hi> So that ye see the proper fruit of Faith is, <hi>joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> And certainly, did wee believe more, wee should rejoyce more. Seventhly, and lastly, Faith keepeth in exercise the grace of hope: for it is impossible for hope to bee in lively exercises, except Faith once bee exercised: which may bee a shame unto you; For how can wee hope to attain the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, except our faith first close with the promise? So there is this difference betwixt the grace of Faith, and the grace of Hope: the grace of Faith closeth with the promises, but the grace of Hope, it closeth with the thing that is promised.</p>
               <p>IV. There is this fourth Consideration, that may speak out the excellency of the grace of Faith; It is that grace, by which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107527:33"/>
a Christian doth attain to most divine fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and constant correspondency with Heaven. Would yee have that question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and determined, What is the best way, <hi>Not to stir up our beloved, nor awake him untill he please?</hi> It is this, be much in the grace of Faith: this is clear from <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith:</hi> By the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of all other graces, Christ is but a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer, <hi>That turneth aside to tarry but for a night;</hi> but by the exercise of this grace, he cometh to take up house with us. I will tell you what faith is, It is a ladder that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth betwixt heaven and earth: by the steps of which, a Christian doth daily go up to heaven, and converse with the higher House. Faith is that grace, (as the Apostle speaketh) by which wee have accesse to the Throne of his grace. Faith ushers in the Believer to the Throne: and without it hee cannot have accesse there, nor joy when he is there.</p>
               <p>V. Here is this advantage that attendeth the exercise of Faith; A believing Christian is a praying Christian: according to that word in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. where these two are conjoyned together, <hi>Lord, I believe:</hi> and then hee falleth to his prayer presently after that confession, <hi>Help thou my unbelief.</hi> And it is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1. <hi>O God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou art my God, early will I seek thee, my soul thirsteth for thee.</hi> And sometimes Faith is a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient grace: but we may alwayes say of it, that it is a most diligent grace. Oh is it not the neglect of this precious exercise of faith and of the duty of secret Prayer, that makes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107527:33"/>
our leannesse testisie to our Face, and maketh our souls as a barren wildernesse? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of this, (that since Christ had any followers, and since ever this everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t is <hi>to rise at mid-night and call upon God, and to inquire after our Maker under the silent watches of the night.</hi> O but it is a sweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>VI. There is this sixth consideration to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oint out the advantage of Faith: That Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of Christ, and this maketh a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to look upon his duty, more as his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then his duty. And we are perswaded of this, that our chariot wheel should move more swiftly, <hi>(like the chariots of Aminadab)</hi> if we were more in the exercise of the grace of Faith. Would ye know an answer to that question. What is the first most requisit for a Christian while here below? Faith; And what secondly is most requisit? Faith; And what thirdly is most requisit for a Christian? even Faith. Faith above all things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, Faith.</p>
               <p>VII. There is another advantage of it, that by Faith our service and prayers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God. Would ye know what is the prayer of a Christian that is not in Faith? <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The unbelievers sacrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> This is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered up unto God a more acceptable sacrifice then</hi> Cain; and we conceive that there are many unanswered prayers which we do put up, because we want that noble exercise of Faith.</p>
               <p>VIII. And lastly, we shall likewise add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

saw him that is invisible.</hi> Is it not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible thing, to see that, which cannot be seen? But the meaning of it is this, That Faiths discoveries of God, are as certain and sure, as the discoveries of our bodily eyes are: Faith is an intelligent grace, yea, it is a most sure and infallible grace; What will Faith not do? And what can yee do who want Faith?</p>
               <p>Now to enforce the advantages and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Faith a little more, wee shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to you the disadvantages of that wofull sin of unbelief.</p>
               <p>I. There is this disadvantage of the sin of unbelief, that all the actions that proceed from an unbeliever, they are impure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, according to that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>But unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is defiled. Their prayer is unclean:</hi> yea, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh) <hi>their plowing is sin:</hi> yea their going about the most excellent duties (for matter) is an abomination to God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>What ever is not of faith, is sin.</hi> So the want of Faith is the great polluter of all our actions and of all our performances.</p>
               <p>II. There is this second disadvantage of misbelief, that it is impossible for one in the exercise of unbelief, to mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tifie a lust or idol: and wee may allude unto these words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 20. When his disciples came to him and asked this question, <hi>Why could wee not cast out this devil?</hi> That was given as an answer, <hi>because of your unbelief:</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107527:35"/>
Unbelief is that, which taketh up arms for our idols; and doth most strongly defend them: for there is nothing that will kill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption so much, as the exercise of faith: and when that is laid aside, we have laid by our weapons, and have in a manner concluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> treaty of peace with our idols, that we shall not offend them, if they offend not us.</p>
               <p>III. There is this disadvantage that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the sin of unbelief, that such an one cannot win nor attain to the grace of <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is alwayes as the waves of the sea, tossed to and fro,</hi> untill once hee win to the exercise of Faith, as is clear from <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Except ye believe, ye shall not be established.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>V.

                  </gap> loseth the thoughts of the excellency of Christ, but also because he increaseth in his thoughts of love towards his idols; for Christ doth decrease in those who misbelieve, and their idols do increase in their love, and in their desires, and in their estimation.</p>
               <p>VI. There is this sixth disadvantage in the sin of unbelief, it hindereth the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many signall workings and tokens of the love and favour of the most High, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that sad word that is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 58. at the close, <hi>He could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</hi> Unbelief, as it were, laid a restraint on Christ, that he could not effectua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e these things which he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to perform. And (to shut up our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course at this time) I would only adde these two aggravations, which may somewhat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force what we have spoken; (I say) there are these two aggravations in the sin of unbelief, even in his own who have a right (and also his call) to believe: 1. That after Christ hath given most sensible discoveries of himself, <hi>Wherein yee have seen him,</hi> as it were, <hi>face to face,</hi> yet wee will not believe: this is clear from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 36. <hi>Though ye have seen me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>yet yee do not believe in me.</hi> There is not a manifestation of Christs presence, but it is a witnesse against you, because of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Would ye heat the voice of sense, that is rectified? It is this, believe on the Son of God. Secondly, That notwithstanding of the signal demonstrations of the power
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107527:36"/>
of Christ, yet, though it were the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some lust and idol within them, yet they will not believe, but upon new tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will doubt of his love to them. Christ preacheth faith by his Word, He preacheth faith by His fufferings, He preacheth faith by his dispensations, He preacheth faith by his promises, he preacheth faith by his rods, and if these five instruments will not ingage your hearts to believe, what can move them? Do not his two wounds in his precious hands, preach out this point of Faith, believe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth not that hole opened in his side, preach this Doctrine, <hi>That we should believe in him.</hi> And these two wounds, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his precious feet, do they not preach this, <hi>That we should believe on a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour?</hi> And we would only say this, that sometime it is the case of his own, that after the convictions of this, that it is their duty to believe, and also after some desires to close with Christ, yet they find inability to close with him. Is it not certain that to will <hi>(to believe)</hi> is sometime present with you: but how to perform ye know not? And I would have a Christian making this foursold use of such a dispensation as that, (which is most ordinarily) when convictions of our duty to believe, and some desires to close with Christ, is not followed with actual performances.</p>
               <p>1. To study to have your convictions more deeply rooted within you; for it doth sometimes follow, that resolutions and min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to believe, are not blest with actual believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107527:36"/>
because the conviction of our duty to believe, is not deeply imprinted upon your conscience.</p>
               <p>2. Be convinced of that desperate enimity (<hi>and that mystery of iniquity</hi>) that is within you, that yee can have some will to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ability to perform. Wee confesse, it is not an ordinary disease in these days, to have such a contrariety betwixt a Christians will and his practice, our will for the most part being no better then our practice; But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is, which may make you cry forth, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That ye would be much in the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, that as hee hath given you to will, so also hee might make you to do. Christ is about to convince his own in such a dispensation as that, <hi>That faith is the gift of God:</hi> Faith is so noble a grace, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be spinned out from our resolutions, nor from our endeavours; Faith is such a divine plant, <hi>as the Fathers right hand must plant in our souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Let it convince you of the excellency of the grace of Faith (for the difficulty of attaining to any thing may speak out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that thing) there is no sin but it may be easily win at; There is an easinesse and facility to overtake the paths of our idols: but the graces of the Spirit are so excellent things, that wee must fight before we attain them. And you who are strangers to Christ Iesus (and have never known what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is to close with him) wee would request
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107527:37"/>
you in Christs Name to be reconciled to him. What know ye, O men, (or rather Atheists) but this shall bee the last summonds that yee shall get to believe? And that because yee disobey this precious summonds, there shall be one presented to you that yee cannot sit. I remember of one man, who looking upon many thousands that were under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, weeped over them, when he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how that within a few years all these should be laid in their graves, and should be in eternity. O but it were much of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, to bee trying our selves how it is with us. We are not afraid that it is a breach of charity, to wish that but one of each ten that are within these doors, were heirs of the grace of life, and had the solide and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual expectation of heaven. I think, if Christ were to come presently to speak to us; hee might not onely say to each twelve that are here, <hi>One of you shall betray me:</hi> but wee are afraid, that hee would say to each twelve that are here, <hi>Eleven of you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray mee, and but one only shall passe free.</hi> O doth it not concern you, to enquire where ye shall rest at night, when the long shadows of the everlasting evening shall be stretched out upon you? I think there are some, that are so settled upon their lies, that if they were one day in hell, and saw all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are there, and were brought from it the next day to live on earth, they would not repent.

               </p>
               <p>2. Faith can believe a word of promise, notwithstanding that the dispensations of God seem to contradict it; as was clear in <hi>Iob,</hi> who professed, <hi>Hee would trust in God, though he should kill him.</hi> And no doubt, but this was the practice of believing <hi>Iacob,</hi> hee trusted that that promise should bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, <hi>That the elder should serve the younger;</hi> though all the dispensations of God, (which he did meet with) seemed to say, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise should not be accomplished.</p>
               <p>3. Faith can believe a word of promise, even when the Commands of God seem to contradict the accomplishment of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: This is clear in that singular instance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that notwithstanding hee was commanded to kill his promised seed, (upon whom he did depend the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promises) yet hee believed that

               </p>
               <p>5. And lastly, this pointeth out the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious acting of the grace of Faith, that it exerciseth it self upon an invisible object, even upon Christ not yet seen, according to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107527:42"/>
that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Whom having not seen, yet ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet believing,</hi> &amp;c. I pose the greater part of you who are here, whether or not these bee two of the greatest Paradoxes and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto you? For, is not this a mystery, to love him whom wee never saw? <hi>Whom having not seen, yet ye love:</hi> To love an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and unseen Christ, is a mystery to the most part of the world: and is not this a mystery, to believe on him whom we never saw? <hi>In whom, though ye see him not, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi> And I shall adde this, that Faith can hold fast its interest with God, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most precious Christian should call us hypocrites, and not acknowledge us, this is clear in the practice of <hi>Iob;</hi> And most clear from that word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtlesse thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of us, and</hi> Israel <hi>acknowledge us not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Thirdly, this pointeth out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the grace of Faith, that Faith, (when it is in exercise) is that grace by which a Christian doth at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain unto most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible enjoyments. There is a great question that is much debated among Christians, what is the way to win this happy length, to bee alwayes under the sweet and refreshing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of heaven, and to have his dew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes coming down upon our branches? I can give no answer to it, but this, be much in the exercise of Faith: This is clear from that notion and name put upon Faith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 22. It is called a look to Christ, which is a most sensible act. If yee would know a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107527:42"/>
description of Faith, It is this, <hi>The divine contemplation of the immortal soul, upon that divine, excellent, and precious object, Iesus Christ.</hi> For God never made Faith a liar, and therefore its eve is never off him that is the noble object of Faith, Jesus Christ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the Gospel: as it is clear, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>After ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,</hi> which preacheth out the excellent enjoyments these had after their closing with Christ who is invisible. Our Faith is called a seeing, which speaketh out this, that Faiths sight of God, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as if we did behold him with our eyes, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Moses saw him by Faith who is invisible.</hi> And we conceive that the ground which maketh the most part of us have such complaints, <hi>How long wilt thou forget us for ever?</hi> It is this; the want of the Spiritual exercise of Faith: and are there not some here who may cry out, <hi>It is more then thirty dayes since I did behold the King;</hi> Yea, there are some who may go a greater length, and cry out, <hi>I have lived these two years at Ierusalem, and yet I have not seen the Kings face?</hi> Yea, there are some here whose complaint may go a little higher, and cry forth, <hi>These three years and six moneths it hath not rained on me,</hi> but the clouds have been restrained and bound up, and the heavens have become brasse. And would you know the rise of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, it is this, ye are not much in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exercise of Faith. And to you, I would only say these two words, First, It is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107527:43"/>
easier to perswade a reprobate that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the fear of God, and in his love to God, then to perswade some such, that they are wanting to God in their Faith; for they hold fast that peece of desperate iniquity till they die, Secondly, We would say to these of you who have the valley of <hi>Achor</hi> for a door of hope, and have tasted of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, some of you will be lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; for the neglect of the duty of Faith, then for neglect of the duty of Prayer, or of the duty of keeping the Sabbath day. But I am perswaded of this, that if the noble worth of that transcendant object were known, we would have a holy impatience, untill once we did believe.</p>
               <p>IV. Fourthly, This also pointeth out the excellency of the grace of Faith, It is that grace by which a Christian is advanced to the highest and most inconceivable pitch of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that is, To be the child of the living God: As is clear, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received (or believed in him) he gave power or prerogative to become the sons of God.</hi> And certainly that noble prerogative of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is much undervalued by many: And I will tell you two grounds whereon the most part of men undervalue that excellent gift of Adoption: First, They do not take up the infinit highnesse of God (and what a one He is) otherwise they would cry out with David, <hi>Seemeth it a small thing in your eyes to bee a son to the King of Kings?</hi> Secondly, We do not take up, nor understand these matchlesse Priviledges which are given to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107527:43"/>
them who are once in this estate, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, if this were believed, that <hi>he who is a servant doth not abide in the house for ever,</hi> (though he that is a Son doth) it would stir us up to more divine zeal in our persuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith.</p>
               <p>V. Fifthly, This likewise pointeth out the excellency of the grace of Faith, It is that grace, by which all other actions are pleasant to God, and are taken off our hand, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice then Cain,</hi> which must be understood even of all other duties. And that word, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> speaketh this also, That by faith we do exceedingly please him. And this is a most sad and lamentable repoof unto many who are here, that their actions do not please God, because they are not in Faith. Would ye know a description of your prayers? (ye who are hypocrites, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the knowledge of God) It is this, Your prayers are the breach of the third Command, <hi>In taking the name of the Lord in vain; for which he will not hold you guiltlesse.</hi> And would ye know what is your hearing of Sermon? <hi>It is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> according to that word in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>To the unbelieving and impure, nothing is clean.</hi> And as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth speak, <hi>The plowing of the wicked is sin:</hi> So that all your actions that ye go about, are but an offence to the Majesty of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now we would speak to these two things before we proceed to the evidences of faith:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107527:44"/>
(to wit) First, That there is a difference betwixt the direct act of Faith, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting act of Faith. For there may be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect act of faith in a Christian, when he is not perswaded that he doth believe; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting acts of faith are these which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath, when he is perswaded in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that he doth believe. And we would secondly say, that there are many that go down to there grave under that soul destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delusion, that they are in faith, and yet never did know what faith is: I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there are many whom all the preachings in the world will never perswade, that they did never believe, their faith being born with them, and it will die with them, without any fruit. But faith being such an excellent grace, and so advantagious, (whereof we have spoken a few things) we shall speak a little further of it, First, in pointing out some evidences, by which a Christian may know, whether or not he be indeed in the Faith. Secondly, I shall give you some helps whereby Faith may be keeped in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
               <p>I. Now there is this first evidence of faith, that a Christian who doth believe, he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth absence and want of fellowship with Christ, and communion with him, one of the greatest and most lamentable crosses that ever he had: as is clear, <hi>Psalm</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mine eyes,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> that is, <hi>Let me behold, and be satisfied with thy face;</hi> and the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive that he backeth it with, is this, <hi>Lest I sleep the sleep of death. David</hi> thought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107527:44"/>
himself a dead man, if Christ did withdraw his presence from him. Also it is clear, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3, 1. (compared with the following verses) where absence from Christ, and want of communion with him, was the greatest crosse the Spouse had: and it is clear from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 11, 12, 13. where <hi>Mary</hi> had a holy disdain of all things in respect and comparison of Christ. But I will tell you what a hypocrite doth most lament, and that is, the want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among the Saints: that is the great god, and idol among hypocrites, and that which (when not enjoyed) hypocrites and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>theists lament most, the world, and the lust of their eyes: when they want these, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen they cry out, <hi>They have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</hi> They think heaven can never make up the losse of earth. And certainly, if many of us would examine our selves by this, we would finde our selves most defective. I would pose all you who are here, who have taken on a name to be followers of Christ, whether or not ye have been content to walk thirty dayes in absence from Christ, and yet never to lament it? Hath not Christ been thirty dayes and more in heaven, without a visit from you? And yet for all this, ye have not cloathed your selves with sackcloath. I will not say, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his is an undeniable evidence of the totall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome this length, hath losed much of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive love, and much of that high esteem which he ought to have of matchlesse Christ:

I think that it is the noble encouragement of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, when hee is going down to his grave, that he hath this wherewith to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I am to change my place, but not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:</hi> death to the believing Christian being a blessed transition and transportation to a more immediate, constant and uninterrupted enjoyment of God. But I believe, that if all who have the name of Believers in this generation, should go to heaven, they might have this to say, I am now not only to change my place, but also my company; For these seventy years I have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with my idols, but now I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with more blessed, divine, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent company. O that yee might be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pursue much after an absent Christ. Were it not a sweet period of our life, to breath out our last breath in his armes, and to be living in the faith of being eternally with him, which might be founded upon his Word.</p>
               <p>II. There is this second evidence of one that is in the Faith: They do endeavour to advance that necessary work of the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their idols, according to that word, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure, Act.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Faith it purifieth the heart.</hi> And concerning this evidence (lest any should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it) I would say these things to you. First, The mortification of a Christian, as long as he is here below, it doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107527:45"/>
in resolutions then attainments. It is certain, that there are high attainments of a Christian, in the mortification of his idols, but his resolutions go far above his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Secondly, Wee would say this, That those Christians who never came this length in Christianity, to make that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal conclusion, and full resolution, <hi>What have I to do any more with idols?</hi> They may suspect themselves, that they are not in the Faith: for a Christian that is in Christ, he is universal in resolutions, though he be not so in practice, but defective in performances. A Christian may have big resolutions with weak performances; for resolution will be at the gate of heaven, before practice come from the borders of hell; there being a long distance betwixt resolution and practice; and the one much swifter then the other. And thirdly, Wee would likewise say, That yee who never did know what it was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour (by prayer and the exercise of other duties) the mortification of your lusts and idols; yee may bee afraid, that ye have not yet the hope of seeing him as he is, And I would say this to many, who are settled upon their lies, and who never did know what it was to spend one hour in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer for mortifying an idol, that they would beware lest that curse bee past in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against them; <hi>I would have purged you, and yee would not be purged, therefore yee shall not bee purged any more till you die;</hi> that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of refusing to commune with Christ in the work of secret mortification, I say,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107527:46"/>
that <hi>iniquity shall not be purged away.</hi> And we would once seriously desire you, by that dreadful sentence that Christ shall passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, and by the love ye have to your immortal souls, and by the pains of these everlasting torments of hell, that ye would seriously set about the work of spirituall mortification; that so ye may evidence that ye have believed, and that ye have the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforting hope of eternal life. I would onely speak this one word to you, (and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you seriously to ponder it,) What if within twelve hours hereafter a summonds were given to you (without continuation of dayes) to compear before the solemn and dreadfull Tribunal of that impartial Judge, Jesus Christ: What suppose ye, would be your thoughts? Will ye examine your own conscience, what ye think would be your thoughts, if such summonds were given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. I am perswaded of this, <hi>That your knees would smite one against another, and your face should gather palenesse,</hi> seeing your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would condemn you, <hi>That ye had been weighed in the ballance and found light:</hi> O think ye that ye can both fight and triumph in one day? Think ye that ye can fight and overcome in one day? Think ye your lusts and unmortified corruptions so weak and faint hearted an enemy, that upon the first appearance of such imaginary champions (as most part of us are in our own eyes) that your idols would lay down arms and let you trample on them? Believe me, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a work of one day, or one year,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107527:46"/>
but it is a work will serve you all your time, begin as soon as ye will: And therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have spent your dayes in the works of the flesh, it is time that now yee would begin and pursue after him, whose works is with him, and whose reward shall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>III. Now there is this third evidence, by which a Christian may know whether he bee in the Faith or not, and it is, that Christ is matchlesse and incomparable unto such an one, according to that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To you that believe Christ is precious,</hi> and that word that <hi>Luke</hi> hath in his 7. Chap. at the close, <hi>That shee to whom much was forgiven, loved much.</hi> Now lest this likewise should prove a discouragement to any, I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have you taking notice of this, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may bee a Believer, and yet want the sensible discoveries of this, that Christ is matchlesly precious to him: but this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they which are in the lively exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Faith, it is impossible then for them not to esteem Christ matchlesse, and I would speak this likewise to many who are here; Have yee not been living these ten years in Faith, and I would pose you with this, Esteem yee not your idols more matchlesse then Christ, and more of worth then hee? It is impossible that there can bee any lively exercise of Faith, and not esteem CHRIST matchlesse, It is not to say it with your mouth, and contradict it with your heart will do the businesse: For if your hearts could speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, it would say, I would sell
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107527:47"/>
Christ <hi>for thirty pieces of silver:</hi> But my idols would I sell at no rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are there not many of you who love the world and its pleasures, better nor the eternity of joy? Oh, know yee not that word (O yee desperately igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Truths of God,) <hi>That he who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> And yet notwithstanding of the light of the word, yee would sell your immortal souls (with <hi>Esau) For a messe of po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tage:</hi> O but it is a poor bargain when yee have sold the eternity of joy for a passing world, and for its transitory delights! I would earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what shall be your thoughts in that day, when ye shall be standing upon the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most line betwixt time and eternity. O what will bee your thoughts at that day? but you are to follow on to an endlesse pain, (by appearance) and then yee are to leave your idols. I shall only desire, that ye may read the word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>What will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</hi> Ye shall then preach mortification to the life, though all the time of mortification shall be then cut off. O but to hear a worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, when eternity of pain is looking him in the face, (preach out concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this world) might it not perswade you that the world is a fancy and a dream that shall flee away, and shall leave you in the day of your greatest strait.</p>
               <p>IV. And there is the fourth evidence of Faith, That a Christian, who doth truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107527:47"/>
hee is that Christian who intertaineth a divine jealousie and a holy suspition of himself, whether or not he doth believe; I love not that faith which is void of fear, this was clear in the practice of believing <hi>Noah,</hi> that though by faith he built the Ark, yet hee had fear mixed with his Faith. I know that there are some who are ignorant concerning this, what it is to doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal peace; and more, it is not every one that doubteth, that certainly shal get heaven; for I think an hypocrite may doubt concerning his eternal salvation; however I think the exercise of a hypocrite under his doubtings, it is more the exercise of his judgement, then the exercise of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And I may say, That if all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Law which is preached in these dayes were narrowly searched, it would bee more the exercise of light, then the exercise of conscience, We speak these things as our doubt, which never was our exercise; and we make these things our publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise which was never our private and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber exercise. And I think that if all that a Christian did speak to God in prayer, were his exercise, he would speak lesse, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more. We would be speechlesse when wee go to God; for often if we did speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our exercise, we would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say. And certainly it is true, that often wee fall into that wofull sin, <hi>of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lying against the holy Ghost,</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lattering God with our mouth, and lying unto him with our tongue. And I shall only say these
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107527:48"/>
two words; There are some who have this for their great designe, <hi>viz.</hi> they would bee at peace with their conscience, and also they would bee at peace with their idols, they would gladly reconcile conscience and their idols together, that is their great designe. And there are some whose designe is a little more refined, they study rather to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with their conscience, then to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with God; Their great aim they shoot at, is this, to get their conscience quieted, though they know not what it is, to have the soul comforting peace of God to quiet them.</p>
               <p>V. Now, There is this last evidence of Faith, That justifying Faith is a Faith which putteth the Christian to bee much in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of these duties, by which it may bee maintained, for wee must keep Faith as <hi>the apple of our eye:</hi> Aod for that end, I would only give you these three things, by which Faith must be keeped in exercise; aud a real Christian will bee endeavouring in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to attain unto these.</p>
               <p>I. It keepeth Faith much in exercise, to bee much in marking and taking notice of the divine exercise and proofs of the love of God, wherewith a Christian doth meet, as is clear from that word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience worketh hope.</hi> I durst be bold to charge the most part that are indeed in Christ with this, that they are too little in remarking and taking notice of the experiences of his love. Yee should mark the place of your experience, and much more yee should mark
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107527:48"/>
the experience it self: as is clear from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the very place where Christians did meet with experience, in such ane enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they marked it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>By the rivers of Chebar the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God:</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 30. <hi>Iacob called the place Peniel,</hi> the place of living, after seeing of the face of God: it was so remarkable unto him. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ye would mark these two things mainly in your practice. First, Ye would mark (if ye can possibly) the first day of your closing with Christ, and of your coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and we may allude unto that command (if not more then allude unto it) in. <hi>Dent.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passeover unto the Lord thy God: For in the moneth of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> And secondly, We would have you much in marking these experiences which have increased your Faith, and which have strengthned your love, and which have made you mortifie your idols. These are experiences especially to be marked.</p>
               <p>2. Faith is keeped in exercise, and we win to the lively assurance of our interest in God: which we would presse upon you, by being much in the exercise of secret prayer. O but many loveth much to pray when abroad, who never loved to pray when alone. And that is a desperate sign of hypocrisie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5. It is said of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, <hi>They love to pray, standing in the Synagogues, and in the corner of the street<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107527:49"/>
that they might be seen of men:</hi> But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said of these persons, that they love to pray alone, onely they loved to pray in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues: but it is secret, and retired prayer, by which Faith must be keeped in exercise.</p>
               <p>3. And there is this likewise that we would presse, upon you, that ye would be much in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> studying communion and fellowship with God, that so your Faith may be keeped in life. And O what a blessed life were it, each day to be taken up to the top of the mount <hi>Pisga,</hi> and there to behold that promised land, to get a refreshfull sight of the Crown every morning, which might make us walk with joy all alongs that day!

faith shall once prove a delusion, and flie away as a dream in the night. But let us stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this excellent grace of true and saving Faith, which shall be a precious remedy against all those Christ-destroying and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying evils.</p>
               <p>But now to come to that which we did propose thirdly to be spoken of from the words, which was the sweetnesse of this grace of Faith; no doubt, it is a pleasant command, and it maketh all commands plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, it is that which casteth a divine lustre upon the most hard sayings of Christ, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Christian to cry forth, <hi>God hath spoken in his holinesse, I will rejoyce.</hi> Wee need not stand long to clear that Faith is a sweet and refreshing command; for it is oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture to the advantage of this grace, and unspeakable joy and heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light are the hand-maids that wait upon it. But more particularly to make it out, we shall speak to these things. The first is, That this grace giveth a Christian a broad and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive sight of Christ, and maketh him to behold not only the beauty of his actings, but the beauty of his person: and there are these three precious sights that Faith giveth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christian of Christ. First, It letteth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian see Christ in his absolute and personal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of God, as the Ancient of Dayes, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Eternity, as <hi>the expresse Image of Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and this filleth the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l with divine fear an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> admiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence is that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:107527:51"/>
                  <hi>That we see by Faith him that is invisible.</hi> As if he had said, Faith is that grace that maketh things that are invisible, visible unto us. Secondly, It letteth the soul see Christ in his relative excellencies, that is, what he is to us; Faith taketh up Christ as a Husband, and from thence we are provoked to much boldnesse and divine confidence, and withall, to see these rich possessions that are provided for us by our elder Brother, who was <hi>born for adversity:</hi> Faith taketh up Christ as a blessed <hi>Days man that did lay his hand upon us both:</hi> And from thence it is constrained to wonder at the condescendency of Christ, it taketh him up as dying, and as redeeming us from the power of the grave, and from the hands of our enemies; and this provoketh Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to make a totall and absolute resignation of themselves over unto Christ, <hi>To serve him all the dayes of our life in righteousnesse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi> And, thirdly, Faith maketh the soul behold these mysterious draughts of spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse love, those divine emanations of love that have flowed from his ancient and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting love since the world began. Would you know the great ground why we are so ignorant of him, who is the study of Angels, and of all that are about the Throne, it is this, we are not much in the exercise of faith. And if we would ask that question, What is the way to attain to the saving knowledge of God in Christ? We could give no answer to it but this, Believe, and again believe, and again believe: Faith openeth these mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous seals of his boundlesse perfection, and in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107527:52"/>
some way teacheth the Christian to answer that unanswerable question, <hi>What is His Name, and what is his Sons Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this secondly that pointeth out the sweetnesse of Faith, that it giveth an excellent relish unto the promises, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them food to our soul. What are all the promises without faith (as to our use) but as a dead letter that hath no life: But faith exercised upon the promises, maketh a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cry out, <hi>The words of his mouth are sweeter unto mee then the honey and the honey comb:</hi> as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 12, 13. It is by Faith that wee imbrace the promises, and do receive them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The sweetnesse of Faith may appear by this, that it enableth a Christian to rejoyce under the most anxious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting dispensations that hee meeteth with while hee is here below; as is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 5. where his being justified by Faith hath this fruit attending it, to <hi>joy in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ribulation;</hi> And likewise from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34, 35. Doth not Faith hold the crown in its right hand, and letteth a Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold these infinit dignities that are provided unto them, after they have, <hi>as a strong man, run their race;</hi> And when a Christian is put into a <hi>furnace, hot seven times more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> it bringeth down the Son of man Jesus Christ, to <hi>walk with them in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:</hi> So that they walk safely, and with joy through fire and water, and (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) they can have no crosse in his company. For would yee know what is the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of a crosse? It is to want Christ in any estate, And would ye know what is the description of prosperity? It is to have Christ in any condition or estate of life; What can ye want that have him, and what can he have that want him? He is that All; so that all things besides him are bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vanity. But beside this, Faith doth discover unto a Christian, that there is a sweet period of all his trials and afflictions that he can be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto: so that he can never say that of faith which <hi>Ahab</hi> spake of <hi>Micajah, He never prophesieth good things to me;</hi> But rather he may say alwayes the contrary, Faith never prophesieth evil unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being a grace that prophesieth excellent things in the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est night, and sweetly declareth, that though <hi>weeping do endure for the evening yet joy cometh in the morning;</hi> And that, <hi>though now they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And this may bring in the fourth conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to point out the sweetnesse of Faith, That it giveth a Christian a refreshing sight of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and that is a far off, and maketh him to behold that inheritance that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the <hi>Saints in light:</hi> it goeth forth to the <hi>brook Eshcol,</hi> and there doth pluck down those grapes that grow in Emanuels land, to bring up a good report upon that noble Countrey we are sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards, and the City the streets where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are paved with transparent gold.

many and their own souls, whether or not these eyes that have been the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows through which so much uncleannesse hath entered, and these species of lust have been conveyed into the heart, shall once be like the <hi>eyes of a dove washed with milk and fitly set,</hi> and be admitted to see that glorious object, <hi>the Lamb that sitteth upon the Throne:</hi> Or whether ever these tongues that have been <hi>set on fire of hell,</hi> and these polluted lips that have spoke so much against God, and Heaven, and all his People, and Interests, shall ever be admitted to sing these heavenly <hi>Halelujahs</hi> amongst that spotlesse queer of Angels, and that <hi>assembly of the first born;</hi> or if these hands or feet that have been so active to commit iniquity, and so swift to <hi>run after vanity,</hi> shall even bee admitted hereafter to carry these <hi>Palme Branches,</hi> and to follow the <hi>Lamb where ever hee goeth;</hi> and whether ever these hearts that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>a Bethaven, and house of idols,</hi> may yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, bee a dwelling for the Holy Ghost: Though these things (wee say) and such like may bee the subject of many sad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to some weary souls, and cause many <hi>tossings to and fro till the morning:</hi> yet faith can bring all these mysteries to light, and looking <hi>within the vail,</hi> can let us see thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of thousands who were once as ugly as our selves, yet now having <hi>washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> are admitted to <hi>stand before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there is that fourthly, which we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107527:53"/>
promised to speak of concerning this grace of Faith from these words, and it is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity that is of the exercise of this grace, which is holden forth in that word, <hi>his Commandment;</hi> which doth import these three things. 1. That all the Commands that wee can obey without this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith, it is but a polluting of our selves, and a plunging of our selves in the ditch till our own cloa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hs abhor us. 2. That God taketh greater delight in the exercise of that grace of Faith, then in the exercise of any other. And lastly, that as to the many imperfections which wee have in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there is a sweet act of oblivion past of them all; if we make conscience seriously to obey this command of Faith, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the sweet compend of the Gospel, all these things do most clearly appear, in that believing, here is called, <hi>His Commandement,</hi> by way of excellency, as if this were his only Commandement.</p>
               <p>But that we may yet a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly point out the absolute necessity of Faith; there are these things that speaketh it forth to the full. 1. That though rivers of tears should run down our eyes, because we keep not his Law, though we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rise off our knees from prayer, and should all our life time speak to God with the tongue of Angels; and though we should constantly obey his Commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet without Faith we should never escape that eternal sentence of excommunication from the presence of the Lord; there being no action that doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107527:54"/>
from us which can please the majesty of the Lord, unlesse it hath its rise from this principle of Faith: as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> And though we should offer unto him ten thousand rivers of oyl, and thousands of rams, and should offer up in a burnt sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all the beasts that <hi>are upon the mountains, and the trees that are upon hills,</hi> this should be the answer that God should return to us, <hi>Who hath required these things at your hands? I take no pleasure in these solemn sacrifices;</hi> Because there is no way of attaining peace with God, but through the exercise of Faith, making use of the spotlesse righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> outmost, by all the inventions we can, to bring down our body, and let us separate our selves from all the pleasures of the flesh: yet all our idols shall reign without much contradiction, except once we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto this grace of Faith, which is that <hi>victory whereby we must overcome the world,</hi> and the hand that maketh use of infinite strength for subduing of corruption, making the Christian sweetly to take up that song, <hi>Stronger is he that is with us, than he that is in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this that we have said, both of the sweetnesse of Faith, and the necessity thereof, we would propose these few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, to two or three sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 1. There are some who live in that vain imaginary delusion of attaining hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through a Covenant of Works, and do
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107527:54"/>
neglect to seek salvation by Faith in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ. And to these who build upon this sandy foundation, I shall say but these two words. First, How long shall ye labour <hi>in the fire of very vanity,</hi> do ye ever think to put on the capestone, know ye not that the day is approaching, when your house shall fall about your ears, your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence shall be rejected, and <hi>your hope shall evanish as a dream, and flee away as a vision of the night.</hi> Secondly, What a monstrous blindnesse, and what an unspeakable act of folly must it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. There are some who are secure in their own thoughts concerning their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere are three most precious and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal graces, which a Christian ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> mainly to pursue: There is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting grace of Faith, that comforting grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Hope, and that aspiring grace of Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107527:57"/>
and if once a Christian did take up that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly difference that is between those sister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, hee might be provoked to move after them most swiftly, as the chariots of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab.</hi> And there is this difference between those graces; Faith is a sober and silent grace, Hope is a patient and submissive grace, Love is an ambitions and impatient grace. Faith cryeth out, <hi>O my soul be silent unto God:</hi> Hope cryeth out, I will wait patiently for the Lord, <hi>untill the vision shall speak;</hi> but Love it cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, <hi>How long art thou a coming?</hi> and it is waiting to hear the sound of his feet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>over the mountains of separation.</hi> That is the Motto of Hope, <hi>Quod defertur non aufertur,</hi> that which is delayed (saith Hope) is not altogether taken away and made void: and that may be the divine embleme of the grace of Love. It is sight infolding desire in its armes, and it is desire cloathed with wings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reading upon delay and impediments. There is this second difference between these graces: the grace of Faith, it embraceth the truth of the promises: the grace of Hope, it embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the goodnesse of the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; but that exalting grace of Love, it embraceth the <hi>Promiser:</hi> Faith cryeth out, <hi>Hath hee spoken it, Hee will also do it:</hi> Hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hese graces, Faith it overcometh tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107527:58"/>
Hope, it overcometh difficulties; but Love stayeth at home and divideth the spoil: There is a sweet correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those graces in this: Faith it fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and conquereth; and Hope it fighteth and conquereth; but Love it doth enjoy the Trophies of the victory. And, Fourthly, there is this difference, the noble grace of Faith, it shall once evanish into sight; That noble grace of Hope, it shall once evanish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to possession and enjoyment; But that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant grace of Love; it shall be the eternal companion of a Christian, and shall walk in with him unto the streets of the <hi>New Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> And I would ask you that question, What a day shall it be when Faith shall ced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What a day shall it be when Hope shall yeeld its place to Love, and love and sight shall eternally sit down and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themselves in these blessed mysteries, these everlasting consolations of Heaven world without end.

those who have no strength, and are under the power of their adversaries, the power of God being of no larger extent then his love. There is that second objection of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that wee have nothing to commend us to Christ: But all that wee have to boast of, are infirmities and imperfections: And this is abundantly answered from that second let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Name, that he is <hi>Gracious:</hi> which importeth the freedom of the dispensations of his love that hee walketh nor with us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule of merit, but according to that golden and excellent rule of <hi>Love.</hi> It is a great dispute whether Mercy or Grace be the greatest wonder, Whether the love of Christ, or the freedom of it bee the greatest mystery: Sure both these put together make up a matchlesse wonder? Thirdly, Misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief will object, that wee have forsaken him dayes without number, and that wee cannot trace back our apostasie unto the first day of its rise: And is not that abundantly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that letter of his Name, that hee is long suffering? <hi>This being that Glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God, the glory of which hee desireth to magnifie above all his Name.</hi> Fourthly, Misbelief doth ordinarily propose this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that wee have multiplied our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and <hi>have committed whoredoms under every green tree,</hi> and have <hi>given gifts to our lovers,</hi> even hyring our idols: So that wee may take up that lamentation, <hi>is not our sin great,</hi> and <hi>our transgression infinit:</hi> And is not that also answered from that letter of his Name, that hee is <hi>abundant in goodnesse?</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:107527:64"/>
That though sin abound in us, yet grace doth much more superabound in him. Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse indeed, that there are some that may walk under that condition, that if they had no other exercise throughout eternity, but to make confession, they might confesse and never make any needlesse repetition: And truely in some respect, it is a mercy that we are <hi>mysteries</hi> unto our self: for, if wee did know compleatly the <hi>seven</hi> abominations of our hearts, and those mysterious actings of the body of death, we would be in hazard <hi>to choise strangling and death, rather then life:</hi> Yet may not one glimpse of that <hi>abundant goodnesse</hi> satisfie us, and calm the storm. Fifthly, Saith misbelief, wee know that we have broken our Vowes and Covenants with God, and that all these things that wee have taken on, have been but as flax before the fire of tentation; so that wee have no hope that he will have mercy upon these that have broken wedlock, and have not been sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in his Covenant. But is not that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly answered from that letter of His Name, <hi>That hee is abundant in truth:</hi> which speaketh, That though wee deny our selves, yet he abideth faithfull, and doth not alter the word that hath gone out of his mouth. It is the infinite blessednesse of man that though hee bee changeable, yet they have to do with one that is an unchangeable being. Sixthly; There is that objection: That notwithstanding all these things are matters of encouragement to some, yet they know not whether or not the lot of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107527:64"/>
everlasting love have fallen upon them: And whether their names be in the ancient records of Heaven. But this is answered from that letter of His Name, <hi>hee keepeth mercy for thousands?</hi> which sheweth us that great number of those upon whom the lot of everlasting love shall fall: And if there were no other sentence in all the Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o him, whose compassions have no end,</hi> And who desires to <hi>magnifie his mercy above all his works?</hi> And lastly, Misbelief maketh this objection, They have sinned not onely against light, not onely against vowes, not onely after much enjoyment of God, but even after the application of threatnings: So that they conceive, <hi>that their Maker will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that <hi>Plant of renown,</hi> upon which the weakest faith may cast anchor, and ride out the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est storm; I shall not detain you long on this subject, but this we would have you know, that there is no strait nor difficulty that a Christian can be exposed unto, but there is some name or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tribute of Christ that may sweetly answer that difficulty, and make up that disadvantage. Is a Christian exposed unto afflictions and troubles in a present world? Let him comfort himself in this, that Christ is the <hi>shadow of a great rock in a wearied land;</hi> Is a Christian under inward anxiety and vexation of mind? Let him comfort himself in this, <hi>That Christ is the God of peace, and of all consolation;</hi> Is a Christian under darknesse and confusion of spirit? Let him comfort himself in this, That Christ is the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> and is the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wisdom of God;</hi> Is a Christian under the convictions of this, that he is under the power and dominion of his lusts? Let him comfort himself in this, that Christ is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; yea (that I stay no longer) if it were possible that a Christian could have a necessity that he could not find a name in Christ to answer it, he may lawfully frame a name to Christ out of any promise in all the Book of God, and he should find it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming for the relieving and making up of that necessity, God would not disappoint his expectation.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing further, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the object of Faith, which we shall desire you to tale notice of; and it is the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere they close with Christ. First, These who have committed some grosse and abominable sin that is most contradicting unto the light of nature. Secondly, That person that sinneth much against light, before conversion: Hence it is observed in all the Books of the Gospel, and in the book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there was a more Gospel and love way of converting the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, then was of converting the Jews, see <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. there is a sharp Law exercise among them who had crucified the Lord of Life, and <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> that had been a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous persecuter, at his conversion, he is first stricken dead to the ground before he be made a captive of the love of Christ, and constrained to cry out, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do:</hi> but look to <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and chap. 19.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107527:68"/>
and there ye will find a more fair and smooth way of begetting sons to Christ. And, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that person that is much in conceit of his own righteousnesse, he useth to be brought to Christ through much terrour and exercise of the Law: that is clear in <hi>Paul,</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition also, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and <hi>Act.</hi> 9. compared, and certainly, who ever thinketh to come that length in self abasement, and will count as the Apostle doth in that Chapter, must dwell many dayes at mount Sinai, and learn his Arithmethick there. 2. We would have you taking notice of this, that though the person that is brought in to Christ in a more smooth and evangelick way may have the preheminency of the person that is brought to Christ after a more legall and terrible way in some things. Yet we conceive, that a Christian that is brought to Christ through much of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Law, and through many of the thunderings of mount Sinai, after he hath wone to see his right of Christ, he is more constant in the exercise of Faith; and the reason of it is, because that an ordinary ground of misbelief is our not distinct up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking either of the time of our conversion, which is oftentimes hid from these persons that are converted in a more evangelick way, as likewise this, that those persons that are brought to Christ in a more Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariot, are sometimes put to debates, whether ever they were under the exercise of the Law, and this maketh them often (as it were) to raze the foundation, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107527:68"/>
to cry forth, <hi>My hope, and my strength is perished from the Lord.</hi> And now to shut up our discourse, we shall adde this one word of exhortation; that ye would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lay hold upon that noble object, and exercise your faith upon him; and I shall say but this, that all these that have this noble grace of Faith, and that are he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ay; Therefore I intreat you, enquire at your selves what is your humour. Oh shall the Great Salvation, that yee have slighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107527:82"/>
and stand inlaw, lest the wrath of the most High pursue you.</p>
               <p>Now I shall give you these seven considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may provoke you not to slight (but imbrace) this Great Salvation.</p>
               <p>1. The first Consideration, That the not imbracing of this Great Salvation is one of the greatest acts of folly that can be, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8: 9. <hi>They have rejected the word of the Lord,</hi> (and immediatly is subjoyned). And, <hi>what wisedom is in them?</hi> And so <hi>Solomon</hi> doth assure you they cannot be wise who neglect this Great Salvation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Fools despise wisedom and instruction;</hi> Therefore, may not I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, be who ye will (though ye were the greatest heads of wit in all this place) ye are but stark fools as long as ye neglect this. But would ye be wise indeed, and wise unto <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life?</hi> then I intreat you come and imbrace this Great Salvation.</p>
               <p>II. The second Consideration, to provoke you not to slight the Great Salvation, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the ruine and destruction of the slighters of it, is most certain and infallible, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11. 11. Where (speaking of slighting the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is indeed this same Great Salvation) there is a <hi>therefore</hi> put to the threatning. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape</hi> I defy you all who are the slighters of this Great Salvation, to finde a back door, when justice shall pursue you: For there is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> door to escape if ye imbrace not this Great Salvation: But <hi>the earth will disclose your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and heaven will declare your sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:107527:82"/>III. Thirdly, Let this Consideration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you not to slight this Great Salvation, that Christ is exceeding serious, and earnest that ye would imbrace it. And I think that, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 23. speaketh out his exceeding seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: where four times hee beggeth of his hearers, that they would give ear and hear his voice (saying) <hi>Give ear and hear my voice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earken and hear my speech.</hi> What needeth all these exhortations? But that Christ is most serious, that they would imbrace the Great Salvation. And O that there were a person here (to day) as serious to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as Christ is! But, be who yee will that slight this Great Salvation, (believe me) the day is coming wherein ye shall cry out, alas for my slighting of it. Wilt thou therefore think presently with thy self (O thou sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Great Salvation) what wilt thou say of thy slighting of it, when the devil shall be leading thee in thorow these dark gates of hell? O slighter of the Gospel, how many alaces wilt thou cry, when thou shalt be passing thorow these dark gates into thy everlasting prison? Wilt thou not then cry out. (O me slighter of the everlasting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) whither am I now going? Alas, now for my slighting the Gospel: And as thou passest thorow, thou shalt meet with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of miserable comforters. There is not one in that prison who can comfort thee: But many dreadfull alaces shalt thou then both cry and hear, if thou imbrace not this Great Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:107527:83"/>IV. Fourthly, Let this provoke you no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to slight the Great Salvation, that ye will get it for a very look. O ye within this house to day, ye will get this Great Salvation for one look, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> ever think to get Heaven at a lower rate?</p>
               <p>V. The fifth Consideration, to provoke you not to slight this Great Salvation and more, is this, There is not one of you wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> person here to day who will be a mockers this Great Salvation?</p>
               <p>VI. The sixth Consideration, to provoke you not to slight this Great Salvation a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> more, is this, Ye know not but that yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> dayes may be near a close; I say, ye kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not, but the day of the preaching of this Great Salvation may be near unto a close. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> knowest thou, O man or woman, but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>VII. The seventh consideration, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you not to slight the Great Salvation, is this, that there is a five fold Salvation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this Great Salvation.</p>
               <p>I. The first is this, come and partake of this Great Salvation, and thou shalt have Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from thy idols: and hereby I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty (this day) unto captives. I am sent forth (this day) with the keyes of your prison house, to open your prison doors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if ye will imbrace this Great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I say unto you. O ye <hi>prisoners come forth and shew your selves;</hi> for the keyes of your prison house are with us to open your prison doors unto you, therefore O come forth and embrace this Great Salvation. Will there be any (shall I think) here that will refuse to come forth, <hi>O go forth and slee from the land of your captivity, and from the house of your bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Thou shalt have Salvation from thy darknesse, and from thy ignorance? I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you who understand no more of God then the stones in the wall, I command you to come forth, and partake yet of this Great Salvation; and unto you shall light arise, even the Day Spring from on high shall visit you.</p>
               <p>III. If ye will come and partake of this Great Salvation, ye shall have deliverance
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107527:84"/>
from all your fears. Dost thou fear that thou shalt be poor: Come and partake of this Great Salvation; and thou shalt be delivered from it? Art thou afraid of hell?

               </p>
               <p>V. If yee will come and embrace the Great Salvation offered unto you this day, yee shall be helped before yee go hence to sing that song, <hi>O death where is thy sting?

               <p>Oh cast your eyes upon these pillars of the house, and stones in the walls: I take them as so many witnesses, that they may speak, and testifie against you in the great day of the Lord, if ye neglect this Great Salvation to day.

that higher house to make him a visit. And, fifthly, Christ he sometimes appeareth to his own, in Robes of dreadfull Majesty, and terrible highnesse and loftinesse, when the soul upon the first sight of him remains dead, add there remains no more life in them; Such was the sight <hi>Daniel</hi> got, in his 10.

                  </gap>; The first thing in the words, to wit, That there are many who live under the offer of this Great Salvation that do slight it, and do not imbrace it; And now I shall only add a few things further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. 1. Let me propose a few Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to perswade you to imbrace the Great Salvation: God forbid we go a way before we imbrace this Gospel Salvation: And therefore, I charge you in his Name, go not away before ye imbrace it. And to presse it home upon you, there are these eight or nine properties of this Great Salvation, that is offered unto you this day.</p>
               <p>And first, It is a <hi>free Salvation,</hi> ye have no more a do, but to put forth your hand and take it: O come and take it: Christ

What must I give for it say ye, I say, ye must give nothing for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come and take it <hi>without money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price;</hi> it was dear to Christ, but it shall be cheap unto you, O! is it not cheap to you, I assure you, if you will come to the market to buy the Great Salvation, there is none of you that needeth to stand for the price of it. O come and take it, and have it, and there shall be no more priging.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is an everlasting Salvation, that ye shall enjoy the fruits of throughout eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>He became the author of eternal redemption unto us,</hi> it is a Salvation that the devil can never be able to take out of your hand, if ye take it, ye shall never be robbed of it again. O come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Great Salvation, whereby the gates of hell shall never prevail against you.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is an noble and honourable Salvation, it is not to be taken out of one slavery to another, but it is to be taken <hi>out of prison that we may raign:</hi> Luk. 1. verse 71. compared with vers. 74 it is, <hi>That we being saved, may serve him without fear in holinesse and righteousnesse, all the dayes of our life.</hi> I say, Come, come, and partake of this Great Salvation, that your glory may be increased, and that ye may be exalted above the Kings of the earth.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is a most advantagious Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107527:94"/>
What are the advantages of any Salvation that are not to be found in this: is there not peace to be found through this Salvation, is there not liberty to be found through this Salvation, is there not eternal enjoyment of God to be found through this Salvation; yea, all Salvations are in this one Salvation.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is a royal Salvation, for it cometh to us from and through the Son of God: Christ is the Author of it, and we conceive, Christ may be said to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Salvation, in these respects, 1. He is the meritorious cause that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, it was the price of his bloud that was laid down for to purchase this Great Salvation. 2. He is the fountain from whence it floweth, according to that word which we have cited. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>He became the Author of eternal Salvation.</hi> 3. He is the person that fitteth our spirits for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it, and it is he that removeth mountains out of the way, that we may have fair accesse unto the Great Salvation. 4. It is he that must perswade our hearts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and take hold of it. He standeth without, and cryeth in to the heart, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Great Salvation; And he standeth within, making thy heart cry out, <hi>Content,</hi> I will imbrace the Great Salvation; He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the person that commendeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and doth point forth this Great Salvation unto us, He is the noble Minister of it, it began first to be preached by him.</p>

Art thou a person who beginneth to weep because thou hast been so long a stanger to Christ, and the Great Salvation: Old men, that are here, how long have ye been stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Great Salvation, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it?

I say, if thou hast been made a partaker of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Salvation, thou wilt strive to keep thy self from the power of these things that once triumphed over thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A person that is a partaker of the Great Salvation, will have a high esteem of this mercy and Salvation; so <hi>Paul,</hi> when he speaketh of it here, he cannot but put some note of excellency to it, calling it <hi>the Great Salvation;</hi> Therefore, I say, if thou hast imbraced the Great Salvation, thou wilt have so high esteem of it, that not to be so subjected to it as thou should: or to be

I would ask this at you, Think yee it will not be most sad, that Christ should tell this in heaven of you to night, I was preached to a pack of stones, that none of them would love me: Will yee not bee feared that this report shall be carried back to heaven of you? For what report can Christ carry back but this? Now is the cord of this Great Salvation let down unto you: Is there none of you that will take a grip of it? O will ye fligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after it! Will yee make this a rejoycing day in heaven, that is a fasting day unto you, and the way to make it so, is to imbrace the Great Salvation. Now what say yee to it old men, let mee speak to you, and ask your thoughts of the Great Salvation, gray hairs should bee a Crown of Glory, if it bee found in the way of Righteousnesse, old men speak your minds, that young men may not have your bad example;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107527:97"/>
What say ye of this Salvation? Is it not a most glorious Salvation, is it not a most excellent Salvation that is in your offer; I intreat you speak your minds, tell Christ ye are content to take the Great Salvation; otherwise, who ever he be that will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Gospel Salvation; I in the Name and Authority of Christ our Master, denounce eternal and irrevockable war against him; put on your harnesse, ye shall not boast when you put it off again, the wrath and fury of God shall come upon thee to the uttermost if ye imbrace not this Great Salvation. Other Wars are but for a time; the greatest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that ever the earth did carry, are now <hi>laid down in the sides of the pit, and their swords broken under their heads.</hi> Armies of ten hundreth thousand, a hundreth years time have laid them all in their graves, and ended all their contests, but there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his war that shall be concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and you, it shall become an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and most terrible War, which shall be but beginning when time is ended: Now Peace or War, which of them will ye choise? Dare ye send a charge to Christ, and say ye will defy him? I am afraid there shall be two things that many of us shall report to day. First, I am afraid there will be many that will give <hi>Pharaohs</hi> report to the offer of the Great Salvation, and say, <hi>Who is the Lord that I should obey him?</hi> I tell you who he is, He is <hi>glorious in Holinesse, fearfull in Praises, doing wonders;</hi> O imbrace him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he go hence, and give not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,

lest yee bee drowned in the sea of His wrath, whence there shall be no recovery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I fear there will be many here to day, that will give <hi>Demas</hi> report to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offer; I will go and for sake Christ; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to clear in what cases it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to desire to die.</p>
               <p>1. I say, it is lawfull to desire to die, when it floweth from a desire of uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upted fellowship and communion with Christ, and conjunction with him: this is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Knowing that while we

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>entations that assault us; and from these oppressions whereunto we are subject by it. Doubtlesse, <hi>Paul</hi> desired to die on this account, when he cryed out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> He longeth greatly for the day, <hi>Wherein hee should be made white like the wings of a dove, covered with silver, whose feathers are of yellow gold.</hi> O saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I am as one impatient till I be above, where I shall be cloathed with these excellent and cleanly robes, <hi>The righteousnesse of Christ.</hi> Oh, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I think every day as a year, till I be possessed of that Kingdom where Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than cannot tempt, and the creature cannot yeeld, and where I shall be free from all my sears of sinning. Now in all these respects, who would not desire to die? But to guard all these, I would give you these four Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Caution.</hi> Your desires to die should not be peremptory, but yee should desire to die with submission to the will of God, so that although he would fill up fifteen years more to your life, yee should be content to live it out.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Caution.</hi> When your desires are hasty, and off hand, suspect them; for some when they meer with an outward crosse (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all deliberation) will cry our, <hi>O to be gone, O that I were dead.</hi> But your desires
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107527:101"/>
to die, should be deliberate, but not hasty, or rash.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Caution.</hi> It is not lawful to desire to die, because of personal affliction. Many, when they meet with bitter afflictions, will cry out, <hi>O to be gone:</hi> They long for death, even upon that account, such were <hi>Iobs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 21, 22. and chap. 6. ver. 7. 8. <hi>O that I might have my request, even that it would please God to destroy me, &amp;c.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was very unlawfull.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Caution.</hi> It is not lawfull to desire to die, when thy predominant idol is taken away from thee; yet such was <hi>Ionahs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Ionah</hi> thought his credit and reputation (which was his idol) was gone, and could never be regained: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wished to die. But I would say this to you, that some will have ten desires for death, when they have not one desire for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And what moveth Christians to be so desirous to die? It is not so much because of their hope, as because of their anxiety; it is not so much because of their confidence, as because of their impatience. But I say unto you, when your desires of death are not accompanied with desires of heaven, suspect them. 2. I would say this, that there are some who will have ten desires for death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they will not have one for the death of the body of death; But it were good for thee (who are such) to be desiring the death of the body of death, then should thou be in a more suitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rame to desire to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107527:101"/>3. Some will have hearty desires to die, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when death cometh, they will be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die as any. It hath been observed, that some who have much desired to die, when death came, have cryed out, <hi>O spare a little that I may recover strength,</hi> &amp;c. 4. There is a great difference between a desire to die, and death it self. It is an easie thing to desire to die, but it is a very great business to meet with death, and to look it in the face, when it cometh. We think death (ere it come near to us) to be but childrens play, but when we meet with it, it maketh us change our thoughts. For it is a great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Is it lawfull for a Christian to desire to live, when he is summoned to die?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In some cases it is lawfull for a Christian to desire to live, even when he is summoned to die; which is clear from the practice of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 39. 13. where he prayeth, <hi>That the Lord would spare him a little.</hi> It is also clear from the practice of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Isa. 38. 3. when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to set his house in order, for he should die, and not live,</hi> he cryeth forth, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart: and have done, that which is good in thy sight, and</hi> Hezekiah <hi>wept sore;</hi> Or as the word in the Original, <hi>he wept with great weeping:</hi> But to guard this, take these two <hi>Cautions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Thy desires to live (when thou are summoned to die) should not be peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107527:102"/>
but with submission to the will of God, that if it bee his pleasure to remove thee presently out of time, thou should bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Thy desires to live should have gracious principles, and also a very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious end, as is most clear from <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 39. 13. where hee saith, <hi>O spare a little that I may recover my strength, before I go from hence and bee no more:</hi> his desire to live was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> hee might have more victory over his Idols, as if hee had said, my desire to live is, that I may have strength to wrestle with, and overcome my Idols: and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> desire was a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and well grounded desire: However, I would say this unto thee, that thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est examine thy desires to live, as much (if not more) as thy desires to die: for wee are ready to shun death if wee could, but hee is that universall King, unto whom all of us must be subject ere long.</p>
               <p>Now in the words which are read unto you, there are these six things which may be clearly observed from them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. First, That it is a most clear and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at all persons shall once see death: as is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in these words, <hi>Who is hee that liveth an shall not see death.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. Secon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, That this truth (that wee shall once see death) is not much believed or thought upon by many, therefore it is that the Psalmist doubleth the Assertion. <hi>Who is he that liveth, and shall not see death?
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107527:102"/>
Shall he deliver his soul</hi> (that is his life) <hi>from the hand</hi> (that is) <hi>from the power of the grave.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. Thirdly, That sometimes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may win to the solide Faith of this truth, that once he must die, this the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist wan unto, as it is also clear in that word (who) <hi>Who is he that liveth and shall not see death?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly, That the certainty of this, that once we shall die should be still keeped in our minde, therefore that note of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Selah,</hi> is put to it; as if he had said, take heed that there is none living that shall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
                  <item>V. Fifthly, That howbeit some persons put the evil day far away, as if they were not to see death, yet is the day coming when they shall see death, and death shall take them by the hand.</item>
                  <item>VI. Sixthly, We shall take notice of this from the context, that the Christian who is much in minding the brevity of his life, will believe the certainty of his death, the Psalmist was speaking of the shortnesse of his life in the preceeding verse, and in this verse, he speaketh of the certainty of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Now as for the first of these things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is certain and most sure that we must all once die; I hope there are none of you here who will deny it; although I confesse few of you beleeveth it, yet said the woman of <hi>Tek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:107527:103"/>
14. <hi>We must all die and be like water spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God doth not accept the person of any,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> 30. 32. <hi>I know thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</hi> And it is very clear, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the Spirit, neither hath he any power in the day of death, and there is no discharge in that War; neither shall wickednesse deliver those that are given to it:</hi> It is also clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</hi> So it is most clear that we must die. I remember of one <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who had one substitute for this very end, to cry at his Chamber door every morning, <hi>Memento mori, Memento mori, Memento mori,</hi> Remember thou art to die, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been the practice of the Nobles of <hi>Greece,</hi> and in the day wherein their Emperour was Crowned, that they presented a <hi>Marblestone</hi> unto him, and he was inquired after what fashion he would have his <hi>Tomb stone</hi> made: which practices speak forth this unto us, that although these were most destitute of light of the Scriptures, yet were very mindfull of death. Believe me, death may surprise us before we be aware, for it is most certain that we must die, but there is nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then the way how, and the time when we shall die.</p>
               <p>Death will surprise some, as it did <hi>Abel,</hi> in the open field, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8, Death will sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107527:103"/>
some, as it did <hi>Eglon</hi> in his parlour, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 21. And death will surprise some, as it did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> in the flight, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Now in speaking to this point, I shall first speak a little to these advantages which attend those that live within continuall sight of death. Secondly, I shall give you some Considerations to presse you to prepare for death. Thirdly, I shall give you some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to help you to prepare for Death: And then we shall proceed unto the second point of doctrine which we observed from the Text, and shall speak a few things from it unto you, and so come unto a close for this time.</p>
               <p>First then, we conceive there are these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven advantages which attend those who live within the continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight of this truth, that they must die.</p>
               <p>I. First, The Faith of approaching death will make a soul exceeding diligent in duty: this was our blessed Lords divinity, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>I must work the work of him that sent me, while it is day: The night cometh, when no man can work;</hi> That is, death is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore I must work. It is clear also, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. compared with vers. 14. In the 12. vers. <hi>Peter</hi> is exceeding diligenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in his duty, and the ground of his diligence is in the 14. vers. <hi>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, it is even the Epicures argument, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die;</hi> and should
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107527:104"/>
not the Christian much more cry out, Let <hi>mee watch and pray, for to morrow I may die?</hi> I say, if the Epicures did make use of this notion, to make them vigorous in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of their pleasures: O how much more should a Christian improve i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for making him vigorous in the pursuit of his duty? Therefore I say unto you all, O bee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, for your night is drawing near. O Christians, and expectants of heaven, are ye not afraid lest yee be nighted before ye have walked the half of your journey? For if yee bee nighted on your journey to heaven, before ye come to the end of your race, there is no retiring place whereunto yee may turn aside to lodge: therefore, <hi>O work, work, work, while it is day;</hi> for behold death is approaching, and then shall we all bee called to an account.</p>
               <p>II. The Faith of approaching death, will make a Christian exceeding active in duty: hee will not only bee diligent, but also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding serious and zealous in the exercise of his duty: This is clear from that notable exhortation, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: and</hi> the reason is, <hi>For there is no work, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest.</hi> Wherefore O bee active while yee are alive, for ye shall never work any more after ye are dead; and if ye leave but one work undone, there is no doing of it after death. There is no work (saith
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107527:104"/>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi>) in the grave; therefore, O be active.</p>
               <p>III. The faith of this Truth, that we must all die, will help a Christian to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mortified to the things of a present world. Oh, covetous men and women, would ye shake hands with cold death but once every morning, I should defy you to pursue the world so much as ye do. <hi>Paul</hi> was much in the meditation of his change, which made him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. to overlook these things that are temporary, <hi>while we look not</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the things that are seen, which are temporal, but to the things which are not seen, which are eternal,</hi> therefore, chap. 5. 1. <hi>Knowing that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, Therefore in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be cloathed upon with our house which is from heaven.</hi> What aileth you <hi>Paul</hi> (might one have said) may ye not take a look of the world (no saith he) <hi>For I know that if this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, I have a house with God, not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens:</hi> That is, I know that ere long, the pins of my tabernacle will be loosed, and it will fall down about my ears, therefore I must look for another dwelling house: And, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>The fashions of this world passe away,</hi> Therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith he, vers. 32. I <hi>would have you without careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, caring how to please the Lord.</hi> And
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:107527:105"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:107527:105"/>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:107527:106"/>
Phil. 4. 5. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men, The Lord is at hand.</hi> As if he had said, Death is approaching and at hand, therefore I intreat you be sober: But I think many of us will be found like <hi>Saul</hi> hid among the stuffe, that is, we will be lying amongst the middest of the pleasures of this passing world: But I say unto thee who are such an one, that death will break the strings of thy harp, and thy musick will quickly cease. O but death will make thee have a low esteem of the world. O blessed is the person who hath these thoughts of the world all along his way, which he shall have of it at death? Have not the most cursed wretches been forced to cry forth, <hi>Oh, I would give ten thousand worlds for Christ?</hi> Have not some persons (who have had the Moon upon their head, and that have made their belly their god) being forced to cry forth at death; <hi>O cursed person that I am that ever made the world my god?</hi> Alas that I conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my self with the world. Therefore I say unto thee who art such an one, O stay thy pursuit after the world, for death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching that will cause all thy worldly comforts evanish.</p>
               <p>IV. When a Christian believeth this Truth, that he must die, it will be an exceeding great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estraint to keep him from sinning, as is clear, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 13. compared with vers. 14. where <hi>Iob</hi> reckoning over many good deeds done by himself, saith, <hi>What then shall I do when God riseth up? and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107527:106"/>
when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</hi> As if he had said, Sirs mistake me not, I am not boasting much of my self, for I could not have done otherwise, else what should I do when God riseth up? How could I answer to God if I had done otherwise? I think it were a notable practice for each of you, when temptations begin to assault you, to say, <hi>O temptation, what will I answer to God, when he riseth up to reprove me, if I should yeeld unto thee?</hi> Likewise, <hi>Eccles</hi> 11. 9. Where <hi>Solomon,</hi> disswading young men to pursue after vanity, bringeth this as a reason. <hi>Know thou, that for all, these things, God will bring thee to judgement;</hi> Therefore I say unto thee, who art often tempted to sin. let <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and reckoning with God be still in thy sight, and I defy thee then to imbrace half so many temptations as now thou dost. I intreat you to answer all your temptations with that word, <hi>What shall I do when he riseth up? And what shall I answer when he visiteth me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. When a Christian liveth within the sight of this Truth, that he shall once see death, it shall make him exceeding patient under every crosse wherewith he meeteth; Such a Christian will hardly meet with a crosse, but he will quiet himself with this, Death will put me beyond this crosse: this is but a cloud that will quickly passe away. And for this cause did <hi>Divid</hi> so composedly put up that desire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39 4. <hi>Lord make me to know my end, and the measure of my
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107527:107"/>
dayes:</hi> He was sure that the knowledge of his end would put him in a sober and patient frame.</p>
               <p>VI. The sixth advantage is this, The faith of approaching death, will teach the the person that hath it, to study saving wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, This is clear, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 12. Where <hi>David</hi> putteth up this request, <hi>So teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdome.</hi> As if he had said, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think my self wise, till I know that blessed peece of Arithmetick, <hi>How to number my dayes.</hi> I would desire every one of you all to think with your self every morning when ye arise, now I am a day nearer unto eternity then I was before: and at the end of every hour, now I am an hour nearer unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then I was before. I say, think often, yea alwayes thus, I was never so near my death as I am now; For, oh! are we not all nearer to eternity to day, then we were yesterday?</p>
               <p>VII. The seventh advantage, attending the faith of approaching Death, is this, That it will make a Christian very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in preparing for Death. It is impossible for one to believe really that Death is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and not to prepare for it. Say what ye will, if ye be not carefull in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for death, ye have not the solide faith of this truth, that ye shall die. Believe me, it is not every one that thinketh he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this truth, that believeth it indeed. And O how dreadfull is it for an unprepared
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107527:107"/>
man to meet with death? He desireth not to die, yea he would give a world for his life. but die must he whether he will or not: for death will not be requested to spare a little when he cometh; And therefore I say unto you all, <hi>Set your house in order, for ye shall surely die;</hi> Old men and women, <hi>set your house in order, for surely ye must die;</hi> Young men and women, <hi>set your house in order, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. ye may die, and be cut off in the flower of your age,</hi> Think not that there are any who can sell time: for I say, ye shall never get time sold unto you. Alas, I fear the most part of persons that dieth now, death findeth them at unawars; for indeed the persons that die among us, when we come to visit them, we may give you a sad account of them, for we think they are comprehended under these four sorts.</p>
               <p>1. First, When we go to visit some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons on their death bed, they are like unto <hi>Nabal, their heart is dying and sinking (like unto a stone) within them;</hi> they are no more affected with death, then if it were a fancy; (alas for the great stupidity that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken many) therefore I intreat you delay not your repentance till death, left the Lord take away your wit, so that ye cannot then repent for your senslesnesse and stupid frame of spirit.</p>
               <p>2. A second sort we find in a presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame, saying they have had a good hope all their dayes, and they will not quite it now; they will go down to the grave with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107527:108"/>
their hope in their right hand: or rather they will go down to the grave <hi>with a lie in their right hand;</hi> they live in a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous frame, and they die in the same delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For when we tell them that by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they are going down to hell, they answer, God forbid, I was all my time a very honest man, or woman. But I love not that confession, for there are many such honest men and women in hell this day.</p>
               <p>3. The third sort we find, having some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions that they have been playing the fool all their dayes; but we can get them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I shall only say to such, to go down to the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve with convictions in their breast, not making use of Christ, is to go down to hell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e in their hand to let them see the way: and truly the greater part that die, die in this manner.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, There are some whom we find in a self righteous frame, trusting upon the Covenant of Works, and their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and trusting by these to go to heaven: yet neglecting the offer of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But, alas, we find not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in this frame, <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and be with Christ, that's best of all:</hi> And scarce do we find any in such a frame, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Therefore I say unto you all who are here, O will ye mind death before it take hold on you. Oh mind your work now; for ye will find that death
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107527:108"/>
shall be work enough for it self, though ye leave no work till then.</p>
               <p>VIII. The eight advantage that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Christian believing this truth, that once he must die, is this, death will not be so terrible to him as it is unto many when it cometh. What (think ye) maketh death <hi>a king of terrours?</hi> What maketh many to shake like the leaf of a tree, when they are summoned to appear before Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? It is even because of this, they have not been thinking on death before it came, so as to prepare for it, and I fear many in this place may be feared for death, and that when it cometh to them; they will say unto death, at <hi>Ahab</hi> said to <hi>Elijah Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> Surely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ath will take you and bring you to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ; Therefore study by all means to think often upon it; and make ready for it: For (believe me) death is a very big word, for it will once make you stand with horrour in your souls, if your peace be not made up with God: I know not a more dreadfull dispensation then death and a guilty conscience meeting together.</p>
               <p>The second thing that I shall speak unto from this first observation (viz. <hi>That it is a most certain and infallible truth, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall once see death</hi>) shall be to give you some considerations for pressing you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:107527:109"/>I. The first consideration is this, <hi>That to die well, and in the Lord,</hi> is a most difficult work; therefore I intreat you prepare for death. It is a difficult work to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate aright, it is a difficult work to pray aright, and it is a difficult work to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er aright: But I must tell you, it is a more difficult work to die aright, then any of these. It is true, it is more difficult to communicate aright, then to pray aright, yet it is much more difficult to die aright, then to communicate aright: For it is a most difficult work to die in the Lord. Death will put the most accurate Christian that is here, to a wonderfull search: and therefore I will tell you nine things that death will try in thee. 1. Death will try both the reality and strength of thy Faith. It may be easie for thee to keep up Faith under many difficulties, but death shall put thy Faith to the greatest stresse that ever it did meet with. Yea, know this that the Faith of the strongest Believer may get (and ordinarily doth get) a set at death, the like whereof it never got before: therefore prepare for death. 2. Death will try thy love to God, some persons pretend much love to him: but death will propose this question to such a person, <hi>Lovest thou him more then these? Lovest thou him more then thy wife? More then thy house? More then thy friends?</hi> But your unwillingnesse to die, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us much ground to fear that many have little love to Christ, but much to the world,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107527:109"/>
and so dare not answer the question, <hi>Lord thou knowest I love thee.</hi> 3. Death will try thine enjoyments, some of you may be ready to think that ye met with many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, so that ye might reckon (as you think) to fourty enjoyments and sweet out lettings: but beware that death bring them not down to twenty. I have known some, who thought they had met fourty times with God; but when death came, it made them take down the count to the half, therefore seeing death will try the reality of thine enjoyments, O prepare for it. 4. Death will try thy patience. Thou may seem to have much patience now, but when death cometh (and thou art put to die) it will put thy patience to a great tryall, therefore prepare fore it. 5. Death will try the reality of thy duties, yea even these duties wherein thou had most satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as thy communicating aright in such a place, thou hopest that is sure: thy read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture at such a time aright, thou hopest that is sure: thou prayed at such a time aright, and hopest that is sure: thou meditated in such a place aright, and hopest that is sure. But (believe me) death may make thee change thy thoughts: for there are some persons who have communicated and prayed, &amp;c. as right as any in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who (for all that) will not find six duties wherein they can find satisfaction at death: Therefore our need is great to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it. 6. Death will exceedingly try
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107527:110"/>
thy sincerity when it cometh: An hypocrite may go all alongs his whole way undiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet death may bring him to light, and make it appear what man he it. 7. Death will discover unto thee many hid and secret sins, of which thou never had a thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yea, albeit thou thought these had been forgotten, death will let thee see them stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between thee and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. 8. Death will accurately try thy Mortification: Some think they have come a great length in Mortification; but (believe me) death will try it and put it to the touch-stone. 9. Death will try thy hope, whether it bee real or not. I shall onely say this, that all the other graces must low their sails to Faith, and so it is Faith must carry us thorow, being that last triumphing grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which must fit the field for us, when all the other graces will faint and ly by. It is Faith that must enter us fairly within the borders of eternity, It is Faith must gainstand all the temptations of death, yea, all the other graces must (as it were) stand by, and see Faith strike the last stroak in this war.</p>
               <p>II. The second consideration to presse you to mind death, is this, that yee are to die but once. O labour to do that well, which yee are to do but once, and the wrong doing of which can never bee helped. If yee pray not aright, ye may get that mended: if yee meditate not aright, yee may get that mended: and if ye communicate not aright,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107527:110"/>
ye may get that also mended: but alas, if ye die not aright, there is no mending of that: Therefore, O prepare for death, that ye may die well, seeing ye are to die but once.</p>
               <p>III. The third consideration to presse you to mind death, is this, That they are pronounced blessed who die in the Lord, Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,</hi> O let that provoke you to prepare for death, that so you may die in the Lord, that is the only way to make you eternally happy. I confesse it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion difficult to determine whether it be more difficult to die well, or to live well; I shall not answer it, but rather desire you to study both.</p>
               <p>IV. The fourth consideration to presse you to prepare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That though thou put all thy work by thy hand before death, yet shalt thou finde that death shall have work enough for it self, yea, as much as thou shalt get done. It will then be much for thee to win to patience, it will be much for thee to win to the sight of thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: and it will then be much for thee to win to assurance: O then is it not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thee, to put all thy work by thy hand before thy latter end come? Wherefore I may say to you as <hi>Moses</hi> said in his Song, Deut. 32. 29. <hi>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end.</hi> O that ye had this piece of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wisdome. I pray you consider that sad
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107527:111"/>
word, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>She remembereth not her last end,</hi> And what of it? <hi>Therefore she came down wonderfully:</hi> So will the down coming of many in this generation be wonderfull, who consider not their last end.</p>
               <p>V. The fifth Consideration, for pressing you to prepare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That their labour shall end, but their works shall not be forgotten, as is clear from that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>They rest from their labours, and their works follow them:</hi> and is not that a glorious advantage?</p>
               <p>VI. The sixth consideration to presse you to prepare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That death may come upon you ere ye be awar: ye know not but death may surprise you this night, before you go home to your houses: and therefore let that presse you to study a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant preparation for death.</p>
               <p>VII. The seventh Consideration to presse you to prepare for death, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as death leaveth you, so will judgement find you, If death shall leave you strangers to Christ, ye shall appear before his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat strangers unto him: Therefore I intreat you all to prepare for it. I think that noble practice of <hi>Paul</hi> exceeding wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of imitation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>I die dayly,</hi> which (I think) doth comprehend these three things. 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> had death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his sight. 2. It comprehendeth this, that he endeavoured to keep such a frame, as that every moment he should be ready to die, so that whensoever death
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107527:111"/>
should put the summonds in his hand, he should be content to answer. 3. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth this, that he laboured to lay aside and remove all things out of the way, that might detain him from laying down his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. O saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I labour so to clear my self of all hinderances, as that when ever I shall be summoned to remove out of time, I may willingly lay down my life. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> desired alwayes to have his Latter Will clear; Therefore I would ask you this question, <hi>viz.</hi> when did you make your last testament? I think it were suitable for us to be renewing our latter will every day; for in so doing, <hi>Paul</hi> made an excellent testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the better of which, none that died since have made, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have keeped the faith;</hi> These are very sweet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and then he addeth, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousnesse, which the Lord, the righteous Iudge shall give me at that day:</hi> And think ye not that very sweet? And he would leave some thing unto you in Christs Name, <hi>viz. And not for me only, but for all them that wait for his appearance.</hi> Now I come to the third thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> To give you some directions for helping you to prepare for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. I intreat you, be much in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for death every day, for it is even a preparation for heaven, to be taking a sight of your grave and latter end every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. I intreat you, he much in these
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107527:112"/>
duties. First, In Self examination, that your compts may be clear with God: for many a ragged compt will we have, when death and we shall meet. Secondly, Be much in the exercise of Repentance, that so ye may have every fault of corruption in you mourned for, before death and you meet. Thirdly, Be much in the exercise of Faith, <hi>making your calling and election sure?</hi> Fourthly, Be much in the exercise of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and that will help you to keep a loose grip, not only of the world, but also of your other idols; And if ye be much in these, ye shall undoubtedly be prepared for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Be much in minding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of heaven. A Christian that would be prepared for death, would have all his thoughts and conversation there. I think, it would be an excellent help (in preparation for death) to take a sight of the Crown every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. <hi>Labour alwayes to keep a good conscience void of offence towards God and men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> I say, labour to keep thy conscience clear, and that shall be a continual feast unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Slight not thy known duty, do not crucify any conviction, neither break any resolution: put these three together, and that will exceedingly help you to prepare for death: I say, see that ye adventure not to slight any known duty, see that ye adventure not to crucifie any conviction, and see that ye adventure not to break your resolutions</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:107527:112"/>Now we come to the second thing which we observed from the words, <hi>viz.</hi> That this truth, that we shall once see death, is not much believed by many of us. And to make this appear, we shall only give some Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences unto you, to prove that we are not as yet prepared for death.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Evidence,</hi> Doth not the unspeakable stupidity that have overtaken many, say, that we are not a people prepared for death? Alas, many of us would find our selves in a most stupid temper if we were presently to die; for many of us are no more moved with the threatnings and terrouts of God, then if they did not belong unto us; and this saith we are not as yet prepared for death.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Evidence,</hi> That we are not prepared for death, is our pursuing so much after the vain and passing delights of a present world. Many of us, <hi>Rise up early, and go late to bed at night, and eateth the bread of sorrow all the day, and loading themselves with thick clay;</hi> And I am sure, that such a person, (being night and day taken up with the world) is not prepared for death. I remember a word recorded of such a wretched one, who was exceedingly rich; said he, I would give so many thousands of money, if death would give me but one day: yet he got it not. And O how suddenly will death surprise many of you as it did him?</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Evidence,</hi> which speaketh forth our unpreparednesse for death, is our impatience
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107527:113"/>
under every petty crosse that we meet with, for the prepared Christian will be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very sharp crosses.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Evidence,</hi> That we are not prepared, is our not endeavouring to live within sight of our interest in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh if wee were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death, durst we live in so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our interest in God, and of our assurance of heaven?</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Some of us can let our Idols ly in our brest six years without repentance, and will never study to mortifie them, nor to repent for them; and surely such are not prepared for death.</p>
               <p>Now I intreat you seriously to minde what hath been said. And that yee may the more seriously think upon it, I will tell you some materiall challenges that your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at death will present unto you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed, that yee may know how yee will answer.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Challenge.</hi> Is the slighting of much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time, and sinning away the precious offers of Grace. O what will yee answer to that Challenge, when Death shall present it to you? Death will say (or rather thine own Conscience at Death) what ailed thee to sin away so many hours, without either Praying, Reading, or Meditating<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? Now have yee any thing to answer when Death shall present this Challenge to you? I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you premedita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e what ye will say: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you prevent death by presenting it first seriously to your selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:107527:113"/>II. <hi>Challenge,</hi> That Death will present unto you, will be, for the killing of many precious Convictions which we have had. What will each of you answer at death, when your conscience proposeth this challenge to you? thou met with such a challenge at such a time, and went home and crucified it, when at another time thou met with another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and went home and crucified it: These challenges will be laid home to thy door, therefore think on them.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Challenge,</hi> Death will charge you for a formal hypocriticall way of going about duties: I say your Conscience will then tell you, that ye went to such a Communion with a selfish end: and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> another time ye prayed hyporritically and formally: and what will ye have to answer when ye meet with these challenges? I confesse I know not what ye can answer to these; but I charge you, be thinking what ye will answer, for it may be that these convictions shall ly on your consciences, that even this day ye have heard two searching Sermons, and did meet with some convictions; but made no good use of them; yea, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> may be ye did sleep all the time. O what will ye answer, when it will be said to you, ye went to such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and sleeped all the time: and ye went to such a Communion, but had no other end before your eyes but to be seen of men? I intreat you consider presently what ye will answer to these.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Challenge,</hi> Will be for your breaking
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107527:114"/>
of many precious resolutions. It will be said to some of you, that at the Communion in this place, ye took on vowes, and did break them: I am sure ye cannot question the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of this challenge: therefore see what ye will answer?</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Challenge,</hi> Ye slighted many precious offers of the Gospel; O men and women in this city, what will ye answer to this? I was often exhorted to take Christ, and yet would never take him; What will Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence say to that, when death shall table it before you? I tell you what ye must then answer, O cursed I, that ever refused Christ in the Gospel, and ye shall then be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded because this is your sin. (Believe me) there was never an offer of this everlasting Gospel, and of Christ in it made unto you, that shall not at death (before or after) be brought to your remembrance; and O how sad and doleful will it be to you, when Christ shall open the book where your sins are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and begin with the sin of slighting the Great Salvation? thus I invited you when you were twelve years old, and ye would not come, I invited you when ye were thirty years old, and ye would not come, I invited you when sixty years old, and ye would not come: What will ye answer to this? Have ye any thing to say? Or must ye not stand speechlesse before your Judge, when he shall put home this challenge unto you, therefore think seriously upon it, how ye will answer to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:107527:114"/>VI. <hi>Challenge,</hi> will be for your sinning oftentimes against Light, and O how sad and painfull a challenge will that be at the day of Death! when it will be said, thou sinned with a witnesse in thy bosome that thou wast doing wrong: thy Conscience will say, oftentimes did I tell thee this is sinfull, yet wouldest thou not abstain from it: And what will ye answer from this?</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Challenge,</hi> Oftentimes ye sinned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every small temptations, and what will ye answer to that? Must ye not then confesse it, and say, O how often have I deserted Christ and imbraced my idols upon a small temdtation? Now I intreat you be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ye will answer to these seven most material Challenges which certainly shall be presented to you at death. I assure you, ye must either answer all your challenges in Christ, else ye will not get them well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. Therefore I would exhort you to imbrace the Gospel and Christ in it: that so let death propose never so many chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye may answer them all as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>viz. God hath made with me an everlasting Covenant,</hi> (and that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all your challenges) <hi>though my house be not so with God, yet I have the everlasting Covenant to build my salvation upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to presse you to make use of Christ, I shall give you these four Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consideration</hi> 1. If ye imbrace not Christ now, Death will be very unpleasant to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107527:115"/>
you. O what else can comfort thee, when going through the region of the shadow of Death, but this, I am Christs, I am Christs? is there any other thing can comfort thee in that day, but only this, <hi>I am Christs, and He is mine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consideration</hi> 2. If ye imbrace not Christ and the Great Salvation now, It will be an hundred to one, if ever ye get time or libertie to do it, when ye are going to die. For although many delay their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Christ till death, yet scarcely one of a hundred getteth favour to grip Christ at death: therefore think on it, for ye will not get your mind so composed at death as ye imagine, nor all things done as ye suppose: therefore now imbrace the Great Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consideration</hi> 3. If ye delay your closing with Christ, till death seise upon you, ye shall never be able to make up that losse, <hi>For will the dead rise and praise God? Or shall any come from the land of forgetfulnesse, to take hold upon a crucified Saviour?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, O will ye take him for your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consideration</hi> 4. If ye will take Christ now, he shall be your guide, <hi>When ye are going through the valley and shadow of death.</hi> And O how blessed is the person that can sing that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 14. <hi>This is my God, he will be my guide even unto death.</hi> If ye can sing that pleasant song, O how may ye be comforted, when your eye strings
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107527:115"/>
shall begin to break? O how happy is hee who can say, <hi>Though I walk through the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, yet will I fear no ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> I know that the Lord is with mee.</hi> Now this is the acceptable day, and the year of salvation, therefore do not delay, but imbrace Christ, lest death surprise you ere yee be aware, and so the acceptable day be lost. But unto these who think they may delay till death, I say, surely there are many damned atheists in hell that (sometime) did think as yee think: <hi>I will make all wrongs right when death and I shall meet:</hi> I hope that three dayes repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will satisfie for all my wrongs: for I am sure there are many in hell, who did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get three dayes to think upon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes; Therefore, <hi>O come, come,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Christ presently: Now are yee all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of this truth, that yee shall once see death? Then study a tender walking; for (believe me) there are many of us who shall go thorow death with many bruised bones, because of untender walking before God. We know it is not the multitude of words can perswade you to imbrace Christ, for many of you never minded the thing: but (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve mee) death will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each these things to you in a more terrible manner then wee can do at this time. Therefore I say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o each of you, O prepare to meet thy God; for, if death finde you in an estranged estate from God, I defy the Angels in Heaven to free you out of that estate. And the day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein thou shalt cry out, <hi>O slighter of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107527:116"/>
the Great Salvation that I am, I would give ten thousand worlds for one Sermon again that I once heard, wherein Christ was freely offered to me,</hi> when thou shalt bee tormented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of remedy; Therefore, <hi>While it is to day, harden not your hearts,</hi> for your late wishes shall not bee granted (when yee are gone) if yee make not haste. O therefore <hi>Haste, haste in time, and come out from the land of your captivity, and from the house of your bondage,</hi> and take Christ for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the guide of your youth and old age. Now unto him, who can lead you thorow all these steps betwixt you and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, be eternal praise.</p>
