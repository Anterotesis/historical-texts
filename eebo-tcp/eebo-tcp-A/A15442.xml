            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20726:3"/>
their iust complayntes, that they might vnderstand them and redresse them. For whereas they themselues hauyng shaken of al obedience towards God and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and confounded the generall bonds of naturall and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reason, do both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste all law and lawfull Magistrates, and also (as much as in them lyeth) inforce men either to most miserable thraldome, (of conscience by forsaking God and all godlynesse, and of body by losse of goodes, landes, libertie, wiues, children, lyfe, and good name) or to some meanes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so extreme wretchednesse whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they driue them by streyning them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all abilitie of humane patience: yit most slaunderously they beare the states and potentates of the world on hand, that those most innocent and giltlesse persons, (whiche stand in nothyng but onely that which their Prince hath both graunted and sworne that it should bee lawfull for them to do, and in such wise as he by lyke graunt and othe hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them leaue and commaundement to do, as appeereth most euidently by his solemne Protestation and vowe made at the tyme of his ioyfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

when he was first admitted to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of those countreyes, at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest request and intreataunce of the late Emperour Charles his father, who made the lyke solemne othe Protestation and vowe before him and with him:) are the authors, practizers and workers, of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, confusions, mutinies, vprores, trub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, rebellions, and treazons: only bycause that after suffrance of their excessiue tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; the thrustyng of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their natiue countreys: they giue them not leaue to tread the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly vnder foot as myre, or rather to rid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quite &amp; cleane out of the world, with the Gospell and Religion of Christ.

For no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Iudge condemneth without heering the allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of both parties, nother doth any rightfull Prince permit his subiectes to reuenge their owne wrongs, and much
<pb facs="tcp:20726:4"/>
lesse to oppresse, deuour, and eate vp one an other. Therfore when the hartes of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereine liege Lordes are so shet vppe, and their myndes so alienated aforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by the sinister perswasions of cankerharted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes and sly Sycophantes, which care not whose house be on fire so they may warme themselues by the coales of it, as no truth can haue enterance into their eares or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse into their presence: needes must the people go to wrecke to the preiudice of the Prince, and the people being so wronged ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not but seeke to iustifie the right and truth of their cace, by all good and reasonable meanes, to the church of God, and vnto all such as are not so wholly caried away with blynd and fantasticall affection, but that they haue some abilitie to discerne right and equitie: as may appeere by the treatise heere insewyng. For heere is nothyng sayd or intended to the defence, maintenance or allowyng of any disobedience, disorder, or vnlawfull behauiour of the subiect towards his Prince: but to shewe most humbly and dewtifully both to Prince and subiect, the intolerable inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences that grow by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the mutuall regard that eche of
<pb facs="tcp:20726:4"/>

            <p>And forasmuch as in this treatise there is mention made of <hi>a Ioyfull Entrey:</hi> it is necessarie to know what the same was. Therfore it is to be vnderstode, that when soeuer any souereine Lord entered into the possession of dominion ouer the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, whither it were by name of Earle, Duke, or any other title of superioritie: by succession, election, or otherwise: he first tooke a sacred and solemne othe, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the Lawes, Statutes, Customes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Priuiledges of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and not to procure, cause, suffer, or permitte the infrindging, breaking, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, disanulling, impeaching, or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them or any of them, or the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in, setting vppe, or stablishing of any new, without the consent, counsell, aduice, and agreement of the states of the same Countrey, to the benefite and commoditie of the people: before the whiche othe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:20726:5"/>
was in no wise allowed or acknowledged as Lord there. By reason wherof, Charles the Emperour, and his sonne Philippe nowe king of Spayne, to stablishe the continew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of their possession in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, as their predecessours had alwayes done at their first <hi>Entryes:</hi> did lately make solemne and faithfull promis, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, vowe, and othe, as well for their heyres and successours as for themselues, that besides their maynteinyng of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, peace, rest, quietnesse, tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and securitie of those Countreys: they and euery of them should and would keepe, obserue, and performe all the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, Lawes, Statutes, Liberties, and Priuiledges of the same inuiolable, and not bryng in any new customes or orders, or suffer any to be brought in: nor set any Gouerner, Magistrate or Officer ouer them or in authoritie among them, beyng not the same Countreyman borne and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing landes goodes or possessions there: nor call any assembly of the States, nor cause any leuying of money or men of warre: no nor any coyning of money to bee made there, without the consent and aduice of
<pb facs="tcp:20726:5"/>
the States of the same Countrie. And for the more confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and assurance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: after the rehearsall of the particular poyntes and Articles of the said Entrie, (whiche are many) they added in effecte this conclusion folowing: That if they, their heyres, or successors shall by them selues, or by any other, either wholy or partly, doo, or cause to be done, any thing contrary or preiudiciall to the premisses, after what sort soeuer it be: they consent, agree, and graunt to their Prelates, Baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Knights, Townes, Cities, Liberties, and al other their subiectes, that then and from thencefoorth they shall not doo to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their heyres or successors any kind of seruis, nor owe them any duetie of allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any matters wherein they shal haue neede of them, or which they shall desire or require at their handes, vnlesse that vpon reconciliation, satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they be by the states of the same Countries accepted new againe. And to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they decreed and ordeyned, that all officers appoynted or placed contrary to the faythful purport and true meanyng of this their sayd Entrie, should be dischargcd &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20726:6"/>
displaced: and likewise that what soeuer thing were or should be done or attempted in preiudice or impeachment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, should be esteemed as voyde and of none effecte. In witnesse and euerlastyng confirmation whereof, the said Emperour &amp; the Prince his sonne did set their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and seales to the sayd othe in writyng, at Louane the fift day of Iuly. 1549. <hi>And this is it that is called the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful entrie.</hi> Whereby, and by many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentes of their stories, (whiche make mention how the people of those Countries haue refuzed, renounced, reiected, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and depozed diuers of their Lords &amp; soueraignes for their misgouernment, and for infrindging their sayd othe: and in their places elected, appoynted, set vp, and established others, of whose Iustice they had better opinion aud likelyhood: which thyng notwithstandyng they haue not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doo, but vpon most vrgent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessitie, after long sufferance and seking of redresse by all reasonable meanes with most duetifull iutreatance, submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, supplication, and humilitie:) It may playnly appeare, that the state of the lowe
<pb facs="tcp:20726:6"/>
Countreys is not an absolute Monarchie or heritable kingdome, after the maner of this Realme, and of Fraunce, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like: but a State with condition, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and not to continue any longer than the Lorde whom they doo so accept, vpon hope of his good gouernment, dooth continue in reignyng and rulyng accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to his oth taken at his entrie. Which if he violate, then are they by the same his othe discharged of their subiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to hym, and haue full authoritie and free libertie both to resist hym and his Officers, and also to chooze and take to them any other head or Soueraigne that wyll be more frendly and beneficiall to their Countrey, as appeareth by that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and autentike deede of Duke Iohn, dated at Louane the fourth of Maye. 1420. and by diuers other Records to the same effecte. Whereupon it foloweth, that this Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prince of Orendge, and of suche as take his parte, and of the cace wherein they stande, is most iust and rightfull euen in these respectes, though there were no further proofes, wberof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng there are very many in this
<pb facs="tcp:20726:7"/>
treatise folowing. Thus I commyt thee to God, who giue thee the spirite of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to discerne accordyng to truth, that thou be not lead into errour, to allowe the thyng that is euyll, or to condemne the thyng that is good.</p>

And therefore to shewe who haue bin the chiefe ringleaders and authours of the troubles that haue happened in the low Countrey: the onely thyng to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is, who they were that had cause to desire innouation in that Countrey, for any commoditie or profit which they looked for, and were the first beginners and putters therof in execution.</p>
            <p>For the doing wherof, in my opinion it is necessarye to set downe the state of the sayd low Countrey, in such wise as it was before the late troubles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the warres, whiche as well the late

Which state was such, that although in the meane season the people were in some vnquietnesse, by reason of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> and <hi>Iniunctions</hi> that were obserued iu diuers Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the case of Religion, whiche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse augmented dayly more and more through the increase of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and through the rigour of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions</hi>

ayded and counselled the Lorde of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derode, (chiefe of the rebels, as is there pretended) to fortifie his citie of Uiane, against the kyngs maiestie: I confesse, that commyng to Uiane certayne yeres before these alterations, and beyng told by the sayd Lord of Brederode, that his late Lord and Father had inioyned and commaunded hym by his last wyll and testament, to goe foreward with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying<note place="margin">The forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Towne of Vianen.</note> of the sayde Towne, and of his house, lately begonne, desiryng me to geue him myne aduice for the fortifying therof: I confesse (say I) that I dyd so: wherupon it may wel be inferred, that I gaue the saide Lorde counsell to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the last will of his sayd Lord and father deceased: but not that I ayded or counselled any captayne of Rebelles to fortifie the citie agaynst the kynges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.

            <p>And that so much the more, because that in the low Countreys it hath at all times bin lawfull for Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie &amp; liuyng, to furnish &amp; fortifye their

            <p>And if a man looke more neare into the aduice: he shall fynd that it is against all reason and equitie, to grounde any crime of treason thereuppon, because it was not geuen vppon the principall poynt, that is to wyt, whether the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication should be made or no, whereof the Lord of Brederode made no doubt nor scruple at al: but only vpon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme of the fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>Now when report was made to the Regent how I had commaunded the said Lord of Bouxtell to receiue no gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison into the Ile, no not euen though it were sent from her highnesse: I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>By reason wherof, and for asmuch as the other places and Cities of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But I must tell you Madame, that the greatest inconuenience whiche I know to be in this cace at this preset,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20726:62"/>
is that they which are of greatest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and credit about the kyng, (that is to witte the Duke and the <note n="*" place="margin">This Duke is the Duke of Alua: and the Prince is the prince Deboly Ruygomes.</note> Prince) agree well vpon the punishment, but not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meane how to punish them.

and open sight of all Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome.

And for as muche

as I perceyued by good ground, and in very truth, that some of the kyngs and Queenes Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, yea euen of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and oldest sort, (how Catholicke so euer they pretended to be) were myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to serue their owne turnes by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Ambassade, by entryng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to league with those Princes, and so to strengthen themselues in their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie and alyance, I was in some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse for certaine dayes, how to fynde meanes to breake that broode.

I visited him &amp; had long discourse with him about the weightynes of this cace, and the greate inconueniences that it drewe with it to the ruine of the Catholickes of this Realme: and I ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated it in such wise vnto him, as I made it seeme to tend, not onely to the harme of the kyng my maister, but also to the harme of his owne Prince. By meanes wherof I gaue him a colour to attach the said <hi>Iunius</hi> as a subiect borne in the low countrey, so as he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hence the nexte mornyng to a house of the Queenes called <hi>Monceaulx,</hi> where the Court lay. And when he came there, he

sped him so well, that immediatly the kyng &amp; the Queene dispatched a writ to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marshal of their house, to put the said Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ambassadours in prison who were as then in the towne, and to seaze their letters, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunces, &amp; Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Specially for asmuch as they perceiued themselues to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used new agayne, in that in sted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes for the sayd wrong, they were very ill intreated at the Court, when they came to haue audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; afterward mocked for their labour, by meanes wherof they thought that the kyng and the Queene and their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell had small likyng of them: a thyng that cannot but

At leastwise I wil by Gods helpe take such order henceforth, as they shall neuer make their bragges that they haue couzined a Spanyard.

               <p>Besides this, it may please your highnes to vnderstand, (for it is cleare and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly knowen to the most part of the kings
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20726:74"/>
maiesties subiectes, and specially to al men of any good countenance &amp; calling here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes) that both the Emperours maiesty<note place="margin">Mary Queene of Hungary.</note> and also Queene Mary, haue oftentimes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the inhabitantes, as well by word as by writyng, that the Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should not be brought into the lowe Countreys: but that they should be mainteyned and ruled as they had bin of all ancient tyme before. Yea and euen the kings maiestie that now is, to the intent to put that imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the peoples heades, hath ofttymes made the like assurance hym selfe.</p>
               <p>And vndoubtedly Madame, the sayd as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances and promises haue kept his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties subiectes and other dwellers here from fallyng into any alteration, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many men of good wealth and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to forbeare the alienating of their goodes, and the seekyng of any other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they might liue without feare of any Inquisition. And so consequently they haue bin a meane to mainteine the vnion, tranquilitie, trade of Marchandise, and supply of the most part of the treasures for the maintenance of the warres: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as els the Countrey being made bare both of inhabitantes, men, and money, had bin abandoned as a pray to whosoeuer had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to lay hold of it.</p>
               <p>As touching the third poynt, whereby
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20726:75"/>
his maiesty wylleth and commaundeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,<note place="margin">The Iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, Decrees, or Edictes.</note> that the Iniunctions or Edictes made as well by the Emperour, as by hym selfe, shoulde in all poyntes and articles be kept, folowed, and executed, with al rigor, and without any qualification or winkyng at them.</p>
               <p>Madame, (to my seemyng) that likwise is a very hard poynt, because the Iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are many and dyuers, and haue byn li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, qualified, and restrayned nowe and then heretofore, and not pursued with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: in so muche that they were not so sharpe euen in the tyme of the vniuersall misery, as they be now, nother were our people so much inclyned to innouation, as they be now by the instigation and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of our neighbors.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, to vse more extremity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and all at one instant to renue the Inquisition more vehemently, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede on to execution wyth all seueritie: surely Madame, I can not see howe the kynges maiestie shall wyn aught els by it, than to put hym selfe to payne, and the Countrey to trouble, with the losse of his good subiectes hartes, by makyng euery man mistrust, that his maiesty intendeth to goe an other way to woorke than he hath alwayes assured them of and pretended, and to hazarde the puttyng of all thynges

into hys neyghbors handes, as wel by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peoplyng of the Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To auoyde tediousnesse, I omyt the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgyng of many inconueniences in this behalfe, because I know that both his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and your highnesse haue bin aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of them at large already. Moreouer, (I speake it vnder correction) me thynkes the tyme is very vnfit to styrre the braynes and humors of the people, whiche is too muche disquieted and troubled alreadye with the present scarsitie and dearth of corne. It were muche better (in myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) to deferre and let all alone, vntyll his maiesties commyng, who is sayd to be in preparyng hym selfe hytherwarde. And I woulde to God he were so steaded, as he myght be here with speede, to the intent that by his presence suche order might be taken, as shoulde be expedient for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God and his maiestie, and for the reste and quietnesse of his Countreys and subiectes here. For in caces of trouble, thynges would be remedyed more ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his presence than otherwyse.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, if hys maiesty and your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be styll at one staye, and fully bent to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20726:76"/>
haue all the sayde poyntes folowed to the ful: for as muche as I see clearely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore myne eyes, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be now exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without great hazarde of the ruine of the whole Countrey, (which it may be that his maiesty would haue regarde of, yf he were here:) If it be so that your hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wyll not deferre the Inquisition tyll then, but wyll needes persist in the present executyng thereof: I had leuer that his maiestye shoulde put some other in my place, that can better skyll of the peoples humors, and is better able than I to keepe them in peace and quietnesse: than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the shame that maye lyght vpon me and myne, if any inconuenience should fal vpon the Countrey, vnder my gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and duryng my charge.</p>
               <p>And his maiestye and your hyghnesse may well assure your selues, that I saye not this because I am loth to folowe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, or desirous to lyue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse than as a good Christian: for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doynges can wel beare witnesse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and I hope his maiestye hath well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by experience, that I haue neuer spared eyther body or goodes to doo hym seruice, wherein my desire is to continue styll all my lyfe long. Besides this, if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of the Countrey shoulde goe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse than well, I woulde (for my duetyes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20726:76"/>
sake to his maiesty and my natiue soyle) I woulde (I say) aduenture not onely al the goodes that I haue in the worlde, but also myne owne person, my wife, and my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom euen nature wylleth me to preserue and keepe. Wherefore I beseech you, let it please your highnesse to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it according to your tryed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed discretion, and to take this mine information in good parte, as proceedyng from one that speaketh of earnest affection and good wyll, to doo his maiestie seruis, and to preuent all inconueniences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I take God to witnesse, whom (hauing commended my selfe most humbly to the good grace of your highnesse) I beseeche to giue you long and good lyfe in health. </p>
