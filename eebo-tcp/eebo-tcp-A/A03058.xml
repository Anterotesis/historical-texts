            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Much lesse think we it meet to seek the recommendation of the Muses, for that which himself was confident to have been inspired by a diviner breath then flows from <hi>Helicon.</hi> The world therefore shall receive it in that naked simplicitie, with which he left it, without any addition either of support or ornament, more then is included in it self. We leave it free and unforestalled to every mans judgement, and to the benefit that he shall finde by perusall. Onely for the clearing of some passages, we have thought it not unfit to make the common Reader privie to some few particularities of the condition and disposition of the Person;</p>
            <p>Being nobly born, and as eminently endued with gifts of the minde, and having by industrie and happy education perfected them to that great height of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, whereof his fellowship of Trinitie Colledge in Cambridge, and his Orator-ship in the Universitie, together with that knowledge which the Kings Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d taken of him, could make relation farre above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie. Quitting both his deserts and all the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that he had for worldly preferment, he betook himself to the Sanctuarie and Temple of God, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to serve at Gods Altar, then to seek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:23248:3"/>
of State-employments. As for those inward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements to this course (for outward there was none) which many of these ensuing verses bear witnesse of, they detract not from the freedome, but adde to the honour of this resolution in him. As God had enabled him, so he accounted him meet not onely to be called, but to be compelled to this service: Wherein his faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>full discharge was such, as may make him justly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the primitive Saints, and a pattern or more for the age he lived in.</p>
            <p>To testifie his independencie upon all others, and to quicken his diligence in this kinde, he used in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie speech, when he made mention of the blessed name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to adde, <hi>My Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next God, he loved that which God himself hath magnified above all things, that is, his Word: so as he hath been heard to make solemne protestation, that he would not part with one leaf thereof for the whole world, if it were offered him in exchange.</p>
            <p>His obedience and conformitie to the Church and the discipline thereof was singularly remarkable Though he abounded in private devotions, yet wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he every morning and evening with his familie to the Church; and by his example, exhortations, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements drew the greater part of his parishioners to accompanie him dayly in the publick celebration of Divine Service.</p>
            <p>As for worldly matters, his love and esteem to them was so little, as no man can more ambitiously seek, then he did earnestly endeavour the resignation of an Ecclesiasticall dignitie, which he was possessour of. But God permitted not the accomplishment of this desire, having ordained him his instrument for reedifying of the Church belonging thereunto, that had layen rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated almost twenty yeares. The reparation whereof,
<pb facs="tcp:23248:3"/>
having been uneffectually attempted by publick col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, was in the end by his own and some few others private free-will-offerings succesfully effected. With the remembrance whereof, as of an especiall good work, when a friend went about to comfort him on his death-bed, he made answer, <hi>It is a good work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <l>MY God, I heard this day,</l>
               <l>That none doth build a stately habitation,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>For Man is ev'ry thing,</l>
               <l>And more: He is a tree, yet bears no fruit;</l>
               <l>A beast, yet is, or should be more:</l>
               <l>Reason and speech we onely bring.</l>
               <l>Parrats may thank us, if they are not mute,</l>

               <l>With his train-bands and mates agree</l>
               <l>To meet together, where I lay,</l>
               <l>And all in sport to geere at me.</l>

               <l>Then Money came, and chinking still,</l>
               <l>What tune is this, poore man? said he:</l>
               <l>I heard in Musick you had skill.</l>
               <l>But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then came brave Glorie puffing by</l>
               <l>In silks that whistled, who but he?</l>
               <l>He scarce allow'd me half an eie.</l>
               <l>But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then came quick Wit and Conversation</l>
               <l>And he would needs a comfort be,</l>
               <l>And, to be short, make an oration.</l>
               <l>But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.</l>

            <lg>

               <l>Is but a bubble, and makes thee a boy.</l>

               <l>Strongly and sweetly movest! shall I write,</l>
               <l>And not of thee, through whom my fingers bend</l>

               <l>And put the penne alone into his hand,</l>
               <l>And made him Secretarie of thy praise.</l>

               <l>Beasts fain would sing; birds dittie to their notes;</l>

               <l>To thy renown: but all their hands and throats</l>
               <l>Are brought to Man, while they are lame and mute.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Man is the worlds high Priest: he doth present</l>

               <l>Such as springs use that fall, and windes that blow.</l>

               <l>ANd art thou grieved, sweet and sacred Dove,</l>
               <l>When I am sowre,</l>
               <l>And crosse thy love?</l>
               <l>Grieved for me? the God of strength and power</l>
               <l>Griev'd for a worm, which when I tread,</l>

               <l>Then weep mine eyes, the God of love doth grieve:</l>
               <l>Weep foolish heart,</l>
               <l>And weeping live:</l>
               <l>For death is drie as dust. Yet if ye part,</l>
               <l>End as the night, whose sable hue</l>
               <l>Your sinnes expresse; melt into dew.</l>

               <l>Or cry no more.</l>
               <l>Almightie God doth grieve, he puts on sense:</l>
               <l>I sinne not to my grief alone,</l>

               <l>Which may with thee</l>
               <l>All day complain.</l>
               <l>There can no discord but in ceasing be.</l>
               <l>Marbles can weep; and surely strings</l>
               <l>More bowels have, then such hard things.</l>

               <l>Ev'n endlesse tears</l>
               <l>Without relief.</l>
               <l>If a cleare spring for me no time forbears,</l>
               <l>But runnes, although I be not drie;</l>

               <l>And flesh would fail,</l>
               <l>If my deserts were masters of mine eyes:</l>

               <l>Expell good motions from thy breast,</l>

               <l>When I had gain'd the brow and top,</l>
               <l>A lake of brackish waters on the ground</l>
               <l>Was all I found.</l>

               <l>With that abash'd and struck with many a sting</l>
               <l>Of swarming fears,</l>
               <l>I fell, and cry'd, Alas my King;</l>
               <l>Can both the way and end be tears?</l>
               <l>Yet taking heart I rose, and then perceiv'd</l>
               <l>I was deceiv'd:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My hill was further: so I flung away,</l>
               <l>Yet heard a crie</l>
               <l>Just as I went, <hi>None goes that way</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>And lives:</hi> If that be all, said I,</l>

               <l>COme, bring thy gift. If blessings were as slow</l>
               <l>As mens returns, what would become of fools?</l>
               <l>What hast thou there? a heart? but is it pure?</l>
               <l>Search well and see; for hearts have many holes.</l>
               <l>Yet one pure heart is nothing to bestow:</l>
               <l>In Christ two natures met to be thy cure.</l>

            <lg>

               <l>Yet one, if good, may title to a number;</l>
               <l>And single things grow fruitfull by deserts.</l>

               <l>Thy lusts have made, and not thy lusts alone;</l>
               <l>Thy passions also have their set partitions.</l>
               <l>These parcell out thy heart: recover these,</l>

               <l>The sky his azure mantle gain'd.</l>
               <l>And when they ask'd, what he would wear;</l>
               <l>He smil'd and said as he did go,</l>

            <l>Unlesse they get new conduits, new supplies</l>
            <l>To bear them out, and with my state agree.</l>
            <l>What are two shallow foords, two little spouts</l>
            <l>Of a lesse world? the greater is but small,</l>
            <l>A narrow cupboard for my griefs and doubts,</l>
            <l>Which want provision in the midst of all.</l>
            <l>Verses, ye are too fine a thing, too wise</l>
            <l>For my rough sorrows: cease, be dumbe and mute,</l>
            <l>Give up your feet and running to mine eyes,</l>
            <l>And keep your measures for some lovers lute,</l>
            <l>Whose grief allows him musick and a ryme:</l>
            <l>For mine excludes both measure, tune, and time.</l>

            <l>From times great Chronicle, and hither sent.</l>
            <l>Thus both the Church and Sunne together ran</l>
            <l>Unto the farthest old meridian.</l>
            <l>How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are!</l>
            <l>Who may with thee compare?</l>
            <l>Much about one and the same time and place,</l>
            <l>Both where and when the Church began her race,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:23248:100"/>Sinne did set out of Eastern <hi>Babylon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And travell'd westward also: journeying on</l>
            <l>He chid the Church away, where e're he came,</l>
            <l>Breaking her peace, and tainting her good name.</l>
            <l>At first he got to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and did sow</l>
            <l>Gardens of gods, which ev'ry yeare did grow,</l>
            <l>Fresh and fine deities. They were at great cost,</l>
            <l>Who for a god clearely a sallet lost.</l>
            <l>Ah, what a thing is man devoid of grace,</l>
            <l>Adoring garlick with an humble face,</l>
            <l>Begging his food of that which he may ear,</l>
            <l>Starving the while he worshippeth his meat!</l>
            <l>Who makes a root his god, how low is he,</l>
            <l>If God and man be sever'd infinitely!</l>
            <l>What wretchednesse can give him any room,</l>
            <l>Whose house is foul, while he adores his broom?</l>
            <l>None will beleeve this now, though money be</l>
            <l>In us the same transplanted foolerie.</l>
            <l>Thus Sinne in <hi>Egypt</hi> sneaked for a while;</l>
            <l>His highest was an ox or crocodile,</l>
            <l>And such poore game. Thence he to <hi>Greece</hi> doth passe,</l>
            <l>And being craftier much then Goodnesse was,</l>
            <l>He left behinde him garrisons of sinnes</l>
            <l>To make good that which ev'ry day he winnes.</l>
            <l>Here Sinne took heart, and for a garden-bed</l>
            <l>Rich shrines and oracles he purchased:</l>
            <l>He grew a gallant, and would needs foretell</l>
            <l>As well what should befall, as what befell.</l>
            <l>Nay, he became a poet, and would serve</l>
            <l>His pills of sublimate in that conserve.</l>
            <l>The world came both with hands and purses full</l>
            <l>To this great lotterie, and all would pull.</l>
            <l>But all was glorious cheating, brave deceit,</l>
            <l>Where some poore truths were shuffled for a bait</l>
            <l>To credit him, and to discredit those</l>
            <l>Who after him should braver truths disclose.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:23248:101"/>From <hi>Greece</hi> he went to <hi>Rome:</hi> and as before</l>
            <l>He was a God, now he's an Emperour.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nero</hi> and others lodg'd him bravely there,</l>
            <l>Put him in trust to rule the Romane sphere,</l>
            <l>Glorie was his chief instrument of old:</l>
            <l>Pleasure succeeded straight, when that grew cold.</l>
            <l>Which soon was blown to such a mightie flame,</l>
            <l>That though our Saviour did destroy the game,</l>
            <l>Disparking oracles, and all their treasure,</l>
            <l>Setting affliction to encounter pleasure;</l>
            <l>Yet did a rogue with hope of carnall joy</l>
            <l>Cheat the most subtill nations. Who so coy,</l>
            <l>So trimme, as <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt?</hi> yet their hearte</l>
            <l>Are given over, for their curious arts,</l>
            <l>To such Mahometan stupidities,</l>
            <l>As the old heathen would deem prodigies.</l>
            <l>How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are!</l>
            <l>Who may with thee compare?</l>
            <l>Onely the West and <hi>Rome</hi> do keep them free</l>
            <l>From this contagious infidelitie.</l>
            <l>And this is all the Rock, whereof they boast,</l>
            <l>As <hi>Rome</hi> will one day finde unto her cost.</l>
            <l>Sinne being not able to extirpate quite</l>
            <l>The Churches here, bravely resolv'd one night</l>
            <l>To be a Church-man too, and wear a Mitre:</l>
            <l>The old debauched ruffian would turn writer.</l>
            <l>I saw him in his studie, where he sate</l>
            <l>Busie in controversies sprung of late.</l>
            <l>A gown and pen became him wondrous well:</l>
            <l>His grave aspect had more of heav'n then hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Onely there was a handsome picture by,</l>
            <l>To which he lent a corner of his eye.</l>
            <l>As Sinne in <hi>Greece</hi> a Prophet was before;</l>
            <l>And in old <hi>Rome</hi> a mightie Emperour;</l>
            <l>So now being Priest he plainly did professe</l>
            <l>To make a jest of Christs three offices:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:23248:101"/>The rather since his scatter'd jugglings were</l>
            <l>United now in one both time and sphere.</l>
            <l>From <hi>Egypt</hi> he took pettie deities,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Greece</hi> oracular infallibities,</l>
            <l>And from old <hi>Rome</hi> the libertie of pleasure,</l>
            <l>By free dispensings of the Churches treasure.</l>
            <l>Then in memoriall of his ancient throne</l>
            <l>He did surname his palace, <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet that he might the better gain all nations,</l>
            <l>And make that name good by their transmigrations;</l>
            <l>From all these places, but at divers times,</l>
            <l>He took fine vizards to conceal his crimes:</l>
            <l>From <hi>Egypt</hi> Anchorisme and retirednesse,</l>
            <l>Learning from <hi>Greece,</hi> from old <hi>Rome</hi> statelinesse:</l>
            <l>And blending these he carri'd all mens eyes,</l>
            <l>While Truth sat by, counting his victories:</l>
            <l>Whereby he grew apace and scorn'd to use</l>
            <l>Such force as once did captivate the Jews;</l>
            <l>But did bewitch, and finely work each nation</l>
            <l>Into a voluntarie transmigration.</l>
            <l>All poste to <hi>Rome:</hi> Princes submit their necks</l>
            <l>Either t' his publick foot or private tricks.</l>
            <l>It did not fit his gravitie to stirre,</l>
            <l>Nor his long journey, nor his gout and furre.</l>
            <l>Therefore he sent out able ministers,</l>
            <l>Statesmen within, without doores cloisterers:</l>
            <l>Who without spear, or sword, or other drumme</l>
            <l>Then what was in their tongue, did overcome;</l>
            <l>And having conquer'd, did so strangely rule,</l>
            <l>That the whole world did seem but the Popes mule.</l>
            <l>As new and old <hi>Rome</hi> did one Empire twist;</l>
            <l>So both together are one Antichrist,</l>
            <l>Yet with two faces, as their <hi>Ianus</hi> was;</l>
            <l>Being in this their old crackt looking-grasse.</l>
            <l>How deare to me, O God, thy counsels are!</l>
            <l>Who may with thee compare?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:23248:102"/>Thus Sinne triumphs in Western <hi>Babylon</hi>;</l>
            <l>Yet not as Sinne, but as Religion.</l>
            <l>Of his two thrones he made the latter best,</l>
            <l>And to defray his journey from the east.</l>
            <l>Old and new <hi>Babylon</hi> are to hell and night,</l>
            <l>As is the moon and sunne to heav'n and light.</l>
            <l>When th' one did set, the other did take place,</l>
            <l>Confronting equally the law and grace.</l>
            <l>They are hells land-marks, Satans double crest:</l>
            <l>They are Sinnes nipples, feeding th' east and west.</l>
            <l>But as in vice the copie still exceeds</l>
            <l>The pattern, but not so in vertuous deeds;</l>
            <l>So though Sinne made his latter seat the better,</l>
            <l>The latter Church is to the first a debter.</l>
            <l>The second Temple could not reach the first:</l>
            <l>And the late reformation never durst</l>
            <l>Compare with ancient times and purer yeares;</l>
            <l>But in the Jews and us deserveth tears.</l>
            <l>Nay, it shall ev'ry yeare decrease and fade;</l>
            <l>Till such a darknesse do the world invade</l>
            <l>At Christs last coming, as his first did finde:</l>
            <l>Yet must there such proportions be assign'd</l>
            <l>To these diminishings, as is between</l>
            <l>The spacious world and <hi>Jurie</hi> to be seen.</l>
            <l>Religion stands on tip-toe in our land,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:23248:102"/>Then shall Religion to <hi>America</hi> flee:</l>
            <l>They have their times of Gospel, ev'n as we.</l>
            <l>My God, thou dost prepare for them a way</l>
            <l>By carrying first their gold from them away:</l>
            <l>For gold and grace did never yet agree:</l>
            <l>Religion alwaies sides with povertie.</l>
            <l>We think we rob them, but we think amisse:</l>
            <l>We are more poore, and they more rich by this.</l>
            <l>Thou wilt revenge their quarrell, making grace</l>
            <l>To pay our debts, and leave our ancient place</l>
            <l>To go to them, while that which now their nation</l>
            <l>But lends to us, shall be our desolation.</l>
            <l>Yet as the Church shall thither westward flie,</l>
            <l>So Sinne shall trace and dog her instantly:</l>
            <l>They have their period also and set times</l>
            <l>Both for their vertuous actions and their crimes.</l>
            <l>And where of old the Empire and the Arts</l>
            <l>Usher'd the Gospel ever in mens hearts,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Spain</hi> hath done one; when Arts perform the other,</l>
            <l>The Church shall come, &amp; Sinne the Church shall smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</l>
            <l>That when they haue accomplished the round,</l>
            <l>And met in th' east their first and ancient sound,</l>
            <l>Judgement may meet them both &amp; search them round</l>
            <l>Thus do both lights, as well in Church as Sunne,</l>
            <l>Light one another, and together runne.</l>
            <l>Thus also Sinne and Darknesse follow still</l>
            <l>The Church and Sunne with all their power and skill.</l>
            <l>But as the Sunne still goes both west and east;</l>
            <l>So also did the Church by going west</l>
            <l>Still eastward go; because it drew more neare</l>
            <l>To time and place, where judgement shall appeare.</l>
