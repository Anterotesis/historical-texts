            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which she has by the dexterity of her wit and incomparable curiosity of art highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd, and by this unexpected means: for it hapned, to give an addition to her future happiness, that one Sir GREGORY SHAPELESS, a Mundungo's Monopolist, a paltry-penurious-pecking pinchgut, who had smook'd himself into a Mercenary title of Knightship, set his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon her soon after her arrival here; whom thou may imagine, <hi>Nick</hi>; to be no sooner woo'd then won. But scarcely were their marriage sheets warm; till her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled fancy, having no other bait but Lucre to feed it,
<pb facs="tcp:57286:9"/>
grew cold. And the Mundungo Knight became pittifully Crest-faln: more in love with the World then his Italian Doxy. A divorce she sues and so happily pursues: as by the sollicitancy of her private Ingles, she became whole sharer in his trucking fortunes.

But if he strut in the street, you may command him to come before me the Constable, as I am the Representave Body of the Duke; or before your selves, being the Representave Body of your Constable: and if the Person so taken remain under safe Custody, and he fly, if you overtake him by speed of foot, or by help of the Belmans Mungrel, you may by the Law of Arms lay him by th' Heels.</p>

            <l>YOu see our <hi>Ladies</hi> now are vanished,</l>
            <l>And gone, perchance, unto their Husbands Bed</l>
            <l>Convinc'd of guilt: where if they cannot tame</l>
            <l>Their loose desires, but still retain the Name</l>
            <l>Of <hi>ALIMONY LADIES</hi>; you shall hear,</l>
            <l>They will not forfeit what they hold so dear,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Prohibited delights:</hi> and in that stain</l>
            <l>With blushless dalliance visit you again.</l>
            <l>Nor shall we build on these our confidence</l>
            <l>Who give less reins to <hi>Reason</hi> then to <hi>Sense:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet for redemption of their Husbands Lands,</l>
            <l>Seal our Acquittance with your graceful hands.</l>
