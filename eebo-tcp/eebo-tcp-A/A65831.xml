            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY dear and tender hearted Friends, who truly love the Name of the Lord, and the precious and living Unity and Society of his holy Spirit, whereunto he hath called and gathered us by his invisible Power; you are truly dear unto me in that life which shall never die, and in that love which is stronger then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58876:3"/>
Death, and therein my Soul truly loves all the Faithful in Christ Jesus, and such have been and are my Joy and Crown of rejoycing in him, and such can sympathize one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and bear one anothers Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in all Afflictions, Tryals and Sorrows which befall the Righteous in this short time of our Pilgrimage here on Earth. And my dear and tenderly beloved Friends, though my Spirit be greatly bowed down, and my Heart daily broken before the Lord under my present Exercise and Affliction, in parting with so dear and true a Companion, and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ and his Church, as my dear wife was well known to be; yet I feel secret peace and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lord, in an humble submission to his blessed Will, and in being reconciled to him in all his Ways and Dealings with us, under all such Tryals as he sees meet to bring upon us; as well knowing, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58876:3"/>
to the Lord is the death of his Saints, and that the Lord who gives, he takes away at his pleasure, &amp; none can hinder him, nor may we say to him <hi>What dost thou?</hi> But wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Friends so nearly related have so long lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in that sincere love, unity, concord and tender heartedness one to another as we have done, 'tis a tryal to part, 'tis a day of exercise and heaviness, and requires some time to get thorow it, &amp; 'tis the Lord alone that can effectually relieve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and bind up the broken hearted in such Cases and distressed Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet we sorrow not as those that have no hope of Immortality, or of meeting together in immortal Glory and Felicity hereafter; for Life and Immortality is revealed and come to light in a good measure, and therein have all the faithful Members of the Church of the first Born some spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sense and Union with the Spirits of all just Men and Women, who have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58876:4"/>
faithfully served the Lord in their Generation, and finished their course with Joy; and the real sense of the Sincerity, Love and Zeal of my dear Wife, for the Name of the Lord, lives and has deep impression upon my Heart, and upon the Hearts of many more. She truly loved Truth and Righteousness, and hated Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Deceit, Loosness and Pride: She was plain hearted and true, and of a right Mind &amp; sound Judgment, and near and dear to the Lord; and therefore I always valued her in Truth, &amp; esteemed her as one whom God had effectually endued and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with Wisdom for her Service, which was required of her: She tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tenderly considered the Poor, the Widows and Fatherless, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not her self to serve them that were in distress: She was faithful and kept her integrity to the end, and the Lord has taken her to himself, her Spirit is received into rest with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58876:4"/>
God in Christ: She has obtained that blessed end that Crowns all her Labours, Sufferings and Service. I cannot forget her lively Testimonies and Expressions upon her dying Bed, nor be clear without communicating something of the substance thereof unto you my dear and tender Friends, who knew and truly loved her as she did you; my Soul hath been, and still is deeply affected in the sense and seeling of that tender Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is among you, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and her in her Life time, and with your tender heartedness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and in remembrance of her Life, and Testimony, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Truth she had among you; and therefore recommend unto you some of her living Testimonies, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and Desires to Almighty God for his People, upon her dying Bed, and near her latter end, in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of her real and tender love in Christ Jesus unto Friends, as followeth, <hi>viz,</hi>

Upon some discourse which a Friend had with <hi>Ann Whitehead</hi> of the great service which her Husband was in, and had done for suffering Friends, she answered, <hi>The Lord has blessed and prospered my Husband in his Service, which is great satisfaction to me, and this I shall leave behind me, as that which is satisfaction to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> I never did detain him one quarter of an hour out of the Lord's service,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 23d 5th Month 1686, in the presence of several Friends, she declared, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would not have you too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about me, as to my going hence, I am in the hand of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(and with respect to Friends) I desire the God of Peace and Love may be among all Friends, and that they may be kept in Love and Peace, and Concord, unto which we were gathered in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the same that gathered us in the beginning may always preserve Friends in the spirit of Love, and of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58876:5"/>
a sound Mind,</hi> [these words she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed several times over] <hi>so as the God of Peace and Love may continue with them, and be with them to the end; and as for me, however the Lord shall please to dispose of me I am content in his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Friends Visits she several times acknowledged, as their great kindness and love to her, though her weak Condition for some time could not bear much Company at once. She further declared after this manner, viz. <hi>And as to my Husband, I have signified my mind as to what I would have done, and leave it to him to do as he sees meet, Hee'l do what s just and right. In our first coming together I had an Eye to the Lord, that I might do nothing but what might be accerding to his will, and that I might serve the Lord and his Church; and the Lord has answered my desire: and he has been a tender and true Husband to me, in all respects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have nothing desireable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58876:6"/>
to me in this World save my Husband, but I am content &amp; given up in the will of God, however he shall please to dispose of me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 24th 5th Month 86, being asked, how she was, she said, <hi>I am well, I know nothing in this World, nor that to come, but all's well:</hi> Implying, that all was well with her. A little after again expressing how well she was, and given up in the will of the Lord; and signified her unity with all faithful Friends, as being a living Member of the Body of Christ with them; and her great love to all Friends in the Truth; and though she signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that a sadness had come over her Spirit for two or three Weeks, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that she was ready to Weep (as she said) when any Friends look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her, or spake to her, and that she had been something troubled at it, as not knowing any thing by her self as the reason thereof, but that she was naturally Pensive, (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58876:6"/>
she said) being then clearly got over all that Sadness of Spirit, and over all her Affliction and Pain, insomuch that the more near she drew towards her end, the more chearful she was, her Spirit being greatly revived and comforted in the great love of God, and his tender mercies to her, whose mercies endure for ever to them that fear him.</p>
            <p>This faithful Servant of our Lord Jesus Christ was in such Patience, such Contentedness, such Subjection of Spirit and holy resignation to the will of the Lord, that she appeared no ways burdened with the thoughts of Death, nor concerned, nor in the least troubled about it; Life immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal was over all. But still she was given up in the will of God, desiring others not to be concerned nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about her, if the Lord pleased to take her away, saying, <hi>Let me go away quietly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 25th 5th Month 1686,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58876:7"/>
when her antient and faithful Friend <hi>Mary Stout</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit her, towards evening, being asked, if she knew her, she said, <hi>Yes, very well. 'tis</hi> Mary Stout, <hi>I have my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory very well, and my Understanding is clear, though I am very Weak, but I am given up into the will of the Lord whether to Die or Live, for I have been faithful to him in what I knew both in Life and Death.</hi> When she discerned any Friends troubled, she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, &amp; would say, <hi>There's no cause for you to be troubled, or concerned, for I am well, and in peace, and have nothing to do,</hi> &amp;c. with several more words to the same purpose. Besides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seasonable tender &amp; Christian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Counsel which on her dying Bed she gave in the love of God to particular Friends, (which I pray God may be truly remembered and practiced) and her many weighty and apt expressions in discourse on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occasions relating to Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58876:7"/>
On the 26th 5th Month 86. in the evening, <hi>Ann Whitehead</hi> said to her Husband, <hi>&amp;c. The Lord is with me, I bless his Name, and I am well. It may be you are afraid I should be taken away, and if I be, the will of the Lord be done. Do not trouble your selves, nor make any great ado about me. But my dear, go to Bed, go to Rest; and if I should speak no more words to thee, thou knowest the everlasting love of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the 27th 5th Month 1686, near three in the morning she quietly departed this Life, at <hi>Briget Austil</hi>'s, at <hi>Southstreet</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> her <hi>Husband, Sister Ann-Mary Freeman, Ann Cox, Mary Stout</hi> and <hi>Briget Austil</hi> being present at her departure.</p>
            <p>And now dear Friends, the great tenderness, gravity and solemnity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our tender and loving Friends accompanying her Body to the Burial on the 29th of the 5th Month 1686, did very deeply affect my Heart;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58876:8"/>
Friends love was felt beyond utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you (my dear Friends) this naked account, I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly recommend you all to the grace of God, to preserve you in the unity of his holy Spirit, faithful to serve out your Generation in the love of God, and blessed concord therein. I pray God keep you, comfort and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you with all that's needful for you to the end of your days; and in the end crown all your labours of Love for his Names sake, with a Crown of Life and Glory that fades not away, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>AS to my dear Sister <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> who was greatly beloved in the Lord, by all that knew her aright in the blessed Truth of God, for that she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given up, as a true and faithful Member of his Church, to serve him in constant sincere Obedience, in her Generation and Day, on all accounts, as is well known, whose practice and manner of Life &amp; Conversation, being not only Blameless, but of good Report and Savour amongst Men, from her Youth up; when I was but a Child she took me unto her care, and tenderly educated, and helped
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58876:9"/>
me many Years; and though young in Years then, yet this I can testifie, that her desires and inclinations were always religiously bent to serve the Lord, both in Private and Publick, in that way of Worship her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing reached to, being so given up and devoted to his Service, that her Zeal for the same hath carried her through much hardship of Body, early and late; and in due time the Lord answered the desires of her Soul, in visiting her with his Gospel Day, and powerful Testimony of the glorious Light thereof; which she willingly imbraced, through the Lords goodness and love to her, and gave up to walk in the Light of the Living, and was a Sufferer for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Testimony to the Truth, and found great Peace and Satisfaction, and the Lords presence and blessings in her Faithfulness and Perseverance, and indeed, as a natural Sister, I can say, and that in true thankfulness to

God, I have had great cause to bless the Lord in her behalf, for she was a Treasure to me of great Value, and I can truly say I honoured her as my Mother, and she was not only a blessing to me, but also to my Fathers House, and the Memorial of her is pretious to me, and will be blessed to Generations to come; and now as it hath pleased the Lord to take her hence, and I am deprived of so dear and near a Relation, I am, though in the bowed-downness of my Spirit, before him subjected and reconciled to his will, as knowing he giveth and taketh, and in his own time and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, in whose hand the breath of all is: So she is gone to Rest, and I am fully satisfied her Soul is in Peace and Joy with the Lord eternally.</p>
            <p>Much more might be said of her by me, but her daily Care and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice being so well known by Rich and Poor, Old and Young, I shall forbear inlarging, knowing her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

is with her, and her Works follow her; for she did spend, and was spent to serve the Lord faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Truth and Righteousness to the end of her days; and this I am a Witness of, though one of the meanest in Gods Vinyard, who am by Name</p>

            <head>A Testimony for my dear and wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> whom I dearly loved in the Lord, and that for her Works sake, and for what the Lord had done for her.</head>
            <p>I Had a true knowledg of her in the blessed Truth, according to my measure; she was a blessed Instrument in the hand of the Lord; about some twenty seven Years ago, it was my lot to meet her at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> at the House of <hi>John Feilders,</hi> where we had a Meeting on the first day of the Week, and the Lord was pleased to seaze so upon me, by his everlasting power, through her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that the operation thereof did so open my understanding, and confirm me in the blessed Truth, that I could set to my seal that it was the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58876:11"/>
true and the living way, and the way wherein no Soul could ever be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which day is never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with me, amongst the many other days of the Lords tender Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to my poor Soul in the days of my Distress; and after I came more acquainted with this my dear Friend, seeing her Faithfulness and Uprightness in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and her great care she had of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, it did incline my Heart more and more unto her, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Name of the Lord, who hath quickened and made alive unto himself, and hath made us near and dear one unto another, and hath knit and tyed, and bundled up, and hath united us together in that one Spirit, which is the bond of our Peace, where there is no Rent nor Division, but all one in Christ Jesus our Lord. And this is my Testimony further to her Ministry, that it was living and true, and she was one that never would go
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58876:11"/>
beyond the gift of the Spirit, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways would return into that blessed Power that gave it forth, which was very pretious to all that heard her; and I can truly say that my Soul hath been many a time truly refreshed by her, and in her, and my Heart hath been made right glad, for the which I bless and praise the Name of the Lord forever, who is worthy saith my Soul. She was a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman to the Lord, and to his Truth, and had a Testimony in her Heart against all things that would make a seperation therein; and I can truly say, it was very hard for me to part from her, because of her worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the want of her in the Church and Family of God, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our blessed Woman's Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where she was made very servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable beyond many others, through the gift the Lord had given her; but considering the work is the Lords, and he is alsufficient to carry it on, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58876:12"/>
raise up other Instruments in her place; the consideration thereof is a satisfaction to me, and many more of my dear Friends and Sisters in the Truth, and now she is ceast from her Labours and Sufferings, and is at rest with the Lord, who is her reward for all; but tho she is gone, her Spirit lives in the Hearts of the upright forever.</p>
            <p>There is one remarkable thing brought to my mind, which was the last Testimony of this our dear and wel-beloved Friend <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> at a Meeting at the <hi>Bull</hi> &amp; <hi>Mouth,</hi> a few Weeks before she departed this Life; first signifying' to Friends how she came to the Meeting in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to be refreshed among us, but withal declared, how she was burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see the vanity of the minds of some professing the Truth; and so she went on Exhorting and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, and Testifying against <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> which she saw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58876:12"/>
some young People that came among Friends.</p>
            <p>So it is the desire of my Heart to the Lord that this her Testimony might not be forgotten, but have a living impression upon the Spirits of all those whom it concerns; and in that love which desires the good of all, I rest</p>

            <p>THE one Eternal God, besides whom there is none, has in these last days manifested himself <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, and in us, of a Truth, and all that into the new Covenant are gathered and there abide have his Teachings, and feel his Presence, and in the eating of the Bread that comes down from God discerns the Body, whereof Christ Jesus is head, and know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and everlasting Union with God and all Saints; so when any are removed or fallen asleep, laying down their earthly Tabernacles, our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in Spirit ceases not, nor do we

sorrow as those without hope, but can with Joy remember, and make mention of those that Lived and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the holy Faith, not speaking the praise of the Dead, but of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as this our dear Sister <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> who wrought in God, and her Works follow her; I knew her enterance was at the straight Gate, and had no sooner the sight of the Pearl of great Price, but was willing to sell all for it, so put away that which was delightful to her, tho her own Wotks, &amp; highly priced by others, yet least there should be an Idol in them, were thrown in the Fire by her; yea, all that she thought would stop her in her Enterance, or hinder her walking in the narrow Way, yea her Relations, whom she had manifested much kindness to, yet being contrary to Truth, she seperated from; and thus having cast off that which pressed down, she was not Idle, but testified of the Truth in City and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58876:15"/>
Country, as called of God, and she manifested, that she was in the true Faith, for it worked by Love, I am a Witness thereof, with many more. Before the Womens Meeting was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled she went visiting the young con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced both Rich, and Poor, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exhorting as was needful, and supplying the Poor, and stirring up others thereto, and watching with those that were Sick, and comforting the Parents with their dying Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yea helpful in many States, and had no Reward, nor looked for none, but what she found in well-doing, and I was one that was a partaker of her free Services, which was in and for the Truth-sake, daily stirring up others thereto, that I then said in my Heart, she was worthy to be an Example to all, but by me rather to be Admired then Imitated, for she was so Provident and Endustrious, that tho she spent her time in doing good, yet did not waste what she had, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58876:15"/>
did encrease it every way, having not only an open Heart, but a diligent Hand; but when she came to be a Wife, she was a blessing to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and his Children, as he told me himself, admiring her with many Praises. And since the Womans Meeting came to be settled, in which her Services were very great, as in the Plague time, and after the Fire, necessities being so great, and many, that there was much need of Wisdom and Parts to go through what was required of us, her care, diligence and pains, and readiness in Accounts, and disposing of it more then many, for her abillities therein exceeded most, tho many were willing to work with her, but she only in those things moved the great Wheel that caused the rest to follow, and she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Mother to teach and provide for many, and some have, and may confess and call her Blessed, whose counsel and help raised some Families,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58876:16"/>
and preserved others from Ruin. O let her own Works praise her; but being in my Heart since her Removal, in the Night and in the Day, I could not be clear without making some mention in plainness of that sound Judgment &amp; Wisdom, with Charity, that our God had endued her withal, that as she followed our Lord Jesus Christ, we might be followers of her; but neither I nor any can add unto her, but what is brought to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of one so worthy to be an Example, that the minds of some may be stirred up to like Wisdom, Endustry and Practice of those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in which she did excel; for we have many Daughters among us that have done worthily, but in many things she exceeded us all.</p>

            <head>Mary Stout HER TESTIMONY FOR <hi>Ann Whitehead</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS concerning that true and faithful Servant of the Lord, our dear and wel-beloved Friend and Sister in the Truth <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> there is little need of much to be spoken in Character of her, she was so well known and read in the Hearts of most of the Faithful now in Beeing: But that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come may know what Worthies and Faithful Followers of the <hi>Lamb</hi> the Lord hath blessed this Age withal, who were as the first Fruits unto God in their Age, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58876:18"/>
others also may tread in their steeps, and walk as they walked; therefore it is meet that something should be spoken on this wise, and left upon Record, for the memorial of the Just shall live forever.</p>
            <p>I am very sensible that there are many dear Friends, especially in and about <hi>London,</hi> in whose Hearts the Lord had given her an honourable place, and would give her the right hand of Fellowship, whereupon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very rememberance of her do greatly lament their loss, and are ready to say in their Hearts, with me, <hi>Alass our dear Sister, who shall supply thy place? but that we know him who is al-sufficient, and will fit and prepare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to carry on his own Work, and is able also to pour forth a double porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his good Spirit, (wherewith she was richly endued) upon those who persevere in wel-doing, and continue to the end, as she did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was one of those that came
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58876:18"/>
forth early, even at the beginning and breaking forth of that glorious day, in these our last times, which many of the Righteous have longed to see, but have not seen it; and she received the Truth in the love of it, and did bear her part of the Burden and heat of the Day, and discharged her Place, and performed that service in the Body unto which she was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Faithfulness, and was a true Servant unto the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> of which she was a living Member, her Love and Care extended unto all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the highest to the lowest and weakest Member thereof, and the daily concerns of her Mind, and travel of her Spirit, and continual endeavours, were, that all things might be so managed, and performed, that the Lord might be honoured, and his People so preserved, as that his Truth might prosper and be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through and over all: Thus through her true practicing Religion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58876:19"/>
and constant diligence in the Work and Service of the Lord, she did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to such a state in Christianity, and was grown into such a clearness and soundness of Judgment, and was so impartial therein, that she answered the Witness of God, and gained estimation and true value in the Hearts of the Righteous.</p>
            <p>I shall not descend into particulars to speak what I know of her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, if I should, I could say much, having been anciently &amp; intimately acquainted with her, even above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, and knew the frame of her Spirit, and the singleness and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness of her Heart to the Lord, to be such, that I must needs give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Memory its due, and say, that although I do know many Faithful and Worthy Women, who are dear and precious in the sight of the Lord, and may truly be called Mothers in <hi>Israel,</hi> yet I know none that did exceed her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58876:19"/>
When I look back, and call to mind the time of our first Convincement by the Spirit of Truth, and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Hearts thereby unto the Lord, and one unto another, and how we, with many more dear Friends, have been preserved by and in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sence &amp; feeling of the invisible power of the Lord, in Unity with him, and one with another, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of her departure out of this World, (when several who came forth with us are fallen by the way) I say, the remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is precious, and rejoyceth my Heart, even more then I have words to express.</p>
            <p>And now, as to what was spoken by her when she came to her Death-Bed, I question not but those dear Friends which vvere about her, and vvere longer vvith her then I, have already given a more full and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account then I am able to do; only thus much I must say, that her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58876:20"/>
patience and quietness of Mind, and resignation of Spirit, together with those heavenly expressions of that true Peace and full satisfaction, and assurance of the Love and Favour of God at her Death, doth abundantly evidence &amp; confirm what is written of her Life; for she did certainly die the Death of the Righteous, and her latter End was like theirs, &amp; the close of her Days, and finishing of her Course, doth demonstrate that she had keep the Faith, and that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there was laid up for her a Crown of Righteousness.</p>

People in uprightness, as I can bear my Testimony in Righteousness for her, having been Conversant with her ever since I knew the way of the Lord, as it is now revealed, in and through the Light and Spirit of Christ Jesus in the Heart, which discovers the works of Darkness, and all secret Iniquity; I say, ever since it pleased the Lord in the freeness of his Love and tender Mercy to make known his Truth unto me, it hath been my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to be acquainted with this faithful Servant of the Lord, and I have been exercised with her in many Services relating to the Poor, where I have seen her great Care, Love and Charity extend to many poor helpless Families, as also her Wisdom and Justice in making a difference betwixt the Worthy and the Unworthy, and the honest hearted amongst them blessed the Lord for her; and as there was a care in her to supply their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants, she was always fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

with a word of Exhortation, according as their States required, that they should have their dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon the Lord; so that from my own knowledg, her Exercises were many, and her Travels great for the prosperity of Truth; and I pray God that we who knew her, and are left behind, may follow her steps, as she followed Christ to the end of her days; and some of her last Words that she spoke to me, being near her end, was, <hi>That she was satisfied with the will of the Lord, and did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing to be otherways then it was as to her, for she felt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Lord;</hi> being filled with Joy, she prayed fervenrly for Friends Children, <hi>That the Lord would bless them, and that they might fear the Lord, and grow and walk in the Truth, and be preserved from the Spirit of Pride;</hi> which was the Substance of her last pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Testimony, as many may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.

            <p>ALthough I am satisfied there will be Testimonies many, by them more worthy then my self, concerning our dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> yet can I not peaceably pacifie my own Heart and Spirit without giving in my Mite amongst the rest of my dear Friends and Sisters, whom I know have not buried her Works with her Body; my Testimony is, They shall stand upon Record to after Ages, for I know her savoury Life hath been a help to season many Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and though it hath pleased the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58876:24"/>
Lord to gather her into everlasting Rest &amp; Peace, &amp; by Flesh to be seen no more, yet doth her Righteous Spirit, Life and Testimony live freshly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, blessed be the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Oh, our dear <hi>Ann</hi> cannot be forgotten by us, who knew her, as she was a faithful Handmaid and Daughter of the Lord, and by us truly Valued; for the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to clothe her, with the Kings Daughter, all Glorious within; her righteous Heart loved no false Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but still was labouring to keep Truth clear over all Deceit, always incouraging all, both Privately and Publickly, to serve the Truth in their day with singleness of Heart, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness of Mind, and where-ever she found the Lord was dishonoured by any, and his Truth evil spoken of, she spared not her self, but with, and in his Wisdom she dealt with such, to bring them to a sight of their evil doing; the Lord had surely a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58876:25"/>
great regard unto her for her sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heart in his Service, for I am one with many of the Lords People, that can testifie of her unwearied pains and care in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> like as <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquilla,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls fellow helpers in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, so I know could many of the Lords Servants and Worthies call her in her day; for the Lord was pleased to give large Gifts unto her; because her Heart was right in his sight, and her delight was to improve her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in her Lords Service, laying aside all things else for the sake of that; a true Mother in <hi>Israel</hi> indeed, taking always due care for them that were in want of help, inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; to the simple &amp; honest heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed she was truly tender, and was as Eyes to the Blind, and Legs to the Lame, teaching them, in the way of Life, to the strait path where she had walked and travelled without fainting by the way: I would not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58876:25"/>
leave off without giving her her due in more things then these I have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not being willing to be too large, knowing that many were the Friends that loved her in her Life, &amp; served according to their measure in the ever blessed Truth with her, that would have the same privilidge, in easing of their tender Hearts and broken Spirits as I have; her dear and worthy Husbands loss is great indeed, in his own particular, but that I know his will is resigned to the will of the Lord; I saw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their pure Innocent parting, upon her dying Pillow, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I shall not hastily forget; as she Lived she Died, an honourable esteem she had of him in her Life, so had she to the Last, with great desires that nothing upon her account might hinder his Service; of us that were about her, she took a dear and tender Farewel, with a kind acceptance of our Care and Love to her, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58876:26"/>
was but our reasonable Service and Duty; for in her day the Lord gave her amongst us, and she was a blessed Instrument; and the Lord be good unto us, and keep us in his holy fear, that we may run the Race that he hath set before us, and finish our Course with Joy, as I am satisfied she hath done; Amen, Lord Jesus Amen.</p>

            <p>AS for our dear Friend <hi>A. W.</hi> I have this short Testimony to bear concerning her.

            <p>But when the Lord was pleased to visit this Nation with the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his glorious Truth, she was called in the Morning of that Day, and followed the Lord

fully through many Sufferings and various Exercises, and still grew in the Truth; so that she arrived to a high pitch of divine Knowledg, whereby we may truly say, <hi>Deborah</hi> like, <hi>She became a Mother in</hi> Israel: Her Agency and Usefulness in the Church cannot be better demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then by the many Tears that followed her to the Grave; and as she was filled with heavenly Wisdom, so she increased in humane also, and did not hide her Talent in a Napkin, but spent her self in the Service of the Truth, and was ready to communicate to any that stood in need of her grave Counsel, and of this I know there are many Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; I can for my own part say, I have often had occasion to resort to her, &amp; to receive Advice from her, in many matters of important weight, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found her Advice very success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and as she was thus serviceable to the Church in General, and to many

            <p>A Short Testimony lives in my Heart, and is weighty upon my Spirit concerning our dear and worthy Friend, and dearly beloved of the Lord <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> of whose savory Life and sweet innocent Conversation I was a Witness for a considerable terme of Years, in all which time, since the Lord in his everlasting Mercy brought me into acquaintance with himself, and true nearness with his People, I beheld her Beauty and Comeliness in the Truth, and her inward Adorning,

which was a meek and quiet Spirit, seasoned with Graces, and Vertue, and true Wisdom from above, whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the Lord had largly indued her withal, whereby she was always furnished with a Word in season upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, a true Mother in <hi>Israel</hi> indeed, still making it her greatest concern in her place, that all might be kept in right order in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> and nothing vvanting, tenderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing the young Ones to press forvvard in the vvay of Life and Peace, vvhich might make for their everlasting happiness hereafter, and gently advising and exhorting the elder Women to vvalk as good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, in all Comeliness in their places, that the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ might be adorned by them: These things have I many a time been an Ear Witness to, and my Soul refreshed thereby, &amp; though but one of the least of the Lords

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58876:32"/>
her Life remains in the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newings thereof upon my Spirit, and the same shall continue amongst the Faithful through Ages; she was not to me a Stranger, for besides our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and oneness in Spirit, I knew her personally from my Childhood, and many precious Oppertunities God afforded us, both Publick &amp; Private, so that I had a full knowledg of her these thirty two Years, as my Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city could retain, and can therefore with a good Conscience testifie on her behalf, that she was one whom God had, in an extraordinary manner, visited with the springings of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Day, and furnished her with Wisdom and Gifts beyond many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; she had a gift of Discerning, and so quick and ready in Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, accompanied with soundness of Judgment, which she managed with a Wisdom and Gravity, even to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, all which rendered her hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> where
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58876:32"/>
her Service was very great, and unto which she gave her self up to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, of which Service and Labour, many, upon whom it is since sallen, may I believe testifie for her, and I in particular am a Witness on her behalf; she wanted not, but was larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extensive in her Charity for the Poor, she was always ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Necessitous, she was furnished with Counsel from God to many in Distress both inward and outward, which she readily gave, the same being often accompanied with a good Effect, <hi>for she opened her Mouth with Wisdom, and in her Tongue was the Law of Kindness;</hi> and in Meetings, altho she had excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Matter, and also of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by saying much in a few Words, for she used not many, neither was she forward or hasty to Speak, for I believe it was her care not to prevent or hinder the Brethren in their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for God and his Truth, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58876:33"/>
when any such thing happened it greatly grieved her, for she loved good order in the Church, and made it her business to promote and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, and was her self so subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a heavenly Wisdom, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed her in the right seasons to speak, or to with-hold, even as the same might be of Service in the Church; so that may it not be said, <hi>Many Daughters have done Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously but she excelled us all:</hi> Her constant and long continued care for the Church and Poor, of late (through providence) seemed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and more difficult to her then formerly it had done, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her to desire that some other Women would take upon them some part of that which she had long travelled under, with some desire to with-draw a little by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some Weakuess she found attending her outward Man, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly she went into the Country,

to <hi>Southgate,</hi> where her Weakness encreasing she did in a few Weeks finish her Course, and thither I went to visit her, and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with her in her Sickness, and am sensible that the Lord was with her in a wonderful manner, and furnished her with Patience and Content in her Condition, with a Resignation and holy Submission to his Will, in which frame she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unto the end.</p>
            <p>And now that the Lord, who is the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, would be pleased in Mercy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease amongst us the number of such Labourers in his Harvest, which is the desire of my Heart, and Prayer to God; and that he who did in loving kindness visit me early, even in the Morning of this his blessed Day, and hath preserved me until now, grant an encrease daily of his Wisdom and Counsel unto me,

            <p>AS concerning our dear Friend <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> she received Truth at the first breaking forth of it among us, and was blessed of God, who endued her with many spiritual Gifts and Graces, whereby she became a Blessing to others, and the sweetness of that Life which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through her Earthen Vessel hath often Comforted and Refreshed God's People, who in the sence of that living Power, which plentifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in her, have many times been broke into tenderness before the Lord, and in their Hearts have returned
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58876:37"/>
Praise unto him on her behalf, who was knovvn to be Faithful and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, a true Preacher of Righteons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in her Day; and although she outvvardly be taken from us, and her Body removed to its place, yet her Spirit Lives, and the memory of her Faithfulness, Exercise and Sufferings for Truth's sake, and Labour for the Prosperity thereof, continues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, hath a deep impression on the Spirits of many, and vvill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Churches of Christ, vvhere her Service vvas manifest, as a matter of great Value and Esteem not to be forgotten; for indeed she vvas a Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Israel,</hi> a Nursing Mother to many Children, begotten by the same vvord of Faith, vvhich richly dvvelt in her, vvhereby she vvas strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith Might in the invvard Man, so that she vvas strong in the Lord, and though many Archers shot at her; to Grieve &amp; Wound her Life, yet her Bow always abode in Strength, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58876:38"/>
she was covered by the heaveuly Power of God, out of the Enemies reach, as one of the Lords hidden ones, in favour with him; and I am assured in my Spirit he hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her unto his everlasting Kingdom of Rest and Peace, who was a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Vessel unto him, fit for his use, and to bear his Name forth unto the World, and an eminent Example of Righteousness unto all, who by her chaste Conversation, coupled with Fear and diligent perseverance in the Truth, did adorn the Gospel of our Lord, being as a true Daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> adorned with those inward Ornaments of the hidden man of the Heart, as were the holy Women of old who trusted in God; and she has now finished her Course, fought the good Fight of Faith, and I am satisfied hath obtained a <hi>Crown of Righteousness,</hi> as a reward of her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Labours, which is prepared, not only for her, but for all that love

the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ, a more full Enjoyment of whom she had long been waiting in a preparation for, and as sensible of her Dissolution, or of her Departure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hand, did often Exhort and Admonish Friends to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with that part of the Care which fell on her for the Church, and to diligence in the Lords Work and Business, which she her self was mightily furnished to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of, through the Wisdom given her of God, and in the consideration of our great loss, I have secretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of the Lord, that he would please to pour out of his Spirit on some worthy Instruments to succeed her in his Work and Service.</p>
            <p>This Testimony is part of what rested on my Spirit on behalf of our dear Friend Deceased, who I greatly valued in the Truth, having often felt the distillings and dropping down
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58876:39"/>
of heavenly Dew, and refreshment from her Branch, which springing from the living Vine, brought forth Fruits Savoury and Acceptable, which my Soul did often delight in, and the savour of that virtuous life, which flowed through her Spirit, still is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation unto me, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, I know, will yet be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to all who are rightly sensible thereof.</p>

            <p>AH, my Sister, my worthy Friend <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> who was highly favoured of the Lord, and endued with an excellent Spirit, to follow the Lord fully, and to be serviceable to him, his Truth and People; for the Lord did not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her Heart, but fill it full of his divine Vertue, and as a Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Kingdom, she did bring forth of the Treasure which God had given her, things both New and Old; she fought the Lord in her Youth, and betimes tasted, and was made partaker of his heavenly Grace,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58876:40"/>
so that her Experience was great, and the fresh living Springs of Life did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten run through her, to the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many; and in the spirit of true discerning she did divide the Word of God aright, to the <hi>Poor, Penitent</hi> and <hi>Broken-Hearted, Peace, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness;</hi> but to the <hi>Stubborn, Idle</hi> and <hi>Disobedient, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment;</hi> and indeed such could not stand before her, yet could she bear the Burdens of the Weak, and Suffer with the Afflicted Ones; I have for about twenty seven Years known her, her ability and readiness to serve the Lord in his Church, and more especially in the affairs of the Poor, which she did in much Wisdom and Prudence, not sparing her Person or Substance, when either could be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; indeed it was her Meat and Drink to do the Will &amp; Work of God; she was a chearful Sufferrer for the Name and Truth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and did encourage others so to

do, and to hold out to the end.

            <p>THere was a concern upon me in a short Testimony to give in amongst you, with whom my Soul hath Unity, concerning our dear and tender Friend <hi>Ann White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> that she was a Woman whom the Lord greatly honoured with a large measure of his heavenly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, and in that she was made able to speak aword in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the strengthening of the Weak and the bowed down one, and many living Testimonies she bore amongst us in brokenness of Spirit, and in that heart melting love of God, in which I can truly say, my Soul hath often been livingly refreshed, with the Souls of many more. Friends my Heart is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58876:51"/>
overcome, and my Spirit bowed down at this time, in a living sence of our loss, which indeed is very great, the Lord make it up unto us, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his presence amongst us, and in a sence thereof strength will be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to do the VVork of the Lord acceptably, fot this was the Labour and Travel of our dear and wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend, whilst she was amongst us, <hi>That all be done in Love, in the blessed order of Truth,</hi> and where any thing hapned contrary, it became her Burden, for she delighted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of Truth, and in them that lived in it; this is my Testimony (from a certain knowledg of her) in my measure, though one of the least amongst you; yet as one whom the Lord had reached unto in visiting my Soul in his everlasting Love and Power, in the day of my Affliction, and hour of Temptation which my Soul was under, then did the Lord appear in his unlimitted power for my

preservation, and limitted the power of <hi>Sathan,</hi> so that deliverance was witnessed to my Soul.

            <p>COncerning our dear and wel-beloved Friend <hi>Ann White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> whom I truly Loved and Honoured in the Lord for the Truth's sake. This Testimony arises in my Heart: It was her faithfulness to the Truth that made her truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, that is her Crown, and is now set upon her Head for evermore: She having set her House in order, the Lord hath gathered her, by his gentle hand, into Rest and Peace, where her Reward is sure with him, and through her Faith in Christ Jesus, and her steadfastness in the Truth, she hath obtained a good Report in her Day and Generation: She truly Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Feared and Served the true and living God, being made subject to the Truth through the mighty
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58876:53"/>
Power of God: She was adorned and furnished by the Truth with <hi>a good Understanding, true Wisdom</hi> and <hi>sound Judgment,</hi> to discern between things that differ, whereby she was made a very serviceable Member in the <hi>Church of Chrst,</hi> and a Mother in <hi>Israel</hi> to many Children, ministring the Word in due season, sutable to every State and Condition; and I can truly say, we have been often Refreshed and Comforted together in the Lord, and one in another in our Women's Meetings, where the Weak and Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have been strengthened, and that which was heady &amp; high abased and brought low, and Truth over all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and we as Members, of that one Body, of which Christ Jesus our Lord is the Head, build up together a spiritual Houshhold unto God: And this was the Labour &amp; Travel of our dear Friend and faithful Labourer in the Work &amp; Service of the Lord, who was therein drawn forth to visit us at
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58876:54"/>
our Quarterly-Meeting, at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> the 5th of 5th Month 86. and it was the last publick Meeting she was at amongst us, for she was then weak in Body, yet she was strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might was she enabled to bear a faithful Testimony for the Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such that made a profession of it, and was high and lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the pure fear of the Lord, and that measure of Truth which many had received and been partakers of in the beginning; also signifying of what little value all the <hi>Glory, Pride, vain Fashions, Customes</hi> and <hi>Friendships</hi> of this World are, and how they all pass away, and will not stand any one in stead in the day of account, which will certainly overtake all; therefore she exhorted and laboured in the Word of Truth, that all might be warned against, &amp; awakened out of all those things which grieves the good Spirit of the Lord, &amp; are contrary to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58876:54"/>
the pure mind &amp; will of God, that so your Souls might live to God through your obedience to the Truth, and the operation of his Power (which works in them that believe) to do those things which are acceptable in his Sight, that God over all may be glorified, for he alone is worthy of all Glory and Praise for evermore. Oh, that we which yet remain, may be found following the footsteps of this our dear Friend, as she followed Christ, leaving us a good example in all manner of god-like Conversation: She was a pattern of Wisdom and Sobriety, and her Integrity to God was manifested through her labour of Love, and faithful Service for the Truth's-sake. In her Life time she sought the good of all, and at her Death manifested her Love the same to all, being sweetly kept in a living Injoyment of true Peace and Rest with the Lord, her Love flowed forth uoto all the whole Flock and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58876:55"/>
Family of God, desiring that we might all live in Love, <hi>And the God of Peace</hi> (said she) <hi>be with you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve you and keep you all in true Love Peaece and Unity with himself and one with another.</hi> And in this peaceable frame of Spirit, I am satisfied, that this our dear Friend resigned and gave up to the will of the Lord, as in her Life time, so at her Death, having fought the good Fight, finished her Course, and kept the Faith, and is at Rest with the Lord, and her Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is blest forever.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58876:56"/>
that they might have their Minds exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their own Gift; oh the great care she had to exalt the Name and Power of the Lord over all, and that all might come to feel the Power to administer Life to their Souls: Blessed be the Lord, and Magnified be his pure and holy Name! I have often felt him in the midst of our Assembles as an overflowing Fountain, and that our own have overflowed, to the praise and glory of his Name; this is not to adore the Creature, but that as she was a faithful Follower of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Jesus Christ, so we may be found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her steps; that as I am fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this dear and wel-beloved one hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished her Course, and laid down her Head in perfect Peace with the Lord, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rered into her Rest, it may be so with us: Dear <hi>Ann</hi> is fallen asleep, yet doth her memorial live, and will be had in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembranee. So dear Friends, let us be diligent in our places, and be found good Examples, as dear <hi>Ann</hi> was in her Day, being nursing Mothers, and Patterns of Gravity to those Young Ones that are coming up, that they may have cause to praise the Lord on our behalfs, as a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath on behalf of her that is gone,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58876:57"/>
and we must follow, the Lord knows how soon; therefore dear and wel-beloved, let us in all things be careful, that we set no bad example to any, neither in our Habit or Behaviour; I have seen much in my time, since the Lord convinced me of his ever blessed Truth, that lawful things have not been expedient in Apparel, as well as other things: So dear Friends, this is the true desire of my Heart and Soul, and the breathing of my Spirit, that we may walk so circumspect in our Day, Age and Generation, so that when our Change cometh, we may lay down our Heads in Peace also, to the Praise and Glory of the great Name of the Lord our God, who is worthy of all Honour, Glory and living Thanksgiving, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this time, but henceforth and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

of this VVorld? meeting with him who is the Glory of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom my Soul sought after, through Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dispised by this VVorld, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, oh <hi>Ann,</hi> thou art num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, and shalt everlastingly shine as a Star in the hand of him that sitteth upon the Throne; and though as to the mortal thou art removed, yet art present in the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Church of the <hi>First-Born,</hi> who having washt their Robes in the Blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> with Harps in theis Hands, Sing the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb, Great and Marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty, Just and True are thy Ways, thou King of Saints.</hi>

            <head>A general TESTIMONY for <hi>Ann Whitehead.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DEar Friends in the blessed Truth, to whom this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise may come, we tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly salute you in the Lord, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare and signifie unto you, that though these foregoing Christian Testimonies were written apart by particular Friends, as they felt a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity come upon them, in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Christian Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, holy Example, weighty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and blessed End of our truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and faithful Sister in Christ <hi>Ann Whitehead,</hi> yet the said foregoing Testimonies are so concurrent in themselves, bespaking one and the same spiritual Sence and Judgment in many Witnesses, and so clearly agreeing with the general Sence, Knowledg &amp; Experience of our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens-Meeting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58876:61"/>
in <hi>London,</hi> to whom the Faithfulness, Labour of Love, Care and Diligence of our said Sister was well known, that our said Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth unanimously own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the same to all our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends and Sisters in Christ, of other Womens-Meetings, in this and other Nations. Though God is our record, 'tis not to admire the Person or exalt the Creature above its place, that these things are written &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but to magnifie the Power and Goodness of the Lord our God, and his divine Grace and Gifts in his Creature, as manifest in this his day, who worketh both immediately and instrumentally, as he teacheth and instructeth, both by himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and by his faithful Witnesses, according to his good pleasure. The Holy One in these his VVays and VVorks is not to be limitted, but we ought to admire his great Wisdom, to consider his great Kindness to us
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58876:61"/>
in all his Ways, and daily to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who is the Father of Spirits, that we may both daily feel his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Counsel in our Hearts, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>their Faith</hi> &amp; Christian Example of Love, Peace and Concord, who have thereby left a good Report, and such lively Impressions upon tho Hearts of a Remnant, as may not be raced out, nor easily forgotten. God Almighty preserve us all faithful in his Work and Service, and in his pure Love, blessed Unity, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Order of his holy Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus our Lord, unto the end of our Days, <hi>Amen.</hi>
