         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What is further spoken in the Preface for a lawfull obedience to an unlawfull change of Government, will be touched on in the further prosecution of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. It is said [<hi>The Apostle commands obedience to higher powers, Rom.</hi> 13. and thence it is inferred, <hi>that he speaks not in that place meerly of power or authority ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from persons, but of persons cloathed with that authority.</hi>] The Apostle speaks<note place="margin">Pag. 1, 2.</note> there directly of Authority, of men only in subordination to that Authority; no further than as the executioners of that power, because it is impossible Authority should be exercised, but where men are to manage it. The Apostle in that place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires submission to legall Authority, by whomsoever executed, not to any men<note place="margin">It is not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>

               </gap> the Authour of that Book knows, that those only can be the higher powers, or legall Authority of any Kingdom, which the constitution of that Kingdom makes such, and that only can exact obedience according to the Scripture rule. Now what the Higher powers of <hi>England</hi> are, by the constitution of this Kingdom, is sufficiently known.</p>
            <p>The Apostle commands wives to submit to their husbands, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 22. surely the injunction is for obedience to husbands, <hi>quà</hi> husbands, not <hi>quà</hi> men, indeed not abstracted from their persons, because it is impossible the authority of an husband<note place="margin">Eph. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>What is there urged as the great argument to prove the lawfullnesse of obedience to the present Government, hath been my main deswasive (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Apostles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>obey higher powers for conscience sake:</hi> Had I been convinced that the King in his person had been the <hi>higher powers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and that his personall command <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

have submitted for conscience sake. The great inducement I had to adhere to the Parliament, was (besides the hopes of better reformation) that thorow conviction that lay upon me, both by mine own reason, and Parliamentary practices, that the two Houses of Parliament, in case of the Kings absence, weaknesse or refusall, had in them such a part of the <hi>higher powers,</hi> and supream authority, as to defend, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the people without, yea against the King, doing, commanding or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any thing besides or against the law. And this is that main block, at which I stumble in yeelding obedience to this new power, because I am yet convinced, that they are not the <hi>higher powers</hi> of our Kingdom, to which the Apostle requires obedience.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge a government may be altered (although I think it not safe, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on urgent and evident necessity) to which being altered obedience is required, but it must be done by the <hi>higher powers</hi> still, whom we ought equally to obey in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to an altered, as a continued form; but for any party by force to lay low the <hi>higher powers,</hi> and to exact obedience as to the legall Authority, is to me a sinne.</p>

               <hi>that are, are ordained by God:</hi> to which in the second page of the book is a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>viz. Rulers and those that were in authority were ordained of God:</hi> the Scripture enjoins obedience to powers, to men only as intitled to those powers: the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was ordained by God, not the Rulers, they were constituted by men, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be Gods Ordinance, when the deputing of persons to the exercise of that power may be (at most) but Gods permission: nay, that men in Authority (Rulers in the Apostles expression) are to be obeyed no further then as acting according to that Authority, is the judgement of one much used by the composer of that book. When a Tyrant shall offer violence to his private Subjects. which they can by no other means avoid, they may defend themselves and theirs against that Tyrant as against a thief; when are men properly called tyrants, but when they either usurp or exercise a power contrary to the law and usage of those places where they rule? when a consciencious obedience is required to the Authority, but not to those, who by their own will, or procured force, either usurp or exercise a power besides that Authority.</p>
            <p>Should we grant that men assuming to themselves the place and power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, by what right or means soever they came by it, must be obeyed, surely it would be the greatest inlet to tyranny in the world, and the speediest means of destroying states that could be invented: for then should none govern in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any longer, then their swords and their strength could bear them up.</p>
            <p>Thus much I shall yeeld, That when any shall usurp Authority, by whatsoever title or force he procures it, such may be obeyed in reference to their power, while they command lawfull things, but not in reference to Authority: A man being overpower'd may yeeld for his own safety, but to submit to that usurp'd power, as

            </p>
            <p>From this I shall take a just occasion to speak to those instances there urged, from obedience to whom, the argument is drawn to prove the lawfullnesse of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission now.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> which are mentioned, <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3. how they<note place="margin">Pag. 2, 3.</note> came in by force, yet were obeyed by the people, I shall not trouble my self nor the Reader with any taedious search into, or large recitall of the story, but take it as there laid down, and give a brief answer to it.</p>
            <p>But before I fall upon a plain answer to what is there fallaciously urged, and shew the insufficiency thereof to prove that for which it is asserted: I conceive there will appear such a disproportion between the quoted instances and our present case, that should we grant all the premises, yet the conclusion would not directly follow to prove the question. The most that can be asserted from those examples is, That people did obey a supream power as exercised by those who had no true (at least but a dubitable) title, when the same form of government was still continued, for so it had been for many years before, during the reign of <note n="a" place="margin">Iulius Caesar.

force were put upon them, then the people of <hi>England may lawfully submit to a change of goverument, though beleeved unlawfull:</hi> but they did submit, therefore these may, I will finde no fault with the Syllogisme, because it is of mine own making, although it be the very summe of what is urged: what aequivocall terms there are whereby a spirituall eye would quickly see four terms (at least) in it. I shall discover in mine answer to the severall propositions.</p>
            <p>In the first Proposition, it being hypotheticall, I shall deny the consequence: For 1. A People may possibly do what is not in it self lawfull either for themselves or others to do, <hi>a facto ad jus non valet argumentum,</hi> had the author proved their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission legall, it had been more urgent. Indeed it is said at the end of that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, <hi>We see Rulers put by souldiers into that power which is said by the Scripture to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>be ordained of God, and even to these Rulers men must be subject for conscience sake.</hi> But the Apostle doth not command obedience to these men, but to the <hi>powers,</hi> nay not to any men, but as commanding according to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se <hi>powers</hi> (as was said before) nor is it materiall who put men in, nor what men are put into <hi>powers,</hi> if they are the <hi>powers that are ordained of God:</hi> those that command according to that Authority, must be obeyed: and whatsoever the souldiery of <hi>Rome</hi> did, had the souldiery of <hi>England</hi> (in this tacitely pleaded for) observed that doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we had not been (I think) disputing this question now. But 2. What might be lawfull for the people in the Roman Empire, may not be lawfull for the people of this Kingdome: I finde not in any History that ever they were sworn to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular government as we have been: Things in themselves indifferent are made necessary, when by an oath engaged to. But of that more afterward.</p>
            <p>To the Minor proposition, I shall say 1. That those mentioned had (at least seeming) titles to the Empire. Indeed it is agreed by all Historians I have met withall, that they were first encouraged by souldiers: but what iniquity is in that, if they might pretend a Title? The very end of power and strength is or should be to conserve and recover just right, we have alwaies acknowledged it lawfull and expedient by force of Arms to acquire a rightfull possession illegally detained; But I could wish that this story had been printed and read by the sword-men in this kingdome five moneths agoe, that they might but have thought whether it had been greater honour to be recorded as men, that should guard a King of a doubtfull title to the Crown, or to be storied as men that should bring a King of an indubitable right to the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>I will not here dispute by what title, or according to what law <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> not yet his successour <hi>Octavius</hi> assumed the Empire, but when that government and those governours were received, and acknowledged by the Senate, it became law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to that people. Although Conquest be no true Title, nor durable tenure any longer then strength can keep it, yet compact upon that Conquest, gives a title to the Conquerour, and engageth submission from the other party to those rules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on at, or given out according to that agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiberius</hi> from whom indeed both <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> had their government, did<note place="margin">T</note> not only for a great part of his time, do all he did by the advise of the Senate, but would (at least seemingly) be chosen by the Senate, as not contented secretly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For <hi>Nero</hi> he descended in a direct line on the mothers side, from <hi>Livia Augustus</hi> his wife, and although <hi>Brittanicus</hi> was the naturall son of <hi>Claudius,</hi> yet <hi>Nero</hi> (by <hi>Agrippina's</hi> means) was his adopted son for the Empire, and brought to the Senate, where it was consented unto, that he should have his <hi>togam virilem,</hi> and he called Prince of youth: it being their usage, as far as I have observed in the story, that an Adoptive title assented to by the Senate, hath commonly been acknowledged, when a lineall succession hath been rejected: yea, the Authour seems to grant a kinde of title to <hi>Nero</hi> too, where it is said, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. that <hi>the sentence of the souldiers was followed by the consent of the Senate:</hi> if the Senate had any share in either constituting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring a King, <hi>Nero's</hi> title was hereby established.</p>
            <p>But what is this to our case? A rightfull or doubtfull heir was brought by souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Senate, who among themselves were contriving to alter their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> This heir was received by the Senate, and upon that submitted unto by the people: But doth the Authour think that if the Senate had declared and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yea, promised to preserve the Title of a rightfull Prince, and the souldiers by the advice, counsell, or assistance of some party in this Senate, should imprison or slay their Prince, and take away the Major part of the Senate, only because against their actings, and this minor part relict should alter their government, yea, make themselves without the consent of the people their Rulers, that then the people would or lawfully could have submitted to them as their legall and rightfull gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, nay, would not rather have resisted them, as not being those higher powers, whom they ought <hi>for conscience sake to obey?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed had the King for some reason hid himself (as <hi>Claudius</hi>) or for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons absented himself, and the two Houses of Parliament legally elected, and freely sitting (at such a time esteemed) the <hi>higher powers,</hi> contrived a way for the altering the government, although I should not have proclaimed their wisdome, yea, should have bewailed their sin, in respect of the many ties and bonds of Declarations and Oaths upon them, I think I should have submitted to their power, yet I would not for my Oath's sake (had I liked the thing) have acted in it. In which I think I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eeld more then many Anti-Malignant men in <hi>England</hi> will do: yet how far from our case this is, what hath been spoken will testifie.</p>
            <p>But 2. Had the instance been of <hi>Iulius Casar,</hi> who by meer force and violence, without the least pretence of Title acquired the government, which had better sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49851:4"/>
our businesse, yet I should say, that what submission the people yeelded, and what commands he gave, were in relation to a power which he by force had gotten, and did exercise without any pretence to a legall constituted power, till received and acknowledged by the Senate.</p>
            <p>I confesse should these Rulers now in our Kingdom command submission to them, as to a conquering party, and acknowledge they did by power exercise, what by force they had gotten, I should in that sense submit to them, because not able to defend my self against them: but they call themselves the legall Authority, and <hi>higher powers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> under which notion I cannot submit, because posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to obey what is thus commanded, what soever secret reservation I may have, I doe and must assert their power as lawfull, and their Authority as the legall Authority.</p>
            <p>By this I shall fitly descend to those instances of our Nation, to which what<note place="margin">Pag. 4, 5.</note> hath been already spoken, will give (<hi>me judice</hi>) sufficient answer: For</p>

               <item>1. What submission was given to the Conquerour, was yeelded as to a forc'd power, untill by after-compact it was acknowledged and made legall.</item>
               <item>2.

               <hi>power, and by the same excluded all other from Authority, either that Authority which is thus taken by power must be obeyed, or else all Authority must fall to the ground.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may indeed get themselves the greatest strength, and in that sense may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they cannot illegally get themselves the legall power, nor can they exclude others from their Authority, although by force they may keep them from the exercise of it, A man may be a man, yea a living man, although by the violence of disease, he may be kept from outward actings. An husband may be a husband still although imprisoned and thereby kept from the exercise of his duty to his wife. A Parliament may be a Parliament still, although by violence kept from sitting and executing their Authority. I am so far from thinking that <hi>disobedience</hi> to such <hi>power</hi> will make <hi>all Authority and government fall to the ground,</hi> that I beleeve submission to such will quickly lay all Authority waste: for by the same reason that we obey this altered government and usurped authority now, we must obey any other sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, if another party get more strength, and what an unsetled state and unknown Authority we should then have may easily be judged: nor do I think the Authonr himself would be of the same minde, should the Prince with a potent army get the power into their hands. Surely were this doctrine true, those renowned men shall be rased out of the Calendar for Saints, that opposed the Kings power in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money: nor must such be sequestred who under the Kings power formerly did lend or give whatsoever he required, whether men, money, horse or arms: nor these put out of the Parliament, who obeyed him in sitting at <hi>Oxon:</hi> nay, nor himself neither put to death for doing what was urged against him, if men in power how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they come by it are Rulers ordained by God, and to be obeyed for <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake.</hi>

               <hi>If a Masters mate had thrown the Master over-board, and by power would suffer no other to guide the ship but himself, if the mariners will not obey him commanding aright for the safe guiding of the ship, the ship must needs perish, and themselves with it.</hi> I doubt here is a fallacy, and this case will not concern our question, for I suppose, although I am not so well skilled in the discipline of marriners, as to know that a Masters mate hath a kinde of Title to the government of the ship in case of the Masters mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49851:5"/>
which suits not our condition: But suppose him to have no title, or state the question somewhat nearer our case, That if a party of the Sea-men should throw the Master over-board, and assume to themselves the government of the Ship: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>hall then answer, That if that Mate or this party having the greater strength, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>hould by power enforce and exact obedience of the rest, these ought for the safety of their own lives, although not to obey the Authority, yet to do the commands of the enforcing party, and if ever they come ashoar, to doe what they can to bring such unworthy persons to condigne punishment, who, besides the murder of the Master, would so basely hazard the ship too; But if that mate or party should command the Sea-men to obey them as the rightfull Master, I think (although with submission to better judgements) they ought not, although for the safety of their lives thus to obey them. It is better to lose a naturall life, then a quiet conscience, and a spirituall soul: The greatest advantage will not warrant the least evil. In such a case it would easily be judged both by God and men, to whose fault the losse of the ship should be imputed, either to them that did unjustly require, or those who dared not unwarrantably to do an unlawfull thing. I know not what the sodain fear of unavoidable death might make such men (<hi>de facto</hi>) do, and I can easily think what harsh censures their hazarding or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their lives upon such refusall, may bear from rash and lesse considerate men, as an empty product of meer peevishnesse: but I am confident that a Synod of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and intelligent Divines would conclude, that (<hi>de jure</hi>) they ought rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the losse of all, than call him a lawfull, who is but an usurped master, which they must by yeelding to his or their commands under that notion.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>some speak of a time for settlement, they indeed do rather speak for a time</hi>

               <hi>of unsettlement, for they will have an unsettlement first and a settlement after.</hi> If I mistake not the desires of those who withhold submission to the present power, the Authour of that Book is mistaken in his apprehensions of them: That they desire a settlement (I think) is true, but that they desire an unsettlement first, is besides my thoughts of them; I know it is the grief of their souls, and causeth sad searchings of heart, that ever they were brought into such unsettlements, and thereby put upon such racks of conscience as these are. It is not unsettlement but a deliverance from unsettlement they long for: I scarce see how we can be more unsetled then now we are: Indeed being unsetled, we would use any means for a settlement, although for it's procurement our unsettlednesse were more unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; If a man be at the rivers brink, I would advise him to keep out of the water, but if at once he leap into the middle of the river, I should perswade him to come to the bank, although he wade through much water to come thither: I would counsell a man to prevent distempers, but when the disease is already contracted, I should prescribe some Physick for the safety of his life, although for the present it should more disease him.</p>

               </note> godly men (if but of a contrary judgement, a liberty of conscience formerly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for) are made offendors for a word, would be too large a field to walk in, and besides the swelling of this tract, but give too wide an occasion to further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests. But this shall suffice, that the gentleman a little begs the question in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it justice, for although men may have, or might expect, what he cals justice, <hi>viz.</hi> things in themselves just, yet if he grant, as I have proved, that Authority illegall by which they act, what they do or is done by any under that Authority, although in it self just, yet is not properly justice: Judgement (for I conceive the Authour means <hi>justitiam distributivam</hi>) is then only just, when it is exercised by the <hi>higher powers,</hi> the legall Magistracy of that Kingdome where it is acted. The Hebrews expresse justice by that word, which they likewise use for the usage and custome of that people, that are concerned in it.</p>
            <p>Another argument the Authour useth is, because <hi>People cannot judge of Titles:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod 21. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Josh. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> when they cannot judge, then an usurped Title is true to them, and will exact obedience: but if this be an Argument, then (for <hi>contrariorum eadem est ratio</hi>) when Titles are visibly unlawfull, people are disingaged from obedience. This is our case, where there is not any pretence of Title.</p>
            <p>But some say, <hi>There are Oaths that justifie disobedience to the present government:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> There are indeed severall Oaths that engage us to the continned observance of our formerly established government, and then how far they justifie disobedience to this, let the Authour judge. <hi>That Oaths are sacred bonds and reverend oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and where they do not themselves leave or make us free, we are not to cut or break them in peeces:</hi> I shall equally assert, and could heartily wish it had been as truly practised in the Kingdome as plainly spoken in the book: But seeing there are indeed (as the Authour affirms) <hi>concerning these, faults on both hands,</hi> let us a<note place="margin">Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> little examine the faults he mentions, and see whether there are not other faults too, that he speaks not of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the one side the slieghting of an Oath,</hi> &amp;c. This is a fault indeed: Oaths and Covenants are the strongest engagements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby we can binde our selves either to God or man, if these come once to be sleighted and no longer observed, then they may conduce to the palpable advantage of those that made them, I am afraid that may justly be written upon the door-posts of <hi>England,</hi> what was set in the front of <hi>Davids</hi> song, <hi>Psa.</hi> 12. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>I am loth to misjudge any person, whom I finde so modest, else I should fear that this fault was purposely argued, the more secretly to insinuate another, though not under the name of a fault: It is said, <hi>We finde some part of the Covenant to speak of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> daies of our lives:</hi> as if some part had been but of a temporary engagement:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49851:6"/>
but if I mistake not, the Covenant did in every part of it oblige us to a continued ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of it: we did not swear constantly to keep this part, or that clause, but all our lives to keep this Covenant, which is known to comprehend every part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True it is, that the obligation of some things end, because they can no longer be kept,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> 
               <hi>as that of the Kings person</hi> &amp;c. I grant that the obligation of a people to any thing ends, when that thing obliged to, necessarily, and in its own nature ends; but if men shall by violence put an end to the thing, that thereby the obligation may end too, I doubt such will be esteemed by God as Covenant-breakers; I do not think, that he breaks his Covenant, that doth not preserve the Kings person, when he is dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I think he is guilty, that did not endeavour to preserve it while he was living; had the Covenant, in that part, been observed then, for all that I know, it might have obliged now. A woman promiseth to be faithfull to her husband so long as he lives, but if she, out of love to another man, shall lay violent hands on her husband to end his life, that thereby she might marry another, I beleeve she would scarcely be thought to have performed her promise. A Tenant bargains with his Land-lord to pay him rent for his house, so long as he lives in it: but if he through malice shall pull down the house, that he cannot live in it, and thereby to extinguish his bargain, it may be easily thought what determination the Law would make in such a case.</p>
            <p>What is spoken here of the Kings person, might as well have been spoken of any other part of the Covenant: It is Covenanted to preserve Religion, but if those that made the Covenant should by force extirpate, or by deceit undermine Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: would the Authour think himself or others disingaged from that part of the Covenant, or rather look upon himself as bound to preserve it, while it hath a being? If this liberty should be given, no man would keep any Oath any longer, than he saw good, if it were in his power to put an end to that thing to which he is obliged. But let's see what faults are found on the other hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But on the other side there are other faults: such are the urging of an Oath or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant against enemies, and not against friends in one and the same action.</hi> In this I am wholly of his judgement, and could wish that he had instanced in some things, whereby I might have guessed what aim he had taken, and against what he had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled it. As I would not have any unequally excused, who are equally guilty, so I would not have him free from blame, who imputes guilt to one, when another shall be connived at, or incouraged in the same thing.</p>
            <p>In that clause of bringing Delinquents to condigne punishment: If the Covenant<note place="margin">I</note> engage to bring one to punishment, that raised arms against the Parliament in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> why not another that raised arms against the Parliament in <hi>Oxon</hi> shiere and <hi>Berks</hi> shiere? If according to our Covenant we should preserve the priviledges of Parliament against a malignant party, that would have taken away but Five Members; why not against an Haereticall party that took away above two Hundred? If one party be charged as guilty in not obeying Orders of, but offering violence to the Parliament; why should another be excused as faultlesse, whose disobedience was more manifest, and whose violence was more palpable? or if not altogether so, yet (as the Authour) a slight and diminishing charge of<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49851:7"/>
it upon one, and a vehement and aggravating charge of it upon the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another fault may be, a stiffe insisting on one part, and a neglect or at least silence in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>another part.</hi> This is not alwaies a fault, for when there is no occasion given to speak, silence is no evil; One part may be in more danger to be broken than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a more violent asserting, and stiffe contending for that part is more necessary. If I had two children, the one at home in safety, the other in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, that I were more earnest and industrious for the saving and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this, doth not at all argue lesse love or care to the other. But to take it in the best sense, to pretend much care in the keeping of one part, and in the mean time, to neglect another, I think a fault. As when men are seemingly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent against Popery and Prelacy, yet very indulgent to Heresie and profanesse. When men shall plead Covenant in the preservation of subjects liberties, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Oath for the safety of the Kings person in the preservation of Religion; which in respect of the Covenant are of equall concernment; for although it be pleaded by fome, and granted by all that Religion, yea asserted by others, that the subjects liberties are of greater concernment than the Kings person, it must be <hi>ratione mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>As also when by event two parts of it came to be inconsistent, to choose and inforce</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>the keeping of the higher and lesse necessary part, and to give way to the losse and not keeping of the greater.</hi> Here is to me a <hi>falsum suppositum;</hi> I think it a sinne in any to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it be by him meant, what is talke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> by others, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the safety of the Kings person, and the preservation of Religion are inconsistent, I must declare my dissent in this; for I am yet convinced, that both the truth and honour of Religion might have better been preserved by the safety of his person, and the continuance of our Government, than hitherto it hath been, or for all I see, like to be, by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the one, or taking away of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is another, in racking an Oath or Covenant, to make it speak that which it</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>meant not.</hi> I will adde, there is another fault to stop the mouth of a Covenant, and denying it to speak what it would. Nay, there is yet one more, when men shall put what interpretation upon Covenants they please, or reserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a power to make any other interpretation upon them, than what the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and naturall sense of the words in which they are taken doe afford. Oathes ought to be their own interpreters; we may deceive men, <hi>but God is not mocked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to what I conceive is the main end of what hath been hitherto as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted about Oathes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Is it not a mans undoubted right to have his lawfull Heirs succeed him in his lawfull enjoyments? But now by this Government the Kings Heirs are wholly divested of any possession, and absolutely debarred of that right, which by the usage of the Kingdom belongs to them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Heirs and Successors. If his Heirs be not his Successours, how doth that Oath binde? either the word Successours must be superstuous, or else it must binde Successours as well as Heirs,</hi> &amp;c. If I should grant that the word <hi>Successours</hi> were superfluous, it would not be the only superfluous word in things of that nature; or that it is an exegeticall expression which is not unusuall in all writings both Divine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, the more fully to expresse the same thing by two words: <hi>His Heirs and Successours are conjunctive,</hi> which must necessarily imply, that his <hi>Heirs</hi> according to the usage of this Kingdom ought to be his <hi>Successours:</hi> so that it can binde to no Successours besides the Heir: Indeed should the Line extinguish, then the legall Successour were to be obeyed by that Oath, and yet that too in the continuance of the Government, for he is not properly a Successour, unlesse in the same form of Government; for <hi>without asking Lawyers and Learned men,</hi> he is properly a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> that succeeds any man in the place where he was. If the Agitators in the Army should depose the Generall, and order the Army according to their wills, would they be justly called his Successours, when the frame of their Discipline were altered? This seems partly to be acknowledged by the Authour in the same page, where he instanceth only in those for Successours, which su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But there is one engagement to the former Government yet lies upon us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our Oaths, which is mentioned either in that (before named) or in the Oath of Supremacy, <hi>That no power on earth shall deter or absolve us from the keeping of it,</hi> If so, I would but humbly begge the Authour conscienciously to judge, whether the force or fear of any party, were they stronger than they are, should affright a people into a submission to any other Government, then that to which they have thus sworn.</p>

Those, who were against the irregular actings, the Court-faults, the wicked Counsels of the Father, were for the safety of his person, the preservation of his Rights, and the continuance of his Government: And now the same persons that are for the Rights of the Son, and the continuance of the Government, are as much against the vices and counsels in and about him, as about the Father. Besides it might be said, that the Father was not opposed, untill there was a Parliament, that being the legall means in our Kingdom of resisting Arbitrary and extra-legall power; the King in the intervalls of Parliaments being the chief officer, not to be resisted by private subjects: And certainly I think, were there now a Parliament sitting according to the constitution of <hi>England,</hi> and the Received to the Crown, should act any thing against the known Law, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> would avoid a lawfull thing rather then offend the scrupling consciences of weak brethren: what then is their fault, who do unlawfull things, and thereto engage the dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating consciences of weak Christians?</p>
            <p>Whether both in humane probability, and religious reason, it were not more likely to conduce to Gods glory, to Religions settlement and honour, to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans union and satisfaction, to the Kingdoms peace, to the prevention of danger, and the safety of all (who have not wickedly out-acted all hopes of safety, and are conscious to themselves that their bucket must sink, whensoever Authorities bucket shall arise) to endeavour ere it be too late, to join Authority and Power, Title and Strength together; that as Power may arm Authority, and render it formidable, so Authority might justifie Power, and make that lawfull? Least when the Title shall be claimed, those who may dislike the vices, and oppose any Tyranny (were they legally authorized) of the claimer, yet should not <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake</hi> deny his Right; and those who could like well the pretensions of our new Governours (were they justifiably managed) should not adventure for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions sake to assist their usurpation: Whereby, as by our unwise actions, we have too much justified Malignants actions, and made them our deriders: we may strengthen their hands, and make them our Masters.</p>
            <p>I am confident that if the great managers of our new-work, and the violent assertors of this changed Government would but seriously lay these things to heart, it might make them seasonably retract, what they untimely attempted, and rather finde out waies to settle, then further unsettle the Kingdom, rather to satisfie then disturb the peaceable consciences of religious and unbyassed men (<hi>The Lord prevail upon their spirits.</hi>)</p>
