            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>2. With the extent of ⅓ of the Cord as EC meaſure on the Arch

               <p>3. With another Radius leſs than AC, <hi>viz.</hi> AK draw a ſecond
arch as KL, until it cut the perpendicular EF, and let the Radius AK
be ſo long, that the extent of the Cord betwixt K and L be ſomewhat
longer than EC, and with the ſame extent EC meaſure on this ſecond
arch KR=EC.</p>
               <p>4. From G to R draw a ſtraight Line by poſt 1. 1. <hi>elem.</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ſame by poſt 2. until it cut the Perpendiculars at I and O.</p>
               <p>5. Draw the ſtraight lines AI and AO, and extend them to H on
both ſides, ſo that the one line ſhall be AIH, and the other AOH,
which two Lines ſhall ſect the given angle BAC into three parts or
angles, <hi>viz.</hi> BAH, HAH, HAC.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion, or Problem to be reſolved is, whether theſe three
angles are not equal, and conſequently that the angle BAC is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
into equal angles.</p>
               <p>The apparent demonſtration that is here propoſed to prove it,
followeth.</p>
               <p>In order to the apparent following demonſtration, by way of
Preparation,</p>
               <p>1. Draw the line OI, which ſhall be parallel to EE by 28. 1. <hi>elem.</hi>
and extend it on both ſides, from I to N on the one ſide, and from O
to N on the other, making IN=ON=EC=OI.</p>
               <p>2. With Radius IN, and ON, deſcribe the arches on both ſides
NM until theſe arches cut the lines AC and AB, ſo ſhall the lines or
cords drawn betwixt I and M and O and M, <hi>viz.</hi> IM and OM=EC.</p>
               <p>3. Make the angle IMP=angle MIN by 23. 1. <hi>elem.</hi> and
OMP=MON, and extend the line MP, until it cut the line AI at
P, and AO at P.</p>
               <p>4. Draw the line OP parallel to IM, until it cut MP, whence the
perfect Rhombus OMPI ſhall be formed, having the oppoſit ſide;
paralel and equal, for PM by conſtruction is parallel with OI,
and OP with IM and that the Line OP drawn parallel to
IM can cut the Line PM no where but at P on the line AI
is proved thus. Suppoſe it cut the line PM any where elſe, than
on the line AI on either ſide, it ſhould make PM either longer or
ſhorter than its oppoſit ſide (for the arch drawn by the radius MI,
and cutting the line AI at P proveth MP=MI by <hi>def.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>elem.</hi>)
as alſo OP ſhould be longer or ſhorter than IM, (as the like arch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37417:3"/>
conceived to be drawn by radius OI, and cutting AI at P, proveth
OI=OP by the ſame, <hi>def.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>elem.</hi>) but both theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
are abſurd, making the oppoſit ſides of a Paralellogram to
be unequal, contrary to 34. 1. <hi>elem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the Figure OPMI is proved to be a perfect Rhombus,
having all the ſides equal, whereof the line PI is the diagonal, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved that OP and PM terminate on AI) therefore the angle
OIP (=OIA)=PIM=(AIM) by 8. and 4. 1. <hi>elem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, theſe two Triangles OAI and IAM ſhall be according
to the 4th. prop. 1. <hi>elem.</hi> and ſo ſhall OAI and OAM, for OI=IM
as above proved, and AI is common to both, and the Angle
OIA=AIM as is above proved, therefore by 4. 1. <hi>elem.</hi> AM=AO
=AI, and conſequently by 8. 1. the angles IAM=OAI=OAM,
therefore the given angle BAC is Geometrically triſected by the
Lines AO and AI extended to H. Q. E. D.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> let the Radius be ever ſo much changed betwixt M
and C, taking it at any extent from A, and let ever ſo many Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Arches be drawn from the Center A betwixt IM and GC,
their Cords terminating on the ſtreight Lines MC on the one ſide,
and IG on the other ſhall all be equal, one to another, and to the
Cord GC=<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>BC. as the demonſtration above given proveth, for the
reaſon that proveth the Cords of any 3 Concentrick Arches, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
on two ſtreight Lines to be equal within the limits MI and
GC, being a Trapezia, proveth any other 3 to be equal within the
ſame limits. But if we draw any Concentrick Arches without the
Trapezia IGCM, as with a leſs Radius, than AM, or with a
greater Radius, than AC, the Caſe is altered, and the equal Cords
will not terminate on the ſtreight Line IG, but diviate or depart
therefrom, as both true Reaſon doth prove, and even ocular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
doth ſhew; for though the Eye is not able to judge of a
ſtraight Line, yet when a Line is viſibly apparent to make an Angle
with another Line, theſe two Lines cannot be a ſtraight Line. I
call the Figure IMCG a Trapezia, for it is not any Paralellogram,
becauſe the ſide IG, is not parallel to the ſide MC, but very unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel,
which makes the ſide IG to be longer than the ſide MC, but
this doth not hinder that all the Cords of the Concentrick Arches
drawn betwixt IG and MC are equal, for let them be ever ſo many
within the limits IM and GC, they are all equal, though their
Arches are unequal being from a differing Radius. And though the
demonſtration above given may ſeem ſufficient to prove it, yet for a
further proof, let a Line be drawn, or conceived to be drawn (as in
this Figure it is only conceived) from I Paralel to AC, towards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37417:4"/>
FC and beyond it, all the extream Points of the Cords of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centick
Arches, above mentioned, terminating on the ſtreight line
IG, do gradually ſtill more and more depart from that parallel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the perpendicular IF within the aforeſaid limits, IM and GC,
on the firſt Arch, which I call the primitive Arch; but if we draw
any Arch, without GC by a longer Radius than AC, or within IM
by a ſhorter Radius than AM, the Cords of thoſe concentrick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
if equal, ſhall deviate from the ſtreight line IG, and come
nearer to the Parallel above mentioned, but that within the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezia
above ſaid IMCG, the equal Cords of all theſe Arches ſhall
terminate on the ſtraight line IGI thus further prove. Draw, (or
conceive as drawn in this Figure) a ſtraight Line from C to H pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to IM, and take a Cord of any of thoſe Concentrick Arches
=⅓ of the Cord BC=IM, I ſay it muſt terminate on the line IG,
and neither go without it, nor within it, otherwiſe the ſame extent
cutting the paralel Lines, <hi>viz.</hi> the one parallel to MC, the other to
IM, ſhall make the oppoſite ſides of a Paralellogram unequal
contrary to 34. 1. <hi>elem. Eucl.</hi> as the due Coſideration of the Figure
Will ſhow, and the part equal to the whole.</p>
               <p>I have in the Example of Triſection uſed an obtuſe Angle, becauſe
it is more commodious and eaſie to be done by Manual Operation
in an obtuſe Angle than in an Acute as Experience will ſhow,
though the demonſtration is the ſame both in the Obtuſe and Acute.
Nor is it any juſt exception, that ſome acute Angles being ſmall, can
hardly be triſected by this Method; for when Angles are very acute,
they can hardly be biſected. But the proper Remedy for both is,
when the Angle is ſmall, double or quadruple it, and then biſect or
triſect it, as occaſion requires.</p>
               <p>The Praxis of the Triſection hath theſe following great Uſes.</p>
               <p>By the Triſection of the Angle of 120 degrees we have the true
Mathematical Cord of 40 degrees, and ſeeing it is demonſtrated in
11. 4. <hi>elem. Euclid.</hi> to find the Cord of ⅕ of the Circle,=72 degrees
the ½=36 by ſubſtracting 36d. from 40d. we have the true Cord
of 4 degrees, that biſected gives the Cord of 2 degrees and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
biſected gives the Cord of I degree. Also 40 degrees twice bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
gives 10 degrees, and that again biſected gives 5. and thus
by the Triſection of 120 or 60 degrees, and certain other biſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
a line of Cords truly Geometrical or Mathematical can be made
by plain Geometry, without all conick Sections or Algebra Aequati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and tedious Extractions of Roots, and alſo without any Table
of natural Sines, which never hitherto hath been taught (ſo far as I
ever heard or read) in a plain method, by plain Geometry, ſo as to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37417:4"/>
be made intelligible to any Tiro or Young Artiſt; and yet ſuch a
method is altogether neceſſary for the perfection of Geometry and
Mathematical Learning, that the way to triſect any Angle be known
by plain Geometry, ſeeing many things in plain Geometry require a
true line of Cords, and a true line of Cords cannot be found without
the Triſection of certain Angles, or ſome other Section than Biſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to refer a Tiro, or Young Scholar, to the conick Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and tedious Algebra Aequations and Reſolutions how to
triſect an Angle, or underſtand how to make a true Geometrical
Line of Cords is altogether immethodical, even as much or
more as to referr him to ſome of the difficulteſt Problems in
<hi>Euclid</hi>'s <hi>Elements</hi> to underſtand the demonſtration of one of the
firſt Propoſitions in thoſe Elements. Seeing therefore <hi>Geometry</hi>
as it is one of the beſt natural Sciences for certainty and uſe,
ſo for good Method; and the nature of good Method requireth
that in reaching we proceed to the <hi>more unknown</hi> from and by
the <hi>more known,</hi> therefore to preſuppoſe the knowledge of
<hi>conick Sections</hi> to the knowledge of ſome neceſſary Problems in
plain Geometry, is greatly incongruous and an immethodical Hyſteron
Proteron, which this new Praxis doth Remedy.</p>
               <p>2. By this Praxis of Triſection a Foundation of Method is Iaid to
ſect any Angle given into any other equal parts whatſoever, <hi>even</hi> as
4. 6. 8. 10. or <hi>uneven</hi> as 5. 7. 9. 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an univerſal Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
is formed, as by triſection of the Cord of an Angle, that Angle
is triſected, ſo by quinquiſection of the Cord of an Angle it is quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſected,
and the like of all others.</p>
               <p>3. By the like method a Circle is divided into any number of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts even or uneven.</p>
               <p>4. And, by the like Method, the quantity of any Right-lined An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
can be found in degrees, and odd Minutes, without any line of
Cords by a line of equal parts only, as the diagonal Scale of Inch,
or half Inch or ¼ to a far greater exactneſs than by a line of Cords.</p>
               <p>5. By the ſame, a way is taught how to protract or project any
Angle, whoſe degrees and odd Minutes are given.</p>
               <p>6. Having any one Angle given in any Triangle, and the Ratio of

Triſection of an Angle by a conick Section, and Algebra Aequations,
by teaching the ſame more eaſily by plain Geometry, ſo it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it may prove of great uſe, both in conick Sections, Algebra Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
