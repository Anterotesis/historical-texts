            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Firſt doe acknowledge and profeſſe, that a Generall Aſſembly lawfully called and orderly convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is a moſt neceſſary and effectuall meane for removing thoſe evills wherewith the ſaid Church is infeſted, and for ſetling that order which becometh the houſe of God: and that we wiſh nothing more then a meeting of a peaceable and orderly Aſſembly to that effect. Secondly we acknowledge and profeſſe as becometh good Chriſtians and faithfull ſubjects, that his Majeſty hath authority by his prerogative Royall, to call Aſſemblies, as is acknowledged by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at Glaſgow 1610. and Parliament 1612. and that it is not lawfull to conveene without his Royall conſent, and approbation, except we will put our ſelves in danger to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for ſedition.</p>

but eſteeme this meeting at Glaſgow moſt unlawfull and diſorderly, and their proceedings voyd and null in law, for the cauſes and reaſons following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, before his Majeſties Royall warrant to my Lord Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioner his Grace to indict a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">I</note> free Generall Aſſembly; the uſurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Table (as they call it) by their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives and inſtructions, did give order and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all Presbyteries to elect and chuſe their Commiſſioners for the Aſſembly, and for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods bleſſing to it, to keepe a ſolemne faſt Sept. 16. whereas his Majeſties warrant for indicting of that Aſſembly was not publiſhed till the 22. of that moneth: ſo that they preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and not proceeding by warrant of Royall authority, the pretended Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners being choſen before the Presbyteries were authorized to make election, cannot be reputed members of a lawfull Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>A lawfull Aſſembly muſt not only be indicted by lawfull authority (as we acknowledge this to <note place="margin">II</note> be) but alſo conſtituted of ſuch members as are requiſite to make up ſuch a body.

the Generall Aſſembly, ordaining them to keepe and aſſiſt at the ſame, as in the Aſſembly at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Decemb. 15. 1566. At Edinburgh. 6. March. 1572. At Edinburgh. May 10. 1586. and by a letter written by the Aſſembly March. 6. 1573. to the Regent, earneſtly deſiring his owne or his Commiſſioners preſence, and the Lords of Councell, and the Biſhops at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.

            <p>Giving, and not granting, that the perſons <note place="margin">IV.</note> foreſaid directed Commiſſioners in name of the Clergie to this meeting were capable of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that the ſaid Presbyteries had the authority to direct Commiſſioners to the Generall Aſſembly; yet have they now loſt and fallen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17505:6"/>
from all ſuch right, if any they had, in ſo farre as they have depoſed the Moderators, who were lawfully appointed to governe them, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their Synods, and elected others in their place, contrary to the Act of the Aſſembly at Glaſgow 1610. and Act of Parl. 1612. ordaining Biſhops to be Moderators at theſe meetings, and in their abſence, the Miniſter whom the Biſhop ſhould appoint at the Synode. So theſe meetings having diſclaimed the authority of Biſhops, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their lawfull Moderators, and chuſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without authority, cannot be eſteemed lawfull convocations, that can have lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſending out Commiſſioners with authority to judge of the affaires of this Church.</p>
            <p>And yet doth the nullity of the Commiſſions <note place="margin">V.</note> flowing from ſuch meetings further appeare in this, that they have aſſociate to themſelves a laick ruling Elder (as they call them) out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seſſion and Pariſh, who being ordinarily the lord of the Pariſh, or the man of the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the bounds, doth over-rule in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſaid Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, both by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and their number, being moe then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whereof ſome being ordinarily abſent, and five or ſix or ſo many of them put in liſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, there remaine but a few Miniſters to voice to the election: and in effect the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Clergie are choſen by lay-men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all order, decencie, and cuſtome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Chriſtian world, no wiſe according to the cuſtome of this Church, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17505:6"/>
to follow: the Presbyteries formerly never aſſociating to themſelves lay-elders in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commiſſioners to the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but onely for their aſſiſtance in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and correction of manners, calling for them at ſuch occaſions as they ſtood in need of their <hi>Godly Concurrence,</hi> declaring otherwiſe their meeting not neceſſary, and providing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely that they ſhould not be equall, but few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in number then the Paſtors, as by Act of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at Saint Andrewes April 24. 1582. (where Maſter Andrew Melvill was Moderator) doth appeare. Like as theſe fourty yeares by gone and upwards, long before the re-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Biſhops, theſe lay-elders have not bin called at all to Presbyteries. And by the Act at Dundie 1597. whereby it is pretended that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries have authority to ſend theſe lay-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, it doth no wiſe appeare that thoſe lay-elders had any hand in chuſing of the Miniſters. And this is the onely act of the Aſſembly, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing Presbyteries to chuſe Commiſſioners to the Generall Aſſembly: nor have lay-elders ſate ordinarily in Presbyteries upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe fourty yeeres, and upwards: nor ever had any place nor voyce in the election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for the Generall Aſſembly: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently theſe choſen by them to this Aſſembly have no lawfull power nor authority. <note place="margin">VI.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide, the perſons Eccleſiaſticall pretended to be authorized Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners to this Aſſembly, have ſo behaved themſelves, that juſtly they

may be thought unworthy and uncapable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a ſree and lawfull Aſſembly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that by their ſeditious and railing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Pamphlets, they have wounded the Kings honour and ſoveraigne authority, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated his liedges to rebellion, averring that all authority ſoveraigne is <hi>Orignally</hi> in the <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive body,</hi> derived from thence to the Prince, and that not onely in caſe of negligence, it is <hi>Suppletivè</hi> in the <hi>Collective body,</hi> as being cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate from the Commontie to the King, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulativè</hi> not <hi>Privativè:</hi> but alſo in caſe of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration, to returne to the <hi>Collective body;</hi> ſo that <hi>Rex excidit jure ſuo,</hi> and that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next they are knowne to be ſuch as have either beene ſchiſmatically refractary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to good order ſetled in the Church and State; or ſuch as having promiſed, ſubſcribed, and ſworne obedience to their Ordinarie, have never made conſcience of their oath; or ſuch as have ſworne and accordingly practiſed; yet contrary to their promiſe and practiſe, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiled, to the contempt of authority, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church; or ſuch as are under the Cenſures of the Church of Ireland for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to order; or under the Cenſures of this Church, or conveened, at leaſt deſerving to be conveened before the Ordinaries, or a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Generall Aſſembly, for diverſe tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſerving deprivation: as firſt, for uttering in their Sermons, raſh, and irreverent ſpeeches in

Thirdly, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of mens names in Pulpit, or deſcribing them vively to their reproach, where there was no notorious fault; againſt another Act of the ſame Aſſembly. Fourthly, for uſing Applications in their Sermons, not tending to the edification of their preſent Auditory; contrary to another Act of the ſame Aſſembly. Fiftly, for keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions not allowed by his Majeſtie, without his knowledge and conſent; contrary to another Act of the ſame Aſſembly.

But hereby it doth appeare, how unfit theſe perſons are to be members of a free
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17505:8"/>
and lawfull Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it ſtand with Reaſon, Scripture, or <note place="margin">VII.</note> practiſe of the Chriſtian Church, that Lay-men ſhould be authorized to have deciſive voyce in a Generall Aſſembly. In that Act of Dundie 1597. whereby theſe Elders pretend to have this place, there is no Warrant expreſſed for them, to deliberate and determine. Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aſſiſtance wee approve, being allowed and authorized by the Prince. The Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſence in perſon, or by his Delegates, wee hold moſt neceſſary, to ſee all things orderly and peaceably done; and that he have the chiefe hand in all Deliberations and Determinations. Nor doe wee refuſe that any Intelligent or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man may make remonſtrance of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the reaſons of it, in that way that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him in a Nationall Aſſembly, due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence being kept, and confuſion avoyded. But that any Lay-man, except hee bee delegate by Soveraigne Authoritie, ſhall preſume to have a definitive and deciſive voyce; we eſteeme it to bee intruſion upon the Paſtorall Charge, and without warrant. May wee not therefore intreat my Lord Commiſſioner his Grace, in the words of the Fathers of the Fourth Generall Councell at Chalcedon? <hi>Mitte for as ſuperſtuos.</hi> Nor will a pious Prince be offended with it; but with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the younger will ſay; <hi>Illegitimum eſt, eum qui non ſit in ordine Sanctiſſimorum Epiſcoporum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticis immiſceri tractatibus—</hi>And <hi>Pulcheria</hi> the Empreſſe commanded <hi>Strategus, Vt Clerici,</hi>

            <p>If theſe pretended Commiſſioners, both Lay and Eccleſiaſticall were lawfully authorized, (as it is evident they are not) and for none other cauſe declinable, yet the law doth admit, that juſtly a judge may be declined, who is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuſpect. And of all propabilities, this is the moſt pregnant, when the judge, before he come to judgement, doth give ſentence of theſe things he hath to judge. This made our Reformers proteſtation againſt the Councell of Trent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, and their not compearing juſtifiable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 10. had precondemned <hi>Luther,</hi> as appeared by his Bull, dated 8. <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1520 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by <hi>Paul</hi> 3. dated in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1535. This was the cauſe why <hi>Athanaſius</hi> would not give his appearance at ſome Councells, nor <hi>Hoſius</hi> of Corduba, nor <hi>Maximus</hi> Patriarch of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. But ſo it is, the moſt part, if not all of the ſaid Commiſſioners directed to this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, have precondemned Epiſcopall governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemned, at leaſt ſuſpended obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Acts of the Generall Aſſembly and Parliament concerning the five Articles of Perth, have approven their Covenant as moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be embraced of all in this Kingdome: and not onely have given judgement of theſe things before hand, but by moſt ſolemne oaths have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17505:9"/>
bound themſelves to defend and ſtand to the ſame: as doth appeare by their Covenant, Petitions, Proteſtations, Pamphlets, Libels and Sermons: and therefore by no law nor equity can theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Commiſſioners be admitted to determine in this meeting, concerning theſe perſons and points, which before hand they have ſo unjuſtly condemned.</p>
            <p>Further, with no law nor reaſon can it ſubſiſt, that the ſame perſons ſhall be both Judges and <note place="margin">IX.</note> Parties. And we appeale the conſciences of all honeſt men, if all, at leaſt the greateſt part of the pretended Commiſſioners, have not declared themſelves partie to the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of this Church: for in that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the Biſhops to be their Judges, as being their partie (as their Declinators, Petitions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and Proteſtations do bear) have they not <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel, &amp; ipſo facto</hi> declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be partie againſt Biſhops? Whom they have not onely declined, but perſecuted by their calumnies and reproaches vented by word and writt, in publike and in private, by invading their perſons, oppoſing and oppreſſing them by ſtrength of an unlawfull Combination, for the ſubſcribing and ſwearing whereof, they have by their own authority indicted and kept Faſts, not onely in their own Churches, but where wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men refuſed to be acceſſory to theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and impious courſes, they have by aid of the unruly multitude, entred their Churches, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped upon their charges, reading and cauſing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17505:9"/>
to be read that unlawfull Covenant, by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and menacing compelling ſome (otherwiſe unwilling) out of juſt fear to ſet their hands to it; by proceſſing, ſuſpending, &amp; removing obedient and worthy Miniſters from their places, by the uſurped authority of their Table and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And whereas by all Law and juſtice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons finding themſelves wronged in judgement, have never beene denyed the remedy of declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and appellation: nevertheleſſe not a few of theſe Presbyteries have proceeded againſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry worthy Miniſters, who have declined and appealed from their judgements, without reſpect to this defence: by theſe meanes craftily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diſable them to be Commiſſioners for the Church: directly or indirectly cauſing their ſtipends to be kept backe from them. By which meanes not the leaſt part of the ſubſcribing Miniſters have beene gained to their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>But it is without example uncharitable and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall, that under the pretext of ſummons (the like wherof was never uſed, nor in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the moſt haynous malefactors in the kingdome) they have deviſed, forged, vented and publiſhed a moſt infamous &amp; ſcurrile libell, full of impudent lies and malitious calumnies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arch: and Biſhops of this Church: and have firſt given out from their Table, the order preſcribed in theſe ſubſequent Articles, which we have inſert, that the world may be

Againſt all charity which doth not behave it ſelfe unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor delighteth in the diſcovery of mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, nor take up a reproach, nor backbite with the tongue; much leſſe to write a booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a brother. 2.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17505:12"/>
cauſe and crime: which the ſaid Libell doth not: nameing onely generall calumnies, reproaches, and aſperſions, without inſtruction of any particular, but leaving theſe to be filled up by malitious delation, after they have defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their brethren by publiſhing this Libell: as appeares by the 8. and 11. articles of the ſaid inſtructions. And againſt the order preſcribed by the Aſſembly at Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> April 24. 1582. <hi>whereby it is enacted, that in proceſse of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Miniſters, there be a libelled precept upon fourty dayes warning, being within the Realme, and threeſcore dayes being without the Realme, to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Kirk and ſuch Commiſsioners thereof, as elects and admits the perſon complained of, ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to compeare and anſwere upon the complaint. And in caſe of their abſence at the firſt ſummons, the ſecond to be directed upon the like warning, with certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if he faile, the Libell ſhall be admitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and he ſhall be holden</hi> pro confeſſo. Which forme not being kept in a ſummons inferring the puniſhment of deprivation, the ſame cannot be ſuſtained by the order of that Aſſembly. 4. Againſt common equity which admits ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons only by the authority of that judge before whom the delinquent is to compeare. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſummons directed by the authority of theſe pretended Presbyteries, cannot ſuſtaine, for compearance before the Generall Aſſembly, nor could reference be made from the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Generall Aſſembly, the parties never being ſummoned to compeare before the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,

whereby either in preſence of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in caſe of contumacy, the complaint might be referred to the Aſſembly. That there was no citation before the reference, is cleare, by the ſaid inſtructions. And what a ſtrange and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious forme it is, to inſert ſuch a Calumnious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell in the Presbytery-books, without citing of the parties to anſwere thereto; and to cite Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops before the Generall Aſſembly by the ſaid Libell, by publiſhing the ſame at Churches, to which they had no relation, and were many miles diſtant, we leave it to the judgement of indifferent men. 5. Againſt all decency and reſpect due to men of their place, the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being men of dignity, and ſome of them of his Majeſties moſt honourable privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and knowen to be of blameleſſe converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to have deſerved well, thus to be reviled and traduced, doth redound to the reproach of Church and State, and of the Goſpell whereof they are preachers. 6. Laſtly, to omit many other informalities againſt their owne conſciences, which we charge in the ſight of God, as they muſt anſwere before his great and fearefull tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, if they ſuſpect and know not perfectly, according to the judgement of charity, them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thus accuſe, to be free of theſe crimes wherewith they charge them, at leaſt of many of them; as appeares evidently by the 11 article of the ſaid inſtructions, having therein libelled the generall, and have yet to ſeeke the ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, from the malice of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17505:13"/>
if ſo be they can furniſh it. By which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formall and malitious proceeding, it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that our ſaid parties do ſeek our diſgrace and overthrow, moſt malitiouſly and illegally. And therefore we call heaven and earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if this be not a barbarous and violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, that all circumſtances being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hath few or none to parallell it, ſince the beginning of Chriſtianity: and if we have not juſt cauſe to decline the ſaid pretended Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, as our party.</p>
            <p>Moreover, can theſe men expect, but in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Aſſembly they were to be called and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their enorme tranſgreſſions foreſaid? And will any man thinke, that they can be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their owne cauſe? It is alledged out of the Canon-law, againſt the Pope, that if the Pope be at variance with any man, he ought not to be judge himſelfe, but to chuſe arbitrators. And this may militate againſt them; except they be more unruly then Popes. <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> and all the Eſtates of Germanie with him, did plead this nullity againſt the ſentence and proceeding of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. and of his Councell. And the Archbiſhop of Cullen 1546. did plead the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Paul</hi> 3. his Bull of excommunication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he proteſted, that ſo ſoone as a lawfull Councell ſhould be opened, he would implead the Pope as party, being guilty of many things cenſurable by the Councell.</p>
            <p>But the late Proteſtation doth ſhow the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <note place="margin">X.</note> thereof to be no leſſe injurious to our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17505:14"/>
place and authority, then they are over weening of their owne. For it is againſt reaſon and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Chriſtian Church, that no Primate, Archbiſhop, nor Biſhop, have place nor voyce deliberative or deciſive in Generall Aſſemblies, except they be authorized and elected by their Presbyteriall meetings, conſiſting of preaching and ruling Elders (as they call them) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant or example in the Primitive and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times of the Church.</p>
            <p>This alſo doth inferre the nullitie of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, if the Moderator and Preſident for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">XI.</note> of doctrine, and diſcipline, ſhall be neither the Primate, Archbiſhop, nor Biſhop, but he who by plurality of Presbyters and lay-mens voyces ſhall be elected: which happily may be one of the inferiour Clergie or a lay-perſon, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath fallen out. Whereas Canonically, according to the ancient practiſe of the Church; the Primate ſhould preſide: according to the conſtitution of the firſt Councell of Nice Can. 6. of Antioch Can. 9. and of the Imperiall Law Novell. conſtitut. 123. cap. 10. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our owne Law. For what place in Aſſemblies Archbiſhops and Biſhops had in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian nations, the ſame they had (no doubt) in Scotland, and yet ſtill doe retaine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by ſome Municipall law it hath bin reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which cannot be ſhowne. For the reſtraint of their authority by the Act of Parl. 1592. is reſtored by the Act of Parl. 1606. and 1609. and all acts prejudiciall to their juriſdiction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17505:14"/>
Neither doth that Act 1592. eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Generall Aſſemblies, debarre Biſhops from preſiding therein: nor the abrogation of their Commiſſion granted to them by Act of Parl. in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes imply and inferre the abrogation of that authority which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not from the Parl. but from Chriſt, from whom they received the ſpirituall overſight of the Clergie under their charge: whereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the Preſidentſhip in all Aſſemblies for matters ſpirituall, alwaies with due ſubmiſſion to the Supreame Governour: which is ſo intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally inherent in them, as they are Biſhops, that <hi>huc ipſo</hi> that they are Biſhops, they are Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of all Aſſemblies of the Clergie: as the Chancellor of the Kingdome hath place in Councell and Seſſion, not by any Act or Statute, but <hi>hoc ipſo</hi> that he is Chancellor. By Act of Parl. Biſhops are declared to have their right in Synods and other inferiour meetings; but by no law reſtrained nor debarred from the exerciſe of it in Nationall Aſſemblies: and the law allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops to be Moderators of the Synods, doth preſent a liſt in abſence of the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to whom of right this place doth belong, as ſaid is, out of which the Moderator of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly ſhall be choſen. For is it not more agreeable to reaſon, order, and decencie, that out of Moderators of Synods, a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Generall Aſſembly ſhould be choſen, then of the inferiour Clergie ſubject to them?</p>
            <p>As concerning that Act of the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17505:15"/>
1580. whereby Biſhops are declared to have no warrant out of Scripture; if corruption of time ſhall be regarded, the authority of that Aſſembly might be neglected, no leſſe then that at Gloſgow 1610. But it is ordinary that prior acts of Aſſemblies and Parliaments give place to the poſterior: for <hi>Poſteriora derogant prioribus.</hi> And there paſt not full ſix yeares when a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly at Edinburgh found, that the name of Biſhops hath a ſpeciall charge and function annexed to it by the word of God: and that it was lawfull for the Generall Aſſembly to admit a Biſhop to a benefice, preſented by the Kings Majeſty, with power to admit, viſite, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Miniſters, and to be Moderators of the Presbyteries where they are reſident, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject onely to the ſentence of the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>As for that Act at <hi>Montroſe,</hi> let them anſwer to it that have their calling by that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We profeſſe that we have a lawfull calling by the election of the Clergie, who are of the Chapter of our Cathedralls, and conſecration of Biſhops by his Majeſties conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, according to the laudable Lawes and auncient Cuſtome of this Kingdome, and of the Church in auncient times, and do homage to our Soveraigne Lord for our Temporalities and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him <hi>ſolo Deo minorem,</hi> next unto God in all cauſes, and over all perſons Spirituall or Temporall, in his owne Dominions ſupreame Gouernour.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is moſt manifeſt by the premiſſes, <note place="margin">XII.</note> how abſurd it is, and contrary to all reaſon and practiſe of the Chriſtian Church, that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops ſhall be judged by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and more abſurd that they ſhould be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a mixt meeting of Presbyters and Laicks, conveening without lawfull authority of the Church. How, and by whom, they are to be judged, according to the cuſtome of auncient times, may be ſeene by the Counſell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, <hi>Can.</hi> 9. and <hi>Concil. Milevit.

Nor do we decline the lawfull tryall of any competent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory in the Kingdome, eſpecially of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly lawfully conſtitute, or of his Majeſties high Commiſſioner, for any thing in life or doctrine can be laid to our charge: onely we declare and affirme, that it is againſt order,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17505:16"/>
decency, and Scripture, that we ſhould be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Presbyters or by Laicks, without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Commiſſion from Soveraign authority.</p>
            <p>For the reaſons foreſaid, and many moe, and for diſcharge of our duty to God, to his Church, and to our Sacred Soveraigne, leſt by our ſilence we betray the Churche's right, his Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and our owne conſciences, We for our ſelves, and in name of the Church of Scotland, are forced to proteſt, that this Aſſembly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and holden null in Law Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: and that no Church-man be holden to appeare before, aſſiſt or approve it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that no letter, petition, ſubſcription, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor, certification, admonition, or other act whatſoever proceeding from the ſaid Aſſembly, or any member thereof, be any wiſe prejudiciall to the Religion and Confeſſion of Faith by Act of Parliament eſtabliſhed: or to the Church, or any member thereof, or to the juriſdiction, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, priviledges, rents, benefices, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the ſame, acts of Generall Aſſemblie, of Councell and Parliament in favours thereof; or to the three eſtates of the Kingdome, or any of them, or to us, or any of us, in our perſons or eſtates, authority, juriſdiction, dignity, rents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, reputation, and good name: but on the contrary that all ſuch acts and deeds above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and every one of them, are and ſhall be reputed and eſteemed unjuſt, illegall and null in themſelves, with all that hath followed or may follow thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:17505:16"/>
And foraſmuch as the ſaid Aſſemby doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (as we are informed) to call in queſtion, diſcuſſe, and condemne things not onely in themſelves lawfull and warrantable, but alſo defined and determined by Acts of Generall Aſſembly and Parliaments, and in practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: to the diſgrace and prejudice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, authority of the Lawes and Liberties of the Church and Kingdome, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Majeſties authority, diſgracing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practiſe, which he holdeth in the Communion of the Church where he liveth, and branding of Reformed Churches with the foule aſperſions of Idolatry and ſuperſtition: we proteſt before God and man, that what ſhall be done in this kinde, may not redound to the diſgrace or diſadvantage of Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor be reputed a deed of the Church of Scotland.</p>
            <p>We proteſt that we imbrace and hold, that the Religion preſently profeſſed in the Church of Scotland, according to the Confeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, received by the eſtates of this Kingdome, and ratified in Parliament the yeere 1567. is the true Religion bringing men to eternall Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and do deteſt all contrary errour.</p>
            <p>We proteſt, that Epiſcopall governement in the Church is lawfull and neceſſary: and that the ſame is not oppoſed and impugned for any defect or fault, either in the Government or Governours; but by the malice and craft of the

Devill, envying the ſucceſſe of that governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Church theſe many yeeres by paſt, moſt evident in planting of Churches with able and learned Miniſters, recovering of the Church rents, helping of the Miniſters ſtipends, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe jarres betwixt the King and the Church, which in former times dangerouſly infeſted the ſame, keeping the people in peace and obedience, and ſuppreſſing of Popery, which in reſpect either of the number of their profeſſors or boldneſſe of their profeſſion, was never at ſo low an ebbe in this Kingdome, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe ſtirres.</p>
            <p>We proteſt, that, ſeeing theſe who for ſcruple of conſcience did miſlike the Service book, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, which were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or given forth to be the cauſe of the troubles of this Church, have now received ſatisfaction, and his Majeſty is graciouſly pleaſed to forget and forgive all offences by paſt in theſe ſtirres; that all the ſubjects of this kingdom may live in peace and Chriſtian love, as becometh faithfull ſubjects and good Chriſtians, laying a ſide all hatred, envy, and bitterneſſe: And if any ſhall refuſe ſo to do, they may beare the blame, and be thought the cauſe of the troubles that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: and the ſame be not imputed to us, or any of us, who deſire nothing more, then to live in peace and concord with all men under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties obedience: and who have committed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Lawes of the Kingdome and

Church, that may give any man juſt cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and are ſo farre from wiſhing hurt to any man, in his perſon or eſtate, notwithſtanding all the indignities and injuries we have ſuffered, that for quenching this preſent combuſtion, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling peace in this Church and countrey, we could be content, after clearing of our innocency of all things wherewith we can be charged, not onely to lay downe our Biſhopricks at his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties feet, to be diſpoſed of at his royall pleaſure, but alſo, if ſo be, it pleaſed God, to lay downe our lives, and become a ſacrifice for this atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We proteſt in the ſight of God, to whom one day we muſt give account, that we make uſe of this Declinator and proteſtation out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our duty to God and his Church, and not out of feare of any guiltineſſe, whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us is conſcious to himſelfe, either of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe in our lives, or miſcarriage in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; being content every one of us, for our owne particular (as we have never ſhowen our ſelves to be otherwiſe) to under goe the lawfull and moſt exact triall of any competent judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within this Kingdome, or of his Majeſties high Commiſſioner.</p>
            <p>And we moſt humbly intreat his Grace, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed with the Kings Majeſty, that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a free and lawfull Generall Aſſembly, ſuch as Gods word, the practiſe of the Primitive Church, and laws of the Kingdome do preſcribe
