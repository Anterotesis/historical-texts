            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOur Majeſties moſt loyall and obedient Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament, do finde their juſt Apprehenſions of ſorrow and fear, in reſpect of the publike dangers, and miſeries like to fall upon your Majeſtie and the Kingdom to be much encreaſed, upon the receipt of your unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected denyall of their moſt humble and neceſſary Petition, concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Eſpecially grieving, that wicked and miſchievous Councellors ſhould ſtill have that power with your Majeſtie, as in this time of Imminent and approaching ruine; Rather to encline your Reſolutions to that which is apt to further the accompliſhment of the deſires of the moſt malignant enemies of Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of the peace and ſafetie of your ſelf, and your Kingdom, then to the dutifull and faithfull Councell of your Parliament.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they are enforced in all humility to proteſt, that if your Majeſtie ſhall perſiſt in that denyall, the dangers and diſtempers of the Kingdom are ſuch, as will indure no longer delay: But unleſſe you ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly pleaſed to aſſure to them by theſe Meſſengers, that you will ſpeedily apply your Royall Aſſent to the ſatisfaction of their former deſires, they ſhall be enforced, for the ſafetie of your Majeſtie and your Kingdoms, to diſpoſe of the <hi>Militia</hi> by the Authoritie of both Houſes, in ſuch manner as hath been propounded to your Majeſtie, and they reſolve to do it accordingly.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſtie to believe, That the dangerous and deſperate deſigne upon the Houſe of Commons, mentioned in their Preamble, was not inſerted with any intention to caſt the leaſt aſperſion upon your Majeſtie, but therein they reflected upon that malignant party, of whoſe bloudie and malitious practices they have had ſo often experience, and from which they can never be ſecure, unleſſe your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to put from you thoſe wicked and unfaithfull Counſellors, who interpoſe their own corrupt and malitious deſignes betwixt your Majeſties goodneſſe and wiſedom, and the proſperitie and contentment of your Self, and of your people: And that for the diſpatch of the great Affairs of the Kingdom, the ſafetie of your Perſon, the protection and comfort of your Subjects, you will be pleaſed to continue your abode neer to <hi>London</hi> and the Parliament, and not to withdraw your Self to any other remoter Parts; which if your Majeſty ſhould do, muſt needs be a cauſe of great dammage and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>That your Majeſtie will likewiſe be gratiouſly pleaſed to continue the Princes Highneſſe in theſe parts at St. <hi>James,</hi> or any other of your Houſes neer <hi>London,</hi> whereby the deſignes which the enemies of the Religion and Peace of this Kingdom may have upon his Perſon, and the jealouſies and fears of your people may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>And they beſeech your Majeſtie to be informed by them, That by the Laws of the Kingdom, the power of raiſing, ordering, and diſpoſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> within any Citie, Town, or other place, cannot be granted to any Corporation by Charter, or otherwiſe, without the authoritie and conſent of Parliament; And that thoſe parts of the Kingdom which have put themſelves in a poſture of defence againſt the common danger, have therein done nothing, but according to the Declaration and Direction of both Houſes, and what is juſtifiable by all the Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All which their moſt humble counſell and deſires, they pray your Majeſtie to accept, as the effect of that Dutie and Allegiance which they owe unto you, and which will not ſuffer them to admit of any thoughts, intentions, or endeavours, but ſuch as are neceſſary and advantagious for your Majeſties Greatneſſe and Honor, and the ſafetie and proſperity of the Kingdom, according to that Truſt and Power which the Laws have repoſed in them.</p>
