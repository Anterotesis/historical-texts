            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now, I ſhall deſire the Courteous Reader to give Me leave to take this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to wipe this Cuckow's ſpittle (fall'n upon my other Writings) off with my Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As to the firſt Article; If to loſe a Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for His Majeſties ſake; If to loſe Blood and Liberty in His Quarrell; If to vindicate His Majeſties Cauſe and Workes, by Writing in their Defence, and ſuffering ſuch an Impriſonment for thoſe Vindications, be to wrong His Majeſty, then I am guilty of that Crime: Otherwiſe, I know not how I ſhould deſerve ſuch an Asperſion: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Particulars alledged againſt Me were as true as I ſhall eaſily render them to any indifferent Reader Falſe and Ridiculous.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As to the Second; Although I can lay claime to no Illustriouſneſſe in my Family; yet (I thinke) I have enough that will defend Me from Disparagement, or my Perſon from ſuch Obſcurity as the Nameleſſe Gentleman would blind me with, if I onely ſay, I came into the World upon an Account that ſpeakes Me the Sonne of a Peere of this Realme, and that my Mother was a Knights Daughter, and of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Family.</p>
            <p>The Father of Him who Publiſhed the Diſcourſe that troubles the Waſpe ſo much, was ſufficiently knowne, both in the King's Court and the Emperiall City; and by His Writings generally taken notice of, not onely by his Native Countrey-men, but by more Kingdomes than His Soveraigne Master had Scepters over. And this Obſcure Perſon (his Sonne) had the luck to be Thrice in Print, and the Preſſe never
<pb facs="tcp:97485:3"/>
yet Printed any Disparagement to His Pen, nor waſte to His Paper before ever he Publiſhed that Controverſie.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Publiſher thereof thinke the Authour of that Advertiſement either a Courtier, or a Soldier, or a Scholler, or a Gentleman, or a Friend, or an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the King: But He imagineth the Fellow to be one of His late Majeſties Upſtart Friends, that knew no longer how to be His Enemy. So that the Obſcurity may not ſo properly belong to him, who hath ſet downe his Degree, Name, and Dignity to his Pamphlet, as it may to his Accuſer, who taxes a Perſon that had all Three, and hath none himſelfe. Which Pamphlet and which Perſon is already knowne to other Nations and Languages beſides his owne, and in his owne to have ſo much notice taken of him by the Higher Powers, as to be thought worthy of Iron-Grates for the Royall Cauſe; and therefore altogether undeſerving ſuch an Asperſion by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Royalliſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> He ſaith <hi>my Relation was broken and Imperfect;</hi> Who doubts it? I have acknowledged as much my ſelfe in my Epiſtle: It could not be otherwiſe; I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it as it was: I intended it not as a Monument of His late Majeſties Abilities (whereby it ſhould be thought worthy of taking place with the reſt of His Admired Works) but as an Argument of His Conſtancy in His Religion and Sincerity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting a ſtrong Temptation; and I muſt tell this <hi>Nicholas-Nemo</hi> that it is conceived (by better Judgments than his owne) That His Majeſties Anſwers (ſo upon the ſudden) to thoſe Objections (as broken and as imperfect as he makes the Relation of them to be) argued more Acuteneſſe of Wit, and Soundneſſe of Judgment, than any thing that ever he did upon mature deliberation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> His Third Objection, is, <hi>That I compoſed moſt of it my ſelfe—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truely, I compos'd it all: So did he the King's Workes, but he was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any of them: No more was I either of any of His Majeſties Anſwers, or the Marqueſſe's Objections, Beſides what I owne my ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>I publiſhed this Conference divers yeares after the Conference.</hi> Indeed it muſt be divers yeares after the Conference, becauſe it was not the ſame, but could not be many yeares, becauſe it was but Three, nor many months after I had Liberty ſo to doe: Which being agreed by both Parties to be kept Private, I could not Publiſh, till after both their Deaths, as appears in my Preamble to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> The next thing wherewith the Fellow taxeth me, is, <hi>That my Relation was broken and Imperfect.</hi> I have acknowledged it, I have confeſſed in my Epiſtle, <hi>that it had received ſome Tainture by running through my Quill.</hi> I intended no Monument Royall; Onely, a Vindication from thoſe Asperſions that were laid upon His late Majeſty, <hi>viz: That He was a Papiſt in His Heart,</hi> and could no way better Vindicate His Majeſty from that Asperſion, then by Publiſhing His Reſiſtance to ſo ſtrong Temptations.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> Next, He ſaith, <hi>It Agrees not with his Stile, and that I bring in the KING contradicting Himſelfe, as may appeare</hi> (He ſaith) <hi>by His Papers againſt</hi> Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, <hi>and the quoted place of my Pamphlet:</hi> and how is that? <hi>viz:</hi> In His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Paper againſt <hi>Hinderſon,</hi> the late King pleads <hi>the Church to be the Judge of the Scriptures;</hi> and there I bring the King holding <hi>the Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>their own Interpreters.</hi> But was there ever ſuch a Sir <hi>Jarvis Simple</hi> knowne as this Fellow makes himſelf? Either he never Read the Controverſie (and ſo takes it up upon truſt) or elſe he remembers, or knows not what he reads: for otherwiſe he might have taken notice that I own'd that Paper (which he makes to Contradict the <hi>King's</hi> to <hi>Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)</hi> as my owne, and not the <hi>King's;</hi> otherwiſe then as He approved of what I writ: for, he might have remembred, that <hi>I writ how that the King commanded Me to view the Marqueſſe's Paper before I brought it to Him, and to give Him my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
               </hi> I did in writing; <hi>w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
               </hi> Paper His Majeſty approved of, as a ſufficient Anſwer, and ſo ſent it to the Marqueſſe: and that I ſaid in my Epiſtle to the Reader,
<pb facs="tcp:97485:3"/>
That <hi>I writ onely what the KING ſpake, and that I Tranſcribed or Publiſhed none of His Writings.</hi> And if I had aſſerted that Paper to have been an Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from His Pen, it had not been a Contradiction to what He wrote to <hi>Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> For, <hi>Hinderſon</hi> urging upon His Majeſty the <hi>Private Interpretation as the Proper Judge of the Scriptures,</hi> His Majeſty might very well hold out unto him <hi>the Authority and Expoſition of the Church as a more Competent Judge then that which the Scripture it ſelfe ſpeaks againſt;</hi> Which was an Argument good enough againſt him: And when the Marqueſſe preſſed His Majesty with <hi>the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being Judge of Scripture,</hi> His Majeſty might have recourſe unto the Scripture, and yet there might be no Contradiction at all: But as a Fellow in a Fooles Goat may have the Priviledge to ſtand in the King's preſence amongſt Wiſe and worthy Men; ſo, this Advertiſment may not be amiſſe, before the King's Workes.</p>
            <p>If this be the Reward of Loyalty (like a Blind-Beare) to be whipt on both ſides, and laſh'd by every hand: Or like a Maſtiffe to be ridde by ſuch a Jack an. Ape and boxt on both Eares, I will have nothing to doe henceforward with <hi>State-Affaires; LOVE</hi> ſhall be my Theame, which is <hi>the Spirit of God and Soule of the World,</hi> which (like <hi>Archimedes</hi> his <hi>Needle)</hi> drawes all things to it ſelfe: <hi>Love-Paſſions</hi> are the Hinges whereon depend the Two Leafes of that one Doore of Entrance <hi>into Eternall Life,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> the <hi>Two Heavenly Poles of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation</hi> are the <hi>Love of God</hi> and that of <hi>our Neighbour. Love</hi> is that wherewith the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> being lifted up upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> promiſed, that <hi>He would draw all Men unto Him:</hi> All other <hi>Graces</hi> put together doe but ſcant <hi>the Cup;</hi> but <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law.</hi> It is the Tree <hi>whoſe Fruit is never withered,</hi> or blaſted; And the Root from whence the <hi>Flowers of all good Workes and good Deſires</hi> doe ſpring. <hi>Love</hi> compoſes Bookes of <hi>Holy-Scripture,</hi> and drawes Lineaments of Beauty over the ſeverall Pages. Now come forth thou black and ſullen Spirit that carpeſt at my Writings, and ſee of what Fraternity thou art of, whilſt thou commeſt ſo neer that onely Property of the Devill and Damned Spirits, <hi>[Not to Love]</hi> 'I, but <hi>Momus</hi> will aske me, What kind of <hi>Love</hi> is this, of which you treat? I anſwer him, That there is but one <hi>Love in the world,</hi> but there are Diverſities of Objects, <hi>[the Love of God, the Love of Women, the Love of Money.]</hi> The Love of any thing is but one and the ſame thing, though it be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Subject whereon it workes: <hi>Amor, Dilectio, Charitas, Zelus,</hi> are but ſo many Branches of that Immaculate Tree of Life guarded by Angels, and a Sword whoſe Temper was of Holy flames of Preſervation, whilſt the Tree of Knowledge parted with her Fruit to ſinfull hands, and whoſe Armes received the Embracements, and entertained the Windings and turnings of the ſubtile Beaſt: whoſe Branches as it bare Knowledge of Good and Evill, ſo, an Excreſſency (contrary to its owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) grew out of its owne Body, which was Death.</p>
            <p>Doe we not ſee God and his Creatures oftentimes Corrivalls for the ſame young Mans Heart? We ſee Heaven and Earth Competitors for the ſame Roome and Lodging in the heart of Man: and the Holy Ghoſt adviſing Man how he may gaine Poſſeſſion of the heavenly Manſion by laying up Treaſure there, that there may his Heart be alſo.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay more? The World, the Fleſh, and the Devill are but ſo many Defendents to the joint Plaintiffs of the Bleſſed Trinity, both contending to whom the Heart of Man ſhall properly belong, and when the Scales are even, <hi>Love</hi> is the weight of the Hearts Ballance, cauſing it to Propend that way whereſoever it lyes. The Compaſſe hath many Points whereto its Needle may becken and make its offer, but there is but one that is Elegible, whereby it may find reſt, and leave its Trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and that's the North: So there are many Circumferences, whereby the Affections of Mens hearts are carried further off from one another, by how much the more they forſake their Fountaine-head; yet there is but one Center, the place of reſt and unity, where all theſe may fully meet, and that is <hi>God;</hi> which <hi>God is
<pb facs="tcp:97485:4"/>
Love;</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> thus rightly plac'd, is the main prop and principall Stay and Support of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and <hi>Center of Perfection.</hi>

                  <hi>I am nothing, more or leſſe, then a</hi> leafe <hi>which is falne from the</hi> tree <hi>that made</hi> Lawrels <hi>for the Roman Emperours; and toſt by a wind that hath blown me upon your coaſt: I perceive you are a man of ſome authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe parts; exerciſe that power, which may make you worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne: (and not in</hi> ſullying <hi>a vertue, which belongs to Princes, which is, to defend and relieve the</hi> diſtreſſed, <hi>and chiefly, Ladies in</hi> diſtreſſe; <hi>the true point of</hi> Maſculine <hi>Nobility.)

Whereupon he

diſcovers himſelfe a Prince of all the Territories round about, and cauſing his moſt ſumptuous Chariot to be ſent for, he ſeats her in it, and kneeling at the loweſt ſtep, he begs the favour of his admittance: ſhe bends both her body, and diſcourſe, to lay hold upon all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities that might helpe him up; applauding the exuberance of ſo great humanity, ſhewed to a perſon, who ſate there, as a meere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his clemencie. The commanded haſte, which the Charioteere ſoone made, to the Royall Palace (together with the many Queſtions and Anſwers which the King and Queene of Love made to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhortned the way, that brought them to ſo glorious a ſtructure, as if one of <hi>Jupiters</hi> birds had built his neſt in the Sun; which dazled the eyes of its beholders.</p>
               <p>The Palace was ſeated on the ſide of a hill, whereby though there were <hi>many</hi> buildings, yet not any <hi>one</hi> obſcur'd the reſt, but <hi>all</hi> like ſo many <hi>yearly</hi> children of a right Architectiſt, ſtood in ſo many ſeveral degrees one above another. Before the houſe there glided a ſoft ſtreame, <hi>ſmiling</hi> upon the flowery Bankes, whoſe depth rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Bargemen</hi> then <hi>Navigators.</hi> All along which River there was a fruitfull Valley, that yeelded a moſt pleaſant proſpect, which a man might eaſily <hi>behold</hi> without <hi>loſing</hi> his owne eyes. Above the Palace, a Hill, almoſt compaſſed the Seate, in forme of a Moone Creſſant, opening to receive the benefit of the pleaſing <hi>Zephirs,</hi> and a <hi>Grove</hi> betweene, anſwerable to the <hi>ſhape</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the Hill. Adjoyning whereunto, in proportion, was a goodly Orchard, and next unto the Houſe, a faire Garden, whoſe Platt was contrived upon ſuch a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Levell, whoſe <hi>proclivitie</hi> was ſo <hi>inſenſible,</hi> that you might walke <hi>upwards</hi> upon plaine ground, and <hi>downe</hi> againe, without deſcent. Upon the midſt whereof, was a liberall Fountaine, which was no leſſe ſervient to the <hi>Grotts</hi> for Water-works, then to the Houſe for uſe. No <hi>tunnells</hi> of any Chimney were to be ſeene above the houſe, but the Chimneys of every Square were ſo contrived all back to back, that they ſent up their conveyance ſo cloſe drawne up together, that over ſo many ſeverall places of the Palace, there was nothing more to be ſeen then ſo many tripartited walls, with Benches for to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either opening to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> or affording <hi>ſhade,</hi> from what part of the Firmament ſoever the Sunne ſhould caſt his Beames, as <hi>favours,</hi> or <hi>perſecutions.</hi> Upon the ſide of every wall, there attended the Suns motion, Dials, that took conſtant notes of all the progreſſe. At the corner of each wall, were Pendents, and in the midſt, higher then all the reſt, a larger Pendent, having the Princes Armes cut through, whoſe thorough light made the <hi>Chardge</hi> Sables, and the <hi>Field,</hi> Azure, or <hi>Skie-</hi>colour; ſerving as well for ornament as uſe. Neither was the Contrivement leſſe beneficiall, reſpecting the <hi>three</hi> walls ſheltridge from the <hi>foure</hi> winds. The comming up to the Palace, was over a faire River, and along a two-arched ſtately Bridge, between which and the Palace, was a ſtately Launt, five hundred and fifty paces, with a double row of trees on both ſides; in each double row a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97485:6"/>
wherein three might goe abreaſt; and in the middle a faire gravell riſe for the Chariot and the Horſe; which led through a faire Parke, no leſſe enamell'd with ſtore of Deere, then ſhadowed with the goodlieſt trees; which brought you to a Building, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements were all ſonnes and daughters of Uniformity and Beauty.</p>
               <p>The Prince (having ſhewed her all that is deſcribed, and having brought her with all his Attendant Lords and Ladies to the top of the Palace) tells her (before them all) that all that ſhe had ſeene within thoſe walls, and all that her eyes beheld without, ſhould be hers, upon no other condition, but that ſhe ſhould be his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honoria</hi> (perceiving that ſhe was now put to act the two parts both of Modeſty and Diſcretion) anſwered him in theſe words:</p>
               <p>WORTHY SIR,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In my weake opinion, you doe not deale ſo kindly with me, as if you would have me live: You cannot be ignorant of the danger that is in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a poore</hi> hunger-ſtarv'd <hi>wretch, and tempting her owne</hi> appetite <hi>to be her</hi> ruine, <hi>in ſetting before her ſo many diſhes, and plentifull varieties. I have beene fed with ſorrow a long time, and have had no moiſture wherewith I might quench my</hi> thirſting <hi>after comfort, but my owne teares; and now you cram me with delights: what can be expected, but that I ſhould ſoone ſurfet with the joyes wherewith you fill a heart that is too narrow to containe the moitie of your bounty and goodneſſe? I ſee here in your preſence, choice of faire and honourable Ladies, daughters to Felicity, and right heires to Happineſſe: Tell me but which you like, and my needle ſhall worke her ſuch a wedding garment, as it may be</hi> Carthage <hi>never ſaw the like; and this is all the favour I ſhall beg, or thinke my ſelfe worthy of.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She (ſeeing him ſtand amazed) urged him farther with theſe words (ſo modeſtly ſpoken) <hi>I pray Sir, let it be ſo, it may be I may be thought worthy for to wait upon her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No,</hi> (ſaid the Prince) <hi>they ſhall all attend on thee, and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more or leſſe happy then according to the degrees of favour that thou ſhalt ranke them in, and their merits, at thy hands, ſhall purchaſe estimation. For (by all that's ſacred) before the morrowes Sunne ſhall reach to its Meridian, thou ſhalt be mine. Doe not you ſtand ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refuſall, leſt you make us thinke, that you</hi> Romanes <hi>have an art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond us, to make your ſelves more acceptable by crowning your Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Humility. Come, let's goe, and what thou haſt not ſeen, that ſhall be thine; Ile ſhew thee farther.—</hi>Whereupon leading her by the arme, he delighted himſelfe (in ſuppoſing how much he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her) in ſhewing her all his Rarities and Treaſures.</p>
               <p>All his attendants (eſpecially they of the Female Sexe) were not (as yet) more affected with <hi>envie</hi> of her happineſſe, then they were pleaſed with the <hi>humble</hi> manner of her behaviour, untill their ſecond thoughts had placed their envies right againſt her: conſtruing that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97485:6"/>
Modeſtie, as a piece of cunning, to attract Honour (the more) by flying it; and to draw his love more and more towards her, by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to refuſe it. This night, the honourable women, by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Prince, attended <hi>Honoria;</hi> who the next day, as their Princeſſe, was to command their attendance. Which day being come, the time of that day allotted for the ſolemnization of ſo great a Marriage was at hand: when they were both made one, with the greateſt pompe and ceremony that could be deviſed, which I leave to your owne imaginations to ſupply the place of a deſcription. But one thing I muſt not omit, becauſe it was ſo ominous to that, which after happened: For at the ſame time whilſt the Prieſt was joyning the Hands of thoſe whoſe Hearts were one already, Blood guſht from his noſtrils, and at once ſtain'd the two maine preſervers both of Knowledge and Devotion, the ſacred Directory, and the Prieſts lips; and made the very word which enſured the Prince his love unto <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria,</hi> Rubrick in the Lyturgie. Which though the ſtanders by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it as a bad <hi>Omen,</hi> yet the parties themſelves, guarded with Innocence, and Thoughts as noble as their Reſolutions towards each other, diſdain'd to underſtand it a preſage of evill.</p>
               <p>No leſſe prodigious was that of the Diſhes being ſerv'd up to the Bridall Board with a noiſe of the Cloud-cleaving thunder of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and with Lightnings from the ſeverall windowes croſſing the meat: Which was not conſtrued, as a benediction, by thoſe who did obſerve it; and they who were leaſt ſuperſtitious, were (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) ſomewhat out of countenance to behold ſuch ſad Pottents: which the Princely Bride perceiving, thus ſpake unto her better part:</p>
               <p>MY LORD,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why ſhould you and I be troubled at theſe accidents, ſeeing it lies within our power to make them nothing? If you ſhould once ſpeak harſh to me, that thunder would be terrible in mine eares; neither can I feare the blaſting of any Lightning, but what may (unhappily) have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure from your eyes; and when I deſerve either, may I meet with both. The Prieſts blood dropt not upon our hands, but upon his booke; whilſt theſe are pure and innocent, we need not feare. Though the blood fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Letter, it did not fall upon the meaning that was between us. Be you but conſtant to theſe vowes which you have made, and it ſhall not lie within the power of Fate to work our prejudice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My deare</hi> Honoria, (reply'd the Prince) <hi>I am glad that theſe things have happened thus, ſince they have given thee occaſion to make Superſtition ſuch a foole. Look, my Deare, it cleares up already, thy breath hath rais'd the Siege that had ſo cloſe begirt the incloſed fires, that ſallied forth in thunder; and thy ſmiles have already diſpell'd the Clouds that ſate on every countenance. Come, let us ſit downe, and better our Commons with exceedings both of mirth and jollity.—</hi>

Brother to <hi>Honoria,</hi> and Nephew to the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Governour of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (a man of admirable Proweſſe, and much Gallantry) one who had expreſſed it ſufficiently againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> (having ſlaine with his owne hands <hi>Amboyolus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Alarick,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths)</hi> eſcaped the Gottiſh Inquiſition, and conceal'd himſelfe for ſome time heretofore in that Country) came to heare of the good fortune which his ſiſter met withall by flying from ſo ſad a fate, (where finding her fixed amongſt the higheſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations of that Firmament, and hearing that there were Juſts and Tournaments to be performed in the after-noone in honour of the day) he engaged a rich Jewel, which he had brought over with him, and ſlipt himſelfe into the moſt compleat Armour that the time would give him leave, and mounted himſelfe upon the braveſt horſe that money could buy. When the Prince and Princeſſe were ſeated, with all the Lords and Ladies of the Court, he entred the Liſts amongſt the other Tilters (diſguis'd as the reſt were) who therefore could not wonder at any other ſtrangeneſſe, but that their number ſhould exceed by one, they knew not who, and come amongſt them, they knew not how: wherefore he was ſoone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted by the Herauld, who demanded of him what he was, and upon what Accompt he entred the Liſts: to whom <hi>Bertaldo</hi> gave this <hi>Anſwer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I am a Stranger, that ſeek renowne in Forraigne parts, and oppotunity offers me a purchaſe at your hands: I require my Match if if he be to be found amongst the Carthaginians.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians?</hi> (ſaid the Herauld) that you ſhall ſoone find. And ſo left him, declaring to the reſt, the contents, of what had paſſed betweene him and the ſtrange Knight: the newes of ſo bold a Challenge was ſoon brought into the eares of the higheſt Spectators, who fraught with wonder, ſummon'd all their intellectualls; out of which they choſe a Committee of Divining thoughts to make enquiries who it ſhould be, but could not draw up a report: the Combatants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, that ſuch a bold expoſtulation ſhould proceed from a ſtranger, to the diſparagement of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Chivalry, if not chaſtiſed for his preſumption: they all ſtrove who ſhould undertake him firſt: and not agreeing otherwiſe, they all reſolved to caſt Lots to whoſe turn the Enterprize ſhould fall; but the Prince fearing that the Lot might fall to the moſt unskilfull, and weakeſt, to undertake ſo high a piece of Confidence; and ſo the glory of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> might happen to be eclipſed, commanded <hi>Coſdruball,</hi> Captain of his Guard, a man of higheſt eminence and eſteeme in all that Country, and one that never had been foil'd in point of Chivalry, to undertake the Challenger, which was obeyed, and thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coſdruball</hi> mounted upon a Milk-white Steed, having a ſilver Mane, that reacht (curling) downe to his knees, with his Launce in his hand, and Sword by his ſide, in gilded Armour, enters the Liſts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97485:7"/>
(his horſe out-noiſing all the Trumpets with his neighings) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares himſelfe for the Encounter, againſt whom was brought <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldo</hi> upon a bright Bay, with black Spots over all his body, and a white Star in his Fore-head, having a goodly Mane mingled with black and brown Haires: Drake-neckt, mouſe-ear'd, full-ey'd, and open noſtrils, pawing with one Foot upon the ground, and pricking up his Eares, as if he delighted rather to hear, then mar the muſick of the Trumpets: Blowing, as if he ſtomackt the delay, and waving his body up and downe, as if idleneſſe were a greater burden to him then action: All which ſignes of goodneſſe in his Horſe put <hi>Bertaldo</hi> in good hopes, that he ſhould make his words good, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his late Maſter in his behalf: who hearing his late Maſter ſpeak by way of commendation of his Horſe, (he was then ſelling to <hi>Bertaldo) viz.</hi> That he was a Lambe in the Stable, and a Peacock upon the Road; anſwered, that he would teach him how to be a Lyon in the Field.</p>
               <p>Thus all in Armour ſilver'd ore, with a mourning Ribbond a croſſe his Armour; and a black plume of Feathers in his Helmet, with a Launce in his hand, and Sword by his ſide: He ſate his Horſe in ſuch a comely poſture, that his Princely Siſter could not but think of him, who was the Man ſhe thought of, her own Brother: the ſignall was thrown down on the ruſh, like lightning upon one another; and he that was never worſted in all his life, was now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors'd upon the firſt Encounter: Which <hi>Coſdruball,</hi> not knowing how to brook, requeſted that he might run againe, and trie his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune once more; which being againſt the Lawes of Chivalry for him that was Unhors'd to trie a ſecond Combate, was denyed it by the Herauld: and his fellow Tilters (hoping to re-gaine immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Honour, by repairing that miſ-fortune with a better) ſtickled ſo much againſt him, that he (ſcorning nothing more then that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of vindicating the Carthaginian honour ſhould fall to anothers ſhare) therewith was ſo outed of all moderation and reaſon, both at once, (by a ſtrong paſſion that too often had been his enemie) that he ſtruck at one of them, and the other foure vindicated the firſt: ſo that they all five fell upon him. Which <hi>Bertaldo</hi> perceiving, takes part with his Antagoniſt; by whoſe aſſiſtance, <hi>Coſdruball</hi> held long play with all the five, and two of them were diſmounted, and ſore wounded in the face, and between the joynts of their armour, and both of them, by the brave <hi>Bertaldo;</hi> whoſe ſword at the laſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took one of their horſes by one of the cheeks of the bit, whoſe horſe being tender mouth'd, rear'd ſo up an end, that it gave occaſion for a leſſer ſtrength, then what <hi>Bertaldo</hi> had, to throw horſe and man backward over and over: Whereupon the Prince threw down his Warder, commanding his Guard to part them, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But <hi>Coſdruball</hi> by this time having turned his Envie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bertaldo</hi> into Admiration, and his Choller into Complement, thus ſpake unto him:</p>

SIR,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have expreſſed a great deale of Gallantry, both againſt me, and on my behalfe. Let me be ſo happy as to know your name, leſt you make me beleeve ſome Deity hath fought this day in Armour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> about to reply, uſing the ſame reverence which <hi>Honoria</hi> had obſerv'd him for to ſhew on Horſeback unto the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whilſt he thankt him (upon his returne) from ſome good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, cryed out, <hi>It is my Brother, my deare Brother, deare</hi> Bertaldo, <hi>I know it is he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereat the Prince aſtoniſhed, ſends for them all to come before him; who having uncaſed, were preſented to the Royall Paire as the true inſtruments of valour; But no Muſique affected the Royall Princeſſe eare ſo much, as when ſhe heard her Brother ſpeak, whom ſhe preſented to the Prince, her Husband, who acknowledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe much honoured with his relation to a man of ſo great Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; offering him to be no leſſe then what he would be, that lay within the power of his Dominions to make him ſo; wherefore he bad him freely to ſpeak his minde, or to take ſome further time for his demands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> ſoone reply'd, <hi>Great Prince, there needs no long time to be given me to requeſt that at your hands, which of all other things I moſt deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Speak it then,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) and upon the word of a Prince it ſhall be granted preſently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Sir,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bertaldo) I deſire nothing more then that you would love my Siſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which words, the Prince ruſhes into his armes, and embracing him, told him, That <hi>he had requeſted nothing, for greater love then that he bare already towards his Siſter, he could not ſhew:</hi> But this he had gained by ſo great an expreſſion of his love to her, that he could love him no leſſe with all his ſoule, then her with all his heart. And ſeeing his modeſtie would not make knowne unto him any farther deſires, he was contented (for his merits ſake) to be the hardeſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, untill he had found out wayes to make him happy. With ſuch love-expreſſions between theſe two Worthies, as alſo betweene <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldo</hi> and <hi>Coſdruball,</hi> the Prince and Princeſſe, <hi>Honoria,</hi> and her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with variety of delights and paſtimes, Muſick and Dancings, the reſt of the Day, and the borrowed part of the Night, that the maine happineſſe could afford to lend their expectations, ſeemed too ſmall a contribution to ſatisfie the deſires of thoſe who now began to wax ſad with thinking how their happineſſe muſt end, with a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that felicity whereof they were no ſharers, but ſo far forth as they could make it theirs by fancy: The time being come, that the Queen of Beauty muſt be taken by the Miniſters to the throne of Love, out of the hand of her beloved, where ſhe might be placed by his ſide; ſhe taking her leave with a reverend, yet Prinely behaviour, and went before that ſhe might be come to, rather then come at man:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97485:8"/>
where ſhe was no ſooner laid in her bed, but all the Honourable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fell in love with her, (except <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> a faire Lady, whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity we ſhall defer to mention till the laſt: It ſhall ſuffice for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that ſhe was one who formerly conceived hopes of having ſome aſſurance of the Prince's love, who ſate at the beds feet, behind the Curtaine, with her face from the bed, weeping) and with no leſſer ſenſibilities of delight, then as if their owne imaginations had meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed them all to men, ſtanding on both ſides the bed, holding Tapers in their hands, and gazing upon that lovely object, whoſe ſo <hi>many</hi> faces caſt <hi>one</hi> ſo out of countenance, that ſhe made ſignes with her hand that they ſhould be gone; and then recollecting her ſelfe, as fearing that they might judge the diſmiſſion a making <hi>haſte</hi> for her Husbands approach, her bluſhes forc'd a paſſage ſo <hi>powerfully</hi> into her countenance, that ſhe was faine to attempt a <hi>ſuppreſsion</hi> with both her hands: And leſt any of the <hi>red</hi> ſhould ſlip an apparance through her <hi>white</hi> fingers, ſhe throwes the ſheet over her head, ſo that their eyes forſooke their object, as <hi>objects vaniſh</hi> from the eye-ſight, when the light is gone.</p>
               <p>Word being brought, that the Prince thought their Ceremonies too tedious, they <hi>ſighed</hi> forth their extaſies with ſuch a ſtrong gale of wind, whoſe breath <hi>ſwell'd</hi> each contrary Curtaine, as if by thoſe <hi>full</hi> ſailes they had been <hi>tranſported</hi> to themſelves againe; and ſo left her: Onely <hi>Amariſſa</hi> ſtay'd behind, unmiſſed, and unregarded, until ſuch time, that the Prince with all his Nobles entred the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who entertained him with this ſad <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Play:</hi>

               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had you no other way to</hi> ſtep <hi>into your Nuptiall bed, but by</hi> treading <hi>upon a heart, that ſo much lov'd and honour'd you? to</hi> abuſe <hi>a beliefe, that once thought you could not erre? What delight is this you take, to</hi> raiſe <hi>with one hand, and</hi> deſtroy <hi>with t'other? to</hi> fill <hi>one creature ſo</hi> full <hi>of joy with an unexpected fruition, and</hi> ſtrangle <hi>another in the-midſt of all her hopes? Sir, you did not well: There is that</hi> within <hi>you, and there be thoſe</hi> without <hi>you, that will not ſtick to tell you ſo:</hi> and with that ſhe flung out of the Chamber, in the greateſt diſdaine, both to her Soveraigne, and her bad fortune, that could be imagined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who loved a ſpirit, (howſoever qualified) was mightily taken with her, (whoſe comportment it ſeemes well ſuted with his humour) wherefore he thus ſpake unto the Prince:</p>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You were once pleaſed to bid me</hi> aske <hi>and</hi> have; <hi>now I onely</hi> aske, <hi>that I may</hi> have <hi>this Lady, or at leaſt your approbation and aſsiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom the Prince returned this quick Reply:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My deare</hi> Bertaldo, <hi>I will not onely grant thee this, but aſſure thee, were I a woman my ſelfe, thou ſhouldſt have me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereat the Princely Bride raiſing her ſelfe up a little in her bed, ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, I pray tell me truly, have you promis'd the Lady marriage,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97485:9"/>
that ſeem'd to be ſo much perplext through ſome unconſtancie on your behalfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom the Prince made anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon my word I never promis'd her any ſuch thing, and I know ſhe's more noble then to ſay I did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh Sir,</hi> (ſaid the Princeſſe) <hi>I beg that I might heare her but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what you ſay, before you come betweene theſe ſheets, or elſe I ſhall never enjoy you nor my ſelfe: For I proteſt before all that's good, that I had rather embrace a heartleſſe, then a faithleſſe man: And as ſoone ſhall Steele strike fire without a Flint, as</hi> either <hi>of us can enjoy Felicity, where</hi> both <hi>have not kept touch with mutuall Loyaltie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince proteſted againe <hi>by Heaven, he never did promiſe that he would marry her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Princeſſe, <hi>Did not you tell her that you loved her? tell me truly; and ſo made her beleeve too much? Did you never give her any Rings or Favours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince confeſſed that <hi>he had done all that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereat the Princeſſe as <hi>over-ſenſible</hi> of the <hi>ſad</hi> condition that the poore Lady was in, <hi>gently</hi> wiping the teares that were even ready to <hi>overflow</hi> their bankes, told him that he had done <hi>too much,</hi> to doe <hi>no more;</hi> and that ſhe feared, that was not <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereat the Prince, deeply wounded with her ſorrow, told the Princeſſe, that he would have her ſent for, and would engage her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in teſtification of that truth which he had ſaid; and for the wrong which ſhe conceived that he had done the Lady, in telling her, in a generall way, he loved her: or in beſtowing ſome particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon her, he would make her this amends:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here is</hi> Bertaldo, (ſaid the Prince) <hi>as much in love with her, as ever ſhe was with me; a man every way deſerving her affection, with ſtronger pleas of merit, then I my ſelfe can boaſt of; (onely he's not a Prince.) And rather then thou ſhouldſt build a diſcontent on ſuch foundations, he ſhall be Prince of</hi> Carthage, <hi>and I will be</hi> Bertaldo: <hi>And</hi> (ſaid the Princeſſe) <hi>I will be</hi> Amariſſa, <hi>and ſhe ſhall be</hi> Honoria. <hi>Let her be ſent for.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Prince commanded two of his Noblemen to go and tell <hi>Amariſſa</hi> that her company was much deſired, who all this while had hid her ſelfe in a place where ſhe both <hi>ſaw</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> all that had been <hi>ſaid,</hi> or <hi>done:</hi> And being overcome with the Princeſſe goodneſſe, thinking her ſelfe by this time ſufficiently <hi>revenged,</hi> in finding <hi>Honoria</hi> (already) a partaker with her, in her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo <hi>ſenſible</hi> of her owne and hers, ſhe anſwered that <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi> with a deepe ſenſe of both their willingneſſe to give her ſo <hi>full</hi> a ſatisfaction, for ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> a fault, as was neither a <hi>reall</hi> wrong, nor a <hi>compleat</hi> injury: but eſpecially by reaſon of thoſe <hi>ſparkles</hi> of fire which <hi>Bertaldo</hi>'s words had kindled in her breaſt, which began (already) to <hi>ſmother</hi> under that <hi>vaſt</hi> load of fuell which <hi>former</hi> love had prepared for ſo <hi>high</hi> an inflamation. In ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97485:9"/>
comes of herſelf, before ſhe was either lookt for by <hi>them,</hi> or found by <hi>their</hi> Ambaſſadours, upon whoſe approach, the Prince thus ſpake unto her:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam, As you have relation unto Honour, be a friend to Juſtice; and let no paſsion prejudice the truth, that onely muſt confeſſe I often ſaid I lov'd you, and that I gave you pledges of my love, I have acknowledged it; but that thoſe pledges might not have been given as well unto a thing call'd</hi> Man, <hi>as unto you as</hi> Woman, <hi>(ſeeing I never promiſed you Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or gave them you in any ſuch conſideration) I ſee no reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>Amariſſa</hi> thus reply'd,</p>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſeemes I did not underſtand your</hi> dialect, <hi>nor the</hi> language <hi>of your</hi> gifts: <hi>I must confeſſe, I thought, that (being a</hi> woman) <hi>profeſsing love to</hi> ſuch <hi>a one, (and I never queſtioned any other but what was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) had no other</hi> ſignification, <hi>but what it ſeemes you never</hi> meant: <hi>and your</hi> gifts, <hi>no otherwiſe, then ſo many</hi> pledges <hi>of that love: But I am</hi> contented <hi>to be</hi> miſtaken; <hi>my griefs are now</hi> epitomiz'd <hi>to this ſmall</hi> Volume. <hi>I am ſorry I am not a</hi> Man, <hi>(as you took me to be) for then would I love</hi> Honoria <hi>better then your ſelfe, and ſo be even with you. Wherefore be ever happy,</hi> Honoria, <hi>in his love, and if my contentment may contribute any thing to that accompliſhment, you have it freely: Imbrace</hi> him, <hi>as the</hi> Ivie <hi>doth the</hi> tree, <hi>murmur together like two</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-doves, <hi>and kiſſe as cloſe as Cockles meet, I envie not your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> fir'd with this brave carriage, tells <hi>Amariſſa</hi> that ſhe is the greateſt <hi>Conquerour</hi> in the world, thus to <hi>rout</hi> her paſſions, and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> her ſelfe, (not knowing the <hi>meanes</hi> whereby ſhe got the victory) and that if ſhe could love a <hi>man</hi> under the degree of a <hi>Prince,</hi> ſhe might find happineſſe to <hi>crowne</hi> her deſires, beſides that which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces weare upon their <hi>heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amariſſa</hi> made quick reply, ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Woman was not taken out of the</hi> ſcull <hi>of Man, whereby ſhe ſhould ſo much affect that</hi> ornament; <hi>but out of his</hi> ſide, <hi>that ſhe might ſit neare his</hi> heart: <hi>Where if ſhe were once duly ſeated, ſhe ought to think her ſelfe ſufficiently crown'd with hearts content.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Which words the Princeſſe ſeconded with theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love him, and you ſhall not loſe your firſt love; For</hi> Lorenzo <hi>being my ſelfe, and I yours,</hi> Bertaldo <hi>and</hi> Amariſſa <hi>ſhall ſo agree in a</hi> third <hi>perſon, that</hi> foure <hi>ſhall be happy all at</hi> once. <hi>Love me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bertaldo, and I will teach Love it ſelfe new delights that it never dreamt of, and make it aſhamed of its old wayes, as if they were out of faſhion.</hi>

The best favoured was the youngeſt, the leſſe the elder, whom ſhe cauſed to be accounted as her youngeſt ſonne; and us, to keep her counſell, which we did accordingly: ſo that</hi> Berontus <hi>the right heire, was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long eſteemed to be the younger brother, who (as if his divining ſoule could not be contented with a leſſer degree of Fortune, then that which the God of Nature had already given him) ſeekes better in the worlds wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, while he was yet a Stripling, and</hi> Jacomius <hi>(the younger) was bred up to all the good qualities that education could afford him, and is unjuſtly likely to inherit that vaſt Eſtate which his Father left him, beſide the Dukedome that was to deſcend unto him after the death of his Great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, (if your mercie towards my diſtreſſed condition, and love to Juſtice, doe not help to ſet things right)</hi> acquainting him with the names, and places of the women, and their habitations, that were at the Labour of this great Lady; ſhe implores his aſſiſtance for pitty ſake, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him faithfully, that if he would doe this good worke for her, he ſhould never want her aſſiſtance to give him the beſt intelligence for his good, or the avoidance of any evill that ſhould befall him.</p>
               <p>As much as Wonder and Amazement would give him leave, he promiſed faithfully to effect what ſhe deſir'd; the voice was heard no more, after theſe her laſt words, <hi>What you have promiſed, look you doe

performe:</hi> Which words were no ſooner out of his mouth, but they could heare a melodious Harmony, as the Muſick of the Sphaeres in compariſon therewith would ſeeme but jarring; and ſo (as if it went farther and farther off, till it went ſo far, as paſt their hearing) they were permitted to their former ſweetneſſe of repoſe. When as the Prince perceiving how Sleep (that dull thiefe) began to ſteale upon him, fearing that he might obliterate thoſe penall notions out of his <hi>Memorandum,</hi> ſtarts upright in his bed, <hi>Honoria</hi> claſping him by the middle, and asking him, <hi>What would my Love?</hi> He anſwers her, <hi>Sweee heart, the</hi> Blood, <hi>the</hi> Thunder, <hi>and the</hi> Lightning, <hi>that the Prieſts</hi> Booke, <hi>the</hi> Eares, <hi>and</hi> Eyes <hi>of all that were obſervers of thoſe</hi> Prodigies, <hi>bid me be circumſpect, and omit no opportunities, that may make</hi> Fate <hi>her ſelfe runne back with all her Monsters in her armes.</hi> Whereupon he ſtept out of his bed, and onely cloathing himſelfe with his Night-gowne, he opened his doore, where the Guard, which watcht in the Gallery, were ſo amaz'd, that it was a long time before his commands could be obey'd. At the laſt, they lighted his Candle at the Lamp. Which done, he retires into his Chamber, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits all the particulars to writing, that had been told him by his late informer.

The Guard without cryes, <hi>Arme, Arme, Arme, Coſdruball</hi> bounces at the doore, and cryes, <hi>Sir, pray open your doore, I muſt ſpeake with you:</hi> The Prince ſtarts up, the Princeſs puls him down again, crying aloud, <hi>Ah!

The Prince asked him <hi>if the</hi> Moores <hi>were at the gates?</hi> His Lieutenant <hi>Coſdruball</hi> anſwered, <hi>No. But they were within</hi> 60. <hi>miles, That's ſix dayes march</hi> (ſaid the Prince) <hi>I hope I may have one nights reſt, and to morrow I am a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my Country-men.</hi> Coſdruball, <hi>here's my Seal, iſſue forth what Warrants you ſhall think moſt ſit to ſet the Country in a poſture of defence, and to morrow I will be in the head of the moſt reſolute party.</hi>

The ſame voice which <hi>Charm'd</hi> their eares, <hi>lul'd</hi> them both aſleep, and ſleep ſo ſoone after <hi>admonition</hi> is not good: for reſt invites the body to <hi>lie down</hi> in her lap, whilſt ſhe <hi>picks</hi> memorialls out of his head. All was thus forgot, <hi>Aurora,</hi> the <hi>Poſtillion</hi> of the morn jets by the window, at whoſe heeles the near horſes of the Sunne follow the gray with brighter colour: till at laſt, <hi>Phoebus</hi> himſelf lookes in at the window; and darting his beames through the crimſon Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that was drawn before it, made all the bridall <hi>whiteneſſe</hi> of the bed look <hi>red.

I but in the mean time</hi> (ſaid <hi>Honoria) I had rather you would take away this claw of lead that gripes my heart ſo ſore, and ſqueeſes out all the gladneſſe thence. Honoria,</hi> (ſaid the Prince) <hi>no miſ-fortune can befall me, whileſt I am happy in thy love, which nothing can deprive me of, but that which may lead me to a better life: And if thou think'st my death any miſ-fortune, I'le repaire the loſſe of my Perſon, with the donation of my Dominion: For here, before all theſe Nobles, if I fall, there ſtands the Queen of Carthage.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Honoria</hi> made her laſt Reply: <hi>Long may you live to enjoy that, your ſelfe; and I, you.</hi> So they both parted. She was ſorry that he was gone, he diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſhe was ſorrowfull. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> taking his leave of his Siſter, and the reſt of the Ladies, bids her make much of her ſelf, ſhe, him:

               <p>The Court (thus) emptyed (almoſt) of all the Men, <hi>Maximanus</hi> ſtruts among a Company of Women, like a <hi>Major domo</hi> of a <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> (though he was more <hi>Satyr</hi> then <hi>Eunuch)</hi> yet for ſome while he kept on his way, laying hold on all opportunities that might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the Princeſſe favour: which, when he had once ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obtained, he thought he had made a faire progreſſe towards his journeys end, diſloyall luſt. <hi>Good natures are ſeldome wanting in retalliating good ſervices with acknowledgements, and innocence oftentimes engratiates her owne Subjects with too many free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> had often ſought occaſion to give the Princeſſe ſome intimation of his meaning; but all his opportunities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fruitleſſe to his deſires, which were ſtill nipt in the bud, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could give them breath) by the chaſt wind of her words, and Majeſty of her Countenance: Which was ſuch, as would have ſtill kept him in the ſame ſtate of innocence, if ſhe had not (as <hi>unhappily,</hi> as <hi>innocently)</hi> let fall a word by chance, which (like a ſpark of fire by the often claſhings of diſcourſe, like the ſtriking together of Flint and Steele) lighting upon the black tinder of his halfe-burnt Soul, (once extinguiſhed, and ſuppreſſed already by her chaſt hand over him) ſo ſpread fire (by his additionall breath) that he thought he might (in a very ſhort time) both touch his match, and light a candle to his hearts deſires. And thus it was:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honoria</hi> was much addicted to good Houſewifery, eſpecially in preſerving Fruits, and Diſtillations; well governing her Houſhold, receiving Accompts, &amp;c. <hi>Maximanus,</hi> as he was very diligent to find out wayes wherein (he thought) he might pleaſe her, and beſt ſuite with his occaſions, and adminiſter diſcourſe proportionable to his deſigne. One time amongſt the reſt, he preſents unto her, a rare and exquiſite Limner; making it his requeſt, <hi>That the Prince's Gallery might be graced with her Picture, which was wanting: Which if it were truly drawne to the life, would put down all the pictures there.</hi> She (as little regarding the <hi>motion,</hi> as affected with the <hi>vanity)</hi> was, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (by much opportunity) drawne to give her conſent (with this proviſo) that ſhe may have the liberty to chuſe her owne fancy in it. <hi>Maximanus</hi> thought, Reaſon good; and duty, binding. Whereupon ſhe cauſeth this rare Artiſt to draw her Picture holding <hi>Cupid</hi> between her Legs, his <hi>Bow</hi> under her Foot, his <hi>Quiver</hi> upon the ground, with the <hi>Arrowes</hi> broken, and plucking the feathers out of his Wings, (which lay ſcattered about the Roome) with this Motto, <hi>viz. But a Gooſe to a good Huſwife.</hi> And when it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſhe preſented it to <hi>Maximanus</hi> with theſe words: <hi>Now Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus I am at your ſervice.</hi> Meaning no otherwiſe, but that (upon thoſe termes) ſhe had gratifi'd his deſires. He (not reading the <hi>Motto)</hi> underſtood not the <hi>conceit.</hi> She (not doubting but that he had) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97485:14"/>
it no farther. <hi>Maximanus</hi> (imagining that by <hi>Cupid</hi> which ſhe held betweene her legs) was Hieroglyphict the love that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her and her husband, whoſe <hi>bow</hi> ſhe trod under her foot, and whoſe <hi>feathers</hi> ſhe threw away, as ſlighting his departure) thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that ſhe had done this, to let him ſee, that now ſhe had <hi>(wholly)</hi> caſt her ſelfe upon his love and affections. Whereupon he ſaid but little, becauſe the Limner was preſent, as if he had been ſomewhat ſorry that ſhe had ſhewed her ſelfe ſo <hi>comming</hi> before a man, that could not but take ſome notice of her <hi>too much</hi> forwardneſſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he was all on fire, which being kept in, burnt the hotter: She ignorant of <hi>any,</hi> addes <hi>more</hi> fuell by her enſuing diſcourſe: ſaying unto him, <hi>Come</hi> Maximanus, <hi>you and I will goe and hang it up in my owne Chamber, bidding him reward the Picture-drawer, and diſmiſſe him,</hi> which he did accordingly: He carrying the Picture in his hand into her Chamber, and finding no body there, inſtead of ſetting it up, he ſets it down. And thus the <hi>Goat</hi> courted the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raven</hi> the <hi>Dove.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That my love was unexpreſſable, it might appear by my not ſpeaking: but it ſeemes my actions ſpake in a language that your quick apprehenſion underſtood: But I could wiſh you had ſaid nothing, and then you had performed the greateſt maſter-piece of wit that ere was wrought by inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and had made a third hand, Limne the</hi> Idea <hi>of your minde, who never knew your meaning: whereas now I am afraid—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he was going on with his ſpeech, ſhe gave him ſuch a look, that ſtopt his ſpeech, with ſwallowing downe his Spittle. Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>What he meant by that ſtrange language, and inſolent kind of behaviour? Maximanus</hi> recollecting his ſpirits, asked <hi>Honoria what ſhe meant by that ſtrange Picture, and familiar way of telling him that ſhe was now at his ſervice?</hi> Adding, moreover, the <hi>diſmiſment</hi> of the Artiſt, and <hi>inviting</hi> him to her Chamber, able to give a <hi>duller</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, then his own, the like encouragement: Withall, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>her</hi> with his conception of the Myſtery.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> reply'd (to ſo unexpected a cooling Card) <hi>Madame, I pray be not offended, you cannot hate me for loving you: nor blame that love that is attracted by ſuch Magnetick vertue: 'Tis your owne fault to be ſo Beautifull, and none of mine, to be paſsive in my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that power. Truly Madam, I muſt needs confeſſe, I doe love you with all my heart, and have ſmother'd my affection a long time: But now I muſt tell you, that you murder me, if you deny.</hi>

                  <hi>Sir, Sir,</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, <hi>love is your ſcene, but when the ſcene is opened, foul luſt appeares, which makes you unworthy of your Princes Favour, or my Company: With what countenance can you look him in the Face, that can be ſo diſloyall to him, or me, of whom you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97485:14"/>
ſo vile conceptions? For the Love-ſake that my Husband beares unto you (in hopes of your amendment) I will not blab your Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or Diſloyalty: But I proteſt, if ever you open your mouth againe in this particular, your Maſter ſhall know into how treacherous hands he hath repos'd ſo great a Truſt: And ſo farewell.</hi>

So this ſonne of <hi>Mars</hi> (environed within a black cloud of <hi>Moores)</hi> thunders in the midſt of them, and (like lightning) ſo peirced this black cloud, till there fell ſhowers of bloud. Such was the behaviour of the brave <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> having intelligence from <hi>Hanno,</hi> that the Prince was thus engaged, if he were not loſt already; and that the left wing (attempting to diſ-engage him) were all routed, with his 100.

He gives <hi>Philaret</hi> a ſtrict charge that <hi>he ſhould not loſe the ſight of him (if it were poſsible) but be ready at had (with his ſpare Horſe) if need required; and that he ſhould ſhew his love unto him in that dayes ſervice, and have it ever after.</hi> The poor wretch over-joy'd with the apprehenſion of ſuch a reward,

converts his fear of death into hopes of merit: And having at the beginning of the Battell taken a box of Oyntment from a Captive Tawny-Moore (wherewith the <hi>Moores</hi> uſed to make their Faces more black (as more Beautifull) he colours his face as black as jet, imagining (thereby) to performe ſome notable piece of ſervice that day, in the behalfe of his ſo much beloved, <hi>Bertaldo:</hi> who by this time finding the <hi>Moores</hi> to ſtand ſo cloſe drawn up, as no ordinary force, or manner of diſcipline could break, or enter; drawes up his Men in forme of a wedge, edg'd with his own perſonall Valour (it being impoſſible that ſuch a <hi>one,</hi> being backt by <hi>two,</hi> thoſe <hi>two</hi> by <hi>three; three</hi> by <hi>five,</hi> bearing the ſame proportion up to the very Rear, whoſe <hi>greater</hi> number ſtill followed the <hi>fewer,</hi> whilſt the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-</hi>mettled <hi>fewer</hi> ſtill made way for the <hi>worſer</hi> temper'd multitude to follow, (like a well-droven wedg) riving the bonds of nature in ſunder) and thoſe hearts of Oak, at once, both to complaine and open, till they ſaw the Prince (with a few ſurvivers) like <hi>Mars</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtand <hi>Bulwarckt</hi> in the midſt of ſo many ſlaughter'd <hi>Moores:</hi> and <hi>Re-intrench'd</hi> about with his owne Dead.

               <p>Theſe two men in <hi>Mars</hi> his livery, ſeeing the <hi>Moors</hi> endeavouring to Sally on either hand, reſolv'd (equally) to divide their Forces, and Charge them ſeverall wayes. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (in proſecuting his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne) had his Horſe ſlaine under him upon the firſt Charge, which had no ſooner brought him to the ground, but up comes <hi>Philoret</hi> with his ſpare Horſe in his hand, ready to re-eſtate him in his former poſture: He perceiving <hi>Philoret</hi> black as the night, thought ſome <hi>Moore</hi> had kill'd his pretty Page, and ſeiz'd his horſe, and clad him in his Pages habit: whereupon <hi>Bertaldo</hi> ſtruck at <hi>Philoret,</hi> who call'd upon <hi>Bertaldo</hi> to ſtay his hand; but the confuſed noiſe being ſo great that he could not hear him, <hi>Bertaldo</hi> gave him a ſleight wound upon his neck, whereat <hi>(Philoret</hi> letting his horſe goe out of his hands) to lay hold on that, <hi>Bertaldo</hi> left proſecuting <hi>Philorets</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, by ſparing the perſon whom he perſecuted with ſo blind a zeal: crying out, <hi>Black Devill, how couldſt thou find in thy heart to deſtroy ſo ſweet a Creature?

                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> was no ſooner mounted, but preſently he Charges in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt of his Enemies, as if ſome wild Bull had runne madding through ſome Market-place, treading down all the people

as he ranne along, till ſtopt by Butchers, that ſtaid his courſe by knocking of him downe: ſo fell <hi>Bertaldo.</hi> Up comes <hi>Philoret,</hi> and diſmounting his horſe, ſtrides over him, and with his ſword in his hand menaces the approaching Enemy. The <hi>Moores</hi> ſeeing him Black, took him to be one of their own party; and by his rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell to be of ſome extraordinary quality; wherefore they durſt not preſſe upon <hi>Bertaldo</hi> any further violence, whom Authority had protected: untill the Prince (having quite routed his Adverſaries, and hearing <hi>Bertaldo</hi> to be ſo engaged) comes in (like a raging Sea back'd by the winds, that had made ſome new breach into the Land) which when the fainting ſpirits of <hi>Bertaldoes</hi> men once perceived, they reſolv'd (like a dying taper) either to contract <hi>all</hi> their ſtrength, to make <hi>one</hi> great blaze before they went out, or elſe (for ſhame) to doe their own work themſelves, before <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſhould come to their aſſiſtance: which they performed ſo couragiouſly, that they made the enemy give the ground that was covered with <hi>Bertaldoes</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded body; who being ſet upon his feet, on the one ſide by his friends, on the other by his ſuppoſed enemy, to whom he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much beholding, that he pray'd his Souldiers to <hi>uſe that pretty little Blackamore well:</hi> wondring how he neglected his owne liberty, and hazarded his life to preſerve his perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philoret</hi> was forthwith carrried out of the Battell, which was ſoon after ended, and the <hi>Moors</hi> all totally routed, by the comming back of <hi>Coſdruballs</hi> horſe, who received orders to follow the execution. They all drew off the field: and when the Prince was well got to his Quarters, and <hi>Bertaldoes</hi> wounds had been well dreſs'd, he requited the Princes <hi>kinde</hi> Viſite, with the <hi>pleaſing</hi> Story of the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that the ſuppoſed <hi>Moore</hi> had ſhewed him in his extremity. They both reſolved to ſend for him; and being ſent for, they were both inquiſitive after the cauſe of his ſo great humanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (telling <hi>Philoret,</hi> that to his knowledge he had <hi>ſaved his life, hazarded his owne, and loſt his liberty)</hi> deſiring to know of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loret, what moved him to all that kindneſſe?

               <p>They admiring firſt, and afterwards commanding it to be ſent for; which being brought, they both delivered it to <hi>Philoret</hi> (ſtill wondring what he meant to doe therewith) who receiving it ſtep'd aſide, and (as if night had been waſhed away by the morning dew) breaks upon them with ſuch red and white, as <hi>Aurora</hi> paints her

Cheekes withall, after her climing up the Eaſtern hills. Of which, when they had throughly enform'd themſelves, they both ſtrove who ſhould imbrace him firſt; the Prince firſt caught him in his Armes, he catches at <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who kiſs'd his Cheekes: And <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldoes</hi> armes being about his neck, he weepes upon his hands; his merits ſowing the ſeedes of love in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> his teares reaped no further benefit then of being rewarded in the Act, which was as high as his poor heart durſt goe. The Prince perceiving him to weep ſo faſt, lets him goe, fearing that he had hurt him, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him with too hard a kindneſſe. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> enjoying a quiet poſſeſſion of his ſo much beloved, takes him in his Armes, and askes him <hi>what he ayl'd;</hi> he hanging down his armes by his ſides, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch an armfull, puts by the true cauſe by this excuſe. <hi>I weep to think what danger you were in.

Then I deſire</hi> (ſaid <hi>Philoret) in the firſt place, That you would never put me from you. Secondly, that I may ever ſleep at your foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince burſting forth into admiration, cryes out, <hi>What ſtrange affection is this of a youth towards his Master!</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philoret</hi> fearing that he had gone too farre, and that nothing could ſooner deprive him of that competent felicity (which he had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto himſelfe) then that it ſhould be known what he was, breaks off all further expoſtulations with this aſſurance: That as <hi>no promiſe could be greater then that, ſo no performance could anſwer his deſires with more delight.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97485:17"/>
ſhe was forc'd unto was not her own act.</hi> And therefore wiſh'd her <hi>not to make any reſiſtance, or call for the leaſt help, as ſhe loved her owne Lord and Life, and the wellfare of his Dominions, with often inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if ſhe compell'd him to ſtop her out cryes with that Dagger ſtruck through the lunges that ſends them up, he would (afterwards) prove as great a Traytour to her Lord, as ſhe had compell'd him to be a Murderer of her, and have his deſires at laſt, though it were but between hot and cold, life and death. Honoria</hi> laught in his face, and bade him <hi>look who ſtood behind him.</hi> And whilſt he was turning about, (to ſee what ambuſh ſhe had laid) ſhe whips by him; and running by the doore, clapp'd it too, which he open'd with ſuch ſpeed, as men often finde who are moſt in haſte: But had doubtleſſe overtaken her running downe the ſtaires that led into the Gallery, or in the long Gallery, before ſhe could have reacht any Company, if her owne Chaſt ſpeed, and the winde together, had not blow'd off her Veile ſo directly towards his feet, that he was ſo entangled therewith, that downe he falls along, upon the ground, whereby ſhe got ſafely to her Guard of Ladies, but could not ſpeak to them, ſhe was ſo out of breath: and when ſhe had breath'd ſufficiently, ſhe could not ſpeak for laughing.</p>
               <p>In which Interim, <hi>Maximanus</hi> enters the Preſence, who not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glad to ſee her ſo pleaſant, and exceeding glad that ſhe had not ſaid any thing at all of him to the Ladies, with greateſt reverence he requeſted her that <hi>he might ſpeak but one word in private with her, at the window:</hi> ſhe conjecturing his meaning (commanding the Ladies not to ſtir out of the roome) withdrawes her ſelfe, where he <hi>begs, and prayes her, for goodneſſe ſake, though he had deſerved the greateſt evill, that ſhe would not ſpeake a word of what had paſſed betweene them: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting before all things ſacred, that he intended her no harme, but onely to put her to the utmost tryall; which had not the ſuddenneſſe of her owne wit taught her ſuch an eſcape, ſhe ſhould not have been unſatisfied in that particular; but now the truth of his intentions was wholly at the</hi> mercy <hi>of her Belief:</hi> Promiſing her faithfully, that if ſhe would <hi>forget,</hi> and <hi>forgive this miſdemeanour, he would never open his mouth unto her, in that behalfe, nor ever harbour any ſuch thoughts within his breaſt. For if ſhe did not, that would be the way to have them both undone; and if ſhe did, nothing ſhould preſerve her honour more then that Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <hi>Maximanus, not forfear of any thing wherewith you can threaten me, but for the loves ſake my Husband beares unto you, I will pardon you, and never ſpeak of this offence: First provided, that you be as good as your word, in baniſhing all thoughts of falling into a relapſe. Secondly, That I may be in a condition never to trust you any more. Wherefore you must give me leave to diſmiſſe your attendance upon my Perſon, till your Maſter returnes, and your ſuit is granted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hortenſius</hi> (the Gardner) waiting upon his Miſtreſſe to a flowrie banke, whoſe bed (at its ſeverall ſeaſons) as well made <hi>ſoft</hi> with the often <hi>riſings</hi> of the <hi>water,</hi> as <hi>comforted</hi> with the <hi>Warming-pan</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> having a <hi>Diana</hi>'s Grove (like a drawne Curtaine) betweene it and the <hi>North-Eaſt-wind,</hi> ſtanding ſo commodiouſly for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the <hi>Southerne Clime)</hi> invited them to ſearch into Natures bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, where ſhe was likelyeſt to hide her greateſt rarities.</p>

to be deluded, might lay hold on ſome occaſion to let in error through the back-doore of ſome miſtake, whereby ſome grounds of witneſſing againſt her may be had, as alſo that if any ſuch thing were, they might adde a little to it, make more) and according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, there hapned this unlucky accident (food to his hunger, and a full draught to his revenge) <hi>Hortenſius</hi> having fill'd his Basket, and ſhe her Apron with the choiceſt delicates; they were both compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fruits of their own induſtry, and natures bounty, together; ſome miſtake of the right name of an Herb (on his part) made the Princeſſe laugh, whereat the ſuperviſors thought them ſomewhat pleaſant: Another miſtake there was of the Princeſſe, which cauſed her to clap her hand upon her breaſt, as blaming her forgetfulneſſe, which cauſed thoſe eves-droppers (byaſs'd with prejudicate opinion) to cry out, <hi>Oh what a paſsionate expreſsion was there! How ſhe was fain to pump it from the very bottom of her heart!</hi> Which miſtake of theirs, the Gardner himſelf ſomewhat improved, when he had made her ſuch an obeyſance, whilſt he was craving her pardon for his contradiction; whilſt ſuſpicion was thus well onward on its way, a ſmall matter helps it forward to its journies end. For <hi>Honoria</hi> eſpying an Earwig ready to creep into <hi>Hertenſius</hi> ear, endeavouring to ſtrike it <hi>off</hi> with her hand, ſhe ſtrikes it <hi>into</hi> his Neck; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be there, thruſt her fingers into his Coller to take it thence; ſhe laughing all the while at his not knowing what was the matter, and wondring why ſhe gave him ſuch a whirret under the Ear: Of which, aſſoone as he had beene informed, in humble manner he makes her a low obeyſance, and <hi>thankes her for being partiall in his behalfe, in taking one wormes part rather then another.</hi>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Which (being ſo confidently related by ſo many witneſſes) had been enough to have made him believe (as it did too many others) that it had been ſo indeed, but that his owne temptations were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97485:18"/>
tryals of their vertue, or that ſhe had preferr'd the Gardner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but that he did verily beleeve they invented thoſe lies to curry favour with his greatneſſe. <hi>Thus fooliſh people ſtanding a great way off, and ſeeing men and women dance, (hearing not the muſick) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be all mad.</hi>

But having recollected her ſelfe a little, ſhe preſently cryes out againſt <hi>Maximanus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Upon her life this was his doings,</hi> and forthwith up and told <hi>Amariſſa</hi> all that had happened betweene <hi>Maximanus</hi> and her ſelfe. <hi>Amariſſa</hi> being fully ſatisfied from what Quarter this wind blew, ſaid unto <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria, Oh</hi> Honoria, <hi>hadſt thou been ſo happy as to have queſtioned him for his villanie, before thou hadſt been queſtioned by him, thou hadſt cruſht the Cockatrice in the egge: But now, when Falſhood hath once made Truth a Defendant, it hath taken away her Teſtimonie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amariſſa</hi> having further made knowne the particulars to <hi>Honoria,</hi> as they were related; <hi>Honoria</hi> then unfolded all the Riddles, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Miſtakes. <hi>Amariſſa</hi> over-joy'd that ſhe was ſo fully inſtructed to defend <hi>Honoria's</hi> honour, ſatisfie the abuſed multitude, and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tyrant; She begins to ſtickle in her behalfe, and undeceive the miſ-informed, and talkt of calling <hi>Maximanus</hi> to account for his villanie.</p>
               <p>Now began the feud, Reports joyne iſſue, Publications are brought forth, and a day of Hearing boldly is required of the Judges. <hi>Maximanus</hi> fearing that his Evidence would not hold water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther proofe, ſtops the proceedings, till he had got <hi>Poſitives</hi> to his <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> which thus he labours to obtaine: He corrupts <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi> the Prince's Waiting-woman, with ſtore of Gold, by the means of his chief Secretary, who alſo was to pretend himſelfe a Suiter to <hi>Bonella;</hi> ſhe both credulous, and ambitious, ſwallowes downe the Treaſon, which thus ſhe had agreed to execute: <hi>Bonella</hi> having told <hi>Maximanus</hi> (upon his enquirie) that ever ſince he was diſmiſs'd his attendance, that <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa</hi> lay together in the ſame bed, and that every night before they took their reſt, they drank a glaſſe or two of Cinamond-water: Whereupon ſhe had direction given her, that when they call'd to her next for any of that water, ſhe ſhould drop three drops of that receipt (which ſhe had then given her) into one of their Glaſſes, acquainting her that every drop would caſt them into ſo many houres dead ſleep: Which when ſhe had done, ſhe ſhould informe <hi>Maximanus</hi> of it, and then leave him to act the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonella</hi> puts this horrid Treaſon in execution, the very next night following, and brings word to <hi>Maximanus</hi> what ſhe had done; who asking her <hi>how long it had been ſince ſhe had done the feat,</hi> and <hi>how it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97485:19"/>
wraught with them?</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>Preſently,</hi> and that they were both aſleep before they could get into their bed, ſo that ſhe was faine to help <hi>Amariſſa</hi> to her reſting place by main ſtrength, and that halfe an hour had not ſcarce ſpent its time ſince ſhe had perform'd the work. He diſmiſt her for the preſent, ſent for <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to come before him, as to examine him upon the premiſſes; he anſwers according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and was diſcharg'd with courteous language.</p>
               <p>The Secretary (having his leſſon given him) followes the Gardner out of the chamber, commending him for <hi>his honeſt dealing,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing that he had <hi>come off</hi> ſo well, invites him into his chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes wine upon him, he (little thinking that he ſhooke a Devill by the hand, whilſt he thought he had caught an Angell by the foot) was over-joy'd to ſee himſelfe ſo much made of. At laſt he had two drops of the ſame ingredient, diſtill'd into one of his cups; which having the ſame operation, he was privately carryed and laid in the ſame bed, betweene <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa:</hi> and there they were all three left. Forthwith pretended intelligence was brought, that <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> was ſpy'd privily ſtealing into <hi>Honoria</hi> her chamber, witneſſes were call'd, they went directly to <hi>Bonella's</hi> bed-ſide, and demanded the key of her: She with a counterfeited trembling produces what ſhe had but lately given her: They open the doore, enter the chamber, approach the bed, find them all three faſt aſleep, with <hi>Honoria</hi>'s arme about the Gardners neck. <hi>Maximanus</hi> cryes, <hi>It's pittie to wake them, how ſweetly they lie! I would my Father had made me a Gardner; what a fine time be has of it!</hi> deſiring the company to <hi>wait their pleaſures a while,</hi> knowing the time to be at hand, when that ſomniferous drug (that growes not any where but under the ſhade of death) would wake them with a vengeance. They all withdraw behind the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curtaine of the bed. At laſt <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa</hi> both awake much at a time, yet neither perceived that they had any body between them. <hi>Honoria</hi> taking <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to be <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> and ſhe the ſame to be <hi>Honoria,</hi> both began to wonder at the light which was in the roome, both their heads began to ake, both complained to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Hortenſius</hi> preſently awakes, and finding himſelfe between two, asks <hi>Where am I?</hi> the deceived Innocents ſhreeking out, cry, <hi>What have we here?</hi> In which <hi>interim, Maximanus</hi> and the reſt diſcover themſelves, and cry all with open mouth, <hi>Out you foule Adultereſſe,</hi> to <hi>Honoria; Out you Bawd,</hi> to <hi>Amariſſa; Out you villaine,</hi> to <hi>Hortenſius. Hortenſius</hi> hee skips out of the bed, diſtracted, and amaz'd; <hi>Maximanus</hi> tells him, that <hi>there are his cloathes,</hi> and that <hi>hee knew well enough where he laid them. Hortenſius</hi> begins to ſpeak, as well as Amazement would give him leave. <hi>Maximanus</hi> ſtops his mouth, with bidding them <hi>Carry him away,</hi> and telling him, that <hi>he ſhould ſpeak upon the Rack to morrow. Honoria</hi> begins to ſpeak, like the gentle wind, when it paſſes over the heads of ſweeteſt flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and ſo delightfully carryes their fragrance into our noſtrils; ſo pleaſingly would ſhe have <hi>breath'd</hi> forth her innocence into their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97485:19"/>
eares, but could not be heard. <hi>Amariſſa</hi> began to ſpeak, like the bluſtring <hi>Boreas,</hi> but was out-nois'd by <hi>thunder</hi> and <hi>exclamations.</hi> Both were commanded to riſe out of their beds, and were committed to ſafe Cuſtody for that night.</p>

               <p>Maximanus <hi>thinking with himſelfe, that death would not doe ſo well for his purpoſe as acknowledgment, pawſes a while; at laſt ſpeakes thus unto him:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come ſirrah, thou ſhalt be rul'd by me, I will raiſe thee forth of the Mire, and will ſeat thee in a place of Honour: I will recompence thy ſufferings with the choiceſt favours that my friendſhip can beſtow upon thee: I will ſupply thy wants with ſtore of Riches, I find that thou haſt in thee the principles of a true friend: Bend but thy reſolutions to my intereſt, and be my ſelfe. Away with this thing call'd Honeſty, ſo like a feather in a fooles cap: Let your Conſcience alone, and it will never trouble you; it will never ſpeak if you never examine it; and is nothing elſe but the Idea of a fantaſtick braine: Fear firſt begot in men the awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of a Deity: Rouze up good fellow, what ſayſt thou? Shall thy horſe ſtand in my ſtable, or ſhall it not?</p>
               <p>Hortenſius <hi>(after ſome pauſe) replyes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemes that I have read better Divinity upon the leaves of Flowers, and Herbs, then you have read in all the folio's of your Books. No Sir, you have a Conſcience that would ſpeak to you without examining, but you will not hear it; and trouble you too, but that you hide your ſelfe out of thoſe wayes it would direct you, and ſecure it as you have done <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa. But conſidering with himſelfe, how that he might (happily) do them more ſervice by preſerving his owne life (though with a</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>villany) rather then (by death) to deſtroy the chiefeſt witneſſe of their innocence, by</hi> reall <hi>Martyrdome. He was ſorry that he had gone ſo farre, and thus he endeavours to re-collect himſelf.)</hi> And beſides, if I ſhould hearken to your allurements, you your ſelfe would think me to be the baſeſt fellow in the world, and would uſe me accordingly, when you had once wrought your ends upon me. No <hi>(ſaid</hi> Maximanus) it is the property of thoſe to love the Treaſon, and hate Traytor, who are otherwiſe themſelves. Vipers nere ſting Vipers, though they gnaw their way through the very bowels of their Dam: the innocent Dove can have rough feet; and of Cruelty it ſelfe it can be ſaid no more, then that it hath rough hands. Give me the wiſedome of the Serpent, who ſtops his eares at the voices of thoſe Charmers, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97485:20"/>
carry ammunition poiſon with their ſtings, rather then the nature of thoſe ſilly Doves, and Pigeons, that can fight, and have no gaul. It is as naturall for Thunder-bolts to ſtrike, as 'tis for Mothers to ſnatch their Children from harmes-way. It is onely the contrariety of thy diſpoſition unto mine, that makes thee obſtinate, a fooliſh fancy, a femall pitty that makes thee thus: It is not my fault, nor thine, to doe ſuch things as theſe, 'tis theirs, to over-load us with what we cannot bear, and then to ſtand in our way.</p>
               <p>What ſmoother then the face of water? what creature runnes a gentler courſe then the ſmiling River, as it glides a long with ſo many pretty dimples in the cheekes of her fair purling ſtreames? But if a tempeſt riſe, what more out-ragious then the Sea? If ſtormes give orders to Crekes and Rivolets, Brookes and Torrents to charge both flankes of this faire troop of waters, in their march, it ſwels, and makes the greater haſte to diſ-engage it ſelf, by cutting through the Van, that it may bear all down before it; ſo that theſe out-rages are not in our nature but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> be at once both Wiſe and Happy.</p>
               <p>What would you have me doe? <hi>(reply'd</hi> Hortenſius.)</p>
               <p>I would have thee ſay <hi>(ſaid</hi> Maximanus) that thou wert Courted by thoſe Ladyes to pleaſures, whoſe temptations were above reſiſtance. None can blame thee, but them; Thou ſhalt erect a happineſſe upon their Ruines, that ſhall not lie within the power of fate to ſhatter. If I ſtand, thou ſtand'ſt; If I fall, thou fall'ſt; throwne downe with a winde that ſhall either ſhake the Earth, or blow the Maſſy Crown from off the Princes Head, with no more then difficulty if a Hat and Feather ſhould stand in competition with the wind. <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Hortenſius, Sir, I am at your ſervice and diſpoſall, direct me wayes how I may be uſefull to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus they (ſeemingly) agreed: Reports ranne over all the Pallace, that</hi> Hortenſius <hi>had confeſs'd his fault, and accus'd the Ladyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ladyes hearing of it, were ſtruck with horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, look'd up to Heaven, wondring</hi> that the Gods took no more care of humane Affaires. <hi>Sometimes they could finde in their hearts to turn Atheiſts, but thoſe thoughts were laid aſide, with confidence that they ſhould be vindicated in their Reputations, though not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet after death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hortenſius <hi>was highly rewarded, and promoted to high dignities, whoſe ſuddain riſing made the wiſer ſort, ſoon believe, that the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had not rais'd that Mount without the Devils help: All things were carryed clear againſt the Ladyes, and</hi> Maximanus <hi>ſuppoſed by ſome to have perform'd the part of a vigilant</hi> Scout-maſter; <hi>by others, of a perfidious</hi> Bloud-hound.</p>
               <p>Bonella <hi>muſt now be thought upon, (as moſt</hi> convenient) <hi>that ſhe ſhould not live; whereupon the Secretrary pretends to run away with her, (having both feather'd their neſts ſufficiently) to which ſhe was willingly enough enclin'd, &amp; ſo by the way to murder her, which was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97485:21"/>
thus far put in execution: He attends her towards the Wood, which when he had far enough entred, tells her what ſhe muſt truſt to, and what his Commands were. Whereat</hi> Bonella <hi>wept, and askt him,</hi> Will you doe it? Is your love come to this, and your profeſsion murder? I muſt confeſſe I have deſerv'd it, for ſhaking hands with ſuch a Tyrant in ſo great Villanies: But know, that his <hi>20000</hi> Crownes were none of the allurements that made me to do this foul injury to ſuch innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but it was your love, and to obtain that which made me thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of all goodneſſe, and am I thus rewarded? Know you not that the Tyrant will not ſuffer one to live, who is acquainted with his Villany? And doe you think you ſhall eſcape at laſt? No, you may have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to goe laſt to pot. But aſſure your ſelfe, he will not leave a man to live within the compaſſe of betraying him with recantation. No! Doe not doe this, though it be juſtice in regard of my ſelfe, yet it is iniquity in reſpect of you. I have not deſerv'd it at your hands, leave off this wicked purpoſe, and goe along with me, and thou ſhalt never want. I have ſent <hi>600</hi> Crownes beyond the Seas, I have a thouſand hid under the ground, that never ſhall riſe out of the Earth if I fall to duſt: Thou haſt wealth enough of thy own, both together will make up a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Fortune to maintain us. Or if thou didſt but make me believe thou lov'dſt me, to worke this helliſh Plot by my meanes; yet let me but live, and I will bequeath that to thee, as a recompence of thy mercy towards me: otherwiſe, whether I ſhall find a Grave, or not, that ſhall lie buried where it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Secretary being ſomewhat touch'd with theſe words, (but eſpecially being loath to loſe ſo much money which might be had by Craft) tells her,</hi> That the truth was, he never intended to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, but for her last requeſt he would grant it, upon condition that ſhe would acquaint him where her treaſure lay: <hi>Which, upon many Oathes and Execrations that he would not murder her, but leave her there in the Wood to ſhift for her ſelfe, ſhe told him where it was, which, when ſhe had done (for two reaſons ſake: the firſt,</hi> That he might be as good as his word. <hi>The ſecond,</hi> That if ſhe did not tell him rightly, he might know where to find her.) <hi>He cauſes her to climb up an old hollow Tree, and lets her down into the bottome of it, telling her,</hi> That there ſhe muſt remain untill ſuch time as he had found the truth of her relation. <hi>And there he left her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Back goes the Secretary, and gives his Maſter an accompt of the buſineſſe, as perform'd according to his injunction, who believes it; and forthwith leads him over a Trap-door, made for ſome ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, who not acquainted with the mode of ordering his ſteps, falls down a Precipice, and there was hideouſly ſlain, falling down upon ſharp ſtakes, ſtuck in the bottome ready to receive him. Whereupon</hi> Maximanus <hi>gives it out, that his Servant, and</hi> Bonella <hi>were both fled, being acceſſaries to the foul Adultery, and that upon the Confeſſion of</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>who takes all</hi> upon <hi>him, now that he may have all to</hi> throw <hi>hereafter.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Drums had beat up a March to the tyr'd Souldiers feet over the <hi>Feſsian</hi> Mountains (and the ſhrill Trumpet, with his Breath, call'd on the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Troops to follow) faſter then the wearied Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries could anſwer to the hot ſpur of their fierce riders. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> might behold (in a fair pleaſant Valley) a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious place for quartering his Army, (having a pretty Village cloſe adjoyning, which, together with the indiſpoſedneſſe of his Army to march any further, invited his Highneſſe reſolution there to reſt his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard) inquiring what great Perſonage did own ſo great happineſſe to be ſo well ſeated. It was anſwered, that the Lady <hi>Paramount,</hi> to all that fruitfull Plaine, and ſtately Building, her name was <hi>Cosbia,</hi> who eſpying an Army to deſcend the Hils, with Colours flying, as if ſome curious Garden had deſcended the craggy Mountaines, to have given Battell to her ſet of Tulips. She ſent to know the cauſe, and dive into the meaning of ſuch an approach.</p>
               <p>The Meſſenger having delivered his Errand, was ſent back with this accompt: <hi>That it was</hi> Lorenzo, <hi>Prince of</hi> Carthage, <hi>who in caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the bold</hi> Moores <hi>attempt upon his Confines, followed the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and was conſtrain'd (as his March fell out) to trouble her, and the reſt of her good Neighbours with one nights lodging; aſſuring her, that the demeanour both of him, and his, ſhould be rather like Gueſts, then Souldiers.</hi> The old Lady thought it policy to make a vertue of neceſſity, and entertain him worthily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was no ſooner entred the Pallace, but he call'd to mind <hi>Aminda,</hi> her engagement; for he was no ſooner invited to reſt himſelf upon the Couch, by the ſide of the old Beldam <hi>Cosbia,</hi> but he began to ask her <hi>how many Sonnes ſhe had?</hi> who anſwered, <hi>Two.</hi> The Prince deſired <hi>to be acquainted with their names:</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>If he pleas'd, he might Honour them, and her, with taking notice of their Perſons, for they were both either neer, or within the Houſe. Lorenzo demanded the cognizance of their Names:</hi> She told him, That <hi>the one was known by the name of</hi> Jacomius, <hi>the other of</hi> Berontus. The Prince demanded <hi>which was the Eldeſt of the two?</hi> The Lady (though ſomewhat ſtagger'd) anſwer <hi>Jacomius;</hi> whereat the Prince ſeemed ſatisfied, (for the preſent) but after a while, the two Brothers entring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97485:22"/>
the Roome, they had no ſooner made their obeyſance to the Prince, but the Prince calls to minde the relation that <hi>Aminda's</hi> Ghoſt had given him; whereupon he ſalutes <hi>Berontus</hi> with a more Princely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then his younger Brother, whereat the old Lady (conſcious of her owne injuſtice) was ſtruck with fear <hi>(the inſeparable ſhadow of a guilty Conſcience)</hi> that ſhe had been betray'd; and that the Army had advanced thither to no other purpoſe but to vindicate the wrong which her partiallity had caſt upon her lawfull Heir, and Eldeſt ſonne: yet notwithſtanding, ſhe plucks up her ſpirits, and tells <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that <hi>ſhe ſuppoſed he was miſtaken, for that was her Eldeſt ſonne,</hi> pointing at <hi>Jacomius:</hi> The Prince tells her, that <hi>he believ'd that neither he, nor ſhe, were miſtaken, though ſhe thought to blind the world with ſuch a falſhood, as rendred her unworthy of the</hi> Cosbian <hi>name.</hi> Neither of the two young Princes <hi>knew</hi> his meaning, <hi>Cosbia did;</hi> the Prince drew forth his Memorandum, and gave Orders to bring before him ſuch, and ſuch, as were inſerted in the Paper. They were all brought before him, examined, confeſſing (in the midſt of the Army, as if they had been ſurrounded by ſo many Ghoſtly Fathers) all that had been done, and how (at the unjuſt commands of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Cosbia)</hi> they had hitherto kept her unjuſt precepts, but now they could not withſtand the truth any longer; whereat <hi>Berontus</hi> raiſes up himſelf a thought higher then he was before, <hi>Jacomius</hi> knew not what to think on't: <hi>Cosbia</hi> (as if ſome Deity had deſcended from the Gods, with an Army of Intelligencers) declares the truth: where upon by the Prince his mediation, <hi>Cosbia,</hi> her willingneſſe, and the clear evidence that the witneſſes did give) the two Brothers were agreed. <hi>Berontus</hi> was to be (thence forward) acknowledged right Heire (as Elder Brother) to the <hi>Cosbian</hi> Family, and <hi>Jacomius</hi> was by conſent (of all parties) to inherit the Dukedom that was deſcended by their great Uncle <hi>Bomon.</hi> Supper-ſeaſon caus'd the Cloath to lay aſide all buſineſſe, ſo that they were at laſt ſenſible of no other want but reſt.</p>
               <p>When time had thus put on her night-cloathes, and the night had brought <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (thus) to Bed, <hi>Aminda,</hi> her gratefull Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, gives <hi>Lorenzo</hi> thanks and melody, with this Song at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window.</p>

               <p>Whereupon <hi>Philoret</hi> finding them all at a ſtand, he betakes him to his old ſtratagem, blacks his face, and the faces of one hundred more, which were the flower of all the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Chivalry, and takes <hi>Lorenzo, Bertaldo, Berontus, Coſdruball,</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> with him along, (as if they had been Priſoners) cauſing the reſt of that party to draw farther off, which (with the thick miſts aſſiſtance) ſoon was out of ſight, and Orders were ſent to the reſt of the Army, that as ſoone as ever they ſhould hear a rumbling within the guts of the foul Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they ſhould make ruptures into the very bowels of the beaſt, up to the place where they ſhould find the Prince to be engaged. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they act, <hi>Philoret</hi> brings in his Captives, tells the <hi>Moores,</hi> that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army is quite fled, and gone, and that in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit he had taken ſo many men of note, whom he brought for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto the Emperour, that their qualities might be known: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Moores</hi> gave a ſhout that made the Skies ring: <hi>Tomolin</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received intelligence of his ſuppoſed happy fortune, ſends Commands to bring the Priſoners before him, when the Emperour ſate upon his Horſe guarded with the Quinteſſence of all the <hi>Affrican</hi> Nobility, on whom the ſuppoſed Priſoners, and the reſt, fell like a fierce Storme; at which ſame time, the ſeverall parties following their directions, this great Gyant fell to ground, as ſtab'd to the Heart, and maim'd in all his Limbes; <hi>Berontus</hi> having ſlaine the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with his own hands. Thus <hi>Victory put palmes into theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes hands, but ſhe reſerved the Bayes to crown the Virgin Temples.</hi>
               </p>

Philoret</hi> amaz'd (with horrour) at the danger of his own merit, thus modeſtly refuſes his preferment: <hi>I hope I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſo ill this day, as that I ſhould now loſe my place; I eſteeme no Dignity comparable to my relation to</hi> Bertaldo; <hi>and when I am turn'd out of his ſervice, I ſhall be uſeleſſe for any action.

The Letter was ſuperſcrib'd <hi>for</hi> Lorenzo, <hi>Prince of</hi> Carthage: <hi>My Honoured Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Letter <hi>Honoria</hi> delivered to <hi>Pippea,</hi> who was as punctuall in her performance, as if her yeares had promis'd much diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Philoret</hi> is come to Court whom (having put on her maiden habit, whereby ſhe might be <hi>leaſt</hi> known in being <hi>likeſt</hi> her ſelfe, and the better <hi>conceal'd</hi> by leaving off her <hi>Diſguiſe)</hi> we will call by her own name, <hi>Periiſſa,</hi> who applies her ſelfe to <hi>Corderius</hi> (a true friend to <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> and a great rarity in Court, an noneſt man) one who was ſufficiently already ſatisfied of the great wrongs which <hi>Honoria</hi> had ſuſtain'd through the unjuſt uſage of <hi>Maximanus?</hi> they two (having conferr'd notes together) thought fit, that he ſhould admit her into his houſe as his Maid ſervant, whereby ſhe might conceal her ſelf the better: Thus <hi>Periiſſa</hi> was diſguis'd in the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of her own Habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periiſſa Hums</hi> about the Court like an induſtrious <hi>Bee,</hi> dwelling longeſt upon that <hi>Flower</hi> where moſt <hi>Honney</hi> was to be gather'd; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, ſhe finds <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his diſcourſes (like beds) beſt ſet with flowers of Invitation for her ſeeking faculty; him ſhe Courts, and ſmiles upon; her, he thinkes as halfe his own: he asketh her the queſtion, he takes her ſilence for conſent. She makes uſe of her <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> apprehenſion, as a <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> of Policy, telling him, <hi>that if he would but anſwer her to own question truly, and ſolve but one doubt really, be ſhould ſoon know more of her mind: He vowes performance, and aſſures ſolution in any matter that ſhe ſhould propound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periiſſa</hi> ſoon reply'd, <hi>my Queſtion is, (as you are a true Lover) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no do you think that</hi> Honoria <hi>is innocent.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hortenſius</hi> fetching a deep ſigh, anſwered, <hi>I would you were mine but halfe ſo ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And looking behind him, he told her, that <hi>no place was ſafe for that diſcourſe, where ſtones were laid together by the power of Art, nor would he trust Woods and Trees, but as they grew ſimply, and out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when the Square and Line is once drawn over them, I cannot believe, but that (thereby) they are conjur'd into intelligencers; and that their Buildings have ſpies in every corner. Therefore (Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart) if you be pleas'd to repoſe ſo much confidence in me, as to walke over the Meadowes, and to truſt your ſelfe with a Faith that never ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſht its profeſſor into a place of Trust, I will tell you (by the way, and in the truſty Groves) ſuch things (concerning the buſineſs, wherein you would ſo faine be ſatisfied) as ſhall not leave you ſo much as a place for ſcruple.</hi>

                  <hi>Periiſſa</hi> glad of this profeſſion, preſently went along with him, where (by the way) <hi>Hortenſius</hi> open'd his breaſt, and ſhewed her all the ſecrets that were lockt up there, concerning the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, between <hi>Maximanus,</hi> and <hi>Honoria;</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Maximanus;</hi> untill ſuch time as approaching the Tree where <hi>Bonella</hi> periſhed in the Hollow (by reaſon of the Secretaries periſhing in the <hi>Dungeon.)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97485:27"/>
Periiſſa</hi> (as if her divining Soul had bid her <hi>stand)</hi> makes a <hi>halt,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>Will you tell me then</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>if theſe things be true, what can you expect but to be made away at laſt, as the reſt of his unhappy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments have been already? You that Act their part, muſt have their Exit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truly</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius) I look for no other.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97485:27"/>
whereunto they communed (by the way) about the manner of the accompliſhment. <hi>Periiſſa</hi> having brought <hi>Hortenſius</hi> privily to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derius</hi> his houſe, ſhe forthwith declares her ſelf to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to be <hi>Bertaldo</hi> his Page, ſhewing him her Apparel, her Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and calling upon <hi>Corderius</hi> to witneſſe (what he thought to be) truth: <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſoon quitted his amorous paſſion, and fell in love with the deſigne. <hi>Corderius</hi> preſently haſtens them both away, with inſtructions, &amp; ſome other Intelligence (relating to diſcoveries) which he himſelf had lately found out in <hi>Honoria</hi> her behalf. So that they were both gone upon a ſuddaine. <hi>Maximanus</hi> miſſing his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and gueſſing (rightly) that it would ſoon be employ'd againſt himſelf: and finding a great many of ſtrange faces, with unwonted behaviours, daily looking upon him, thought it high time for him to look about: wherefore placing a ſtrong Guard of <hi>confiding</hi> men to look well to the Princeſſe, and keep the reſt in aw, he himſelfe makes all the ſpeed he could to <hi>Moretania</hi> (where <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was) and ſends Poſt after <hi>Hortenſius</hi> and <hi>Philoret</hi> (his ſuppoſed Miſtreſſe) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his flight as a matter of no ſmall conſequence; ſo that they were both ſeiz'd upon at the Ferry ſide (ſtay'd too long by contrary winds) by the Governour of <hi>Molocco,</hi> by vertue of Letters ſent by <hi>Maximanus,</hi> charging them with the Higheſt Treaſon, and ſo were put into ſafe Cuſtody, to attend the comming of <hi>Maximanus. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loret</hi> then in Priſon comforts up <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and betakes him to his old Stratagem (his Box of Oyntment) blacks his Face, alters his Habit, and ſo conveighs away his Letters and Inſtructions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with himſelfe (at noone day) ſo inviſibly, as if he had carryed night about him; and ſo went unto the Governour himſelfe, and preoccupies his underſtanding with ſuch ſeaſonable truthes, as his owne well-furniſhed abilities and dexterity could eaſily infuſe into a man who had not been poſſeſs'd with prejudice, nor by aſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to either party: and ſo acquainted the Governour with the hard ſhift that he was faine to make to come to ſpeak with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tyrant <hi>Maximanus</hi> ſhould batter the Juſtice of ſo good a Cauſe, with the engine of his falſe pretences: whereupon he thruſts his hand into a Baſon of water, (that ſtood there by accident) and waſhes and wipes the diſguiſe from off his face. Whereupon the Governour ſaid unto him, That <hi>he had obſerv'd many to have put a Good Face upon a bad Matter, but he never had obſerv'd any to put a Bad Face upon a good Cauſe before.</hi> But the newes of <hi>Maximanus</hi> his arrivall, broke off all further diſcourſe: the Governour (doing that which he moſt deſir'd) diſmiſs'd him to his Fellow priſoner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, That <hi>neither of them ſhould ſuffer the leaſt injury from him, by any meanes that</hi> Maximanus <hi>ſhould attempt: And that he would ſee them ſafely brought to</hi> Lorenzo.

to hard uſage.

I ſhall know the truth, that's ſomething; nay, that's all: For if ſhe be true, and faithfull to me, my heart's at reſt: If ſhe be falſe, yet I am ſatisfied in this, that I cannot wrong her whatſoere I doe. Wherefore I will not endure another dayes torment to gaine all</hi> Affrica. <hi>Prepare your ſelf to goe along with me, I will be ready this night by ten of the Clock at the Park-gate all alone, there meet me privately; none ſhall know where we have been, or what we have done.</hi>

contrary colour, ſaying: <hi>Sir, I would not miſtruſt that woman to gaine the world; if you doe, you doe your ſelfe a great deal of wrong. Bertaldo</hi> ſaluted <hi>Maximanus</hi> very kindly, ſeeing <hi>Lorenzo</hi> look ſo cheerfully, whom he hoped (by this time) to be diſpoſſeſs'd of that peaking Devill, Jealouſie, by ſome <hi>Exerciſme</hi> that <hi>Maximanus</hi> had then us'd, all was well, all were merry and joviall, a ſine time, if it would hold: But alas, this was but that which we call <hi>lightning</hi> before <hi>death; mirth,</hi> before <hi>ſorrow;</hi> and <hi>laughter,</hi> before <hi>deſtruction.</hi> The time appointed is already come, wherein <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Maximanus</hi> were to meet, who both kept touch with one another (as ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſeldome faile) they accoſted (betimes in the morning at the Caves mouth) this <hi>Mandragora</hi> (the Devils Corn-cutter) who (when he has you by the foot, can eaſily tell you where the ſhooe wri<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Forthwith <hi>Maximanus</hi> leads the innocent <hi>Lorenzo</hi> by the hand down into the Cave (like the venemous Spider, who once having entangled the harmleſſe ſilly Flie within his Web, he drags him into his hole to torment, and there devour him) who having thus <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> forſaken the <hi>light,</hi> and condeſcended to thoſe deeds of <hi>darkneſs. Apollio,</hi> the Devils Engineer, takes a Cuſhion in his hand ſtuffed with Moſſe, that had been gathered off of dead mens Sculs, and claps it downe into a Chair, whoſe ſeat was ſoftned with dead mens hair, legg'd and arm'd with dead mens Bones, and covered with their Skinnes: and bids <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to <hi>ſit downe:</hi> Telling him, that <hi>now he is come there, he muſt doe as the place requires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he falls to his conjuring termes, and circulations, which when he had throughly perform'd, he <hi>ſqueezes</hi> out of a bottle a glaſſe of water, or juice, that was extracted, and diſtill'd out of no other herb, or ſimple, but that which we (uſually) call <hi>Jewes-eares;</hi> this he bids <hi>Lorenzo</hi> drink, ſtill telling him, that <hi>now he is come there, he muſt needs doe as the place requires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> neither knowing what he <hi>did,</hi> nor yet what farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions might be <hi>required</hi> at his hands, once wiſh'd he had not put himſelfe under a power wherein he was ſo ignorant of the danger of the diſobedience; the frighted judgment of his brain (that then was ray'd with his own hair, ſtanding ſtiffe an end, like ported feathers of ſome Porcupine) told him, That <hi>now he was gone ſo farre, it was no wiſdome, and perhaps, no ſafety to retire.</hi> Wherefore he drank it off,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97485:30"/>
then <hi>Apollio</hi> takes the milk of the <hi>Hienna,</hi> which he held out to him in a little cup, whoſe materiall was a <hi>dry'd</hi> and well <hi>wrought</hi> Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, which this <hi>Apollio</hi> called <hi>Eye-bright Water,</hi> willing him to waſh his eyes therewith, not forgetting to tell him, That <hi>now he was come there, he muſt needs doe as the place requir'd.</hi> Which he obeys. Theſe two Informers thus ſufficiently corrupted, they could preſently hear a fearfull noiſe, as that of Waters, falling downe their <hi>Precipice;</hi> then another like that of <hi>Thunder;</hi> afterwards a hollow ſound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that which men doe uſe to hear immediately after <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes:</hi> And at laſt, a ruſling noiſe like flames of Fire, after they have newly made their eruptions out of their mothers womb. <hi>Apollio</hi> cryes <hi>ſilence</hi> to the four Elements, and all obey: Forthwith they might hear the <hi>language</hi> of <hi>Court-ſhips,</hi> the <hi>ſmacks</hi> of <hi>Kiſſes,</hi> the <hi>clapping</hi> of <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and the <hi>laughing</hi> at <hi>Jeſts:</hi> And theſe ſo Acted to the life, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> might eaſily ſuppoſe them to be <hi>Honoria</hi>'s words &amp; laughter before he ſaw her. Then he might ſee <hi>Honoria</hi> with <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his Armes about her <hi>Neck,</hi> and <hi>hers</hi> about his <hi>Middle,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring a loof, and after thoſe laſcivious poſtures that were between them, more uncivil then fitting to be expreſs'd: He beheld <hi>Hortenſius</hi> throwing her downe againſt a Flowry bank, committing thoſe <hi>non dicenda's,</hi> which my Pen cannot be guilty of the relation; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Lorenzo's</hi> fancy was ſo ſtrong, that his imagination thought it ſo reall, as that he drew his Sword, and would have executed vengeance upon a delinquency that never had a being, but in the <hi>Hiennas</hi> milk that had waſh'd his Eyes, had not <hi>Apollio</hi> with his black rod forbade the enterpriſe by a waſted prohibition over the Prince his Head. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> cryes aloud, <hi>I have ſeene enough, and will be reveng'd for what I've ſeene. Apollio</hi> Brandiſhes his Black Rod againe, and tells him, <hi>He muſt ſee all with patience now he is there, and be as much diſpleas'd afterwards as the cauſe required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was now vexed that he muſt ſee more, and have (for the preſent) no other ſubject (but a Type) to wreak his fury on: In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content he flings himſelfe downe into the Chaire, in ſuch diſorderly method, that he brake the legs and armes thereof, recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the fall, with bruiſing his right hand, which was a good Omen, <hi>viz.</hi> that at laſt he ſhould break the bones of that deluſion wherein he had ſeated himſelf by ſuch perſwaſion, and recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the cruſh of <hi>Maximanus.</hi> Now the ſcene is altered, and there appeares a faire goodly Chamber, with a Rich Bed, which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> remembred (well enough) exactly to ſet forth his owne. <hi>Apollio</hi> with his Charming inſtrument drawes open the Curtaines; ſo that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> plainly ſaw <hi>Hortenſius</hi> (between <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa)</hi> kiſſing <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa</hi> (with violent hands) ſnatching the kiſſes (head and all) from the embracing Armes of (the as much Beautifull, as abus'd) <hi>Honoria;</hi> together with ſome other <hi>Non-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda's</hi> that were not to be believ'd by any, but by ſuch as had learn'd their <hi>Creed</hi> out of the Devils <hi>Chatechiſme.

obſerv'd <hi>too much by all:</hi> Leaves that <hi>Helliſh darkneſſe</hi> for the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light;</hi> and ſwears by the true <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that <hi>ſhadow,</hi> that he will be ſeverely reveng'd upon that <hi>foul</hi> Abuſe, and <hi>fair</hi> Adultreſſe: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>this was</hi> Amariſſa<hi>'s ſpightfulneſſe towards him, to Bawd out her revenge for his ſuppoſed for ſaking of her, but he would be quit with her.</hi> Preſently Signing to both their Deaths under his owne Hand, written againſt the Shoulder of <hi>Maximanus,</hi> that was broad enough to <hi>bear</hi> ſo great injuries to <hi>others,</hi> whilſt they were ſo <hi>narrow</hi> in his <hi>owne</hi> behalfe, that they were not able to <hi>ſupport</hi> the burthen of a Chaſt deniall.</p>
               <p>Thus the laſt Act being ended, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having ſpoke the Epilogue, <hi>Maximanus</hi> gives the <hi>Plaudite</hi> in theſe words:</p>

                  <hi>As long as there was any favourable poſsibility of beating back a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that forc'd it ſelf ſo violently upon me (you know) I did withſtand it, but now I muſt give way, and applaud your reſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) thou art too good, and I too happy in ſuch a Friend; crown all thy other ſervices with thy obedience to this one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: look that they doe not live longer then the time that thou ſhalt be Riding Poſte to</hi> Carthage, <hi>ſhall defer the Execution, and that it may be the ſooner done, make haſte to Horſe. O Whores, and hatefull pieces of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind, I am ſorry you have but one life apiece to loſe. Make haſte</hi> Maximanus, <hi>I pray thee make haſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid <hi>Maximanus) what will you doe with</hi> Bertaldo? <hi>if you doe not make ſure of him, you'l finde a Canker in your boſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) be ſure I'le pare his Nailes, and knock the teeth out of his Head when firſt I meet him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus, good Maximanus,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) wilt thou make all the haſte thou canst, and let me hear from thee as ſoone as ere thou canſt that they are dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So they both parted, the <hi>one</hi> with a <hi>laugh</hi> in his <hi>Sleeve,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> with a <hi>flea</hi> in his <hi>Ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> returning from his <hi>Purgatory,</hi> to his <hi>Palace, Bertaldo</hi> could not be long out of his ſight, but ſalutes him in this language: <hi>How fares the Prince? we thought that we had loſt you, none could tell what was become of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> gives him this ſullen reply, <hi>It may be ſo, what of that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> asked him, <hi>what was become of</hi> Maximanus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> told him, that <hi>Maximanus was, where</hi> Maximanus <hi>ſhould be, about his buſineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (ſuppoſing that <hi>Maximanus</hi> (having engroſſed him to himſelf all that time of abſence) had put him into this bad humour) told him, That <hi>he beleeved that</hi> Maximanus <hi>had done ill Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his Sister; wiſhing him to beware how he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be abus'd by ſuch an inſtrument.</hi>

truth whereof, ſince I ſaw you last, I have been fully ſatisfied.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was an Errour that I acknowledg'd it to be ſo,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) but now my judgement ſtands on better termes.</hi>

                  <hi>No, on worſer Grounds,</hi> reply'd <hi>Bertaldo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo lyes,</hi> reply'd the Prince.</p>
               <p>Whereat <hi>Bertaldo</hi> having loſt all patience, told him, That <hi>neither the Guard of his Perſon, nor his Conquering Army, ſhould any longer confine his Soul from her Enlargement; but that he durſt tell him to his face, that he was unworthy of her, and his un-princely behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her undeſerving of the least perfection in her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereat they both drew their Swords upon one another, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lay on blowes: <hi>Coſdruball</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> ſtanding by would not ſuffer it, but lay'd <hi>hands</hi> upon <hi>Bertaldo, perſwaſions</hi> upon <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> neither prevailing: The Prince his Guard was call'd, and ſeiz'd upon <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who by Command was committed a cloſe Priſoner. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſtill raving againſt <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> with no ſmall threatnings againſt <hi>Bertaldo.</hi> The night (comming on) that ſhould have given him reſt, adminiſters new matter of diſquietneſſe; for <hi>Aminda</hi>'s (now) <hi>angry</hi> Genius gives him this Curtain-lecture as a cooling Card to his over-boyling Rage.</p>

I am not bound to tell you (ſaid the Governour.) <hi>Maximanus</hi> began to ſmell a Rat, and thought it high time to looke about him, and to make haſte with his Execution, for fear of a Reprieve: nonſuited, he departs ſuddenly for <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Governour ſends his Wards to <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and brings them partly on their way, where we leave them, and haſten after <hi>Maximanus,</hi> whom we have now overtaken, within the Walls of <hi>Carthage.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97485:32"/>
theſe two Innocents, privily, by night, into the Wood, and there to Murder them: they receive their Wages, and goe about their worke. <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa</hi> (not having ſeen one another many a day) now ſee themſelves both carried (like two ſheep) unto the ſlaughter; they wept on one another, but were ſoone parted, and dragg'd away by night into the Wood, (the Moone ſhining bright) wherein, they were no ſooner entred, but one of the Murderers told them that <hi>they muſt die.

To let you ſee</hi> (reply'd Honoria) <hi>what a vanity it is that you hunt after; Beauty is but skin deep, and that skin you could not tell how to touch without being beholding to ſo poore an acceſſary as the light of a Candle: Cotton, and Tallow, are fine ingredients, to be of the Eſſence of your amorous Paſsion; for, you ſee without them, you were as farre from laying hands, as eyes upon the object of your delight, which is not ſo much reall, as it is imaginary; nor is it ſo much as valuable by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination neither, but by accident, like glaſſe or ice, that have no luſtre in themſelves, but by reflection of a ſecond cauſe: Alas! this thing which you call Beauty wherewith you men are ſo tranſported, is but differenc'd from Deformity, like the gliſtring rayes of Steele and Iron, that's ſtill the ſame in ſubstance, worth, and quality, with that which is but ruſty: Alas! what is this inconſiderate thing called Beauty? a thing not qualified with ſo much virtue as are ſeverall ſtones, ſalt-water, or rotten wood: Nay, the beautifulleſt outſide of Woman-kind has not thoſe priviledges, that nature hath beſtowed upon the ſcales of fiſhes, or the eyes of catts, all theſe have their excellencies viſibility in the darke, but you could neither ſee, nor finde, nor touch, nor take your pleaſure, but by ſome other meanes, which was neither in your ſelfe, nor me; wherefore if you will be rightly in love, be not in love with Accidents, but with that ſubſtance, to which light it ſelfe is but a ſhadow. The ſoule that forſakes the Divine love, and gives it to the Creature, is like the ſilly Chicken, who having loſt his parent, followes after the next creature that it meets withall; your love is but miſplac'd; Oh! how admirably would you love the Gods? how well beſtow'd were that affection? yet I wil not deny but that there is a lawfull, and true love proper between Man and Woman; but withall, there is an idoneity in placing that affection, it must not be fixt upon an illicit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſuch a one, as I am to all mankinde, that are affected with the awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of a deity, having vow'd my ſelfe, a Veſtall Virgin: Wherefore make your retreat as honorable as you can, and let your behaviour be ſuch, to your poore Servant, as becomming the honour of your Ancestory, and a patterne of true piety, and virtue.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>You ſee how that you are more afraid then hurt, and that there was more Sport then Harme in my Revenge: You ſee I can play with you and yet not hurt you; and, if it be not your own fault, you ſhall find, that I can Jeſt with you, and Shame you not. For I proteſt unto you, there is none of all thoſe Swaſh-bucklers, or Halbertiers, that knew the leaſt particular of my intention; neither have any taken notice of your fear, nor is it poſsible they ſhould know that it was any trick of mine, neither was there any intention to doe you the leaſt hurt. And upon my Honour,</hi> Fanor <hi>(him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) was no more privy to this plot then the Sucking Child: For it was I (that had a mind to be friends with you) who cauſed him to invite us both unto a Supper; I am at the Charges of the Feaſt, I ordered the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; this was to be but the beginning of a Maſque, whereby (as it were) the ſcene of bluſtring Mars was open'd, next whereunto Peace is to appear with all her plenty in her Armes, placing her ſeverall Diſhes upon the Table.</hi> Fanor <hi>I ſent away on purpoſe (upon an Errant) that he ſhould not take notice of my deſigne; now, if you can keep your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and uſe me well; that is to ſay, let me have my will, for I will have it, you ſhall never be diſgrac'd for all this: otherwiſe I will ſhew you twenty ſuch tricks as theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoron</hi> (about to <hi>commend</hi> her wiſdome, <hi>aſſure</hi> her of performance of her deſires, and to <hi>Embrace</hi> her in his Armes) brought ſuch a ſcent along with him, that ſhe could not but take notice of it, and offer him her aſſiſtance, (as farre as it was fitting) wherefore ſhe told him, (merrily, and ſmiling upon him) <hi>My Lord, I know you have bewray'd your ſelf moſt abominably, and there is a neceſsity in it, that I muſt ſtand your friend, or elſe all the wit in both our pericraniums will not be able to keep this a ſecret.

and ſo you may ſhift your ſelfe; and if you can make your ſelf clean, I can keep your councell.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Anor <hi>(perceiving the ſuddaine alteration and ſubmiſſe behaviour of</hi> Thoron <hi>towards his Wife</hi> Armena, <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome other circumſtances) collected a great many particulars conducing to a perfect knowledge of the meanes, whereby</hi> Armena <hi>had obtain'd that</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty <hi>over her Husband, which as good as</hi> known, <hi>ſhe as good as acknowledged, which was the occaſion of ſome diſcourſe betweene them two, concerning atchievements of that nature. For</hi> Armena <hi>was of opinion, That</hi> there was never a Woman in the world, but might have her will of her Husband, and doe what ſhe would with him, except ſhe were a fool (let him be of what diſpoſition he could be of.)</p>
               <p>How is that <hi>(ſaid</hi> Fanor?) That were a Doctrine that would finde many Diſciples if you could teach it them.</p>
               <p>Truly <hi>(ſaid</hi> Armena) I can teach it you.</p>
               <p>With all my heart <hi>(ſaid</hi> Fanor) I would willingly learn it, that I might teach it to my Miſtriſſe, whereby ſhe might become an excellent Wife.</p>
               <p>O <hi>(ſaid</hi> Armena) ſhe will never learn it of you, it muſt be taught her by one of her own ſex, that ſhe may learn it from her.</p>
               <p>How is it I beſeech you Madam?</p>
               <p>A wiſe Wife <hi>(ſaid</hi> Armena) muſt prie into the inclination and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition of her Husband, obſerve his humours, informe her ſelfe of what temper he is made, otherwiſe ſhe gives battaile before ſhe knowes how the enemy lyes: many a fooliſh Woman hath lost the day for want of this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt: if ſhe perceives him to be of a Noble conſtitution of mind, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſpirit, then (whatſoever hers is) let her ſubmit to him: <hi>and then (as a</hi> flint <hi>is ſooner</hi> malleable <hi>that</hi> receives <hi>its ſtroakes upon the</hi> yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97485:37"/>
cuſhion <hi>than upon</hi> reſiſting iron, <hi>ſo the ſtouteſt heart,</hi> mollifies <hi>and</hi> relents, <hi>upon the</hi> ſoftneſſe <hi>of a diſpoſition, that</hi> hardens, <hi>where it meets with</hi> oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Or like a fiddle-ſtick Madame, <hi>(ſaid Fanor)</hi> which though you ſit upon it with all your weight, upon a hard bench, yet it will not break; but if you lay it on a feather-bed, and ſo repoſe your weight upon it, it will break im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>Come, come, you are a wagge <hi>(ſaid Armena)</hi> I ſpeak nothing but reaſon, <hi>Mars</hi> his Men, have <hi>minds,</hi> like <hi>Mars</hi> his Livery; and are of the ſame nature of the Buffe they weare: through which a Straw may inſinuate it ſelfe, when the ſharpeſt edge or point can neither cut nor enter; through which the mildneſſe of a breath can puffe the fierce flame of an incenſed Taper out, which full-chopt <hi>Boreas</hi> (with his keeneſt breath) can never pierce. A noble mind will foſter up thoſe pleaſing ſubmiſsions of a Wife, with ſuch condeſcentions, as ſhall be incouragements to a good ſubject: whereas contention between ſuch high Spirits, is like Brimstone, mingled with Coal and Peter, whereof ſuch a compoſure is ſoone made, as with the additament of the leaſt heat, the whole frames, piles, and building, which have been erected upon no leſſe firme foundation then ſacred vows, and conjugall affections have been oftentimes blown up, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd no greater benefit to their Parents, then Noiſe and Terrour.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe finds her Husband to be a poor ſpirited man, then let her put hard (a Gods Name) for no ſmall ſhare in the Government. Then let her make her ſelf (if ſhe can) a <hi>Free ſtate,</hi> her husband, but her <hi>Duke of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> She doth but like thoſe Indian Women, who carry their <hi>Heads</hi> in their Boſoms: ſuch a Man wil be glad to do any thing for quietnes ſake like dying man, whoſe ſpirits being ſpent, and weak, ſayes <hi>I</hi> to every thing, to avoid troubleſomneſſe) whereas the want of theſe inſpections and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the occaſion of all the combuſtions that are twixt Man and Wife.</p>
               <p>There is no way to make an abject minde become a monster, but by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring of it; and if you ſacrifice complacencies to ſuch a poverty, you make him a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Madame, <hi>(ſaid Fanor)</hi> your Ladyſhip ſpeaks in extreames, but what would you doe if you had an indifferent Man to your Husband?</p>
               <p>Truely <hi>Fanor, (ſaid Armena)</hi> I have often pray'd againſt ſuch a one, and have often requeſted of the God of Marriage, that he would give me either a wiſe Man, or a Foole to my Husband; for, I ever thought, that if I had a wiſe Husband, he knew how to govern me; or, if a Foole, I knew how to order him: but I ſpeake not <hi>(Fanor)</hi> of greater or leſſer capacities of wit and understanding, which allow a meane; but of high or vulgar ſpirits which admit no <hi>medium;</hi> for, the enquiries (I meane) which we make into the diſpoſition of a Man, is to know of what mettle he is made, whether of baſe, or noble? not of what ingenuity he is of, or how many degrees he hath taken in that excellence; for Nobleneſſe is either higher or lower, according to the ſeverall occaſions it hath to worke upon; but ſtill wee are not to conſider them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Species</hi> by their ſeverall occurrences, but as one and the ſame
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97485:38"/>
kinde, and altogether one noble nature; and the latter (being a contrary quality and baſe temper of the blood) we never examine of how inferiour an allay it is, which alſo ſeems to us more or leſſe, according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accidents it meets withall, yet ſtill we muſt <hi>totall</hi> the particulars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Ignobleneſſe;</hi> ſo that in this conſideration, there is no place left for Indifference to act her part, and theſe two leafes of the ſame dore have never a wicket to let a <hi>ſneaking</hi> diſpoſition creep between them; either he muſt be a brave Gallant Man, or elſe ſome faint-hearted coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Companion; and if he be but either of theſe, I can play my game to my owne advantage.</p>
               <p>But all this while Madame, <hi>(ſaid Fanor)</hi> you ſuppoſe the wiſdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in the Wife, what if the Husband were a wiſe Man? may not <hi>he</hi> tame, rule, or have his Wife at his beck of whatſoever ſpirit <hi>ſhe</hi> were of?</p>
               <p>I have granted you that already <hi>ſaid</hi> Armena) my Argument holds good from the leſſer to the greater; but Mans wiſdome must not be there exercis'd in the obſervation of humours, or diſcerning of ſpirits, but in the well management of the power of his dominion: for both Civill and Divine Lawes have given ſuch a ſoveraignty to men over their Wifes, that they oftentimes loſe their Prerogatives by ſeeking to gaine that by Reaſon which is theirs by Authority. He that gives a Woman leave to argue the caſe with him, doth but like a fooliſh Gameſter, that lends a needy fellow mony to play againſt himſelfe. For though the matter be never ſo juſt on her ſide concerning which they may conteſt, yet the cauſe cannot be but unjuſt on her part, in regard it is <hi>Conteſtation,</hi> which ought not to be. I would have a wiſe man to admit his wife his <hi>Councellour,</hi> but not his <hi>Opponent:</hi> to help him to finde out the <hi>truth</hi> of things, but not to ſtrive for <hi>victory</hi> in the Argument, or carry more <hi>ſaile</hi> then <hi>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt</hi> in her words. That man who ſeeks to over top his wifes <hi>high</hi> Spirit with a <hi>higher,</hi> is but like a King who condeſcends to receive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a Subject, by fighting a ſingle duell when he may have his will by his Prerogative. He that anſwers the nimbleneſſe of his wifes tongue with the volubility of his owne, doth but juſtifie the warre by giving quarter: nothing makes this ſubject ſooner rebell, then when ſhe ſees her Emperour knowes not how to Command. I tell thee <hi>Panor,</hi> there is not a diſeaſe in Wedlock, but the Husband is a <hi>fool,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> able enough to cure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fanor,</hi> it may be you think I ſpeak againſt my ſelfe, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Sex, I proteſt I doe not: I had <hi>two</hi> Husbands before I had <hi>this,</hi> and I never received ſuch contentment in <hi>wholly</hi> having my will of the <hi>one,</hi> as I was pleaſed in being altogether at the <hi>others</hi> Command: The <hi>gracefulneſſe</hi> of whoſe rule and government, made my obedience (alwayes <hi>Honourable,</hi> whilſt the <hi>neceſſitated</hi> (yet pleaſing) <hi>encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> over the others right, made me (oftentimes) aſhamed of the <hi>uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi> Wherefore I alwayes pray'd, that if ever I married againe, I might have a Husband that was either a <hi>Fool,</hi> or a <hi>Wiſe man,</hi> that having a <hi>Fool,</hi> I might know how to <hi>order him;</hi> and if a <hi>Wiſe man,</hi> he may know how to <hi>governe me.</hi> But by my troth <hi>Fanor,</hi> I have (now)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97485:38"/>
met with a Man that is neither one or other; wherefore I knew not how to deal with his <hi>folly,</hi> but by playing the <hi>Fool;</hi> nor how to anſwer his ſhare of <hi>wiſdom</hi> but by a piece of <hi>policy. Hereupon Company came in, and ended the Diſpute.</hi>

                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (whoſe eyes were ſtil upon <hi>Philoret,</hi> deſerv'd by her wiſhly looks on him) makes him this ſhort anſwer (longing to parle with his lovely Page) <hi>Sir, whatſoever your perplexities may be, I adviſe you to make haſte to</hi> Carthage, <hi>that you may prevent the miſchief, and (if poſsibly) ſuperſede your Errour.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Oh Bertaldo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lorenzo) thou poureſt Oyle into my wounds, and tak'ſt away the ſmart with that ſame word. Let there be orders given to march this night, I'le goe my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> lets him goe, that he might ſtay and commune with his <hi>(unknown)</hi> Idolatreſſe; who upon his approach, was ſo full of joy, that he knew not how to behave himſelf; whereof <hi>Bertaldo</hi> took ſuch notice, that he anſwered his <hi>Jollity</hi> with asking him <hi>twenty</hi> Queſtions one after another; he, his <hi>frolick,</hi> with anſwering, he knew not <hi>what.</hi> At laſt withdrawing themſelves towards a more ſerious diſcourſe, after that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> had heard <hi>Philoret</hi> (deliberately) relate unto him <hi>all</hi> that had happened, he clapt his hand upon his breaſt, and abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted from him. Poor <hi>Philoret</hi> began to be a little dejected at the manner of it, but <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (recollecting himſelf) made him amends by giving him a double portion of reſpect, ſo that <hi>pleas'd</hi> he was: <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> glad that he had ſtruck in with ſuch a Favourite, all the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers giving them Cap and Knee, (as they went along) as Courtiers uſe to doe to thoſe whom they ſee <hi>gratiouſly</hi> received.</p>
               <p>No other <hi>noiſe</hi> at Court but of <hi>removall,</hi> no other <hi>newes</hi> in the Camp but of a preſent <hi>March;</hi> ſix dayes brought them within the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>Carthage:</hi> and the two Armies <hi>facing</hi> one another, <hi>viz. Maximanus</hi> and <hi>Corderius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> his Men (like good ſtomacks, (having but a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable allowance) have not (as yet) their Appetites whetted with feare of having too many Feeders upon ſo ſmall a Pittance: But upon the approach of <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Forces, they fall too, putting all their hands together in the Diſh (ſliſing it away) for fear of the new commers Mouthes. So was <hi>Corderius</hi> Army ſoone devour'd by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97485:40"/>
                  <hi>Maximanus,</hi> making ſuch haſte to give him Battell before <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſhould come to his Aſſiſtance. <hi>Corderius</hi> fled with his ſcattered Troopes to meet <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> whom <hi>Maximanus</hi> durſt not purſue too farre (for fear of being met with (by <hi>Lorenzo)</hi> out of order) <hi>Lorenzo</hi> wondred <hi>firſt</hi> to ſee two Armies <hi>Face,</hi> then <hi>Fight,</hi> and at <hi>laſt Purſue</hi> each other. At length ſatisfied his <hi>ſeeking</hi> braine by a <hi>full</hi> relation of all that had hapned, by <hi>Corderius;</hi> whoſe preſence, and Commands, ſoone rallyed the <hi>breathleſſe</hi> Souldiers, whoſe <hi>panting</hi> Royall Hearts left their trepidations like the <hi>Needle,</hi> whoſe <hi>point,</hi> when it once findes the northerne Pole, moves no more, then doth the <hi>Center:</hi> ſo were theſe Souldiers <hi>calm'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corderius</hi> preſently applies himſelfe to the Prince, and deſires that <hi>his men might be commanded by</hi> Bertaldo's <hi>better conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No (ſaid</hi> Lorenzo) <hi>they ſhall be commanded by no other then my ſelfe, and</hi> Bertaldo <hi>ſhall command the Army.</hi> Which <hi>Bertaldo</hi> modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but <hi>Lorenzo</hi> told him, that as <hi>nothing would encourage thoſe new-raiſd men, and re-inliven them, more then his owne preſence; ſo nothing would be more acceptable to the ſouldiery then his Conduct.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus <hi>he</hi> commanded the <hi>Forlorne</hi> Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximanus</hi> by this time (obſerving the orderly advance of <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s over-numerous hoaſt) begins to think his Army <hi>all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,</hi> but howſoever he was ambitious, (though the fates had given him a <hi>villanous</hi> part to act) to act it <hi>well;</hi> that he might have a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Exit.</hi> His followers for the moſt part (all <hi>deſperate</hi> and) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd</hi> in the ſame guilt, were reſolved to doe ſo too; ſo that there was a fierce battaile fought, between <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>deſparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berontus</hi> beats their Forlorne, up to their main Body: whereupon he receives orders from <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> to draw off, and joyne with the Prince, fearing that the Prince (if hard beſet) might not be ſo well defended by his new-rais'd men. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> becauſe he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance his Confidents, bids him <hi>ſtand as a reſerve to his maine Body,</hi> which was done accordingly. <hi>Maximanus</hi> falls on ſo furiouſly, that he followes his <hi>thrown</hi> darts ſo cloſe, that he comes to <hi>handy</hi> ſtrokes, fighting under their flying ſhadowes, but finding that he had miſtaken his aime, and that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> commanded not the party, he gives orders for freſh forces to come up, and bids them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thoſe <hi>ſtriplings,</hi> telling them, he was deceived, and muſt goe and ſeeke <hi>Lorenzo</hi> out, and fight with men of valour.</p>
               <p>Opinion (which the world is guided by) made them but ſtriplings in their hands, indeed, for a long time, untill <hi>Bertaldo</hi>'s proweſſe taught them how much they were deceived, whilſt <hi>Maximanus</hi> with his men fall upon <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s, with <hi>reduplicated</hi> ſtrengths of <hi>madd men,</hi> bearing downe <hi>all</hi> before them, till <hi>Berontus</hi> checkt their fury, with his well-brought-up reſerve, and ſav'd <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with the ſame hand that fell'd the deſperate <hi>Maximanus</hi> to the ground, thereby, ſo diſheartning all the reſt, that they ſoon betook themſelves to flight, <hi>Bertaldo</hi> having done the like unto his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97485:40"/>
Thus whil'ſt there <hi>appeared</hi> great <hi>ſerenity</hi> in every <hi>face,</hi> all might <hi>behold a Cloud</hi> in <hi>Lorenzo's countenance;</hi> and <hi>perceive</hi> a <hi>war</hi> within his <hi>breaſt;</hi> occaſioned by the laſt gaſping words, which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> heard <hi>Maximanus</hi> utter, with his Breath: for <hi>Maximanus</hi> (lying bleeding upon the ground) deſired that he might ſpeake unto <hi>Lorenzo</hi> before he ſhould expire. Whoſe words were theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unfortunate</hi> Lorenzo! <hi>Maſter to a more faithleſſe ſervant! had not thy favours been ſo great, I had not been ſo wicked.</hi> Honoria <hi>was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of all ſhe was accuſed, I playd the Knave, and you the Foole:</hi> ſo ſtretch'd his limbs and dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> at firſt, would have had him (if poſſibly) preſerv'd; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hatefull ſoule had made an eſcape, he revenged himſelfe upon his ſenceleſſe body, vexing himſelfe, that it had not life, to anſwer his <hi>indignation</hi> with <hi>ſenſibility;</hi> never was there ſuch a dying blow given to a Victor: the word <hi>Foole,</hi> troubled him not ſo much, as the word <hi>Innocent;</hi> nor <hi>Innocent,</hi> ſo much as the word <hi>was,</hi> which put him in deſpaire of her being alive. Never was there ſuch a ſad Conqueror as this <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> whom the <hi>Sun</hi> beheld, bringing with him <hi>night</hi> in his Countenance to <hi>Carthage,</hi> after that he had won the <hi>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The men were all disbanded, whil'ſt an <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>unruly</hi> thoughts, and cares, muſtered within his boſome. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> (who himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt over-ſet with ſorrow, yet ſeeing <hi>his</hi> ſo great) beares him up with Comfort, telling him that <hi>none can ſay (for certaine) what is become either of</hi> Honoria <hi>or</hi> Amariſſa, <hi>none ſaw them dye: but many eyes have ſeene one of the intended Executioners, dead in the place of Execution: why might not the Gods protect their Innocence, by unexpected meanes? why ſhould we not hope they did, ſeeing they were Innocent; and we heare nothing to the contrary? why may not one of theſe Villaines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſlaughter (mollifyed into gentleneſſe, by</hi> Honoria's <hi>ſweet behaviour, and overcome by</hi> Amariſſa's <hi>ſprightly Carriage) ſlay that Brother in evill, and preſerve them both himſelf? It is but early day, I warrant you, you ſhall hear more hereafter; come, pluck up a good Courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh (ſaid</hi> Lorenzo) <hi>I thinke</hi> (Bertaldo) <hi>thou wilt raiſe me to life, when I am dead; if this ſhould bee, I will ſerve the Gods (for ever) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicated adorations; and I will recompence their ſufferings with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand new-found ways to expiations, whereto, repentance her ſelf yet never found the way; and ſhould but one of thoſe men, doe as thou Imagin'ſt, I would fill him as full of happineſſe, as his Capacity could hold; I would 'twere true</hi> Bertaldo, <hi>on that Condition that I gave thee Carthage for thy prophecies reward.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt theſe things were in agitation, I ſhall acquaint you with a pretty paſſage which hapned between <hi>Corderius</hi> and <hi>Fortunata,</hi> Neece, and Woman to a Lady that was call'd <hi>Beſanca,</hi> in his Travailes with <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> in ſearch of the Ladyes.</p>
               <p>You muſt underſtand <hi>Corderius</hi> to have been a <hi>Rich</hi> Merchant, and an <hi>old</hi> Batchelour, about the age of Fifty: And one, who for his <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> was worthily received into Prince <hi>Lorenzo</hi> his Counſell of State: him, Fortune did begin to frown upon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt certaine Ships at Sea of ineſtimable value, inſomuch that he was unwilling to venture any more <hi>ſubſtance</hi> upon that <hi>hazard:</hi> and therefore reſolved (to withdraw his hand from ſo cheating a Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as <hi>Fame</hi> (the falſe Trumpeter of the world) who <hi>encouraged</hi> ſo <hi>many</hi> Adventurers to returne home by <hi>Weeping</hi> croſſe (hearkning to her enticement) and yet could never boaſt <hi>ſucceſſefulneſſe</hi> but over a few) and to lead a private life, and to enjoy the remainder of his dayes with ſuch contentment, and true felicity, as the reſt of his great Fortunes (that were not loſeable by being at ſtake) would give him leave. The delight was departed from him, wherein he (formerly) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd felicity, in making Hundreds, Thouſands: and Fifties, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds: by multiplications of ſmaller ſummes. He changed his <hi>itching</hi> deſire, that was in the <hi>act</hi> of getting, for the true contentment that was to be found in making uſe of what he had <hi>got:</hi> And thus he <hi>found</hi> himſelf at <hi>laſt</hi> by <hi>beginning</hi> to be a <hi>loſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all the delights of <hi>Eden</hi> could not make a Paradiſe (he thought) without a <hi>Companion</hi> that ſhould be <hi>meet</hi> for him. But then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think with himſelfe, that he had ſo <hi>over-ſlipt</hi> his time, and that he was now grown <hi>ſo Old,</hi> that he was ſcarce <hi>meet</hi> for a <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> that his <hi>Gray</hi> haires were no <hi>good</hi> repoſure upon a <hi>Green</hi> Bed. And that <hi>Nature</hi> had made him none of her <hi>Favourites,</hi> and <hi>Age</hi> had put him <hi>further</hi> out of <hi>Countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he comforted himſelf a little (allowing his reſolution this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall) that he was not <hi>ſo wondrous Old, as that he needed to deſpaire of poſſeſsing a Miſtreſſe, with a conceit of ſufficient happineſſe, in being ſuch an Old mans darling:</hi> And that <hi>her Poverty (by the meanes of his Riches) would procure in her breaſt a diſpenſation for his Silver haires.</hi> And that, <hi>if he thus took a poor Gentle-woman upon Almes, (though ſhe could not, as yet,</hi> love <hi>him, yet) ſhe might be glad to</hi> have <hi>him, and think
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97485:41"/>
her ſelf happy (bringing nothing with her but Love) to meet with ſuch a one, though he have nothing elſe but means to maintain it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Corderius</hi> did (heretofore) beat about the Country to find out a Virgin that ſhould be thus qualified (being in all his other actions a notable Humoriſt) <hi>viz. Very well borne, Excellently bred, Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Handſome,</hi> and <hi>Miſerably poor,</hi> but never could find a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> to his Fancy that ran upon all (theſe) <hi>Four,</hi> before ſuch time as (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon <hi>Bertaldo</hi> in this itinerary progreſſion) he met with ſuch a <hi>Counter-part</hi> to his own <hi>indenture,</hi> that <hi>fitted</hi> him, as if <hi>occaſion</hi> had taken <hi>meaſure</hi> of his minde. For <hi>Corderius</hi> and his Horſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in termes of ability to Advance; the Rider, (through his Mans default) feeding his <hi>dumb</hi> Porter with a Spur, inſtead of Provinder, (what with faintneſſe, and the loſſe of one of his Shooes) the poor Hackny made a <hi>Hault</hi> all upon a ſudden, without ſtaying for the word from his <hi>Commander;</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Corderius</hi> was by <hi>degrees</hi> ſo left behind, that he grew from being out of <hi>ſight,</hi> to be out of <hi>hope</hi> of overtaking his Companions. Whereupon he ſet up his reſt in a ſmall Village, at the feet of one of the <hi>Feſsian</hi> Mountaines.</p>
               <p>This Cavalliers Caball was unwilling to clime, when he could not goe, with a bare Foot, and an empty Belly. Inſomuch that poor <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derius</hi> muſt be left behind in a poor Inne. High-way accidents muſt be borne withall, his <hi>bad</hi> fortune was <hi>better'd</hi> with this one comfort: his Landlord was a Good fellow, and cheer'd him up, (who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hoſt a fit receptacle for diſcourſe that went no higher then a Merry Tale, or ſo forth) ſo he drove away the time with making his Hoſt believe, That <hi>his Travell was to no other end,</hi> or purpoſe, <hi>but what he had a long time ſought</hi> in vain, <hi>viz. ſuch a Miſtreſſe</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſs'd.</p>
               <p>The Good man of the Houſe preſently anſwered his intended <hi>Mirth</hi> with a profferr'd <hi>reality</hi> of accompliſhing his deſires. <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>here within our Neighbour-hood there is one who is thus and thus Vertuous, ſo and ſo Poor, thus highly Borne, ſo excellently Bred, known by the well-boding name of</hi> Fortunata; <hi>and if it pleaſe you, you ſhall have a ſight of her, and if you can win her, wear her. Corderius</hi> began to think, that <hi>this ſavoury diſh was not ſo ready cook'd to his owne pallat without ſome ſpice of Divine Providence:</hi> Wherefore he reſolves to make an aſſay, and though he be croſs'd in finding <hi>another mans Wife and Miſtreſſe, yet he hoped he might be bleſt by a chance medly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for himſelf (in the ſame perſon he may meet with both.

                  <hi>Fortunata</hi> (peruſing the <hi>letter,</hi> and obſerving the <hi>contents;</hi> and finding no <hi>name</hi> to it) lookt over her ſhoulder, to ſee if there were any that tooke <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>non-plus</hi> ſhe was in, by reaſon of ſuch an <hi>exoticke</hi> and <hi>ononymous</hi> way of writing (as he had framed) and there preſented to her owne hands: then ſhe lookes him <hi>full</hi> in the face, as upon ſome abuſive <hi>foot-poſt</hi> that was hired to play the <hi>foole</hi> with her, and thus ſhe rates him for it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corderius</hi> replyed that <hi>it needed not; when his owne hand was to the letter whilſt he gave it her.

complement <hi>of an</hi> intire <hi>affection: but if you can finde in your heart to Marry me, I aske no more, I'le finde cauſe enough (for ever) to baniſh all repentance from your heart: ſo that reaſon ſhall finde no fault in your election. Weigh my words as ſeriouſly as you can, I have no ends upon you but what are Honourable, and Juſt: Portion, I aske none; Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Comelineſſe, I ſee; your Parentage, and Piety, I hear of: And of this you may aſſure your ſelfe, had you a Fortune of your owne, able (but) to have bought the Cloathes upon your Back, you could not be my Wife.

                  <hi>Fortunata</hi> thought it not <hi>convenient,</hi> that her conſent ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon the firſt <hi>bluſh,</hi> yet her <hi>Colour</hi> (as if it went on <hi>Errants</hi> to her intellectualls, to know the meaning, of ſo ſtrange (yet effectuall) manner of Wooing, and returning againe into her Cheekes with ſo freſh a dye, as if it had made haſt in it's returne) gave him ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intelligence, that her <hi>faint</hi> heart, was ready to yeeld up her Mayden garriſon, upon the <hi>firſt</hi> ſummons; but that her modeſty <hi>mutinyed</hi> againſt its <hi>higher</hi> officer: and would not ſuffer ſo <hi>regular</hi> fortifications to be ſo ſoon <hi>ſleighted</hi> by ſuch a <hi>loving Enemy:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe deſired <hi>longer time to conſider of what he had ſaid, and ſhe would returne him an anſwer worthy of his reſpect.</hi>

This was his humour, and that <hi>if ſhe would take him upon thoſe termes, Happineſſe ſhould be her joynture; Contentment the life ſhe ſhould lead; and Sufficiency, her conſtant maintenance. More then that, ſhe that is to be his Wife, ſhould never know before ſhe were his; and if ſhe were ordain'd his Spouſe, ſhe would be ſatisfied with that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

                  <hi>Fortunata</hi> took occaſion by the <hi>Fore-top,</hi> fearing it would be bald <hi>behind;</hi> and thought it better wiſedome to lay hold of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that might advance her, though to an <hi>unknown</hi> Eſtate, then to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> wedded to <hi>even</hi> reckonings at the years end: Wherefore ſhe thus <hi>reſolv'd</hi> upon the <hi>queſtion.</hi>

ſuch a ſpring, that it was twenty to one, but on the contrary ſide, the cradle had come over, and over: but there happened a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance then all this, and a more cauſe of terror: for the Cat, lying aſleep upon the ground, on the other ſide of the cradle, one of the <hi>theorbo</hi>'s underneath it, preſſed ſo hard upon the Cats tayle, that <hi>(Prickette</hi> having no other meanes to ſave himſelf from that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw but the uſe of his other arme) the aſperous vermine, ſets all the venemous nailes that were upon all four, (together with both rowes of the pointed needles within her jawes) into his trembling fleſh: making ſuch a hideous out-cry, that all the hags and furies, (nimphs to the Stygean lakes) could never have given ſo fierce an alarum to the poore mans quarters, as that had done.</p>

               <p>Whoſe walls they had no ſooner entred, but <hi>Corderius</hi> ſeekes an obſcure lodging where he might be leaſt known; and delivers into <hi>Fortunata</hi>'s hands a purſe of Gold, intreating her Brother <hi>Favorinus, to accompany his Siſter to the Burſe, where ſhe might furniſh her ſelfe with ſuch neceſſaries (of all ſorts) as were expedient for her uſe, and ſuitable to the occaſion, whilſt he went and bought materialls for her Wedding Garments; and provided her ſuch a neceſſary inſtrument (to her minde) as ſhould take meaſure of her body, and fit each ſeverall dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Both parties ingage according to their deſignes, and <hi>Corderius</hi> comes back <hi>fraught</hi> with cloth of Gold and Silver, as the returne of his <hi>Adventure.</hi> But <hi>Fortunata</hi> was ſo <hi>ſparing</hi> in exhauſting the Well (the liberality of whoſe ſpring ſhe was ſo ignorant) that (her modeſty was ſuch) ſhe would not purchaſe thoſe additaments to grace an Ornament, at a higher rate, then the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> of her condition, and the <hi>obſcurity</hi> of her lodging would ſpeak as commendable: which, when <hi>Corderius</hi> did behold, he wrapt them up in a bundle, and beſtow'd them upon <hi>Ribana</hi> (her new recommended Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide) ſaying, <hi>He would rigge up his</hi> ſmalleſt Pinace <hi>with farre better tackling; but his</hi> Vice-Admirall, <hi>Fortunata, her top, deſerv'd more Gallantry.</hi> And forthwith led her to the place where ſhe might exchange her Money for the Choiceſt neceſſaries: And there left her to be attended to her Lodging by <hi>Favorinus,</hi> and her two ſervants, <hi>Prickette,</hi> and <hi>Rivana,</hi> whilſt he takes the neareſt way that brought him to the Court, where he preſents his ſervice to the Prince, and acquaints his highneſſe with the manner how he loſt his Company: <hi>But loſing them, he partly found what he look'd for, thereby he lighted upon certaine intelligence, that gave him a relation how that</hi> Honoria <hi>and</hi> Amariſſa <hi>were alive; and that by all Circumſtances it could be no other but them two, whom report gave out to have taken Shipping at the Bay of</hi> Duno; <hi>departing there with as favourable a wind, as they had been driven a Ship board, by the ſtormes of perſecutions:</hi> And that <hi>he would pawne his life that he ſhould ſuddenly hear good tydings of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was ſo tranſported with joy, and his minde elevated by hope, ſeeing ſo much <hi>Confidence</hi> proceeded from ſo <hi>ſerious</hi> a man, that he vow'd <hi>one minute ſhould not paſſe, longer then the time required, for drawing up his patent, but that he would ſigne him one of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> which was done accordingly. So that back comes <hi>Corderius</hi> to his Miſtreſſe, with a <hi>Lordſhip</hi> on his back, before he had lay'd out any riches upon his clothes: but ſhe muſt not know any thing yet. But now the time is come that high <hi>fancy</hi> muſt delight it ſelfe in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of <hi>humility,</hi> and that a conjuncture betweene <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:97485:45"/>
muſt be made with <hi>charity. Corderius</hi> (as glorious as the Sunne) hands <hi>Fortunata</hi> (eclipſing <hi>Cinthia</hi> in her greateſts majeſty) to the place of Union.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fortunata</hi> could not but wonder that no friend of his appeared to <hi>ſolemnize</hi> their wedding, and not ſo much as a dinner provided, and that no other (or more) witneſſes, were prepared, for the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, then the good man of the houſe, and his wife, with their children at their heels, and a few meane and homely ſervants; ſhe could not but admire that his compleatneſſe in all other reſpects, ſhould want the correſpondent of a Chariot; but that her wedding-garment ſhould be a golden beſome, to ſweep the duſt in the ſtreets, untill it aroſe in their faces, as if it had a minde to <hi>tell</hi> them, what they were; but ſhe that had conſented to marry him in a <hi>humour,</hi> was contented with the humour of his Marriage: and comming within the conſecrated walls, ſtanding upon holy ground, thy plighted their trothes to one an other, by the miniſtration of the ſacred hands of him, whom holy Order had ſet apart (as cleane) to the performance of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies: Thus (tyed in a true loves knot) hand in hand they tooke their leaves of the holy man, and the place of holineſſe: and were no ſooner entred the Porch, but they might behold the moſt magnificent Charriot that could be carried upon wheels, and the braveſt horſes, that ere were faſtned to a pole; with a Charioteer, and footmen, belonging thereunto, all in the ſame livery, which promiſed Majeſtie, rather then <hi>nobility</hi> to be in the owner, <hi>Corderius</hi> took occaſioned to <hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>gaze</hi> a while upon ſo faire an object: at laſt, he asked his bride <hi>how ſhe liked that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot?</hi> who having run diviſion upon the ſeverall <hi>Sumptuoſities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto, and <hi>praiſed</hi> the <hi>goodlineſſe</hi> that ſhe had (worthily) ſpied in the horſes, and commended the <hi>Colour,</hi> and <hi>trimming</hi> of the livery: ſhe <hi>warranted that they belonged to ſome great man,</hi> and <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred whoſe they were. Corderius</hi> told her that <hi>ſhe ſhould know that preſently,</hi> and asking the Charioteer (who had his leſſon given him) <hi>whoſe Chariot that was?</hi> he made anſwer (with much reverence) that <hi>it was the Lady</hi> Fortunata <hi>her Chariot, Wife to the Lord</hi> Corderius. Madam (ſaid <hi>Corderius) I cry you mercy, it is your Charriot, I pray will you aſcend it, and take me with you. Fortunata</hi> hung back and bluſhed, like the redneſſe of the morn, that betokened a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous winde, then what ſhould need, to fill her ſayles: but all this would not help her no otherwiſe then ſooner up, where ſhe might take poſſeſſion of her owne; where ſhe ſits not ſo much elated in her owne minde, as depreſſed under the burthen of her oppreſſion of the great danger that is in over-merit.</p>
               <p>The well-manag'd horſes <hi>pride</hi> it along the ſtreets, with the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made-happy payre, untill they reſted at the doore of <hi>Corderius</hi> his <hi>proud</hi> building: whereat were ſtanding all his friends and kindred, to welcome the bride to the well-furniſhed habitation which ſhe was bid to call her owne; and all within it, hers: feaſting and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97485:46"/>
and dancing, had no ſooner begun to outweare the day, but <hi>Corderius</hi> commanded <hi>foure</hi> other Horſes that wore the ſame natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall coloured livery on their backs, to be added to the former paire; and invited his <hi>Fortunata to take the ayre, and notice of a Country-houſe, that had a Bed to bid her welcome to, and a Tenant to be her Bedfellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortunata</hi> ſigh'd, and ſaid unto <hi>Corderius, Sir, you know in what a poore condition you found me, and I ſee, into what an ocean of felicity you have lanch'd ſo meane, and weake a veſſell, as my ſelfe: ſpare your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of me with further favours, till I have digested theſe; for, one may be as well overwhelm'd with too much joy, as blinded with too much light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Corderius</hi> (like thoſe Women who will never be married to any Man till they have ſeen him once in Drinke) was reſolved, never to let her reſt from receiving expreſſions upon expreſſions of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, till he ſaw her thoroughly intoxicated with kindneſſe, that he might ſee what humour ſhe was in; wherefore a whole row of Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches attended the <hi>Bride</hi> and <hi>Bridegroome</hi> to <hi>Mount-pleaſant,</hi> which was the name of his Country-houſe: where he had no ſooner lighted, and entred the Houſe, but he cauſed the <hi>Lawyers</hi> to produce the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, where (in the preſence of <hi>Favorinus</hi> and many other ſubſtantial Witneſſes) he made that Houſe (with ten thouſand Crownes <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> thereunto belonging, by <hi>ſealing</hi> and <hi>ſubſcribing</hi> thereunto) her <hi>Joynture,</hi> and delivered the <hi>Deed</hi> unto <hi>Favorinus,</hi> her Brother, to be kept to her uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortunata</hi> was aſtoniſhed with admiration, and ſo overcome with kindneſſe, that ſhe could not ſpeake one word. This dumb oratory pleas'd his fanſie beyond the expreſſion of any eloquence; and which of the two were raviſh'd with greater delight (he to ſee his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne take ſo well; or ſhe, to finde her hopes ſo farre out-gone by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities) is hard to imagine.</p>
               <p>At length he invites them all into his Garden (the delightful'ſt of any that ever ſhe had ſeen) and askt her, <hi>how ſhe lik'd it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who anſwered him, <hi>how could a poore Woman be otherwiſe than pleas'd, to be taken out of an Almes-houſe, and made the Miſtreſſe of a Palace, and Lady of ſuch a Manour?</hi> And with thoſe words, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>water</hi> the Garden, with her <hi>teares:</hi> and drew him aſide into the next Arbour, where her (minde by the benefit of that little vent) powred forth a reſentment of her ſad condition through want of <hi>merit,</hi> anſwerable to his <hi>benignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being perform'd with ſo much ſweetneſſe, and ingenuity, he removes the weight that lay ſo heavy on her heart, with this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that <hi>there was that thing, within her power, to grant, that if he could be but ſo happy as to obtaine it at her hands (and it was but what was juſt and honourable) it would (in equall ballance) outweigh all his benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Sir</hi> (ſaid Fortunata) <hi>be ſure it ſhall be granted; and you happy: what is it, good my Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:97485:46"/>
                  <hi>You ſhall know</hi> (ſaid <hi>Corderius) in due time, in the interim I make it part of my requeſt unto you, that you will reſt ſatisfied till you hear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, time hath out-gone the day, and the well-ſpent-time of night calls upon the new-married Couple to haſte to Bed:in Bed they are, the Bride-chamber clear'd; which was no ſooner perform'd, but <hi>Corderius</hi> conjures her by all the Love ſhe thought was due to him, to tell him, whether or no ſhe thought her ſelf <hi>happy at that instant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortunata,</hi> (after ſome pauſe) told him, That <hi>ſhe thought her ſelf the happieſt woman in the world, if ſhe had where withall (in her ſelf) to anſwer that felicity.</hi> For ſhe thought <hi>there could be no true happineſſe where permutation of deſert was wanting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Corderius)</hi> Fortunata, <hi>know, that thou art miſerable, but thou mayſt be happy; and both theſe contrary qualities lie within thy power to ſowre or ſweeten thy whole life withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let me know it quickly then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Fortunata) and I ſhall not be long a chuſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then thus it is</hi> (reply'd <hi>Corderius.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I was a young man, and firſt went out to Sea, as an Adventurer, we ſuffered Ship wrack: all but my ſelfe were drown'd, and I preſerv'd by a miraculous accident; all but the very top of the main Maſt were ſwallowed up in the Quick-ſands, and devouring Seas; up to which top I got, and ſeeing no hopes of life, but a terrour ſpread before mine eyes, as broad as the Horiſon, I vow'd unto the Gods, that if they would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their power in my preſervation, I would anſwer the mercy of their deliverance, with the moſt Holineſſe of life, and Integrity of living, that lay in the utmoſt endeavours of a Mortall creature: In order whereunto, I vow'd Virginity for ever. I ſcarce had ended my Prayers and Fowes to the Almighty, but through the ſalt water of mine eyes, I could behold (riding upon the Maine) afaire and stately Ship making towards me, which (approaching nearer and nearer to me) at laſt tooke me up: And I have kept my promiſe hitherto, and muſt keep it to my grave: I have done all the good that lay in my power; I have been a Father to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, a Husband to many a Widow: I have helped many to their Right, that ſuffered Wrong; the Divine providence hath made me an Instrument in doing many good Offices; but especially, I glory in being a meanes whereby the chaſte</hi> Honoria, <hi>and deſerving</hi> Amariſſa, <hi>were not by the Tyrant brought to Triall; and by which meanes (I hope) ſhe is preſerved; yet I ſaw no reaſon why I might not Marry, if I could meet with one that would be partner with me in my Vow: I ſaw no reaſon why two might not enjoy the freedomes and familiarities that are between Man and Wife, onely as they are divine and rationall Creatures: that is, to contemplate the Deity, and goodneſſe of the Gods; to joy in one anothers company, to diſcourſe together, to embrace, to ſeal to ſuch payres of indentures, as the Cockles ſhall not be more juſt in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyndure, to make ſuch impreſsions on thoſe depreſſed ſupplements, which the Bee's-wax for ſoft, or ſweetneſſe, or the red for colour, is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97485:47"/>
to fall aſleep by ſuch a veſtall fire, that nere goes out, and never burnes; to recover our ſelves (ſo often) from being ſo many times the images of Death, and finde ſo many lives renu'd, by loves aſſurance of its immortality; leaving that other conſideration to thoſe Senſitives that have not underſtanding: thy conſent to this, O</hi> Fortunata, <hi>would cauſe me no leſſe to adore thee as</hi> divine, <hi>than keep me (ſtill) in favour with the</hi> Gods: <hi>all thoſe ſteps of honour to which I have advanc'd thee ſo many degrees above thy ſelfe, were but engagements to thy complacence herein. Now am I to expect my doome, or ſuch a returne of my adventures, that uncovered rocks of Diamonds, or the meſſeraick and big ſwolne veines of the earths golden oare, wide opened, could not afford me more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or requitall for all my obligations.</hi>

                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> falls into a ſweet ſleep, untill the morning-watch awak'd him with their anſwerings to <hi>Berontus</hi> his importunities of opening the Gates; who was ſo tranſported with his fraught, that he thought it much, that wood, and iron, ſhould make his lading dance atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> thus awakt, and remembring the good tidings overnight, he thought they were ſo good, that he began to be afraid they were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97485:52"/>
too good to be true. Thus the Devill, after we have overcome all his temptations, throwes his laſt Dart, and ſeekes to poyſon us with infidelity, like the Ship that hath eſcaped ſo great Enemies, and ſo many Shipwracks, at laſt periſhes in the Harbour.</p>
               <p>But whilſt he was in this great danger, by reaſon of ſo many Rocks and Shelves: <hi>Berontus</hi> (like a good Pilot, comes to guide him ſafely into the Harbour) at whoſe firſt ſight, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> reades comfort in his lookes; and askes him if he has heard of his <hi>Honoria,</hi> (anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his relation with his confidence) in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know, that if thou hadst not brought good Newes, thou woulſt not have return'd ſo ſoone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berontus</hi> taking <hi>Nagivius</hi> by the hand, from point to point, tells him the full relation of the whole, as hath been before expreſs'd: Which, when <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had heard throughout, he knew not whether he ſhould acknowledg himſelf more beholding to the <hi>Hand,</hi> or to the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> that made ſuch muſick to his <hi>Eares:</hi> he ſhowr'd down obligations upon <hi>Berontus,</hi> as upon a Favourite that was capable of receiving thoſe acts of Grace: But when he came to expreſſe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>Navigius,</hi> he found him ſo unſuſceptable, that he could not love him otherwiſe, then with the Love wherewith fond Ladies uſe to be in love with their Lap-dogs, whoſe over-gladneſſe at ſmall favours, make their Miſtreſſes ſorry that they are not rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby they may be more capable of further benefits. <hi>Both</hi> in <hi>their</hi> kind were fully ſatisfied, the <hi>one</hi> with princely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; the <hi>other</hi> with ſpitting a few acknowledgments in his mouth, which the <hi>one</hi> received with <hi>due</hi> reverence, and <hi>good</hi> behaviour; the other with ſo many <hi>ſcrapes</hi> of his feet, and <hi>wagging</hi> of his tail.</p>
               <p>All the Palace did <hi>ring</hi> of this good newes; nothing but <hi>acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of joy and gladneſſe was heard amongſt the People, every body ran to ſee <hi>Navigius: Berontus</hi> was no body amongſt the Vulgar, like to like enjoy'd their liking; the poor man was well help'd up, from a peck of troubles, to ſuch a meaſure of admiration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> was ſent for in Poſt-haſte, (who returning as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.) The next thoughts that were in election, was how theſe two Ladyes were to be ſent for, and who ſhould be employ'd in that Affair. It was determined, that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> ſhould be diſpatch'd upon this <hi>Embaſsie; Berontus</hi> to the <hi>Iſland of Majorca,</hi> to attend upon <hi>Honoria;</hi> and <hi>Bertaldo</hi> to <hi>Minorca,</hi> to waite upon <hi>Amariſſa.</hi> And this for two Reaſons, to which I might adde a third.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, becauſe <hi>Berontus</hi> had been ſo <hi>Fortunate</hi> to bring the Good-newes, it was thought fitting that he ſhould have the <hi>Honour</hi> of the Employment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, That <hi>Bertaldo</hi> thought it more convenient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to wait upon his <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> than his <hi>Siſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the third was, That <hi>Lorenzo</hi> knew <hi>Honoria</hi> would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſufficiently to hear of her Brothers welfare at any hand, but he could not reward <hi>Berontus</hi>'s ſervices with leſſe reſpect. Two Ships
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97485:52"/>
were ſpeedily prepar'd, the one for <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> the other for <hi>Berontus:</hi> But all had been like to be ſpoil'd, for the Prince taking great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Philoret,</hi> had gain'd <hi>Bertaldo</hi> his conſent, that <hi>Philoret</hi> ſhould ſtay behind to keep him Company; but there ſate ſuch a cloud on <hi>Philoret</hi> his Countenance, as made them all fear they ſhould have no Faire weather after them, if he were left behind; wherefore the Prince willingly releas'd him of his grant.</p>
               <p>They were all fairly Shipp'd; but behold, they were ſcarce out of ſight of the Maine-land, but their <hi>ſtately</hi> Ships were forc'd to <hi>ſtrike</hi> Saile to angry <hi>Neptune:</hi> who, with his <hi>awfull</hi> Trident, <hi>muster'd</hi> his Turbulent waves, whilſt the innumerous Tacklings ſerv'd for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Whiſtles</hi> to the winde, to call on danger to her Execution, whilſt the <hi>Boyling</hi> Ocean lifted up her Waves ſo high, that the <hi>Maſts</hi> of both the Ships <hi>charg'd</hi> their <hi>tops</hi> through the proud <hi>Heads</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Billowes; till others (as if they had been their Friends) lifted the <hi>Victors</hi> upon their <hi>ſhoulders</hi> to ſuch a height, as their main <hi>Maſts</hi> were in danger to have fallen <hi>foul</hi> with the <hi>Celeſtiall Sphears;</hi> raking from their <hi>reſtleſſe</hi> bottomes, ſo much <hi>Sand,</hi> as not onely <hi>diſcoloured</hi> the green Ocean, but alſo threatned a diſſolution of the whole <hi>Earth</hi> into ſo many <hi>Attomes</hi> in the <hi>Sea:</hi> So that no <hi>marvaile,</hi> that they had <hi>quite</hi> loſt <hi>one another,</hi> whilſt they were <hi>both</hi> thus <hi>likely</hi> to be <hi>loſt.</hi> So that it hapned (by reaſon of this Storme) that <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who was bound for <hi>Minorca,</hi> was (by the fortune of the Windes) blown upon the Iſland of <hi>Majorca;</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> (who was bound for <hi>Majorca)</hi> was thrown upon the leſſer Iſland: The miſtake was not ſo great, whilſt their Commiſſions were both the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berontus</hi> was no ſooner arrived there, but the newes was brought to <hi>Caſtriots</hi> houſe, That <hi>there was come from the Maine, the Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Gentleman that ever eyes beheld; and his buſineſſe was, to enquire after a certaine Carthaginian Lady that was forc'd away from her owne Country, and brought hither by Violent hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> at the firſt hear-ſay, conjectur'd it to be him who was intended, <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> though it fell out to be him, that ſhould be there, <hi>Berontus,</hi> though not by order of Humane, but Divine Affaires. <hi>Amariſſa</hi> ſaves <hi>Berontus</hi> the labour of Enquiry, and ſends him her Name, with directions where to come, if that he knew it, or had any thing to ſay to her: He haſtens to the place of her abode with ſuch a longing deſire, as good Newes carryes alwayes with it, when it knowes it ſhall affect the hearer with delight. When <hi>Amariſſa</hi> heard that the ſame Cavalier was arriv'd at the Gate, ſhe prepares her ſelfe for ſuch information, as her owne eyes ſhould give her, through the Glaſſe, whether it were the ſame of whom her hopes had given her ſome aſſurance: But as ſoone as <hi>Berontus</hi> began to enter the Court, her hopes began to retire; but ſeeing him ſuch another goodly Perſonage, and having ſuch a Manly gate, ſhe thought the Glaſſe might be no true Mediator: Wherefore, deſiring to be better inform'd, ſhe onely opens the Caſement, ſo farre as might ſerve her
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97485:53"/>
Eye-ſight to ſally out; which was ſo met withall by his, that it was beaten in againe without receiving the leaſt intelligence, ſhutting that Sally-port with ſuch diligence, as if an Enemy were ready to make his Entry in at the window, whilſt the door was open to let in the beſt of Friends.</p>
               <p>In comes <hi>Berontus,</hi> who having ſaluted her, makes her amends for the miſtake of the Perſon, by bringing her <hi>Bertaldo</hi> in his Mouth, whoſe ſervice (as knowing it to be moſt acceptable) he preſented in the firſt place, acquainting the Lady by what accident it hapned, that he was not there himſelfe, being deſigned purpoſely to waite on her, as his was to have attended upon the Princeſſe, <hi>Honoria: Amariſſa</hi> was well enough pleas'd to hear of his Welfare, and could have found in her heart to have expreſſed her feares of his being caſt away at Sea; but ſhe ſmothered her affections for the preſent, and fell to asking how <hi>Lorenzo</hi> did? Scarce had they made an end of all that he had, and ſhe to ſay, which took up no ſmall proportion of time and diſcourſe, but that a Meſſenger came to <hi>Amariſſa</hi> from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria</hi> and <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> to acquaint her, that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> was there, how they miſs'd <hi>Berontus,</hi> who was deſign'd for the place where he now was, acquainting her with the happy newes of all the late Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Berontus</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa</hi> being both more at hearts-eaſe then when they met firſt. <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> who delighted in nothing more then in hearing relations of deeds of Chivalry: and lov'd men for nothing more then their Proweſſe; and no Gallantry like that which was ſhewed againſt her deadly Enemy <hi>Maximanus:</hi> And perceiving how <hi>ſparingly Berontus</hi> had <hi>touch'd</hi> upon that <hi>ſtring,</hi> and how his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had more <hi>commended himſelfe,</hi> then <hi>delighted her.</hi> She deſires him to tell her the manner <hi>how,</hi> the place <hi>where,</hi> the time <hi>when,</hi> with all other particulars concerning the killing of that <hi>Wild-Boar,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe profeſſeth <hi>ſhe could never be ſufficiently ſatisfied.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Berontus</hi> related unto her the whole ſubſtance of the Story, with all the circumſtances belonging thereunto, in ſuch orderly manner, and obſervance to her commands, that all the Predicaments in Logick were but <hi>ſervants</hi> to his <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>ſubjects</hi> to her <hi>Reaſon:</hi> She was ſo much taken with his Gallantry, giving him many thankes for his Relation; but withall told him, That <hi>ſhe was moſt of all beholding to her ſelf:</hi> For the beſt part of his deſcription had been left out (if ſhe had not wreſted it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by degrees) through his modeſty, that was ſo wary in letting any thing ſlip from him to his own advantage that concern'd himſelf. Then ſhe fell to the buſineſſe in <hi>Mauritania:</hi> and when <hi>Berontus</hi> had but <hi>touch'd</hi> upon that particular of preſerving <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> by his moſt happy conduct, ſhe did ſo conjure him not to mince the matter, but to tell her punctually how it was (ſuppoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a third perſon) upon whoſe entreaty he declared more at large. But when he came to ſpeak of that particular ſervice at the Bridge, and how fortunate a <hi>man</hi> had been to the whole Army; and asking him <hi>who it was,</hi> and could have no other anſwer from him but <hi>bluſhes</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:97485:53"/>
and <hi>tranciſions</hi> into other matters, Oh how <hi>Amariſſa</hi> was taken with him! ſhe could have leapt into his mouth, and ſhot the Gulph to come at that faire Harbour where there rid ſo brave a Man of War. But then ſhe recalls her ſelfe, and faces about, to the remembrance of the brave <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> and checks her forward paſſion for loving a man ſo much, ſo ſoon, whilſt all the <hi>Berontus'es</hi> in <hi>Affrica</hi> could not exceed <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> for what ſhe had both heard, and ſeen: But falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning his partaking with <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> in the differences which were between him and the Prince, ſhe falls to loving him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and hearing <hi>Berontus</hi> relate how ſtoutly <hi>Bertaldo</hi> behaved himſelfe, in <hi>Honoria</hi>'s and <hi>her</hi> behalfe, her love runs back againe, and catches at <hi>Bertaldo:</hi> nor is ſhe wavering all this while, but conſtant to the true cauſe of love, worth, and true Nobility: ſhe is not ſo much in love with either of their Perſons, as both their valours; <hi>Berontus</hi> had ſlaine the Gyant, preſerv'd <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Bertaldo</hi> both; <hi>Bertaldo</hi> had done as brave things as theſe, had poſſeſſion of her heart before; at laſt ſhe diſtinguiſhes betwixt loving her houſe, and riding on the top of it, ſhe reſolves to love him as a wel-deſerving Friend, but <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldo</hi> as a deare Husband; yet notwithſtanding her carriage was ſo full of freedome and reſpect, that <hi>Berontus</hi> conceived that in his mind that his honour would not nouriſh, ſo they parted for that night.</p>
               <p>The next day the wind ſerv'd faire for <hi>Majorca,</hi> and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to neglect no opportunity to be together, where they might re-imbark themſelves for <hi>Carthage,</hi> and with a faire wind they joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully landed, and were as Sumptuouſly entertained by <hi>Thoron</hi> and <hi>Armena,</hi> as they were gladly received by <hi>Bertaldo &amp; Honoria;</hi> unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible was the joy that was between <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> the love that was between <hi>Amariſſa</hi> and <hi>Bertaldo, Bertaldo</hi> and <hi>Honoria;</hi> both joyne hands in ſetting forth the praiſes and high Gallantry of <hi>Berontus. Berontus</hi> joynes iſſue with <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> and <hi>Honoria,</hi> in giving the due Encomiums that were belonging to <hi>Philoret;</hi> who preſently becomes <hi>Amariſſa</hi>'s chief Favourite, as the Preſerver of <hi>her</hi> life, the life of her <hi>beloved,</hi> the Honour of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Carthaginians. Amariſſa</hi> would have been in love with <hi>Philoret,</hi> but what love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, faith forbade; <hi>Berontus</hi> would have been in love with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa,</hi> but that <hi>honour</hi> ſtood between: <hi>Honoria</hi> would have been in love with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but knew not how to come at him: <hi>Bertaldo</hi> had been in love with <hi>Philoret,</hi> had he knowne but what he had beene: and <hi>Philoret</hi> might have been beloved by <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> had he but had the confidence: if ever there was love in a maze, here it danc'd the round: you might heare of a True-lovers-knot, but never knew of ſuch a knot (as here was) of True Lovers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenzo</hi> preſently goes and ſearches the Cabinet, finds it there, and reading it fell into a <hi>trembling,</hi> with thinking what a <hi>wound</hi> it would have been unto his injur'd ſoule, if <hi>Honoria</hi> had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, and afterwards he had ſound that Letter; all this <hi>Pippea</hi> did by the perſwaſion of <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> The Prince marvelouſly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Pippea</hi> for her <hi>piety</hi> to <hi>Honoria,</hi> promiſing her the chief place of Honour about her.</p>
               <p>The newes was brought to Court, of the landing of <hi>Honoria,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Prince was aſhamed to looke his owne happineſſe in the face, and to ſee, that, which he moſt deſired, yet he truſted to <hi>two</hi> friends to beare him out, <hi>Honoria</hi>'s <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and his <hi>owne acknowledgment:</hi> he goes out to meet her, and finds her in a moſt <hi>conventent</hi> place for <hi>gratulation;</hi> where, deſcending <hi>his</hi> Charriot as ſhe <hi>hers,</hi> he ſayes thus unto her; <hi>Honoria, if I ſhould queſtion thy pardon, I ſhould tax thy goodneſſe; Mercy is Lady and Empreſſe of all the beſt of Attributes, I have a great deale to ſay, more to confeſſe, moſt of all to acknowledge; if thou wilt give me time, I will take no leſſe then all my life, to beſtow in repentance and ſatisfaction—</hi>

                  <hi>My Lord, I pray ſay no more; he's dead that was the cauſe of this, and in his grave, let the memoriall of all theſe things be buried, I am afraid you have been too ſevere a Puniſher of your ſelf already, I am glad I was preſerv'd for no other cauſe—</hi>

               <p>Thus ſtated, as at firſt, they began to entertaine thoughts, how they might drive a <hi>trade of happineſſe</hi> between <hi>Bertaldo</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> whilſt <hi>Berontus</hi> was love-ſick for <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> and <hi>Philoret</hi> deadly in love with <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> yet neither of them durſt expreſſe the <hi>cauſes</hi> of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents; the one through a ſuppoſed <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> in himſelf, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſt he ſhould ſhew any <hi>defect</hi> in worth towards ſo brave a <hi>friend.</hi>

                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid Philoret) <hi>it is not good to part with that deare privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of being wholly a mans ſelfe, to be the halfe of another; beſides, all the pleaſure I have in this world is in your love; all my ambition is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and all my ſtudy is how I may improve that happineſſe.

in the ſame field where I formerly reapt a full Crop of Bliſſe:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fell into a moſt ſudden paſſion and extreame weeping.</p>
               <p>Whereat <hi>Bertaldo</hi> taking him in his armes, intended him this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>My deare</hi> Philoret, <hi>I will Marry her, but on this condition, that ſhe ſhall double, not mitigate the love I beare to thee: Sweet Boy, had I as many Wives as</hi> Carthage <hi>Women, they all ſhould not be able to eclipſe the leaſt ſparke of the true affection which I beare to thee, and to thy merit.</hi> Juſt as he had ſpoken that word, there came a Servant from the Prince, <hi>deſiring his company;</hi> he clapping <hi>Philoret</hi> on both his <hi>cheeks,</hi> with both his <hi>hands,</hi> bid him <hi>be confident that all the Wives in the world, ſhould not draw away his affection from him,</hi> and ſo left him weeping.</p>
               <p>In which poſture <hi>Berontus</hi> found him, and enquiring into the cauſe, and by <hi>Philoret</hi>'s anſwer, finding it to be grounded upon his diſlike of the Marriage, he imbraces both him and his diſcontent, foſtering it up to a full growth, as agreeable to his humour; but all in vaine: for, the Match was made, the Parties agreed, the Time ſet; onely <hi>Bertaldo</hi> told his Miſtreſſe, with what reluctancy <hi>Philoret</hi> reſented it, and upon what grounds, deſiring her <hi>to uſe her utmoſt indeavour to dispoſſeſſe him of that conceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amariſſa</hi> undertakes it, and ſends for <hi>Philoret:</hi> who being come, <hi>Amariſſa</hi> takes him aſide, and thus intreats him: <hi>Sweet-heart, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thy love to be ſuch to thy Maſter, that thou think'ſt it will be leſſe, when he has me; I have ſent for thee to aſſure thee, that it will be double; when we two are one, you muſt diſtinguiſh between love, and love; it is one thing to love a Wife, and another thing to love a Friend, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; the love of the one, no way leſſens the obligations and ties of friendſhips that are between the other, but rather incloſes them in bounds and fences, whereby they are not violable. Truely,</hi> Philoret, <hi>I know thy love to be ſuch to thy Maſter, and thy merits to be ſo great in every eye, that were I not engag'd unto</hi> Bertaldo <hi>by promiſe, and oblig'd by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of all the Men that carry heads upon their ſhoulders, I ſhould love</hi> Philoret, <hi>and therefore never feare that his love ſhould be leſſe to thee. Amariſſa</hi> (perceiving <hi>Philoret</hi> his colour to be quite gone, and a Civill warre begun already upon his cheekes, between the white Roſe and the Red) leaves off ſpeaking, (as men leave wounding when they think the party almoſt dead) when poor <hi>Philoret</hi> had fallen to ground, had not <hi>Amariſſa</hi> catcht him falling, who (like ſome young Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) ſeeing his Potion begin to work by contraries, feares he had miſtaken the right Glaſſe, and preſcrib'd his Patient Poyſons inſtead of Cordialls: ſo affrighted was <hi>Amariſſa</hi> in applying remedies where ſhe was ſo ignorant of the diſeaſe. <hi>Philoret</hi> comes to himſelf, whom <hi>Amariſſa</hi> leaves, as <hi>Doctors</hi> doe their <hi>Patients,</hi> when they begin to be dangerous, carrying that ſad newes of irrecovery to <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who flies to his beloved <hi>Page,</hi> catching him up in his Armes, asking him <hi>what he ayl'd?</hi> And <hi>what he would have?</hi> Bidding him <hi>declare his mind fully, what he would, before he Marryed: or whether</hi> Honour,

Preferment, Land, Riches, Money <hi>moſt affected him, it ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and if he doubted his Marriage would be an Obſtacle to any of theſe, he would never Marry untill he had ſatisfied him in any of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philoret</hi> anſwered him, <hi>I ask nothing, but that you would not Marry; all theſe things I have forſaken already for your ſake, and if you Marry I muſt forſake</hi> you, <hi>and</hi> die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> told him, <hi>that it was but the</hi> Exuberance <hi>of his affection, which in time may eaſily be remedied:</hi> telling him, <hi>That</hi> fondneſſe <hi>muſt give way to Princes Edicts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was decreed by <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Command, that to morrow muſt be the day that <hi>Amariſſa</hi> and he muſt ſhake hands in Holy Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Philoret) I may lie at your feet this night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philoret</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bertaldo) thou ſhalt lie for ever at my heart, as my beſt friend for ever. Come, I'le call thee Page no more, thou ſhalt be my ſelfe; and afterwards I ſhall let thee know, that thy fears are needleſſe, and that thy diſcontents ſtand upon no ground.</hi>

               <p>Thus paſt the night away, when in the morning there was nothing to be ſeene, but preparations for the Wedding; time drawing on, the accuſtomed preparations for the Solemnity, newes was brought, that <hi>Berontus</hi> was very ſick, and could not attend the Ceremony; <hi>Philoret</hi> had fallen into ſeverall diſtempers, and fits of ſoundings, (ſtrange Preludiums to ſuch Solemnities) <hi>Berontus</hi> his condition was not much weigh'd, becauſe not any knew the cauſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; but <hi>Philoret,</hi> his caſe was much reſented by thoſe who were not ignorant either of the Malady, or the Remedy. Amongſt whom <hi>Bertaldo</hi> was the forwardeſt (as the moſt expert) Phyſitian in feeling of his Pulſe: Who comming to <hi>Philoret,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou</hi> (young man) <hi>that astoniſheſt all men with thy Miracles, and me with thy Love, why dost thou expire ſo often? There muſt be ſomething to hinder every man from the perfection of a Deity. Why wilt thou ſullie all thy former actions with ſuch fondneſs? more befitting ſome female weakneſs, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to ſuch proweſſe as is alwaies reſident in thy manly breast; why art thou ſuch a jarre to all our muſick, rain'ſt thy teares upon our joyfull harveſt? Come, I ne'r Chid thee before in all my life, nor ever thought I ſhould; and why ſhould I Chide thee, ſince it is rather the errour of love, than love of errour? thou committ'ſt the fault, and I'le give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; aske and have what thou wilt of me; for, by all that's good, wert thou capable of a nearer relation than that of Friendſhip, even of that I'm going about and ſhould'st aske me,</hi> Amariſſa <hi>ſhould not ſtand between thee and thy Contentment.</hi> Heavens! what <hi>confuſion</hi> that word caſt into his <hi>thoughts!</hi> what <hi>changeableneſſe</hi> into his <hi>countenance!</hi> what <hi>rain bows</hi> were tied in <hi>True lovers knots</hi> upon his <hi>cheeks!</hi> he gave his <hi>eyes</hi> free leave to <hi>ſpeake</hi> his minde, whil'ſt he deny'd his <hi>heart</hi> the <hi>benefit</hi> of it's own <hi>Advocate;</hi> he lets <hi>ſilly</hi> and <hi>unexperienc'd</hi> wiſhes, ſallie out of that ſtrong-hold, whilſt effective words &amp; language were kept in like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable

Lyons within their Grates; at laſt, (conſidering the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> that would follow his diſcovery, but moſt of all <hi>fearing</hi> the deniall that his ſuppos'd diſparity would ſoone give check to ſuch a Mate) his <hi>mind</hi> gave him rather to break his <hi>Heart,</hi> than break his <hi>Mind;</hi> and choſe rather to die a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to humility, than to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broile</hi> ſuch Lovers in diſcontents, to ſatisfie his own deſires, by ſuch preſumption; giving <hi>Bertaldo</hi> this anſwer, ſent up by the ſwellings of his Heart, no riſing of any Lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo, I am contented that you ſhall Marry</hi> Amariſſa, <hi>and enjoy her, upon one condition, that you will onely give me leave to mourn this day, and I ſhall never trouble you with any more Petitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> admiring at his ſuite, yet being us'd to ſuch exotick fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cuſtome took away the ſtrangeneſſe of it; whereupon he gave him leave (not thinking that he had meant any other kind of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then not rejoycing with the reſt) whereat <hi>Philoret</hi> ſeem'd to be much pleas'd, and <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> glad that he had any way contented him) repaires to <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> whom he confounds with the relation, in thinking with what ſtrange predominance his love bare ſway; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe reſolves to humour him likewiſe for the future, and by her loving carriage towards him to let him ſee his Errour. But when the time drew near, that <hi>hand</hi> in <hi>hand</hi> ſhould joyne <hi>two</hi> hearts in <hi>one;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Lorenzo, he</hi> falls ſuddenly <hi>ſick,</hi> whoſe indiſpoſedneſſe to attend the Ceremony, bequeathes the gift of <hi>Amariſſa</hi> into Holy Hands, to be delivered to <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> to the performance of the brave <hi>Berontus:</hi> who being <hi>ſick</hi> with Love, was <hi>deadly</hi> afraid he ſhould thereby be acceſſary to his owne deſtruction; how averſe ſoever his minde was to the Princes deputation, yet neceſſity laid ſuch ſtrong hold upon him, together with <hi>Bertaldo</hi> his Entreaties, and <hi>Amariſſa</hi>'s Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that it ſeem'd no otherwiſe to him, then as if he had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to act that part with ſuch an impulſion, as wherewith the evill deſtinies drive men to be their own Executioners.</p>
               <p>Thus all was out of order, whilſt ignorance is about to joyne hands with Devotion, to act unlawfull things under the pretenſion of Holy Rites: on they ruſh, as well as they may, they think no hurt, they doe no good: <hi>Monſtrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptum.</hi> They enter the Holy Place, the Prieſt is preſent, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ready, the People by, the Ceremonies begun, <hi>Berontus</hi> is call'd upon to doe his Office; he goes about what he had rather let alone, <hi>unwillingly</hi> willing he takes <hi>Amariſſa</hi> by the hand; and when he ſhould deliver her to the Prieſt, he holds her faſt, and would not let her goe; and when he ſhould ſpeak certaine words, he declares by an uncertaine kind of ſpeech, which had no other articulates but the weight of language, I mean his tears; that what he did, came not from his heart, whereby ſeeming to ſerve for no other uſe, then as a dumb and ſenſleſſe Statue; her hand was taken out of his, and given to another, who gave it to the Prieſt to be delivered to <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who were then, and there, publiquely Married in the fight of all the

world. Never till this time, when it ſeem'd too late, did <hi>Amariſſa</hi> perceive that <hi>Berontus</hi> was in love with her, whoſe pitty of his condition made her ſorry that ſhe had not known it ſooner; and <hi>that</hi> ſorrow cauſed <hi>Bertaldo</hi> to perceive a kind of reluctancy in <hi>Amariſſa</hi>'s countenance, as if ſhe had not been well pleas'd with what ſhe had done, which made him not ſo well pleas'd with his Bargaine as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would have been: But behold a ſad ſight adminiſtred a greater occaſion of diſlike, than was the former; for <hi>Philoret,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with <hi>Melancholly</hi> of the <hi>Blackeſt</hi> hue, ſtudies a way how to improve it to the higheſt. Wherefore when he perceiv'd them all gone to the Wedding, he puts on a Mourning Habit, and all alone goes into the roome prepar'd for the Dinner, where ſolemnity had plac'd two Chaires of State for the <hi>Bride,</hi> and <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> to enthrone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Majeſty; Thus accoutr'd, <hi>Philoret</hi> ſeates himſelfe in the Brides Chair; and throwing his upper Garment over his ſhoulder, he ſettles his minde to as deep a Melancholly, as either his outward Habit, or his Poſture, hung out ſignes: Thus under the ſhadow of deſpaire ſits <hi>Philoret,</hi> like a condemned <hi>Victim preſſed</hi> to death, whoſe inability to indure the <hi>preſent</hi> paine, makes him cry <hi>more</hi> weight; untill <hi>oppreſsion</hi> made him <hi>ſenſleſſe,</hi> falling into a charitable ſlumber, that put him into ſuch a pleaſing dreame, as in a manner was able to quit coſt to all his anxieties: He dream't, how, that after death, he was found to be a <hi>Virgin;</hi> and that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> lov'd him <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> dead, than when he was <hi>alive,</hi> and that he wept over him; and that his <hi>Teares</hi> were ſuch an Embalmement, that he ſhould never Rot, nor Stink; he dream't the looſe Earth over his Grave to be tranſparent; ſo that he could ſee <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> and <hi>Amariſſa,</hi> ſtrewing Herbes and Flowers over his Grave, and from their ſwolne eyes, to pour ſuch virtuall ſhowers upon that Covering, that the Flowers <hi>rooted,</hi> and were everlaſting: whilſt the <hi>bordering</hi> Willowes round his Semitary, with lifting up their <hi>armes</hi> by a juſt <hi>wind,</hi> refus'd their Boughes to hands, that were too forward for to pluck Materialls where withall to make him Garlands. In which interim, in comes <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> with <hi>Amariſſa</hi> in his hand, with all their Concommitants to that half ſolemnity, where finding <hi>Philoret</hi> aſleep in <hi>ſuch</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, <hi>ſuch</hi> a Seat, <hi>ſuch</hi> Habit, and at <hi>ſuch</hi> a time, it ſtruck them into <hi>ſuch</hi> a dumpe, that Raine in Harveſt was never ſo unwelcome to the greedy Husband-man, as this ſight was cauſe of diſcontent to the two Triumphants; they all ſtood about him, and pitied both his <hi>ſleep</hi> and <hi>waking;</hi> all fell a wondring why <hi>aſleep,</hi> why in <hi>Mourning,</hi> why in <hi>her</hi> Chaire, why at <hi>that</hi> time juſt, when others were in <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration</hi> of ſo great Solemnity!</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> catches him up againe, uſes all the meanes to recall him to himſelfe, but all in vaine: he remaines <hi>breathleſſe,</hi> no pulſes <hi>beat,</hi> nor ſigne of <hi>life</hi> at all: All give him for <hi>dead;</hi> he makes haſte by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till he becomes as <hi>cold</hi> as earth; he is delivered into proper hands for laying of him forth: <hi>Bertaldo</hi> weeps, whil'ſt all were ſo full of ſorrow, that there were no Comforters, none ſate downe to eate, whil'ſt the meat, as <hi>ſympathizing</hi> with the accident, cool'd as if it dyed, loſing <hi>their artificiall,</hi> as <hi>he his naturall</hi> heat; who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the ſorow that in generall fill'd every particular breaſt? but to conceive the vaſt load that lay upon <hi>Bertaldo,</hi> who acknowledged him ſelfe <hi>guilty of the murder, by giving ſo</hi> deafe <hi>an eare to</hi> Philoret<hi>'s often inculcations, that he ſhould not Marry, and that if he did he ſhould ſurely dye: which had he but believ'd, all the world ſhould not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to have ſhaken hands with any Creature living.</hi>

                  <hi>Coeli</hi> makes it known unto him how much he acknowledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Honour'd with that tendure; and although the Ancient Family of the <hi>Cerda</hi>'s acknowledg'd him to be the Chief, and his <hi>Bloud</hi> no leſſe <hi>Royall,</hi> than the Potent Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> have acknowledg'd his deſcent; yet he muſt ſubmit to him that writ himſelf <hi>Newphew</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the World; and that he ſhould not onely Command him, but beſpeak his own Commands.</p>
               <p>I here intend no deſcription of Battailes, or to ſpeak, [COMME UN CLERC DES ARMES] it ſhall ſuffice, that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> had ſuch a Command as deſerv'd his Conduct, and fitted his mind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he behav'd himſelfe ſo Gallantly (in that Bloudy and laſt day of Battaile, that ever was fought betweene the daring <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the moſt Barbarous and Bloudy <hi>Moores)</hi> that he not onely got
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97485:63"/>
immortall Honour (eſpecially in that dayes Service) to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Gallant ſoules, (I mean the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> who are never ſparing in giving Worth (the juſt reward of prayſes) in what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman ſoever the deſert is found, and as wary in putting Palmes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne natives <hi>Hands</hi> where they are claimed, but with the leaſt doubt of merit) having once reſcued their King from eminent danger, twice thruſt his Launce through the maine body of the Tawny Monſter; and at laſt, when <hi>Coeli's</hi> Son had loſt his life in the Cauſe, and by his death had gained his Friends the Victory. <hi>Bertaldo</hi> would not ſuffer the ſacrifice to be of none effect; but gave the <hi>Moores</hi> (quickly) to underſtand, that his <hi>Bloud</hi> was <hi>Poyſon</hi> to their hopes, <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Vineger</hi> to their <hi>Thirſt;</hi> and every <hi>drop, Periods</hi> to their Succeſſes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Spaine</hi> formerly loſt by Luſt, and entred by theſe <hi>Moores,</hi> in at the ſides of a laſcivious raviſher, was Re-inſtated by means of a Chaſt Virgin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> having acted his part ſo well, <hi>Coeli</hi> was not backward to Honour him with the higheſt reſpects that could be imagined, among the reſt he expreſs'd upon occaſion a great deal of willingneſſe to ſerve his merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> reply'd, <hi>That it lay in his power to doe him that Curteſie, that would be the moſt acceptable favour of any thing that lay in his power to grant, or his, to ask.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeli</hi> asked him <hi>what it was,</hi> and told him <hi>it ſhould be granted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask you nothing</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bertaldo) but that you would give me</hi> truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeli</hi> bid him onely <hi>aske and have, find and take.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then I ask you upon your Honour: Had you not a Daughter who was called</hi> Periiſſa, <hi>mark't with the Sun and Moon upon her Arme?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeli</hi> admires the perſpicuity of that <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and tells him, That <hi>for truth ſake he would not dececeive him, and for his promiſe ſake he would not utterly relinquiſh her;</hi> telling him moreover, <hi>he did it but to humble the Mother that bare her, and to lead his Child through adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that ſhe might attaine to that perfection of humility, of which he hop'd by this time ſhe was miſtreſſe of:</hi> aſſuring him, that <hi>though ſhe ſeem'd to be out of his ſight, and he might ſeeme to hide his face from her, yet his providence was never wanting in the ſupply of ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as were expedient for her, though ſhe knew not whence they came, and that now the time was come for her recallment; her only Brother being dead, and ſhe all the Children he had living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Bertaldo</hi> (ſaid the Duke) <hi>how came you to underſtand all this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onely by hearing, ſeeing, and believing</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bertaldo) by hearkning to</hi> Adminda's <hi>voice; by ſeeing the</hi> Signes <hi>and</hi> Wonders <hi>upon her Armes, and by believing both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeli</hi> ask'd him, <hi>Have you not brought a</hi> Petition <hi>with you, as well as a</hi> Narration?</p>

                  <hi>Bertaldo</hi> ſaid <hi>I have, and it is ſoone ſaid. I deſire your Daughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeli</hi> reply'd, <hi>and it is as ſoone granted: She is yours, and all that</hi> Coeli <hi>has to give; but you muſt have her upon this one condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will performe it what ever it be, if it be poſsible</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bertaldo.)</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Berontus</hi> wondred who it ſhould be, that ſhould ſtop ſo <hi>fierce</hi> a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and give battaile to <hi>deſpaire.

between that and <hi>Rome,</hi> to recite all their ſeverall paſſages to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were both confident, that their endeavours derived their ſucceſſes from the prayers of Innocents.</p>

               <p>Berontus, <hi>in anſwer to your</hi> Metaphors <hi>and</hi> Compellations, <hi>I could call you Heire to Juſtice;</hi> Amynda's <hi>Favourite,</hi> Fortitudes <hi>right Hand, Fortunes</hi> Minion, <hi>the Peoples</hi> Darling: <hi>But I conceive more felicity in ſaying,</hi> My Berontus, <hi>which includes</hi> all <hi>that can be ſaid: And for your doubt of my belief, Alas!

               <p>Whilſt theſe three paire of Lovers were courting one another, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> and <hi>Honoria</hi> could not uſe any <hi>language</hi> for <hi>hearkning</hi> to what they had <hi>ſaid,</hi> nor other <hi>behaviour</hi> for <hi>obſerving</hi> theirs: both were exceeding glad to ſee the corne ſo <hi>fluſter</hi> upon the ground that was <hi>ſowed</hi> by their hands, and come to ſuch maturity as required their ſickle to be thruſt into their harveſt, that ſhould cut downe the <hi>looſe</hi> eares that were <hi>open</hi> to further diſcourſe, that they might be bound up in the <hi>band</hi> of unity: wherefore <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Honoria</hi> appoint the time of Marriage, and that, no longer then the day that followed; they ſend for the <hi>Heraulds,</hi> and asked their advice about the manner of the ſolemnity, charging them, that <hi>it might be performed with the greateſt</hi> ſtate <hi>and</hi> magnificence <hi>that lay within the power of</hi> art <hi>and</hi> coſt <hi>to ſet it forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heraulds anſwered, that <hi>all things were in a readineſſe, that preparation it ſelf could ſet in order; but there was one thing requiſite, which if it could be effected, nothing could more conduce</hi> to make <hi>it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne,</hi> viz: that <hi>theſe ſolemnities might have their ſhadowes, and theſe paires their ſeconds; which</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>might be eaſily done if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Marriages betweene</hi> Favorinus <hi>and</hi> Biſalta, Hortenſius <hi>and</hi> Pippea <hi>might have ſuch accelerations as they might all meet in parallels upon the ſame day.</hi>

               <p>The propoſition pleaſed the Princes well, and the Ladyes moſt of all; it was ſo order'd by <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> whoſe commands <hi>plain'd</hi> all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and <hi>cut</hi> off all delayes: The Parties were ſent for; ſent for, came; no ſooner there, but all agreed: <hi>Corderius</hi> made a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the Company, that <hi>to his knowledge there were a Couple to be Married, and the time appointed was but the day after the morrow whereon theſe ſolemnities were to be performed, he ſaw no reaſon but that they ſhould take them alſo into the number that the Temple might be full:</hi> They all conſented, and were earneſt to know <hi>who they were?</hi> and being told them, who ſhould it be, but poor <hi>Prickette</hi> and <hi>Rivana;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97485:69"/>
joy,</hi> and <hi>mirth,</hi> and <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> were expreſſed <hi>all</hi> at <hi>once</hi> for his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:</hi> A Herauld at Armes was ſent to <hi>Prickette</hi> to ſummon him to the Wedding, and to command him to be ready on the morrow with his Sweet-heart, to be Married with the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Heraulds having ended their debatements concerning the particular Ceremonies, it was concluded, that <hi>Bertaldo</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> ſhould have <hi>Banners</hi> carried before <hi>them,</hi> wherein were curiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented <hi>all</hi> the famous deeds of Chivalry that had been perform'd by thoſe <hi>Heroes,</hi> when they moſt <hi>quench'd</hi> their <hi>thirſting</hi> after fame, and ſo they were to make a moſt <hi>ſolemne</hi> proceſſion up to the Temple of <hi>Virtue;</hi> and through it, to the Temple of <hi>Honour;</hi> where ſuch <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were to be made as <hi>divided</hi> themſelves into <hi>halves</hi> to be <hi>wholly</hi> one anothers: But, as for <hi>Favorinus</hi> and <hi>Biſalta, Hortenſius</hi> and <hi>Pippea,</hi> whoſe utmoſt merits aym'd at no higher perfection than <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity,</hi> their <hi>aſcendent</hi> was to be no <hi>higher</hi> than to the Temple of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> to conſummate their Vowes, where the <hi>totall</hi> ſumme of all their merits would not ariſe in their <hi>particulars</hi> to any tearmes of Honour: But, <hi>Prickette</hi> and <hi>Rivana they</hi> were to goe no farther than to the <hi>portch</hi> of the Temple, <hi>there</hi> to content themſelves with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible</hi> ſolemnities.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Concluſion,</hi> was no <hi>ſmall</hi> occaſion of <hi>much</hi> diſtraction; for, <hi>Biſalta</hi> (a Woman of a high ſpirit) was not a little diſpleas'd that ſhe ſhould wed her ſelfe to a Man of no <hi>atchievements,</hi> and to one that could not lead her up the ſteps of Honour, ſo that at <hi>laſt</hi> ſhe began to <hi>ſwell</hi> bigger with <hi>ſcorne</hi> than when he <hi>ſcorn'd</hi> her <hi>firſt:</hi> and thus ſhe openly expreſt her diſcontents before all the Company, <hi>Muſt I beſtow my ſelfe, and</hi> ſmile <hi>a fortune upon a Man that can anſwer my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts with no</hi> higher <hi>advance to than ſet me</hi> downe <hi>at Virtue's feet? whoſe Temple as it is a</hi> thorow-fare <hi>to Honours, I like full-well; but as it is a</hi> confine, <hi>I like the Seat no more than if he had ſate me upon the</hi> Stoole <hi>of</hi> ſad <hi>Repentance. I thought (when I ſaw him firſt</hi> (active <hi>as</hi> lightning) <hi>get up upon his</hi> flying <hi>Horſe) he had been able to have</hi> pluckt bright Honour from the pale-fac'd Moone; <hi>but</hi> now, <hi>I ſee, that</hi> Hares <hi>and</hi> Partridges, <hi>were the</hi> Trophees <hi>of his</hi> greateſt Victories: <hi>ſhe could be no more contented with that</hi> beggarly <hi>glory, than</hi> Eagles <hi>could make it their repaſt to catch at</hi> Flies.</p>
               <p>Nor was this all, for <hi>Pippea</hi> takes her Sweet-heart <hi>Hortenſius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and tells him, <hi>Hortenſius, thou art an</hi> honeſt <hi>man, but that is</hi> all: <hi>what a fine thing it would have been if thou hadſt done ſome</hi> famous <hi>act whereby we two might have been Married in the Temple of</hi> Honour <hi>with</hi> Bertaldo <hi>and</hi> Periiſſa, Berontus <hi>and</hi> Amariſſa? <hi>I love thee well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but if thou hadſt been a</hi> martiall <hi>Man, Oh how happy ſhould I have been!</hi>
               </p>

onely <hi>Prickette</hi> and <hi>Rivana</hi> they were <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>heavy;</hi> having no merit to lay claime to Virtue or Honour, they were (likely) to loſe their ſhares in the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, <hi>Rivana</hi> told her Sweet-heart (plainly) that <hi>She would not be Married in a Portch, ſhe ſaw no reaſon but that</hi> he <hi>was as good a Man as</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>and if he was</hi> not, <hi>it was his</hi> owne <hi>fault, he</hi> might <hi>have been if he would: why did he not goe into the Warres, and doe as he did? for her part, ſhe hated a Man that was good for nothing: and if he would needs Marry in a Portch let him get one that would, for ſhe would not be made a laughing-ſtock for the beſt of them all. Oh that ſhe were a Man ſhe would have been Married in the Temple of</hi> Honour, <hi>or elſe ſhe would have been wedded to her</hi> grave!</p>
               <p>This Speech made <hi>Prickette ſoarly</hi> lament and <hi>repent</hi> that he had been ſo <hi>negligent</hi> in laying hold of opportunities (when they were offered him) to have done <hi>ſome glorious act whereby he might be famous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He conſiders with himſelf, and repaires unto the <hi>Herauld,</hi> and layes before him the <hi>miſery</hi> of his <hi>condition,</hi> offering him a large ſumme of money, if <hi>he could finde out ſome way, or plead his caſe ſo, that he might be Married in the Temple of</hi> Honour, <hi>or elſe he was ſure to loſe his Miſtreſſe for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Herauld</hi> told him, that <hi>there was no way except he could fight a Duell with ſome</hi> knowne <hi>Worthy, and ſo come off with</hi> honour, <hi>and in ſuch a caſe he had a private conveyance where he could ſhew him how he might convey his Miſtreſſe into the Temple, and there when he was once got in, it was the manner of the place, that none ſhould be excluded; and he would plead the priviledge of the Temple in his behalf if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> did not like the Propoſition very well, yet that was all he could get of the <hi>Herauld:</hi> away he goes, telling him, that <hi>he would ſee what he could doe,</hi> reſolving to be <hi>quarrelſome</hi> with any living ſoule that ſhould give him (but) the leaſt occaſion; for, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to endure that life whatſoever came of it: up and downe he goes ſeeking occaſion, where at laſt under the walls of <hi>Carthage</hi> he lights into a <hi>grot,</hi> where one <hi>Hamon</hi> (a notable <hi>Kill-cow</hi> and noted <hi>Dueller,</hi> and one who had formerly put an afront upon him) was drinking and making merry with ſome others of his Companions: <hi>Prickette</hi> comes in, and tells them, <hi>he was diſpos'd to be merry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Company anſwered him, that <hi>they were diſpos'd to bid him welcome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> anſwered him, That <hi>if that diſpleas'd him he would ſet up more, and yet not over-ſet, for any</hi> big <hi>wind</hi> his <hi>words could make.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> told him, That <hi>he remembed it very well, and therefore he took this opportunity to queſtion him for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamon</hi> told him, <hi>he took a very ill time to queſtion him, when it was Night; and that he doubted he would not be ſo</hi> valiant <hi>in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> told him, That <hi>if he thought ſo, he would fight with him preſently, it was as dark for the one as tother, happy man be his Dole.</hi> But the Company would not ſuffer them: and <hi>Prickette</hi> found many friends, becauſe he was a Courtier, and one that might be made ſome uſe of; wherefore <hi>Prickette</hi> pretended a willingneſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, that he might enjoy his opportunity to whiſper <hi>Hamon</hi> in his Ear; who had his deſire, and privately challenged <hi>Hamon</hi> to come out, and fight with him; telling him, That <hi>he would take an occaſion to goe out, as if he meant to turne his face to the Wall, and then he ſhould come after him, and they would have a Craſh. Hamon</hi> conſented to it, out goes <hi>Prickette,</hi> and climes up to the top of a Rock, whereon the <hi>foundation</hi> of the City-wall was laid; after him comes <hi>Hamon</hi> (no man ſuſpecting any ſuch matter) and drawes his Sword, and askes <hi>Where art thou?</hi> Now <hi>Prickette</hi> had him between him and the light, ſo that <hi>he</hi> could eaſily diſcerne <hi>him;</hi> but <hi>Hamon</hi> (newly come <hi>out</hi> of the light, and having it behind him) could not ſee before him: So that he ſtill cry'd, <hi>Where art thou?

Prickette</hi> ſtill cry'd, <hi>Here: Why don't you come on?</hi> Untill ſuch time as he had got him juſt under him, and then he leaps upon his Neck and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and beares him to the ground; puts his Shoulder out of joynt, Diſarmes him; cryes aloud, <hi>Call for mercy (thou Villaine) or I will be the death of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Company hearing a noiſe, all run out with Candles in their hands, and there they find <hi>Prickette</hi> upon the <hi>Gyant:</hi> They all take him off of him. <hi>Hamon</hi> cryes, <hi>O I am ſoarly bruis'd, and my Bones are out of joynt! Sirrah, had it been in the day thou ſhouldſt never have done this: I proteſt I ſaw him not, but he came upon me all of the ſuddaine, I knew not how, nor which way.

               <p>
                  <hi>Prickette</hi> told him, That <hi>if he thought the</hi> Night <hi>had been any</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage <hi>to him, he ſhould doe well to take the</hi> advantage <hi>of the Day, he would anſwer him.</hi>

                  <hi>No</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hamon) I think you have given me enough for all the dayes of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All began to <hi>admire Prickette,</hi> every body thought <hi>Prickette</hi> a <hi>Gallant</hi> Man; who but <hi>Prickette</hi> was <hi>cry'd</hi> up for a <hi>daring</hi> fellow. <hi>Prickette</hi> repaires to the <hi>Herauld,</hi> brings his witneſſes, tells him what he had done: The <hi>Herauld bids him leave the management of the reſt to him, and bring his</hi> Rivana <hi>along with him, much about the time of
