            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maiſters, vnto you doe I complaine both in body &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune, and yet cannot beleeue that you all are led by one ſelfe ſpirite in whatſoeuer is contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt me. You cannot be ignoraunt what moderation I haue euermore vſed in your behalfes, euen in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of armes, neither are you to ſeeke of thoſe iuſt neceſſities whereinto I haue ſometimes bene reduced, &amp; I aſſure my ſelfe that euen in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences you are able to lay the fault wher it ought. Thus much I can ſay, that I neuer enfringed the peace of any iolitie, but may truely affirme that I haue attributed my iuſt ſorowes &amp; diſcontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and that in diuers ſorts, vnto the welth and quiet of this Eſtate. Thoſe men, my Maiſters, if you marke them well, whom with your habilities you doe aſſiſt to my deſtruction, haue not taken the like courſe: of perticuler ambition they haue made zeale to the Church, &amp; of their priuate diſlikes a publick warre: neither haue they moreouer made any conſcience to kindle the fire throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fower quarters of this Realm, ſo to enioy the pleaſure of putting the King to trouble, and hauing by an vniuersall calamitie found meanes to reuenge ſuch diſgraces as they
<pb facs="tcp:13948:4"/>
imagine themſelues to haue receiued at his hands. The Lord open your eyes and graunt you grace to enter into the bottome of their entents. I feare not (as knoweth God) the miſchief that may befall me, either of your coyne or their weapons: both the one and the other haue often enough bene employed in vaine: I lament for the poore innocent people, who, almoſt alone, doe beare theſe follies: I moane euen a great number of you that doe contribute to the ambition of theſe perturbers, you of your pouertie, they hardly of their haboundance: and principally I be waile the fault that you all doe commit, ſome vpon one affection, others of an other, who one day ſhall be to aunſwer to this Realme and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie for ſo many miſeries and hazardes whereinto (euen to your coſtes) you doe plunge it: you, who by your vocations ought to bee the pillers of publicke tranquilitie, ſhall aunſwere before God for ſo much innocent bloud ſpilled: for ſuch diſorders, and vices of that warre that you nouriſh, which bringeth in the howlings, cryes and languiſhing, of ſo many poore families whome your aboundaunce ought either to nouriſh or relieue, which you make inſtruments of their miſerie, cauſe of their hunger and ſcourges of the Commonwelth. You may alleadge <hi>zeale of the Church,</hi> and I am content to beleeue that ſome of you are driuen thereby. What ſhall the poſteritie then ſay, that you haue neclected my proffers? that you haue wiſhed rather to bring all into confuſion then to frame your ſelues to a Counſaile, which in
<pb facs="tcp:13948:4"/>
my expreſſe declaration I required at the Kinges hands? That you had rather proceede euen to bloud then quietly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre vpon the ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? That you haue preferred the meanes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Eſtate, before the way to conuert the ſoules which you thinke to be ſtrayed, yea euen my perſon beeing therein touched, whom truely you ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enſtruct then to deſtroy? Thoſe perſons that doe abuze your zeale doe well enough knowe that it is vnpoſſible for them to performe their promeſſe, I ſay, by force of armes to roote y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I doe liue. They ſeeke not the reunion but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Realme: and call to mind that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in vaine vnder the ſame pretence they cauſed you to ſell your Temporalties: remember alſo that your coyne was conſumed and your deuotion to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, quenched, before you could finde euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall ſucceſſe in your deliberations. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede further: ſome of the Cleargie, (I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that many of them haue conſented to ſuch a confederatie) haue ſollicited the Pope againſt me, and at his hands haue obteyned a certaine declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherby I am exhibited for a pray, and declared vnhable the ſucceſſion of this Realme. Thincke not my Maiſters that theſe Thunderbolts doe any whit aſtoniſh me, for it is God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diſpoſeth both of Kings and Kingdomes, and your predeceſſors, who were both better Chriſtians and better Frenchmen then the fautors of this Bull, haue ſufficiently taught vs that Popes haue not to deale with this Eſtate. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:13948:5"/>
it grieueth mee that contrary to all good maner there ſhould be to be found any ſo inconſiderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as at Roome to procure the conſulting vpon and deciding of the ſucceſſion of a liuing King and that in the flower of his age: For whereto may that bee good, except to raiſe vs vp in this Eſtate either many diſperſers or one vſurper. I am ſorie that we ſhould let forraine Nations know that our Nation heretofore ſo deuoute to our Princes, ſhould bring foorth in this age ſuch Monſters, as for either their pleaſures or ambition doe put foorth the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth for a pray, &amp; willingly enuite all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the ſpoyle of this Eſtate. For, as for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt GOD hath preſerued me that my hope pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate not beyond the life of my Prince. God in his iuſt wrath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found al ſuch as ſhall build their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon his Toumbe, euen thoſe that are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident as to anticipate his death by their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailes. But leauing theſe ſpeeches I will accompt better of you then your actions doe will me, and I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudge you by my ſelfe then by your dealings. They haue procured me much miſchiefe, I wil not impute it generally to all: I will thinke it a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratie but of ſome who are otherwiſe vrged thereto, and that peraduenture at the inſtigation of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, the ſeedes of Spayne and enemies to the wealth of this Eſtate, and God graunt them to bee as readie to abſtaine from the miſchiefe to come, as I am now willing to forgiue them. The reſt that I haue to ſay vnto you is that God hath cauſed me to
<pb facs="tcp:13948:5"/>
be borne a Chriſtian Prince, I deſire the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, encreaſe, and peace of Chriſtian Religion: we all beleeue in one God: wee all confeſſe one Ieſus Chriſt: we all receiue one Goſpell, if vpon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the ſelfe ſame textes wee fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, I ſuppoſe the ſhort waies that I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded might bring vs to agreement: I beleeue that the Warre that you ſo ſharply doe proſecute is vnworthy all Chriſtians, yea vnworthy to be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe that pretend themſelues Doctors of the Goſpell.

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maiſters, ſuch is your birth that nere enough you approach vnto the affayres of Eſtate whereby to attribute the right or wrong where it apperteyneth, and therefore wee ſhall neede no long ſpeech to open your eyes. You haue euen in full peace perceiued the originall of the broyles of the League contrary to the quiet of this Realm: you know my patience, notwithſtanding they tooke me for their contrary and made me the ſubiect and pretence of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. You haue ſeene the Leaguers pronounced Rebelles by the King, and for ſuch proſecuted in all Courts of Parliaments: your ſelues haue you ſene commaunded, armed and fighting againſt them by the Kings expreſſe will vnder the authoritie of the Princes of his bloud with the Peeres and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Officers of his Crowne. I doubt not therfore but vnto you it ſeemeth ſtraunge to beholde, as in a moment, this alteration: to ſee your ſelues armed againſt the bloud of France: commanded by ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whom you fought againſt as perturbers, and which is worſe, againſt thoſe who three daies before were for the ſeruice of the King and Realme ſent for, and commaunded as you, ranged vnder the ſame auncients and of like will as your ſelues: But withall you can iudge that the firſt precepts procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:13948:6"/>
of the Kings proper motion, and thoſe that haue followed, of the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the perturbers. For what haue theſe of the League ſince done, euen betweene both, whereby to loſe the qualitie of Rebelles guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Treazon, perturbers of the peace, which by ſo many decrees haue to them bene attributed? either what offence haue thoſe of the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committed, by liuing vnder the benefite of the Edicts, whome his Maieſtie indifferently ſummoned to his ſeruice, who alſo equally oppoſed them ſelues againſt the common flame, that now they ſhould at the appetite of the ſayd perturbers bee expelled the Realme and on euery ſide purſued to the death? If it be for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, was there not expreſſe Edicts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Were not the ſame newly reiterated? Can that which is permitted by the lawes of the Realme be accompted an offence? May it be proſecuted with any paine? If it be (as in troth it is) for contrarying the purpoſes of the League, are not your ſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to that offence? bee not you ſubiect to the ſame payne? doe you then ſeeke your owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe? For what offence are they burdened with except that they are and wil be no other but French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? Now I come to my ſelfe, whether you will iudge of me by my ſelf, or by compariſon with thoſe of the League: well I knowe that you can not lay the fault vpon me: yea, I knowe that euen in your conſciences you doe attribute it to my enemies: They meddle with talke of my Religion, you that know the preeminence of the bloud of France, that
<pb facs="tcp:13948:7"/>
can well ſay that you owe no duetie but to the ſame, ſhall it bee ſayde that I muſt giue accoumpt to the ſtraunger? Is it not enough for mee to ſatiſfie the King and all Fraunce? Hath any one complained that I haue violently entreated him for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? What more could I doe either with reaſon or Chriſtianlike, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to craue a good Counſaile? They are alſo offended with the gouernment of the eſtate, and haue endeuoured to prouide for the ſucceſſion thereof: They haue procured the Pope to decide the ſame at Roome: you therefore that hould the chiefe roume in this Realme, if neceſſitie had ſo required, could you be ſo careleſſe as to ſuffer ſtraungers to preuent you in that office? Haue you no regarde to your poſteritie? Could you ouerſleepe this duetie? For in all theſe broyles what haue appeared but <hi>Lorrain?</hi> But in troth either to reforme or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſforme the eſtate according to their deſires they needed not your helpe: to paſſe ouer the Eſtate into a forraine hand was a worke fit for ſtraungers onely to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: to expell France out of France, the proceſſe could not be determined in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſhe was to much ſuſpected in ſuch a cauſe and therefore it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in Italie. They haue directly oppoſed them ſelues againſt mee: I haue offered the combat: I haue ſtooped beneath my ſelfe: I haue not diſdained to fight with them: I haue done it (God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) for the preſeruing of the people from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſparing of your bloud: Of yours, I ſay, which is principally ſhed in theſe miſeries. If they
<pb facs="tcp:13948:7"/>
had any thing to ſay againſt mee, had not this bene moſt honorable for them? If in heart they ſought the wealth and benefite of this Eſtate, did not I ſet them in a fayre way? There haue bene ſuch found as haue hazarded their liues for the ſafegarde of their Countrey, what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then may you giue of thoſe who for ſauing themſelues out of daunger can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to ſee the ouerthrow of a whole eſtate?</p>
            <p>You profeſſe your ſelues to be men of honor, what wrong then doe they to their honors who will not accept of ſo good a way? or what iniurie doe you to your owne in accompanying them againſt me? You that would make a conſcience in aſſiſting a fauorite againſt one of your neighbours. Thincke not my Maiſters that I feare them, I know what ſtrength may doe againſt me: ſooner ſhall they bee wearie of aſſaulting me then I of defending my ſelfe: many a yere haue I borne their brunt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were much ſtronger and my ſelfe farre weaker then now. You haue experience and iudgement, the paſſed may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue you of that that is to come. Truely I bewaile your bloud ſhed and ſpilled in vaine which ought to be ſpared for the preſeruation of France: I doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that that ſhould be employed againſt me which ye ſhould keepe for me being that which God hath made me in this Realme, for the ioyning vnder the authoritie and good ſucceſſe of the King, France to France, where now it ſerueth to driue it out of France: I doe alſo moane it that it ſhall neither be payed or mourned for almoſt of any: for the King,
<pb facs="tcp:13948:8"/>
being forced in his will doth not holde himſelfe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of thoſe that force him, on the other ſide thoſe that doe force him wil neuer con you thanke for this ſeruice, as knowing that it is the Kings name and not theirs that you doe ſerue. My maiſters, GOD graunt you well to conſider hereof. The French Princes are chiefe of the Nobilitie I loue you all, I feele my ſelfe waſt and weaken in your bloud, a ſtraunger can haue no feeling thereof. The ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger beareth no intereſt in this loſſe. I might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of ſome, I had rather bewaile them, and am readie to embrace you al: My greateſt griefe is that thoſe whom in minde I doe diſtinguiſh, whom alſo I knowe to haue bene circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uented, I cannot make any difference of in the hazard of armes: But God knoweth my hart: Their bloud be vpon the authors of theſe miſeries. For my part, my Maiſters, I doe and inceſſantly will beſeech him that it may pleaſe him to open the way whereby his name may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; honored, the King obeyed, the State quieted, and all orders and degrees of this Realme reduced to their priſtinate dignitie, proſperitie and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Amen. </p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maiſters, I neede not many words to open vnto you the equitie of my cauſe. Call to mind that when theſe broyles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan wee liued in peace and daylie went forward better and better. Remember alſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſame tended directly againſt mee, yet for eight moneths ſpace I ſtirred not, my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience paſſed all bounds: neither forget that I ſawe thoſe armies that had bene meeteſt for me, ioyned to my enemies and comming againſt me before I was reſolued to defend my ſelfe. And I ſweare vnto you my Maiſters, that the horror of a ciuill warre and the ſenſible apprehenſion of the miſerie and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that it bringeth foorth euen benumbed mee and tooke away my ſences to my owne domage, had I not perceiued that my ouer long patience redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the daunger and deſtruction of this Realme by giuing the perturbers leiſure violently to haue fulfilled their pleaſures. In caſe Religion was the matter, I ſubmitted my ſelf to a Counſaile: if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints concerning the eſtate, to an aſſembly of the Eſtates: yea, I wiſhed to drawe vpon my owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the whole perrill of France for ſauing it out of miſerie, voluntarily yeelding my ſelfe equall with thoſe whom nature hath made my inferiours, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they of their owne intereſt haue made a common
<pb facs="tcp:13948:9"/>
calamitie, and of their priuate quarelles a publicke confuſion. I might complaine that my iuſt offers were not accepted: But to you I do complaine, and yet for you, not for my ſelfe: I lament theſe extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereby the extreme iniurie to me done hath brought me to that paſſe that I may not defend my ſelfe without the detriment of the innocent people. I bewaile my owne condition, that for the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my life you muſt feele harme and paine, you, for whoſe relief and wealth I was readie to ſhed my bloud, if my enemies had not coueted rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme themſelues from the combat, whereto I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged them, by a paricide againſt this Eſtate and by an uniuerſall combuſtion. But herein I take comfort, that your ſelues can conſider the nature of euilles to bee ſuch as cannot bee healed but by ſome euilles, the cauſe whereof you are not to attribute to the Surgeon whoſe purpoſe is to heale, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him that made the wound, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this wound all the griefes enſuing: That in a ſhort ſpace God will graunt me the grace after ſo many labours to fee this Eſtate purged of thoſe that doe moleſt it, alſo to ſee you enioye ſo certaine and aſſured quiet as in ſmall time may cauſe vs to forget all paſſed trauailes. Iudge by the effects, I beſeech you, of the entents of men to make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in theſe troubles. Theſe men would put you in hope that they reforme the abuſes of the Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that they would deminiſh taxes and ſubſidies, that they would reduce all thinges to the tyme of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> already (if they might haue bene

beleeued) would haue beene ſurnamed fathers of the people. What is come of it? Their warre ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtrangely deuoured on euery ſide, haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by a peace wherein they haue had reſpect onely to their perticuler profite, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you: and which is worſe, their peace is as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly couerted to a warre againſt thoſe that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned quiet, whereby the King is forced to double the Impoſtes, the people exhibited in pray to the man of warre, and France (without the helpe of God) bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to bee murdered of her ſelfe. For what other is that Edict that is wreſted out, but a neceſſitie layd vpon the King to deſtroye his people, and with his owne hand to make away himſelf? At the leaſt if they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to relieue the people, why were they not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to abuze them? or what had they done that they muſt be ouerthrowne? They couer theſe miſchiefes with zeale to the Church: The heate of this zeale ought to haue appeared in charitie, &amp; charitie in the vnion of both Religions. What charitie, which endeuourd onely to roote out? What heate of zeale, which hath fiered all the Countrey, and hath ſet a whole eſtate in combuſtion? In the meane tyme vnder pretence that the Clergie hath payed ſome portion aforehand for the encouraging the Soldiour to begin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wars, ye ſee them on the way. The people muſt couer it with ſome two hundred thouſand Crownes or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, which ſhall binde them hereafter to millions: and to bee briefe, ſome of the Cleargie to the great griefe of the King, yea and of their owne members

My Maiſters, this doe I repeate vnto you: I am a Chriſtian Prince borne: I haue ſought out and propounded the moſt Chriſtian meanes to make vp this Eſtate &amp; reunite the Church. I am a Frenchman borne, I beare part of your calamities, I haue ſought all meanes to exempt you from ciuill miſeries, I will neuer ſpare my life to abridge you of them: I knowe that for the moſt part you are ſubiect to this violence, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe your willes to be thralled, I will not impute to you your actions, you are Frenchmen, I had rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto you your willes: I deſire of you all, who according to your vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are more ſubiect to beare the miſchief, then to doe it, only your vowes, wiſhes and praiers. Pray vnto God, my Maiſters, that by his iudgements he will diſtinguiſh thoſe that ſeeke the felicitie or miſhap of this eſtate, all publicke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie or calamitie. For my part I take him to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that I deſire only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welth of this Realme &amp; of you al: I take him for my Iudge whether ambition or particuler paſſion hath vrged or any whit ſtirred vp my weapons. </p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maiſters, gladly doe I write vnto you as accoumpting you the mirror or abſtract of this Realme, and yet not to enforme you of the equitie of my cauſe which I knowe is ſufficiently knowne vnto you: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to take you to witneſſe: euen you who through the multitude of your good eyes are able to behold and penetrate déepeſt into al that haue paſſed in this Eſtate. Ye wot what iudgement the King hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the authors of theſe miſeries, what in your eares he hath declared and pronounced them to be: He required your aſſiſtance againſt them as againſt publicke enemies, and that at ſuch time as his will was perfect and free, before violence had wonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at his hands. Whatſoeuer alteration hath ſince fallen out I know you will impute, not to his wil, but vnto force. And in deede I am not ignorant that ſone after being required to furniſh the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this warre you could well aunſwer that theſe troubles were neuer begon by your aduice, and that they that had begon them were to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charges, and not you: which was ſuch an aunſwer as you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make in matter concerning the ſeruice of the King or wealth of the Realme. For in ſuch reſpect
<pb facs="tcp:13948:11"/>
neuer were ſubiects more liberall then you? But vndoubtedly when you perceiue that your money goeth not to the reparations, as aforetime you haue bene perſwaded, but to the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Realm: when you clerely ſee that they requeſt not your Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles to ſupply the raunſome of King Frances or his children, or of a King Iohn, but rather to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the bloud and poſteritie of France, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your King to bondage and priſon. I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that the King hath liked of you therfore, and all good Frenchmen are therein bound vnto you, and eſpecially my ſelfe in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> degree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath ordeyned me in this Realme and for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſith it hath ſo pleaſed him) of the houſhold chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Iudge what neede you had of this warre: you knowe that this Eſtate daylie waxed capable more and more of peace. If any thing were to be altered in matter of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there needed no more (without any innouation) but the ſummons of a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile: If in the gouernment of the Eſtate, the King would not haue refuſed the ouerture of an aſſembly of the Eſtates. And for preuenting theſe miſchiefes, you knowe that by expreſſe declaration I haue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my ſelfe euen by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat to determine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe perturbers could perticulerly pretend againſt me. Thoſe therefore that refuſe ſuch good meanes are authors of the warre, and of an vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and therefore an vniuſt warre. I who haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the ſame and voluntarily therto ſubmitted my ſelfe doe finde my ſelfe diſcharged of whatſoeuer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
<pb facs="tcp:13948:11"/>
may enſue, for from lawfull meanes they haue taken pleaſure to driue me into extreme extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wherby the armes that I haue taken in hand are naturall and neceſſarie and ſo moſt iuſt. To bee briefe, compare my obedience with their rebellion, my patience with their raſh haſtineſſe, my modeſt dealings with their immodeſt paſſions, and with all this, waye with your ſelues what they are in this Realme and what I am, ſo will you conclude that they do me ſo extreme iniurie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Realme but would enforce himſelf, and to whome it were not lawfull to haue reuenge. I ſpeake this in trueth and doe conceiue the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences hereof, I ſee the innocent muſt beare it, but ſtill haue in your mindes that my enemies are thoſe that haue bene declared enemies to the King &amp; the Realme, that they haue troubled the quiet peace, called in ſtraungers, procured the rooting out of the houſhold ſeruaunts, borrowed the enemies and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their meanes, not to my deſtruction onely, but to the confuſion of the whole Eſtate. Then wil you, my Maiſters, impute to their offences all ſuch inconueniences as a iuſt defence may bring in: you will con them ſmall thanckes for the enſuing cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, like as you confeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authors and cauſers of the firſt: for my ſelfe I ſhall be ſorie for my owne miſhap that I ſhall not be able to put away the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall miſchiefe without ſome miſchiefes. At the leaſt I ſhall reioyce in my owne integritie who would haue redemed them euen with my life, which
<pb facs="tcp:13948:12"/>
euermore I ſhall accoumpt wel beſtowed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of this Eſtate and of you all. Now, my Maiſters, to conclude, I will ſay vnto you, that of you I doe and ſtill will attende whatſoeuer maye and ought to be looked for of true Frenchmen, and of the rule and example of the French nation, and of me likewiſe expect whatſoeuer may or ought of a French and Chriſtian Prince be expected concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vnion of the Church, the King my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes ſeruice, the welth of the Realme, the reliefe of the people, and the contentation of all good men.
