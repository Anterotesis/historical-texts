         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And is it fit this populous Nation ſhould be led in matters of Faith, by ſuch unſettled, jealous-pated Weather-cocks, as know not their own minds, and can ſtand ſtedfaſt to nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but objecting againſt their own Overtures, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for Oſtentation, Vain-glory, and to look Big, the ſureſt and beſt Propoſals, which God hath laid before us for the Kingdoms Peace? as <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> deſired to be reputed famous, by burning that wonderful Church which he himſelf had built. Is your Intellectual Glaſs a falſifying Perſpective? Or is the other end turned to your Eye? Is the great <hi>Objectum Attributionis,</hi> the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Popery,</hi> and Preſervation of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> turn'd to a <hi>Neceſſarium ſecundum quid?</hi> Is the Worthy, Valiant, Victorious, and Triumphant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Cannot the Religious <hi>Orange</hi> down with you, nor reliſh your ſqueamiſh and liquoriſh Appetites and Stomachs now, without a Dram of the Whore's Abominable Cup? Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide Conſcience and Religion, with his Royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, Bare common Civility might prompt you to be more than thankful to ſo Worthy a Perſon, whoſe very Behaviour, Parts, Prudence, ſober Life and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, have extorted Love, Duty and Reſpect, from his greateſt Enemies, and ſtrangers of greater repute than Men of your Birth and mean Pedegree. But <hi>Nihil dat alteri, quod in ſe not habet.</hi> And as it was ſaid of the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, beggarly Pope, <hi>Urban</hi> VI. <hi>Aſperious miſero nihil eſt, qui ſurgit in altum;</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of you. <hi>Corde ſtat inflato pauper honore dato.

Pope <hi>Julius</hi> III. was (as ſome of you were) promoted, <hi>a Rhemo ad Tribunal;</hi> and yet, as all Hiſtorians Record, he was the greateſt of Tyrants, and more imperious than any of his Anceſtors. Yea, it is reported by <hi>John Functius,</hi> in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, that in ſeven years ſpace, he was the occaſion of the Murdering 200000 Chriſtians. You trace his foot-ſteps, threatning the Nation with Diviſion and Civil War, which (as our Saviour ſaith) is the ſureſt means to over-throw both us and our Religion; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch a dangerous time as this. But it is a Country Proverb, <hi>Dogs make Swine agree:</hi> The Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble let looſe would be a good Scar-crow, to frighten ſuch black Birds of prey to their right ſenſes, and to know themſelves; and not preſume to tranſgreſs their Limits, nor elevate their Judgments above the low Sphere of their ſhallow Capacities. But why ſhould <hi>Paſſion</hi> eclipſe <hi>Reaſon?</hi> What can we expect but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Order, when by an Hyperbolick <hi>Hyſteron-Proteron,</hi> the heels of the Nation are ſet upmoſt. And, to ſpeak as freely as you act, ſeveral of you are fitter for the <hi>Plough</hi> than a Houſe of <hi>Peers.</hi> Neither is this more than hath been foretold by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the latter days, ſhould be ſeducing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, Men carnally minded, and deſtitute of the Spirit, Wells without Water, Clouds carried about with every Tempeſt, Wandring Stars of Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy, heedy, high-minded, covetous, not feeding, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring both Flock and Paſture, following the way of</hi> Balaam, <hi>who loved the wages of Unrighteouſneſs, and the Praiſe of Men, more than the Glory of the inviſible God.</hi> And truly, your pride makes it evident, that you have no leſs Ambition for Superiority, than <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> had for Supremacy.
