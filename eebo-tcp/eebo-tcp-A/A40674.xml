            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho is not sensible with sorrow of the distractions of this age? To write books therefore may seem unseasonable, especially in a time wherein the <hi>Presse,</hi> like an unruly horse, hath cast off his bridle of being <hi>Licensed,</hi> and some serious books, which dare flie abroad, are hooted at by a flock of Pamphlets.</p>
                  <p>But be pleased to know that when I left my home, it was fair weather, and my journey was half past, before I discovered the tempest, and had gone so farre in this Work, that I could neither go backward with credit, nor forward with comfort.</p>
                  <p>As for the matter of this Book, therein I am resident on my Profession; Holinesse in the latitude thereof falling under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanse of a Divine. For curious method, expect none, Essays for the most part not being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as at a <hi>Feast,</hi> but placing themselves as at an <hi>Ordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The characters I have conformed to the then
<pb facs="tcp:65716:5"/>
standing Laws of the Realm, (a twelvemoneth agoe were they sent to the presse) since which time the wisdome of the King and State hath thought fitting to alter many things, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the discretion of the Reader should make his alterations accordingly. And I conjure thee by all Christian ingenuity, that if light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here on some passages, rather harsh-sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ill-intended, to construe the same by the generall drift and main scope which is aimed at.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it render the modestie of this Book suspected, because it presumes to appear in company unmann'd by any Patron: If right, it will defend it self; if wrong, none can defend it: Truth needs not, falshood deserves not a Supporter. And indeed the matter of this Work is too high for a subjects, the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereof too low for a Princes patronage.</p>
                  <p>And now I will turn my pen into prayer, That God would be pleased to discloud these gloomy dayes with the beams of his mercie: which if I may be so happy as to see, it will then encourage me to count it freedome to serve two apprentiships (God spinning out the thick thred of my life so long) in writing the Ecclesiasticall History from Christs time to our dayes, if I shall from remoter parts be so planted, as to enjoy the benefit of walking, and standing Libraries, without which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb facs="tcp:65716:5"/>
the best vigilancie doth but vainly dream to undertake such a task.</p>
                  <p>Mean time I will stop the leakage of my soul, and what heretofore hath run out in writing, shall hereafter (God willing) be improved in constant preaching, in what place soever Gods providence, and friends good will shall fix</p>

                     <p>MONICA is better known by the branch of her issue, then root of her parentage, and was born in or nigh Tagasta in Africk. <note n="*" place="margin">

She instructed her with holy severity, never
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65716:9"/>
allowing her to drink wine, or between meals. Having out-grown her tuition, she began by degrees to sip, and drink wine, lesser draughts like wedges widening her throat for greater, till at last (ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes being not knockt, but insensibly scru'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our souls) she could fetch off her whole ones. Now it happened that a young maid (formerly her partner in potting) fell at variance with her, and (as malice when she shoots draws her arrow to the head) called her Tos-pot, and drunkard; whereupon Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca reformed her self, and turned temperate. Thus bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taunts sometime make wholesome Physick, when God sanctifies unto us the malice of our enemies to perform the office of good will.</p>
                     <p>After this was she married to Patricius, one of more honour then wealth, and as yet a pagan; wherein she brake S. Pauls precept, <hi>To marry onely in the Lord.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance then there was a dearth of husbands, or she did it by her parents importunity, or out of promise of his conversion: and the history herein being but lamely delivered us, it is charity to support it with the most favourable construction. He was of a stern na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none more lamb when pleased, or lion when angry; and which is worse, his wild <note n="*" place="margin">

Not like those wives who by their hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous outcries drive their wandring husbands farther out of the way.</p>
                     <p>Her own house was to her a house of correction, wherein her husbands mother was bitter unto her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a quarrell not so much to her person as relation, because a daughter in law. Her servants, to climbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the favour of their old mistresse, trampled on their young, they bringing tales, and the old woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; though the teeth of their malice did but file her innocency the brighter. Yea at last her mother in law, turning her compurgatour, caused her sonne to punish
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65716:10"/>
those maids which causelesly had wronged their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.</p>
                     <p>When her neighbours, which had husbands of far milder dispositions, would shew her their husbands cruelty legible in their faces, all her pitying was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them: and whereas they expected to be praysed for their patience, she condemned them for deserving such punishment. She never had blow from, or jarre with her husband, she so suppled his hard nature with her obedience, and to her great comfort saw him converted to Christianity before his death. Also she saw Augustine her sonne, formerly vitious in life, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in doctrine (whose soul she bathd in her Tears) become a worthy Christian, who coming to have his eares tickled, had his heart touched, and got Religion in to boot with the eloquence of S. Ambrose. She survived not long after her sonnes conversion (God sends his servants to bed when they have done their work) and her candle was put out, as soon as the day did dawn in S. Augustine.</p>
                     <p>Take an instance or two of her signall piety. There was a custome in <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>August. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> Africk to bring pulse bread and wine to the monuments of dead Saints, wherein Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica was as forward as any. But being better instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this custome was of heathenish parentage, and that Religion was not so poore as to borrow rites from Pagans, she instantly left off that ceremony: and as for pietie's sake she had done it thus long, so for pietie's sake she would do it no longer. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old folks now adayes, whose best argument is use, would have flown in their faces, who should stop them in the full career of an ancient custome.</p>
                     <p>There was one Licentius a novice-convert, who had got these words by the end, <hi>Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: show us the light of thy countenance and we shall be whole.</hi> And (as it is the fashion of many mens tongues to echo forth the last sentence they learnt) he said it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65716:10"/>
in all places he went to. But Monica, over-hearing him to sing it in the house of office, was <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>August. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De ordine, c.</hi> 8.</note> highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him: because holy things are to be suted to holy places; and the harmonie could not be sweet where the song did jarre with the place. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some may say, that a gracious heart consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth every place into a Chapell; yet sure though pious things are no where unfitting to be thought on, they may somewhere be improper to be uttered.</p>
                     <p>Drawing near her death, she sent most pious thoughts as harbingers to heaven, and her soul saw a glimpse of happinesse through the chincks of her sicknesse-broken body. She was so inflamed with zeal, that she turned all objects into fewell to feed it. One day standing with S. Augustine at an East-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>August. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> she raised her self to consider the light of Gods presence, in respect whereof all corporall light is so farre from being match'd, it deserves not to be mentioned. Thus mounted on heavenly meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and from that high pitch surveying earthly things, the great distance made them appear unto her like a little point, scarce to be seen, and lesse to be respected.</p>
                     <p>She died at Ostia in Italy in the fiftie sixth yeare of her age, Augustine closing her eyes, when through grief he had scarce any himself.</p>

                     <p>I Intend not to range over all his life as he stands threesquare in relation, Husband, Father, Master. We will onely survey and measure his conjugall side, which respecteth his wife.</p>
                     <p>We reade not that ever he upbraided her for her barrennesse, as knowing that naturall defects are not the creatures fault, but the Creatours pleasure: all which time his love was loyall to her alone. As for his going in to Hagar, it was done not onely with the consent but by the advice of Sarah, who was so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of children she would be made a mother by a proxie. He was not jealous of her (though a grand beauty) in what company soever he came. Indeed he feared the Egyptians, because the Egyptians feared not God; suspecting rather them of force, then her of falsenesse, and beleeving that sooner they might kill him, then corrupt her.</p>
                     <p>Yet (as well as he loved her) he expected she should do work fit for her calling. <hi>Make ready quickly three measures of meal and knead it.</hi> Well may Sarah be cook, where Abraham was caterer, yea where God was guest. The print of her fingers still remain in the meal, and of crumbling dow she hath made a lasting monument of her good houswifry.</p>
                     <p>Being falsely indited by his wife, he never travers'd the bill, but compounded with her on her own terms. The case this. Hagar being with child by Abraham, her pride sweld with her belly, and despiseth her mistresse: Sarah, laying her action wrong, sues Abraham for her maids fault, and appeals to God. I see the Plaintiff hath not alwayes the best cause; nor are they most guilty which are most blamed. However Abraham passes by her peevishnesse, and remits his maid to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65716:12"/>
stand or fall to her own mistresse. Though he had a great part in Hagar, he would have none in Hagars re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bellion. Masters which protect their faulty servants hinder the proceeding of justice in a family.</p>
                     <p>He did denie himself to grant his wives will in a matter of great consequence. Sarah desired, <hi>Cast out this bondwoman and her sonne.</hi> Oh hard word! She might as well have said, Cast out of thy self nature and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection. See how Abraham struggles with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, the Father in him striving with the Husband in him, till God moderated with his casting-voyce, and Abraham was contented to hearken to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of his wife.</p>
                     <p>Being to sacrifice Isaac, we find not that he made Sarah privie to his project. To tell her, had been to torture her, fearing her affections might be too strong for her faith. Some secrets are to be kept from the weaker sex; not alwayes out of a distrust, lest they hurt the counsel by telling it, but lest the counsel hurt them by keeping it.</p>
                     <p>The dearest Husband cannot bail his wife when death arrests her. Sarah dies, and Abraham weeps. Tears are a tribute due to the dead. 'Tis fitting that the body when it's sown in corruption should be watered by those that plant it in the earth. The Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites make him a fair offer, <hi>In the chiefest of our sepulchres bury thy dead</hi>: But he thinks the best of them too bad for his Sarah. Her chast ashes did love to lie alone; he provides her a virgin tombe in the cave of Machpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, where her corps sweetly sleep till he himself came to bed to her, and was buried in the same grave.</p>

                        <hi>but doeth it.</hi> Hence it is that simple servants (understand such whose capacity is bare measure, without surplusage equall to the busines he is used in) are more usefull, because more manageable, then abler men, especially in matters wherein not their brains but hands are required. Yet if his Master out of want of experience injoyns him to do what is hurtfull, and prejudiciall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65716:17"/>
to his own estate, duty herein makes him undutifull (if not to deny, to demurre in his performance) and chusing rather to displease then hurt his master, he humbly represents his reasons to the contrary.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ELiezer was Steward of Abrahams houshold, Lieutenant generall over the army of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ruler over all his Master had: the confidence in his loyalty, causing the largenesse of his commission.</p>
                     <p>But as for those who make him the founder of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus, on no other evidence but because he is called <hi>Eliezer of Damascus,</hi> they build a great city on too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a foundation. It argues his goodnesse that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, if dying without a sonne, intended him his heir (a kinsman in grace is nearest by the surest side) till Isaac stepping in stopt out Eliezer, and reverst those resolutions.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture presents us with a remarkable presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>That the namelesse, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Gen.</hi> 24 <hi>was this Eliezer Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams steward, is the opinion of Luther in his comment on that chapter, Rivet on the same,</hi> Exercit. 111. <hi>with many others.</hi>
                        </note> his piety, in a matter of great moment: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, being to send him into Mesopotamia, caused him to swear that he would faithfully fetch Isaac a wife from his own kinred. Eliezer demurr'd awhile before he would swear, carefully surveying the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the oath, lest some unseen ambushes therein should surprise his conscience. The most scrupulous to take an oath will be the most carefull to perform it, whereas those that swear it blindly will do it lamely. He objects, <hi>Peradventure the woman will not be willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi> At last being satisfied in this quaere, he takes the oath: as no honest man which means to pay, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give his bond if lawfully required.</p>
                     <p>He takes ten camells (then the coaches of the East-countrey) with servants and all things in good equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, to shew a sample of his Masters greatnesse; and being a stranger in the countrey asked direction of him who best knew the way, God himself. If any object that his craving of a signe was a signe of infidelity, and unmannerly boldnesse to confine God to particulars;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65716:18"/>
yet perchance Gods spirit prompted him to make the request, who sometimes moves men to ask what he is minded to give, and his petition seemeth just because granted.</p>
                     <p>Rebecca meets him at the well. The lines drawn from every part of the signe required centre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in her. <hi>Drink my Lord,</hi> said she, <hi>and I will draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thy camells.</hi> Her words Prophesie that she will be a good housewife, and a good housekeeper. Eliezers eyes are dazeled with the beams of Gods providence: Her drawing of water drew more wonder from him; and the more he drinks of her pitcher, the more he is athirst to know the issue of the matter. He questions her of her parentage, and finds all his mysticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation historically expounded in her. Then he bowed down his head, and did homage to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, blessing him for his protection. Many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which God giveth us ravell out for want of hemming, through our own unthankfulnesse: for though prayer purchaseth blessings, giving praise doth keep the quiet possession of them.</p>
                     <p>Being come into the house, his first care is for his cattell, whose dumbenesse is oratory to a conscientio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In delivering his message, first he reads his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, I am Abrahams servant; then he reports the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Masters wealth without any hyperboles. How many, employed in such a matter, would have made mountains of gold of molehills of silver? not so Eliezer, reporting the bare truth; and a good estate if told, commends it self. As plain also is his narration of the passages of Gods providence, the artificialnesse whereof best appeard in his naturall relation. Then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65716:19"/>
concludes he, with desiring a direct answer to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The matter was soon transacted betwixt them; for seeing that heaven did ask the banes, why should earth forbid them? onely her friends desire Rebecca should stay ten dayes with them, which Eliezer would not yield to. He would speedily finish that bargain whereof God had given the happy earnest; and because blest hitherto, make more haste hereafter. If in a dark businesse we perceive God to guide us by the lantern of his providence, it is good to follow the light close, lest we lose it by our lagging behind. He will not truant it now in the afternoon, but with convenient speed returns to Abraham, who onely was worthy of such a Servant, who onely was worthy of such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>

                     <p>WHat? (will some say) having a wood of widows of upright conversation, must you needs gather one crooked with superstition to be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to all the rest? must Paula be their president? whose life was a very masse-book, so that if every point of popery were lost, they might be found in her practice.</p>
                     <p>Nothing lesse. Indeed Paula lived in an age which was, as I may say, in the knuckle and bending betwixt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65716:21"/>
the primitive times and superstition, popery being then a hatching, but farre from being fledg'd. Yea no Papist (though picking out here and there some passages which make to his purpose) will make her practice in grosse the square of his own: for where she embraces some superstitions with her left hand, she thrusts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more with her right. I have therefore principally made choice to write her life, that I may acquaint both my self and the reader with the garb of that age in Church-matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein were many remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, otherwise I might and would have taken a farre fitter example.</p>
                     <p>I know two trades together are too much for one man to thrive upon, and too much it is for me to be an Historian and a Critick, to relate and to judge: yet since Paula, though a gratious woman, was guilty of some great errours, give me leave to hold a pencil in one hand, and a spunge in the other, both to draw her life and dash it where it is faultie. And let us that live in purer times be thankfull to God for our light, and use our quicker sight to guide our feet in Gods paths, lest we reel from one extremitie to another.</p>
                     <p>To come to the Lady Paula's birth: the Noblest blood in the world by a confluence ran in her veins. I must confesse the most Ancient Nobilitie is junior to no Nobilitie, when all men were equall. Yet give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leave to see Moses his face to shine, when he knew it not himself; and seeing Paula was pleased not to know, but to neglect and trample on her high birth, we are bound to take notice thereof. She was descended from <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hieron. Epist. ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoch. pag.</hi> 185.</note> Agamemnon, Scipio, and the Gracchi's, and her husband Toxotius from <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Idem in eadem epist. p.</hi> 172.</note> Aeneas, and the Julian familie; so that in their marriage the warres of the Grecians and Trojanes were reconciled.</p>
                     <p>Some years they lived together in the Citie of Rome, in holy and happy wedlock, and to her husband she bare foure daughters, Blesilla, Paulina, Eustochium, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65716:21"/>
Ruffina. Yet still her husband long'd for posteritie, like those who are so covetous of a male heir, they count none children but sonnes: and at last God, who keeps the best for the close, bestowed Toxotius, a young sonne upon her.</p>
                     <p>But commonly after a great blessing comes a great crosse: scarce was she made a mother to a sonne, when she was made a widow, which to her was a great and grievous affliction. But as a rubbe to an overthrown bowl proves an help by hindering it; so afflictions bring the souls of Gods Saints to the mark, which otherwise would be gone and transported with too much earthly happinesse. However Paula grieved lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lesse then excessively hereat, she being a woman that in all her actions (to be sure to do enough) made alwayes measure with advantage.</p>
                     <p>Yet in time she overcame her sorrow, herein being assisted by the counsel and comfort of S. Hierome, whose constant frequenting of her, commented upon by his enemies malice (which will pry narrowly and talk broadly) gave occasion to the report, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with her for dishonest intents. Surely if the accusations of slanderous tongues be proofs, the primitive times had no Churches but stews. It is to be suspected that <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65716:22"/>
congregating Synods still resided in the Emperour.) Hither came Paulinus Bishop of Antioch, and Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Bishop of Salamine in Cyprus, who lodged at the Lady Paula's, and his virtues so wrought upon her, that she determined to leave her native countrey, and to travel into the East, and in Judea to spend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her life. The reasons that moved her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, was because Rome was a place of riot and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, her soul being almost stifled with the frequencie of Ladyes visits; and she feared courtesie in her would justle out piety, she being fain to crowd up her devotions to make room for civill entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Besides, of her own nature she ever loved privacie and a sequestred life, being of the Pelicans nature, which use not to flie in flocks. Lastly, she conceived that the sight of those holy places would be the best comment on the History of the Bible, and fasten the passages thereof in her mind. Wherefore she intended to survey all Palestine, and at last to go to Bethlehem, making Christs inne her home, and to die there where he was born, leaving three of her daughters, and her poore infant Toxotius behind her.</p>
                     <p>For mine own part, I think she had done as accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a deed to God, in staying behind to rock her child in the cradle, as to visit Christs manger, seeing Grace doth not cut of the affections of nature but ripen them: the rather, because Christianity is not naild to Christs crosse and mount Calvary, nor Piety fastned (as we may say) to the freehold of the land of Palestine. But if any Papist make her a pattern for pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, let them remember that she went from Rome: and was it not an unnaturall motion in her to move from that centre of Sanctitie?</p>
                     <p>She with her daughter Eustochium began her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and taking Cyprus in her way, where she visited Epiphanius, she came at last to Judea. She measured
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65716:22"/>
that countrey with her travelling, and drew the truest mappe thereof with her own feet, so accurately that she left out no particular place of importance. At last she was fixed at Bethlehem, where she built one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie for men, and three for women. It will be worth our pains to take notice of some principall of the orders she made in those feminine Academies; because Paula's practice herein was a leading case, though those that came after her went beyond her. For in the rules of monasticall life, Paula stood at the head game, and the Papists in after ages, desirous to better her hand, drew themselves quite out.</p>
                     <p>Each monasterie had a chief matrone, whilst Paula was Principall over all. These societies were severd at their meat and work, but met together at their prayers: they were carefully kept apart from men, not like those Epicoene monasteries not long since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Joan Queen of Sweden, wherein men and women lived under one roof, not to speak of worse libertines. Well were Nunnes called <hi>Recluses,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true meaning of the word signifie those which are set wide open, or left at libertie, though that Barbarous age mistook the sense of the word, for such as were shut up, and might not stirre out of their <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>They used to sing Halelujah, which serv'd them both for a psalm, and a bell to call them all together. In the <note n="*" place="margin">Mane, horâ tertiâ, sextâ, nonâ, vesperi. <hi>Hieron. in praefat.

                        </note> morning, at nine a clock, at noon, at three a clock in the afternoon, and at night they had prayers, and sang the psalmes in order. This I believe gave originall to canonicall houres. The Apostles precept is the plain song, <hi>Pray continually</hi>; and thus mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions ran their descants upon it, and confin'd it to certain houres. A practice in it self not so bad for those who have leisure to observe it, save that when devotion is thus artificially plaited into houres it may take up mens minds in formalities to neglect the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65716:23"/>They rose also at midnight to sing psalmes. A custome begun before in the time of persecution, when the Christians were forced to be Antipodes to other men, so that when it was night with others, it was day with them, and they then began their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. These night-prayers, begun in necessitie, were continued in Paula's time in gratefull remembrance, and since corrupted with superstition: the best is, their rising at midnight breaks none of our sleep.</p>
                     <p>These virgins did every day learn some part of the holy Scriptures; whereas those Nunnes which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to succeed them learn onely with post-horses to run over the stage of their beads (so many Ave Maries, and Pater nosters) and are ignorant in all the Scripture besides. Such as were faultie, she caused to take their meat apart from others at the entrance of the dining-room; with which mild severitie she reclaimed many: shame in ingenuous natures making a deeper impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then pain. Mean time I find amongst them no vow of virginitie, no tyrannicall Penance, no whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themselves; as if not content to interre their sinnes in Christs grave, they had rather bury them in furrows digg'd in their own backs. They wrought hard to get their living, and on the Lords day alone went out of their monasterie to hear Gods word.</p>
                     <p>Yet was she more rigid and severe towards her self, then to any of them, macerating her body with fasting, and refusing to drink any wine, when advised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Physicians for her health. So that (as an <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Bernard. devot. devotis</hi>
                        </note> holy man complained of himself, whilest he went about to subdue an enemie he kild a subject) she overturned the state of her bodie, and whilest she thought to snuff the candle put it quite out. Yea S. Hierome himself, what his Eloquence herein doth commend in her, his Charity doth excuse, and his Judgement doth <note n="*" place="margin">Haec refero, non quòd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideranter &amp; ultra vires sumta onera probem, <hi>p.</hi> 181.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. But we must Charitably believe that these her fastings proceeded out of true humiliation and sorrow
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65716:23"/>
for her sinnes; otherwise where opinion of merit is annexed to them, they are good onely to fill the body with wind, and the soul with pride. Certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Popish self-penance is will-worship, and the purest Epicurisme, wherein pain is pleasant: for as long as people impose it on themselves, they do not deny their own will, but fulfill it; and whilst they beat down the body they may puff up the flesh.</p>
                     <p>Nor can her immoderate bounty be excused, who gave all and more then all away, taking up money at interest to give to the poore, and leaving Eustochium her daughter deep in debt, a great charge, and nothing to maintain it. Sure none need be more bountifull in giving then the Sunne is in shining, which though freely bestowing his beams on the world keeps not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the body of light to himself. Yea it is necessary that Liberality should as well have banks as a stream.</p>
                     <p>She was an excellent text-woman, yea could say the holy Scriptures by heart, and attained to understand and speak the Hebrew tongue, a language which Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome himself got with great difficultie, and kept with constant use (skill in Hebrew will quickly go out, and burn no longer then 'tis blown) yet she in her old age did speedily learn it. She diligently heard Hierome expounding the old and new Testament, asking him many doubts, and Quaeres in difficult places (such constant scouring makes our knowledge brighter) and would not suffer his judgement to stand neuter in hard points, but made him expresse the probable opinion.</p>
                     <p>Most naturally flie from death; Gods Saints stand still till death comes to them; Paula went out to meet it, not to say, call'd death unto her by consuming her self in fasting: she died in the fiftie sixth yeare of her age, and was solemnly buried in Bethlehem. People of all countreys flockt to her funerall: Bishops carried her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65716:24"/>
corps to the grave: others carried torches and lamps before it, which though some may condemne to be but burning of day was no more then needed, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in a cave or grot as an <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>G. Sandys Travells, pag.</hi> 179.</note> eyewitnesse doth testifie. Psalmes were sung at her buriall in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Latine, and Syriack tongue, it being fit there should be a key for every lock, and languages to be understood by all the miscelany company there present.</p>
                     <p>Eustochium her daughter had little comfort to be Executrix or Administratrix unto her, leaving her not a pennie of monie, great debts, and many brothers and sisters to provide for, <hi>quos sustentare arduum, abjicere impium.</hi> I like not this charitie rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when it begins farre off &amp; neglects those at home.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I can do her memorie no better right, then to confesse she was wrong in somethings. Yet surely Gods Glory was the mark she shot at, though herein the hand of her practice did sometimes shake, and oftener the eye of her judgement did take wrong aim.</p>

                     <p>IS one who hath made a resolution with herself to live chaste, and unmarryed. Now there is a grand difference betwixt a Resolution and a Vow. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is a covenant drawn up betwixt the party and herself; and commonly runs with this clause, <hi>durante nostro beneplacito,</hi> as long as we shall think fitting; and therefore on just occasion she may give a release to herself. But in a vow God is interested as the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, so that except he be pleased to give up the band, none can give an acquittance to themselves. Being now to describe the Virgin, let the reader know that virginity belongs to both sexes; and though in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65716:24"/>
we make our Maid a female, let not my pen be chalenged of improprietie, if casually sometimes it light on the Masculine Gender.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She chooseth not a single life solely for its self,</hi>

                        <hi>but in reference to the better serving of God.</hi> I know none but beggars that desire the Church-Porch to lye in, which others onely use as a passage into the Church. Virginity is none of those things to be desired in and for it self, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it leads a more convenient way to the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, especially in time of persecution. For then if Christians be forced to run races for their lives, the unmarryed have the advantage, lighter by many ounces, and freed from much encumbrance, which the married are subject to; who, though private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, herein are like Princes, they must have their train follow them.</p>
                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">2</note> Housekeepers cannot so exactly mark all their family-affairs, but that sometimes their ranks will be broken; which disorder by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will disturb their duties of pietie, to make them contracted, omitted; or unseasonably performed. The Apostle saith, <hi>Such shall have troubles in the flesh</hi>; and grant them sanctified troubles, yet even Holy-thistle and Sweet-brier have their prickles. But the Virgin is freed from these encumbrances. No lording Husband shall at the same time command her presence and distance, to be alwayes near in constant attendance, and alwayes to stand aloof off in an awfull obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; so that providing his break-fast hazards her soul to fast a meal of morning prayer: No crying Children shall drown her singing of psalmes, and put her devotion out of tune: No unfaithfull Servants shall force her to divide her eyes betwixt lifting them up to God and casting them down to oversee their work; but making her Closet her Chappell, she freely enjoyeth God and good thoughts at what time she pleaseth.</p>

                        <hi>Yet in all her discourse she maketh an honourable mention of marriage.</hi> And good reason that virginity should pay a chief rent of honour unto it, as acknowledging her selfe to be a <hi>colonia deducta</hi> from it. Unworthy is the practice of those who in their discourse plant all their arguments point-blank to batter down the married estate, bitterly inveighing against it; yea base is the behaviour of some young men, who can speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Satyres against Gods ordinance of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the whole sex of women. This they do either out of deep dissimulation, to divert supicion, that they may prey the farthest from their holes; or else they do it out of revenge: having themselves former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lighted on bad women (yet no worse then they deserved) they curse all adventures because of their own shipwrack; or lastly they do it out of mere spight to nature and God himself: and pity it is but that their fathers had been of the same opinion. Yet it may be tolerable if onely in harmlesse mirth they chance to bestow a jest upon the follyes of married people. Thus when a Gentlewoman told an ancient Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour who lookd very young, that she thought he had eaten a snake; <hi>No mistris</hi> (said he) <hi>it is because I never meddled with any snakes which maketh me look so young.</hi>

                        <hi>She counts her self better lost in a modest silence then found in a bold discourse.</hi> Divinity permits not women to speak in the Church; morality forbids maids to talk in the House, where their betters are present. She is farre from the humours of those, who (more bridling in their chinnes then their tongues) love in their constant prating to make sweet musick to their own ears, and harsh jarring to all the rest of the company: yea as some report of sheep, that when they runne they are afraid of the noise of their own feet; so our Virgin is afraid to heare her own tongue runne in the presence of graver persons. She conceives the bold maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any argument concludes against her own civil
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65716:25"/>
behaviour; and yet she will give a good account of any thing whereof she is questioned, sufficient to shew her silence is her choice, not her refuge. In speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she studiously avoids all suspicious expressions, which wanton apprehensions may colourably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into obscenity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She blusheth at the wanton discourse of others in her company.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5</note> As fearing that being in the presence where treason against modesty is spoken, all in the place will be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for principalls: yea if silent, she is afraid to be taken to consent; if offering to confute it, she fears lest by stirring a dunghill, the savour may be more noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. Wherefore that she may not suffer in her title to modesty, to preserve her right she enters a silent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat by a blush in her cheeks, and embraceth the next opportunity to get a gaole-delivery out of that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where she was detained in durance. Now because we have mentioned Blushing, which is so frequent with virgins that it is called <hi>a maidens blush,</hi> (as if they alone had a patent to die this colour) give us leave a little to enlarge our selves on this subject.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 <hi>Blushing oftentimes proceeds from guiltines;</hi> when the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender being pursued after seeks as it were to hide himself under the visard of a new face.</item>
                        <item>2 <hi>Blushing is othertimes rather a compurgatour then an accuser</hi>; not arising from guiltinesse in our Virgin, but from one of these reasons: First because she is surprised with a sudden accusation, and though armed with innocency, that she cannot be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet may she be amazed with so unexpected a charge. Secondly from sensiblenesse of disgrace, ashamed, though innocent, to be within the suspicion of such faults, and that she hath carried her self so that any tongue durst be so impudent as to lay it to her charge. Thirdly from a disability to acquit her self at the instant (her integrity wanting rather clearing then clearnesse) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65716:26"/>
she wants boldnesse to traverse the action, and so non-suiting her self, she fears her cause will suffer in the judgements of all that be present: and although accused but in jest, she is jealous the accusation will be believed in earnest; and edg'd tools thrown in merriment may wound reputations. Fourthly out of mere anger: for as in fear the blood makes not an orderly retreat but a confused flight to the heart; so in blushing the blood sallies out into our Virgins cheeks, and seems as a champion to challenge the accuser for wronging her.</item>
                        <item>3 <hi>Where small faults are committed blushing obtaines a pardon of course with ingenuous beholders.</hi> As if she be guilty of casuall incivilities, or soloecismes in manners occasioned by invincible ignorance, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mistakes, in such a case blushing is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent penance to restore her to her state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie.</item>

                     </head>
                     <p>HIldegardis was born in Germany, in the County of Spanheim, in the yeare 1098. So that she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in an age which we may call the first cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the midnight of Ignorance and Superstition.</p>
                     <p>Her parents (Hidebert, and Mechtilda) dedicated her to God from her infancie: And surely those whose Childhood, with Hildegardis, hath had the advantage of pious education may be said to have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65716:27"/>
been good time out of mind, as not able to remember the beginning of their own goodnesse. At eight years of age she became a Nunne under S. Jutta sister to Megenhard, Earl of Spanheim, and afterwards she was made Abbesse of S. Ruperts Nunnery in Bingen on Rhene in the Palatinate.</p>
                     <p>Men commonly do beat and bruise their links be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they light them, to make them burn the brighter: God first humbles and afflicts whom he intends to illuminate with more then ordinary grace. Poore Hildegardis was constantly and continually sick, and so <note n="*" place="margin">Fuerunt ei ab ipsa penè infantia cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri ac ferè continui lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guorum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lores, ità ut pedum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessu petraro uteretur, <hi>Theod. Abbas in vita Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardis, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> weak that she very seldome was strong enough to go. But God who denied her legs, gave her wings, and raised her high-mounted soul in Visions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</p>
                     <p>I know a generall scandall is cast on Revelations in this ignorant age: first, because many therein intitled the Meteors of their own brain to be Starres at least, and afterwards their Revelations have been revealed to be forgeries: secondly, because that night-raven did change his black feathers into the silver wings of a dove, and transforming himself into an Angel of light deluded many with strange raptures and visions, though in their nature farre different from those in the Bible. For S. Paul in his Revelations was caught up into the third heaven; whereas most Monks with a contrary motion were carried into hell and purgatorie, and there saw apparitions of strange tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Also S. Johns Revelation forbids all additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Bible, under heavie penalties; their visions are commonly on purpose to piece out the Scripture, and to establish such superstitions as have no footing in Gods word.</p>
                     <p>However all held Hildegardis for a Prophet, being induced thereunto by the piety of her life: no breck was ever found in her veil, so spotlesse was her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; by the sanctity of her writings, and by the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65716:28"/>
generall approbation the Church gave unto her. For Pope Eugenius the third, after exact examination of the matter, did in the Councell of Trevers (wherein S. Bernard was present) allow and priviledge her Revelations for authenticall. She was of the Popes Conclave, and Emperours Counsel, to whom they had recourse in difficulties: yea the greatest torches of the Church lighted themselves at her candle. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triach of Jerusalem, the Bishops of Mentz, Colen, Breme, Trevers sent such knots as posed their own fingers to our Hildegardis to untie.</p>
                     <p>She never learn'd word of Latine; and yet <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Trithemius de Scriptor. Eccles. fol.</hi> 92.</note> therein would she fluently expresse her Revelations to those notaries that took them from her mouth; so that throwing words at randome she never brake Priscian's head: as if the Latine had learn'd to make it self true without the speakers care. And no doubt, he that brought the single parties to her married them also in her mouth, so that the same Spirit which furnished her with Latine words, made also the true Syntaxis. Let none object that her very writing of fifty eight Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on the Gospel is false construction, where the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Gender assumes an employment proper to men: for though S. Paul silenceth women for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, I know no Scripture forbids them from writing on Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Such infused skill she had also of Musick, whereof she was naturally ignorant, and wrote a whole book of verses very good according to those times. Indeed in that age the trumpet of the warlike Heroick, and the sweet harp of the Lyrick verse, were all turned into the gingling of Cymballs, tinckling with rhythmes, and like-sounding cadencies.</p>
                     <p>But let us heare a few lines of her Prophecies, and thence guesse the rest. <hi>In those dayes there shall rise up a people without understanding, proud, covetous, and deceitfull, the which shall eat the sins of the people, holding a certain order of foolish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65716:28"/>
under the feigned cloke of beggery. Also they shall instantly preach without devotion or example of the holy Martyrs, and shall detract from the secular Princes, taking away the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church from the true pastours, receiving almes of the poore, having familiarity with women, instructing them how they shall deceive their husbands, and rob their husbands to give it unto them,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is well the Index expurgatorius was not up in those dayes, nor the Inquisition on foot, otherwise dame Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degardis must have been call'd to an after account.

If from men, why did the Pope allow it, &amp; canonize her?</p>
                     <p>As for miracles, which she wrought in her life time, their number is as admirable as their nature. I must confesse at my first reading <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> of them, my belief di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested some, but surfeted on the rest: for she made no more to cast out a devil, then a barber to draw a tooth, and with lesse pain to the patient. I never heard of a great feast made all of Cordialls: and it seems improbable that miracles (which in Scripture are used sparingly, and chiefly for conversion of unbelievers)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65716:29"/>
should be heaped so many together, made every dayes work, and by her commonly, constantly, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, wrought. And I pray why is the Popish Church so barren of true works nowadayes here wrought at home amongst us? For as for those report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done farre of, it were ill for some if the gold from the Indies would abide the touch no better then the miracles.</p>
                     <p>However Hildegardis was a gratious Virgin, and God might perform some great wonders by her hand; but these <hi>piae fraudes</hi> with their painting have spoyled the naturall complexion of many a good face, and have made Truth it self suspected.

                        </note> Scholar of his relates, that he lived ten years in Arabia to get learning, and conversed in Greece with the Athenian Philosophers. Whereas in that age Arabia the Happy was accursed with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme, and Athens grown a stranger to her self; both which places being then subjected to the Turks, the very ruines of all learning were ruin'd there. Thus we see how he better knew to act his part, then to lay his Scene, and had not Chronologie enough to tell the clock of time, when and where to place his lies to make them like truth.</p>
                     <p>The first five &amp; twenty years of his age he lived very civilly; being thirty years old he came to Basill, just at the alteration of Religion, when many Papists were expell'd the University, and places rather wanted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, then Professours places. Here by the favour of Oecolampadius he was admitted to reade Physick, &amp; for two years behaved himself fairly, till this accident caused his departure. A rich <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> Canon of Basill being sick promised Paracelsus an hundred florens to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, which being restored to his health he denied to pay. Paracelsus sues him, is cast in his suit, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate adjudging him onely an ordinary fee, because the cure was done presently with a few pills. The Physician enraged hereat talked treason against the State in all his discourses, till the nimblenesse of his tongue forc'd the nimblenesse of his feet, and he was fain to fly into Alsatia. Here keeping company with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65716:36"/>
the Gentry of the countrey, he gave himself over to all licentiousnesse: His body was the sea wherein the tide of drunkennesse was ever ebbing and flowing; for by putting his finger in his throat he used to spew out his drink and drunkennesse together, and from that instant date himself sober to return to his cups again. Every moneth he had a new sute, not for pride but necessity; his apparel serving both for wearing and bedding: and having given his clothes many vomits, he gave them to the poore. Being Codrus over night, he would be Croesus in the morning, flush of money as if he carried the invisible Indies in his pocket: some suspected the devil was his pursebearer, and that he carried a spirit in the pomel of his sword his constant companion, whilest others maintain that by the heat of the furnace he could ripen any metall into gold.</p>
                     <p>All the diet he prescribed his patients was this, to eat what, and how often, they thought fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and yet he did most strange cures. Like the quicksilver (he so much dealt with) he would never be fixt in one place, or live any where longer then a twelvemoneth: for some observe that by that time the maladies reverted again, which he formerly cured. He gave so strong physick as summoned Nature with all her force to expell the present disease, but the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant dregs thereof afterwards reinforcing themselves did assault Nature tired out with the violence of her former task, and easily subdued it.</p>
                     <p>His Scholars brag that the fragments of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would feast all the Philosophers in the world, boasting that the gout, the disgrace of Physick, was the honour of Paracelsus, who by curing it removed that scandall from his profession: whereas others say he had little Learning, and lesse Latine. When any asked him the name of an herb he knew not, he would tell them there was no <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65716:36"/>
and yet this man would undertake not onely to cure men, but to cure the Art of curing men, and reform Physick it self.</p>
                     <p>As for his religion, it would as well pose himself as others to tell what it was. He boasted that shortly he would order Luther and the Pope, as well as he had done Galen and Hippocrates. He was never seen to pray, and seldome came to Church. He was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly skilled in naturall Magick (the utmost bounds whereof border on the suburbs of hell) but is charged to converse constantly with familiars. Guilty he was of all vices but wantonnesse; and I find an <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>Boasting that he could make a man immortall, he himself died at fourty seven years in the City of Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. His Scholars say he was poysoned through the envy (that dark shadow ever waiting on a shining merit) and malice of his adversaries. However his body should have been so fenced with antidotes, that the battery of no poyson might make a breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; except we impute it more to his neglect then want of skill, and that rather his own security then his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies malice brought him to his grave. But it may be he was willing to die, counting a twelvemoneths time enough to stay in one place, and fourty seven years long enough to live in one world. We may more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that so beastly a drunkard lived so long, then that so skilfull a man died so soon. In a word, He boasted of more then he could do, did more cures seemingly then really, more cures really then lawfully; of more parts then learning, of more fame then parts; a better Physician then a man, and a better Chirurgeon then Physician.</p>

                     <p>WIlliam Whitaker born at Holm in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Lancaster of good parentage, especially by his mothers side, allied to two worshipfull fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. His reverend unckle, Alexander Nowell, Dean of S. Pauls (the first fruits of the English Confessours in the dayes of Queen Marie, who after her death first return'd into England from beyond the Seas) took him young from his parents, sent him first to Pauls
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65716:40"/>
School, thence to Trinity Colledge in Cambridge; where he so profited in his studies, that he gave great promises of his future perfection.</p>
                     <p>I passe by his youthfull exercises, never striving for the garland, but he wonne and wore it away. His prime appearing to the world, was when he stood for the Professours place against two Competitours, in age farre his superiours. But the seven Electours in the Universitie who were to choose the Emperour of the Schools, preferring a golden head before silver hairs, conferr'd the place on Whitaker; and the strict form of their Election hath no room for corruption. He so well acquitted himself in the place that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered expectation, the strongest opponent in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes and lectures, and by degrees taught envie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Papists began to assault him, and the Truth. First Campian, one fitter for a Trumpeter then a Souldier, whose best ability was that he could boast in good Latine, being excellent at the flat hand of Rhetorick (which rather gives pats then blows) but he could not bend his fist to dispute. Whitaker both in writing and disputing did teach him, that it was easier to make then maintain a challenge against our Church; and in like manner he handled both Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, and Sanders, who successively undertook the same cause, solidly confuting their arguments.</p>
                     <p>But these Teazers, rather to rouze then pinch the Game, onely made Whitaker find his spirits. The fiercest dog is behind even Bellarmine himself, a great scholar, and who wanted nothing but a good cause to defend, and generally writing ingeniously, using some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slenting, seldome down-right railing. Whitaker gave him all fair quarter, stating the question betwixt them, yielding all which the other in reason could ask, and agreeing on terms to fall out with him, plaid fairly but fiercely on him, till the other forsook the field.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65716:40"/>Bellarmine had no mind to reinforce his routed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but rather consigned over that service to a new Generall, Stapleton an English man: He was born the same <note n="*" place="margin">

He was sent for up by Arch-bishop Whitgift to the conference at Lambeth, after which returning home, unseasonable riding, late studying, and night-watching brought him to a burning-fever, to which his body was naturally disposed, as appeared by the mastery of rednesse in his complexion. Thus lost he the health of his body, in maintaining, That the health of the soul could not be lost. All agreed that he should be let bloud; which might then easily have been done, but was deferred by the fault of some about him, till it was too late. Thus, when God intends to cut a mans life off, his dearest friends by dangerous involuntarie mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes shall bring the knife. He died in the 47. yeare of his age, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1595. and in S. Johns Colledge (whereof he was Master) was solemnly interred, with the grief of the University, and whole Church of God.</p>

Indeed a little skill in Antiquity inclines a man to Popery; but depth in that study brings him about again to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A Nobleman who had heard of the extreme age of one dwelling not farre off, made a journey to visit him, and finding an aged person sitting in the chimney-corner, addressed himself unto him with admiration of his age, till his mistake was rectified: for, <hi>Oh S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,</hi> (said the young-old man) <hi>I am not he whom you seek for, but his sonne; my father is farther off in the field.</hi> The same errour is daily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by the Romish Church, adoring the reverend brow and gray hairs of some ancient Ceremonyes, perchance but of some seven or eight hundred years standing in the Church, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take these for their fathers, of farre greater age in the Primitive times.</p>

Yea not onely Frederick the Emperour, but many a godly Father some hundreds of years before held the Pope's stirrop, and by their well-meaning simplicity gave occasion to his future greatnesse. He takes notice how their Rhetorical hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles were afterwards accounted the just measure of dogmaticall truths; How plain people took them at their word in their funerall apostrophes to the dead; How praying for the departed brought the fuell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which after-ages kindled the fire of Purgatory; How one Ceremony begat another, there being no bounds in will-worship, wherewith one may sooner be wearied then satisfied; the inventours of new Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes endeavouring to supply in number, what their conceits want in solidity; How mens souls being in the full speed and career of the Historicall use of Pictures could not stop short, but must lash out into superstition, vailing their bonnets to Rome in civill courtesie, when making honourable mention thereof, are interpreted by modern Papists to have done it in adoration of the idole of the Popes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.

Besides, what is observed of horse-hairs, that lying nine dayes in water they turn to snakes; so some Ceremonies though dead at first, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time quicken, get stings, and may do much mischief, especially if in such an age wherein the meddling of some have justly awaked the jealousie of all.

From hence he raiseth his studies to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Physicks, the great hall of Nature, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks the closet thereof; and is carefull not to wade therein so farre, till by subtle distinguishing of notions he confounds himself.</p>

                     <p>I Know my choice herein is liable to much excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some will make me the pattern of ignorance, for making this Scaliger the pattern of the generall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, whose own sonne Joseph might have been his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in many arts. But all things considered, the choice will appear well advised, even in such variety of examples. Yet let him know that undertakes to pick out the best ear amongst an acre of wheat, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65716:45"/>
he shall leave as good if not a better behind him, then that which he chooseth.</p>
                     <p>He was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1484. in Italie, at the Castle of Ripa upon lacus Benacus, now called <hi>Lago di Garda,</hi> of the illustrious and noble family of the Scaligers, Princes, for many hundreds of years, of Verona, till at last the Venetians outed them of their ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Being about eleven years old, he was brought to the Court of Maximilian Emperour of Germany, where for seventeen years together he was taught learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and military discipline. I passe by his valiant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances atchieved by him, save that this one action of his is so great and strong, it cannot be kept in silence, but will be recorded.</p>
                     <p>In the cruel battel at Ravenna betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the French, he not onely bravely fetch'd off the dead bodies of Benedictus and Titus his father and brother, but also with his own hands rescued the Eagle (the standard Imperiall) which was taken by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For which his prowesse Maximilian knighted him, and with his own hands put on him the golden spurres, and chain, the badges of knight-hood.</p>
                     <p>Amidst these his Martiall employments he made many a clandestine match with the Muses, and whilest he expected the tides and returns of businesse, he fill'd up the empty places of leisure with his studies. Well did the Poets feigne Pallas Patronesse of arts and armes, there being ever good intelligence betwixt the two Professions, and as it were but a narrow cut to ferry over out of one into the other. At last Scaliger sounded a retreat to himself from the warres, and wholly applyed himself to his book, especially after his wandring life was fixed by marriage unto the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Andietta Lobeiaca, with whom he lived at Agin, near Montpeliar in France.</p>
                     <p>His Latine was twice refined, and most criticall, as appears by his own writings, and notes on other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65716:46"/>
He was an accurate Grecian, yet began to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it, when well nigh fourty years old, when a mans tongue is too stiff to bow to words. What a torture was it to him who flowed with streams of matter then to learn words, yea letters, drop by drop? But nothing was unconquerable to his pains, who had a golden wit in an iron body. Let his book of Subtilties wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse his profound skill in Logick, and Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>
                     <p>His skill in Physick was as great, as his practice therein was happy; in so much that he did many strange and admirable cures. Heare how a <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>In Mathematicks he was no Archimedes, though he shewed his skill therein with the best advantage, and stood therein on his tiptoes, that his learning might seem the taller.</p>
                     <p>But in Poetry his over-measure of skill might make up this defect, as is attested by his book <hi>de Arte Poetica.</hi> Yet his own Poems are harsh, and unsmooth, (as if he rather snorted then slept on Parnassus) and they sound better to the brain then the eare. Indeed his censure in Poetry was incomparable; but he was more happy in repairing of Poems then in building them from the ground, which speaks his judgement to be better then his invention.</p>
                     <p>What shall I speak of his skill in History? whose own actions were a sufficient History. He was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently vers'd in the passages of the world, both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and ancient. Many modern languages, which departed from Babel in a confusion, met in his mouth in a method, being skilfull in the Sclavonick tongue, the Hungarian, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and French.</p>
                     <p>But these his excellent parts were attended with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious pride; and he had much of the humour of the Ottomans in him, to kill all his brethren, and cry down all his equalls, which were corrivalls with him in the honour of arts, which was his principall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with Cardan. Great was his spight at Erasmus, the morning-starre of learning, and one by whom Julius himself had profited, though afterwards he sought to put out that candle whereat he had lighted his own. In the bickering betwixt them, Erasmus pluckt Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65716:47"/>
by the long locks of his immoderate boasting, and touched him to the quick (a proud man lies pat for a jeering mans hand to hit) yea Erasmus was a badger in his jeeres, where he did bite he would make his teeth meet. Nor came Scaliger behind him in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. However afterward Scaliger repented of his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, and before his death was <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>Thus his learning, being in the circuit of arts, spread so wide, no wonder if it lay thinne in some places. His parts were nimble, that starting so late he overtook, yea overran his equalls: so that we may safely conclude that making abatement for his military avocations, and late applying himself to study, scarce any one is to be preferred before him for generality of humane learning. He died <hi>Anno</hi> 1558. in the 75. yeare of his age.</p>

The good conceit of the Physician is half a cure, and his practice will scarce be happy where his person is hated; yet he humours them not in his Doctrine to get their love: for such a spanniel is worse then a dumbe dog. He shall sooner get their good will by walking uprightly, then by crouching and creeping. If pious living and painfull labouring in his calling will not win their affections, he counts it gain to lose them.

Some have questioned ventriloquie, when men strangely speak out of their bellies, whether it can be done lawfully or no: might I coin the word <hi>cordiloquie,</hi> when men draw the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines out of their hearts, sure all would count this lawfull and commendable.<note place="margin">8</note>

                        <hi>He chiefly reproves the raigning sins of the time, and place he lives in.</hi> We may observe that our Saviour never inveighed against Idolatry, Usury, Sabbath-breaking amongst the Jews; not that these were not sins, but they were not practised so much in that age, wherein wickednesse was spun with a finer thred: and therefore Christ principally bent the drift of his preaching against spirituall Pride, Hypocrisie, and Traditions then predominant amongst the people. Also our Minister confuteth no old Heresies which time hath confuted; nor troubles his Auditory with such strange, hideous cases of Conscience, that it is more hard to find the case then the resolution. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reproving of sinne, he ever whips the vice, and spares the person.</p>

As for heaping up of many quotations, it smacks of a vain ostentation of memory. Besides, it is as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the hearer should profitably retain them all, as that the preacher hath seriously perused them all: yea, whilest the auditours stop their attention, and stoop down to gather an impertinent quotation, the Sermon runs on, and they lose more substantiall matter.</p>

                     <p>William Perkins, born at Marston nigh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry in Warwickshire, was afterwards brought up in Christ-Colledge in Cambridge, where he so well profited in his studies that he got the grounds of all liberall Arts, and in the 24. of Queen Elizabeth was chosen fellow of that Colledge, the same yeare wherein Doctour Andrew Willet (one of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable industry) and Doctour Richard Clark (whose
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65716:51"/>
learned Sermons commend him to posterity) were elected into the same Society.</p>
                     <p>There goeth an uncontroll'd tradition, that Perkins, when a young scholar, was a great studier of Magick, occasioned perchance by his skill in Mathematicks. For ignorant people count all circles above their own sphere to be conjuring, and presently cry out those things are done by black art for which their dimme eyes can see no colour in reason. And in such cases, when they cannot flie up to heaven to make it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, they fetch it from hell to make it Magick, though it may lawfully be done by naturall causes. True it is he was very wild in his youth till God (the best Chymick who can fix quicksilver it self) gratiously reclaim'd him.</p>
                     <p>After his entrance into the Ministry, the first beam he sent forth shined to those <hi>which sat in darknesse and the shadow of death,</hi> I mean the prisoners in the castle of Cambridge, people (as generally in such places) living in England out of Christendome, wanting the means of their salvation, bound in their bodies, but too loose in their lives, yea often branded in their flesh, and seared in their consciences. Perkins prevailed so farre with their jaylour, that the prisoners were brought (fetter'd) to the Shire-house hard by, where he preached unto them every Lords day. Thus was the prison his parish, his own Charity his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron presenting him unto it, and his work was all his wages. Many an Onesimus here he begat, and as the instrument freed the prisoners from the captivity of sinne. When this began to be known, some of good quality of the neighbouring parishes became his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, and counted it their feast to feed out of the prisoners basket. Hence afterwards he became Preacher of S. Andrews parish in Cambridge, where he continued to the day of his death.</p>
                     <p>His Sermons were not so plain but that the piously
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65716:52"/>
learned did admire them, nor so learned but that the plain did understand them. What was said of Socrates, That he first humbled the towring specul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For he had a capacious head with angles winding, and roomthy enough to lodge all controversiall in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>asies; and, had not preaching diverted him from that way, he had no doubt attained to eminency therein. An excellent Chirurgeon he was at joynting of a broken soul, and at stating of a doubtfull conscience. And sure in Case-divinity Protestants are defective. For (save that a Smith or two of late have built them forges, and set up shop) we go down to our enemies to sharpen all our instruments, and are beholden to them for offensive and defensive weapons in Cases of Conscience.</p>
                     <p>He would pronounce the word <hi>Damne</hi> with such an emphasis as left a dolefull Echo in his auditours ears a good while after. And when Catechist of Christ-Colledge, in expounding the Commandments,<note place="margin">

                        </note> applied them so home, able almost to make his hearers hearts fall down, and hairs to stand upright. But in his older age he altered his voice, and remitted much of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rigidnesse, often professing that to preach mercie was that proper office of the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</p>
                     <p>Some octject that his Doctrine, referring all to an absolute decree, hamstrings all industry, and cuts off the sinews of mens endeavours towards salvation. For ascribing all to the wind of Gods spirit, (which bloweth where it listeth) he leaveth nothing to the oars of mans diligence, either to help or hinder to the attaining of happinesse, but rather opens a wide doore to licentious security. Were this the hardest objection

                        </gap> all passages, as if he had dwelt on them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; perusing books so speedily, one would think he read nothing; so accurately, one would think he read all.</p>
                     <p>He was of a cheerfull nature and pleasant dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Indeed to mere strangers he was reserved and close, suffering them to knock a good while before he would open himself unto them; but on the least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance he was merry and very familiar.</p>
                     <p>Besides his assiduity in preaching he wrote many books, extant at this day. And pity it was, that he set not forth more of them himself; for though some of his Orphan works lighted on good Guardians, yet all were not so happy; and indeed no nurse for a child to the own mother.</p>
                     <p>He dyed in the 44. yeare of his age of a violent fit of the stone. It hath been reported that he dyed in the conflict of a troubled conscience; which admit were so, had been no wonder. For God sometimes seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly leaves his Saints when they leave the world, plunging them on their death-beds in deep temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and casting their souls down to hell, to rebound the higher to heaven. Besides, the devil is most busie on the last day of his Term; and a Tenant to be outed cares not what mischief he doth. But here was no such matter.<note place="margin">S. W. <hi>ut priús.</hi>
                        </note> Indeed he alwayes cryed out <hi>Mercy Mercy</hi>: which some standers by misinterpreted for despair, as if he felt not Gods favour, because he call'd for it: whereas Mercy is a Grace which they hold the fastest,

that most catch after it. 'Tis true that many on lesse reason have expressed more confidence of their future happinesse, and have delivered themselves in larger speeches concerning the same. But who could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a long oration from him, where every word was accented with pain in so sharp a disease.</p>
                     <p>His funeralls were solemnly and sumtuously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the sole charges of Christ-Colledge, which challenged, as she gave him his breeding, to pay for his buriall; the University and Town lovingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending which should expresse more sorrow thereat.

                     <p>He was born the first, and dyed the last yeare of Queen Elisabeth, so that his life streamed in equall length with her reigne, and they both had their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and falls together.</p>
                     <p>I must not forget, how his books after his death were translated into most modern Christian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. For though he excellently improved his talent in the English tongue, yet forreiners thought it but wrapt up in a napkin, whilest folded in an unknown language.

                     <list>
                        <item>1 <hi>Inclosure may be made without depopulating.</hi> Infinites of examples shew this to be true. But depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath cast a slander on inclosure, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause often done with it, people suspect it cannot be done without it.</item>
                        <item>2 <hi>Inclosure made without depopulating is injurious to none.</hi> I mean if proportionable allotments be made to the poore for their commonage, and free &amp; lease-holders have a considerable share with the lord of the mannour.</item>
                        <item>3 <hi>Inclosure without depopulating is beneficiall to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> Then have they most power and comfort to improve their own parts, and for the time, and manner thereof may mould it to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie. The Monarch of one acre will make more profit thereof then he that hath his share in fourty in common.</item>
                        <item>4 <hi>Inclosure without depopulating is profitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> If injurious to no private person, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them all, it must needs be beneficiall to the Commonwealth, which is but the <hi>Summa totalis</hi> of sundry persons, as severall figures. Besides, if a Mathematician should count the wood in the hedges, to what a mighty forrest would it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount? This underwood serves for supplies to save timber from burning, otherwise our wooden walls in the water must have been sent to the fire. Adde to this the strength of an inclosed Countrey against a forrein invasion. Hedges and counter-hedges (having in number what they want in height and depth) serve for barracadoes, and will stick as birdlime in the wings of the horse,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65716:57"/>
and scotch the wheeling about of the foot. Small resistance will make the enemy to earn every mile of ground as he marches. Object not, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure destroyes tillage, the staff of a countrey, for it need not all be converted to pasturage. Cain and Abel may very well agree in the Commonwealth, the Plowman and Shepherd part the inclosures betwixt them.</item>

                     </head>
                     <p>NIcholas Metcalf Doctour of Divinity, extracted out of an ancient and numerous family of Gentry in Yorkshire, was Archdeacon of Rochester, &amp; Chaplain to John Fisher the Bishop thereof; by whom this our Doctour was employed to issue forth the monies for the building of S. Johns Colledge in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. For Margaret Countesse of Richmond and Derby intending to graft S. Johns Colledge into the old stock of S. Johns Hospitall, referr'd all to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rochester, and he used Metcalf as an agent in all proceedings which did concern that Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which will inferre him to be both a wise and an honest man.</p>
                     <p>Some make him to be but meanly <note n="*" place="margin">

But such trifles were beneath him; and what wonder is it if a Generall long used in governing an armie, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his school-play, and Fencers rules, to put by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thrust?</p>
                     <p>Doubtlesse, had not his learning been sufficient, Bishop Fisher, a great clerk himself, would not have placed him to govern the Colledge. But we know that some count all others but dry scholars, whose learning run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a different channell from their own: and it is possible, that the great distance betwixt men in matter of Religion might hinder the new learning in one to see the old learning in the other.</p>
                     <p>But grant that Metcalf, with Themistocles, could not fiddle, yet he could make a little city a great one: though dull in himself, he could whet others by his encouragement. He found the Colledge spending

scarce two hundred marks by the yeare, he left it spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <note n="*" place="margin">

For he not onely procured and settled many donations, and by-founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as we term them) of Fellowships, and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larships, founded by other; but was a Benefactour himself, <hi>Pro certis ornamentis &amp; structuris in Capella, &amp; pro aedificatione sex Camerarum à tergo Coquinae,</hi> &amp;c. as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in the Colledge books. He counted the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his own home, and therefore cared not what cost he bestowed on it: not like those Masters, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Colledges as steps to higher advancement will trample on them to raise up themselves, and using their wings to flie up to their own honour, cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to spread them to brood their Colledge. But the thriving of the nourcery, is the best argument to prove the skill and care of the nource. See what store of worthy men the house in his time did yield:

                     <head>CHAP. 16. The good Schoolmaster.</head>
                     <p>THere is scarce any profession in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth more necessary, which is so slightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The reasons whereof I conceive to be these: first, young scholars make this calling their refuge, yea perchance before they have taken any degree in the University, commence Schoolmasters in the countrey, as if nothing else were required to set up this professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but onely a rod and a ferula. Secondly, others who are able use it onely as a passage to better preferment, to patch the rents in their present fortune, till they can provide a new one, and betake themselves to some more gainfull calling. Thirdly, they are disheartned from doing their best with the miserable reward which in some places they receive, being Masters to the children, and slaves to their parents. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown rich, they grow negligent, and scorn to touch the school, but by the proxie of an Usher. But see how well our Schoolmaster behaves himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His genius inclines him with delight to this profession.</hi>

So that he who beholds the fabrick thereof may say, God hewed out this stone, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to lie in this very place, for it would fit none other so well, and here it doth most excellent. And thus God mouldeth some for a Schoolmasters life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it with desire and delight, and discharging it with dexterity and happy successe.</p>

                        <hi>He studieth his scholars natures as carefully as they their books;</hi> and ranks their dispositions into severall forms. And though it may seem difficult for him in a great school to descend to all particulars, yet experienced Schoolmasters may quickly make a Grammar of boyes natures, and reduce them all (saving some few exceptions) to these generall rules.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 Those that are ingenious and industrious. The conjunction of two such Planets in a youth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage much good unto him. To such a lad a frown may be a whipping, and a whipping a death; yea where their Master whips them once, shame whips them all the week after. Such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he useth with all gentlenesse.</item>
                        <item>2 Those that are ingenious and idle. These think with the hare in the fable, that running with snails (so they count the rest of their school-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) they shall come soon enough to the Post, though sleeping a good while before their start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh, a good rod would finely take them nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</item>
                        <item>3 Those that are dull and diligent. Wines the stronger they be the more lees they have when they are new. Many boyes are muddy-headed till they be clarified with age, and such afterwards prove the best. Bristoll diamonds are both bright, and squared and pointed by Nature, and yet are soft and worthlesse; whereas orient ones in India are rough and rugged naturally. Hard rugged and dull natures of youth acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves afterwards the jewells of the countrey, and therefore their dulnesse at first is to be born with, if they be diligent. That Schoolmaster de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be beaten himself, who beats Nature in a boy for a fault. And I question whether all the whipping in the world can make their parts, which are naturally sluggish, rise one minute before the houre Nature hath appointed.</item>

                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:65716:62"/>4 Those that are invincibly dull and negligent also. Correction may reform the latter, not amend the former. All the whetting in the world can never set a rasours edge on that which hath no steel in it. Such boyes he consigneth over to other professions. Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights and boatmakers will choose those crooked pieces of timber, which other carpenters refuse. Those may make excellent merchants and mechanicks which will not serve for Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</item>

                     <p>IS one who by his trading claspeth the iland to the continent, and one countrey to another. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gardiner, who makes England bear wine, and oyl, and spices; yea herein goes beyond Nature in causing that <hi>Omnis fert omnia tellus.</hi> He wrongs neither himself, nor the Commonwealth, nor private chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which buy commodities of him. As for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards the Commonwealth, it farre surpasses my skill to give any Rules thereof; onely this I know, that to export things of necessity, and to bring in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein needlesse toyes, makes a rich Merchant, and a poore Kingdome: for the State loseth her radicall moysture, and gets little better then sweat in exchange,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65716:64"/>
except the necessaries which are exported be exceeding plentifull, which then though necessary in their own nature become superfluous through their abundance. We will content our selves to give some generall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements concerning his behaviour towards his chapmen, whom he useth well in the quantity, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and price of the commodities he sells them.</p>

First, because they rob a man of his purse, &amp; never bid him stand. Secondly, because highway-thieves defie, but these pretend justice.

                        <hi>He never demands out of distance of the price he intends to take</hi>: If not alwayes within the touch, yet within the reach of what he means to sell for. Now we must know there be foure severall prices of vendible things. First, the Price of the market, which ebbes and flows
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65716:64"/>
according to the plenty or scarcity of coyn, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and chapmen. Secondly, the Price of friendship, which perchance is more giving then selling, and therefore not so proper at this time. Thirdly, the Price of fancie, as twenty pounds or more for a dog or hauk, when no such inherent worth can naturally be in them, but by the buyers and sellers fancie reflecting on them. Yet I believe the money may be lawfully taken. First, because the seller sometimes on those terms is as loth to forgo it, as the buyer is willing to have it. And I know no standard herein whereby mens affections may be measured. Secondly, it being a matter of pleasure, and men able and willing, let them pay for it, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> Lastly, there is the Price of cosenage, which our Merchant from his heart detests and abhorres.</p>

                        <hi>chiefly if referring himself to his honesty:</hi> where the sellers conscience is all the buyers skill, who makes him both seller and judge, so that he doth not so much ask as order what he must pay. When one told old Bishop Latimer that the Cutler had cosened him, in making him pay two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for a knife not (in those dayes) worth a peny; <hi>No,</hi> quoth Latimer, <hi>he cosen'd not me but his own conscience.</hi> On the other side S. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>He makes not the buyer pay the shot for his prodigality</hi>;<note place="margin">6</note> as when the Merchant through his own ignorance or ill husbandry hath bought dear, he will not bring in his unnecessary expences on the buyers score: and in such a case he is bound to sell cheaper then he bought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Selling by retail he may justifie the taking of greater gain</hi>:<note place="margin">7</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his care, pains, and cost of fetching those
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65716:65"/>
wares from the fountain, and in parcelling and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. Yet because retailers trade commonly with those who have least skill what they buy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sell to the poorer sort of people, they must be carefull not to grate on their necessity.</p>
                     <p>But how long shall I be retailing out rules to this Merchant? It would employ a Casuist an apprentiship of years: take our Saviours whole-sale rule, <hi>Whatsoever ye would have men do unto you, do you unto them; for this is the Low, and the Prophets.</hi>

All single Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els he detesteth, as having first no command in Gods Word; yea this arbitrary deciding causes by the sword subverts the fundamentall Laws of the Scripture: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, no example in Gods Word, that of David and Goliah moving in an higher Sphere, as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: Thirdly, it tempts God to work a Miracle for mans pleasure, and to invert the course of nature, whereby otherwise the stronger will beat the weaker: Fourthly, each Dueller challengeth his King as unable or unwilling legally to right him, and therefore he usurps the office himself: Fifthly, if slaying, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards his neck to the halter; if slain, in heat of malice,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But there are some intricate cases (as in Titles of land) which cannot otherwise be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Seeing therefore that in such difficulties, the right in question cannot be delivered by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of any judiciall proceedings, then it must (with Julius Caesar in his mothers belly) be cut out and be determined by the sword.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Such a right may better be lost, then to light a candle from hell to find it out, if the Judges cannot find a middle way to part in betwixt them. Besides, in such a case Duells are no <hi>medium proportionatum</hi> to find out the truth, as never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to that purpose. Nor doth it follow that he hath the best in right, who hath the best in fight; for he that reads the lawfulnesse of actions by their events, holds the wrong end of the book upwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But suppose an army of thirty thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells ready to fight against ten thousand Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, yet so that at last the Infidells are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try the day upon the valour of a single Champion; whether in such a case may not a Christian undertake to combat with him, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the treble oddes before is the reby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to terms of equalitie, and so the victory made more probable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The victory was more probable before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more likely God will blesse his own means, then means of mans appointing: and it is his prerogative to give victory, as well by few as by many. Probability of conquest is not to be measured by the eye of humane reason, contrary to the square of Gods Word. Besides, I question whether it be lawfull for a Christian army to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their right of fighting Gods battels to any
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65716:71"/>
single man. For the title every man hath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Gods glory, is so invested and inherent in his own particular person, that he cannot passe it over to another. None may appear in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by an Atturney; and when Religion is at the stake, there must be no lookers on (except impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent people, who also help by their prayers) and every one is bound to lay his shoulders to the work. Lastly, would to God no Duels might be fought till this case came into question. But how many dayly fall out upon a more false, slight, and flitting ground, then the sands of Callis whereon they fight: especially, seeing there is an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Court appointed, or some other equivalent way, for taking up such quarrells, and allowing reparations to the party injured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But Reputation is so spirituall a thing it is inestimable, and Honour falls not under valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Besides, to complain to the civil Magistrate sheweth no manhood, but is like a childs crying to his father, when he is onely beaten by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; and my enemies forc'd acknowledgement of his fault (enjoyn'd him by the Court) shews rather his submission to the laws then to me. But if I can civilize his rudenesse by my sword, and chastize him into submission, then he sings his penitentiall song in the true tune, and it comes naturally indeed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Honourable persons in that Court are the most competent Judges of Honour, and though Credit be as tender as the apple of the eye, yet such curious oculists can cure a blemish therein. And why, I pray, is it more disgrace to repair to the Magistrate for redresse in Reputation, then to have recourse to him in actions of trespasse? The pretence of a forced submission is nothing, all submissions having <hi>aliquid violentum</hi> in them; and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65716:71"/>
even the Evangelicall repentance of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hath a mixture of legall terrour frighting them thereto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But Gownmen speak out of an antipathy they bear to fighting: should we be rul'd by them, we must break all our swords into pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knifes; and Lawyers, to inlarge their gains, send prohibitions to remove suits from the Camps to their Courts: Divines are not to be consulted with herein, as ignorant of the principles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed Honour is a word of course in the talk of roring boyes, and pure enough in it self, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their mouths soil it by often using of it: But indeed God is the fountain of Honour, Gods Word the Charter of Honour, and godly men the best Judges of it; nor is it any stain of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardlinesse for one to fear hell and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>We may therefore conclude that the laws of Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the laws of drinking, had their originall from the devil; and therefore the declining of needlesse quarrels in our Souldier, no abatement of Honour. I commend his discretion and valour, who walking in London-streetes met a gallant, who cryed to him a pretty distance beforehand, <hi>I will have the wall? Yea</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered he) <hi>and take the house too, if you can but agree with the Landlord.</hi> But when God, and his Prince, calls for him, our Souldier</p>

                        <note place="margin">8</note> Though life be sweet, it shall not flatter the pallat of his soul, as with the sweetnesse of life to make him swallow down the bitternesse of an eternall disgrace: He begrutcheth not to get to his side a probability of victory by the certainty of his own death, and flieth from nothing so much as from the mention of flying. And though some say he is a mad-man that will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65716:72"/>
Honour so dearly with his bloud, as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live to enjoy what he hath bought; our Souldier knows that he shall possesse the reward of his valour with God in heaven, and also making the world his executor, leave to it the rich inheritance of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

                        <hi>Yet in some cases he counts it no disgrace to yield, where it is impossible to conquer</hi>; as when swarms of enemies crowd about him, so that he shall rather be stifled then wounded to death: In such a case if quarter be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he may take it with more honour then the other can give it; and if he throws up his desperate game, he may happily winne the next, whereas if he playeth it out to the last, he shall certainly lose it and himself. But if he be to fall into the hand of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemy, whose giving him quarter is but repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him for a more ignominious death, he had rather disburse his life at the present, then to take day to fall into the hands of such remorslesse creditours.</p>

                     <p>FRancis Drake was born nigh<note n="*" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Drake his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. of his third voyage, Epistle to the Reader.</hi>
                        </note> south Tavestock in Devonshire, and brought up in Kent; God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the honour betwixt two Counties, that the one might have his birth, and the other his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Father, being a Minister, fled into Kent for fear of the Six Articles, wherein the sting of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery still remained in England, though the teeth thereof were knock'd out, and the Popes Supremacy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65716:75"/>
abolished. Coming into Kent, he bound his sonne Francis apprentice to the Master of a small bark, which traded into France, and Zealand, where he underwent a hard service; and pains with patience in his youth did knit the joynts of his soul, and made them more solid and compacted. His Master dying unmarried, in reward of his industry, bequeath'd his bark unto him for a Legacie.</p>
                     <p>For some time he continued his Masters profession: But the Narrow Seas were a prison for so large a spirit, born for greater undertakings. He soon grew weary of his bark, which would scarce go alone but as it crept along by the shore: wherefore selling it, he unfortunately ventured most of his estate with Captain John Hawkins into the West Indies,<note place="margin">1567.</note> whose goods were taken by the Spaniards at S. John de Ulva, and he himself scarce escaped with life. The King of Spain being so tender in those parts, that the least touch doth wound him; and so jealous of the West Indies, his wife, that willingly he would have none look upon her, and therefore used them with the greater severity.</p>
                     <p>Drake was perswaded by the Minister of his ship that he might lawfully recover in value of the King of Spain, and repair his losses upon him any where else. The Case was clear in sea-divinity, and few are such Infidels, as not to believe doctrines which make for their own profit. Whereupon Drake, though a poore private man, hereafter undertook to revenge himself on so mighty a Monarch; who, as not contented that the Sun riseth and setteth in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, may seem to desire to make all his own where he shineth. And now let us see how a dwarf, standing on the Mount of Gods providence, may prove an overmatch for a giant.</p>
                     <p>After two or three severall Voyages to gain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the West Indies, and some prizes taken, at
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65716:76"/>
last he effectually set forward from Plimouth with two ships, the one of seventy, the other twenty five tunnes, and seventy three men and boyes in both. He made with all speed and secrecy to Nombre de Dios, as loth to put the Town to too much charge (which he knew they would willingly bestow) in providing beforehand for his entertainment; which City was then the granary of the West Indies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the golden harvest brought from Panama was hoarded up till it could be conveyed into Spain. They came hard aboard the shore, and lay quiet all night intending to attempt the Town in the dawning of the day.</p>
                     <p>But he was forced to alter his resolution, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault it sooner; for he heard his men muttering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves of the strength and greatnesse of the Town: and when mens heads are once fly-blown with buzzes of suspicion, the vermine multiply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and one jealousie begets another. Wherefore he raised them from their nest before they had hatch'd their fears, and to put away those conceits, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them it was day-dawning when the Moon rose, and instantly set on the Town, and wonne it being unwalled. In the Market-place the Spaniards saluted them with a volley of shot; Drake returned their greeting with a flight of arrows, the best and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient English complement, which drave their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies away. Here Drake received a dangerous wound, though he valiantly conceal'd it a long time, knowing if his heart stooped, his mens would fall, and loth to leave off the action, wherein if so bright an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity once setteth, it seldome riseth again. But at length his men forced him to return to his ship, that his wound might be dressed, and this unhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent defeated the whole designe. Thus victory some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slips thorow their fingers, who have caught it in their hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65716:76"/>But his valour would not let him give over the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as long as there was either life or warmth in it: And therefore having received intelligence from the Negroes, called Symerons, of many mules-lading of gold and silver, which was to be brought from Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, he leaving competent numbers to man his ships went on land with the rest, and bestowed himself in the woods by the way as they were to passe, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted and carried away an infinite masse of gold. As for the silver which was not portable over the mountains, they digged holes in the ground and hid it therein.</p>
                     <p>There want not those who love to beat down the price of every honourable action, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never mean to be chapmen. These cry up Drakes fortune herein to cry down his valour; as if this his performance were nothing, wherein a golden opportunity ran his head with his long forelock into Drakes hands beyond expectation. But certainly his resolution and unconquerable patience deserved much praise, to adventure on such a designe, which had in it just no more probability then what was enough to keep it from being impossible: yet I admire not so much at all the treasure he took, as at the rich and deep mine of Gods providence.</p>
                     <p>Having now full fraughted himself with wealth, and burnt at the House of Crosses above two hundred thousand pounds worth of Spanish Merchandise, he returned with honour and safety into England, and some <note n="*" place="margin">1577. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> 13.</note> years after undertook that his famous voyage about the world, most accurately described by our English Authours: and yet a word or two thereof will not be amisse.</p>
                     <p>Setting forward from Plimouth, he bore up for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boverd, where near to the Iland of S. Jago he took prisoner Nuno-da-Silva, an experienc'd Spanish pilot, whose direction he used in the coasts of Brasil and

Then bending Eastwards, he coasted China, and the Moluccoes, where by the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renate, a true Gentleman Pagan, he was most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably entertain'd: The King told them, They and he were all of one religion in this respect, that they believed <note n="*" place="margin">

Then they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aright that the best way to lighten the ship, was first to ease it of the burthen of their sinnes by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, humbled themselves by fasting under the hand of God: Afterwards they received the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, dining on Christ in the Sacrament, expecting no other then to sup with him in heaven: Then they cast out of their ship six great pieces of ordinance, threw over-board as much wealth as would break the heart of a Miser to think on't, with much suger, and packs of spices, making a caudle of the sea round about: Then they betook themselves to their prayers, the best lever at such a dead lift indeed, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God that the wind, formerly their mortall enemy, became their friend, which changing from the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to the Larboard of the ship, and rising by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, cleared them off to the sea again, for which they returned unfeigned thanks to almighty God.</p>

But, alas, this voyage was marr'd before begun. For so great preparations being too big for a cover, the King of Spain knew of it, and sent a Caravall of adviso to the West Indies, so that they had intelligence <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hacluits voyage,</hi> 3. <hi>vol. pag.</hi> 583.</note> three weeks before the Fleet set forth of England, either to fortifie, or remove their treasure; whereas in other of Drakes Voyages not two of his own men knew whither he went; and managing such a designe is like carrying a Mine in warre, if it hath any vent, all is spoyled. Besides, Drake and Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins being in joynt Commission hindred each other. The later took himself to be inferiour rather in successe then skill, and the action was unlike to prosper when neither would follow, and both could not handsomly go abreast. It vexed old Hawkins that his counsell was not followed, in present sayling to America, but that they spent time in vain in assaulting the Canaries; and the grief that his advice was slighted (say some) was the cause of his death. Others impute it to the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he took, for the taking of his Bark called the Francis, which five Spanish Frigates had intercepted: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same heart hath two mortall wounds given it together, 'tis hard to say which of them killeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65716:78"/>Drake continued his course for Port-Rico, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within the roade, a shot from the Castle entred the steerage of the ship, took away the stool from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as he sate at supper, wounded S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Nicholas Clifford and Brute Brown to death. <hi>Ah dear</hi>

And sure, as if grief had made the English furious, they soon after fired five Spanish ships of two hundred tunnes apiece, in despight of the Castle.</p>
                     <p>America is not unfitly resembled to an Houre-glasse, which hath a narrow neck of land (suppose it the hole where the sand passeth) betwixt the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Mexicana &amp; Pervana. Now the English had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to march by land over this Isthmus from Port-Rico to Panama, where the Spanish treasure was layd up. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Baskervile, Generall of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, undertook the service with seven hundred and fifty armed men. They marched through deep wayes, the Spaniards much annoying them with shot out of the woods. One fort in the passage they assaulted in vain, and heard that two others were built to stop them, besides Panama it self. They had so much of this breakfast, they thought they should surfet of a dinner and supper of the same. No hope of conquest, except with cloying the jaws of Death, and thrusting men on the mouth of the Canon. Wherefore fearing to find the Proverb true, That Gold may be bought too dear, they returned to their ships. Drake afterwards fired Nombre de Dios, and many other petty Towns (whose treasure the Spaniards had conveyed away) burning the empty casks, when their precious liquour was runne out before, and then prepared for their returning home.</p>
                     <p>Great was the difference betwixt the Indian cities
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65716:79"/>
now from what they were when Drake first haunted these coasts: At first the Spaniards here were safe and secure, counting their treasure sufficient to defend it self, the remotenesse thereof being the greatest (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most onely) resistance, and the fetching of it more then the fighting for it. Whilest the King of Spain guarded the head and heart of his dominions in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, he left his long legs in America open to blows, till finding them to smart, being beaten black and blew by the English, he learned to arm them at last, fortifying the most important of them to make them impregnable.</p>
                     <p>Now began S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis his discontent to feed upon him. He conceived that expectation, a mercilesse usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, computing each day since his departure exacted an interest and return of honour and profit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to his great preparations, and transcending his former atchievements. He saw that all the good which he had done in this voyage, consisted in the evill he had done to the Spaniards afarre off, whereof he could present but small visible fruits in England. These apprehensions accompanying if not causing the disease of the flux wrought his sudden <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ianuary</hi> 28. 1595.</note> death. And sicknesse did not so much untie his clothes, as sorrow did rend at once the robe of his mortality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it. Thus an ex-tempore performance (scarce heard to be begun before we hear it is ended) comes off with better applause, or miscarries with lesse disgrace, then a long studied and openly premeditated action. Besides, we see how great spirits, having mounted to the highest pitch of performance, afterwards strain and break their credits in striving to go beyond it. Lastly, God oftentimes leaves the brightest men in an eclipse, to shew that they do but borrow their lustre from his reflection. We will not justifie all the actions of any man, though of a tamer profession then a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65716:79"/>
Sea-Captain, in whom civility is often counted precisenesse. For the main, we say that this our Captain was a religious man towards God and his houses (generally sparing Churches where he came) chast in his life, just in his dealings, true of his word, and mercifull to those that were under him, hating nothing so much as idlenesse: And therefore lest his soul should rust in peace, at spare houres he brought fresh water to Plimouth. Carefull he was for posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (though men of his profession have as well an ebbe of riot, as a flote of fortune) and providently raised a worshipfull Family of his kinred. In a word, should those that speak against him fast till they fetch their bread where he did his, they would have a good sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to eat it.</p>

                     <p>WIlliam Cambden was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1550 in old Baily, in the City of London. His Father, Sampson Cambden, was descended of honest paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in Staffordshire; but by his Mothers side he was extracted from the worshipfull family of the <note n="*" place="margin">A quibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis (absit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia) genus maternum, <hi>Cambd.

                     <p>He was brought up first in Christ-Church, then in Pauls School in London, and at fifteen years of age
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65716:82"/>
went to Magdalen Colledge in Oxford, and thence to <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex Parenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Degorii Wheat.</hi>
                        </note> Broadgates Hall, where he first made those short La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Graces, which the Servitours still use. From hence he was removed, and made student of Christ Church, where he profited to such eminency, that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to be Master of Westminster School, a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous seminarie of learning.</p>
                     <p>For whereas before, of the two grand Schools of England, one sent all her Foundation-scholars to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, the other all to Oxford, the good Queen (as the Head equally favouring both Breasts of Learning and Religion) divided her Scholars here betwixt both Universities, which were enriched with many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plants sent from hence, through Cambdens learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diligence, and clemency. Sure none need pity the beating of that Scholar, who would not learn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it under so meek a Master.</p>
                     <p>His deserts call'd him hence to higher employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Queen first made him Richmond Herald, and then Clarenceaux King of Arms. We reade how Dionysius first King of Sicily turn'd afterwards a Schoolmaster in his old age. Behold here Dionysius inverted, one that was a Schoolmaster in his youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a King (of Arms) in his riper years, which place none ever did or shall discharge with more integrity. He was a most exact Antiquary, witnesse his worthy work, which is a comment on three kingdomes; and never was so large a text more briefly, so dark a text more plainly expounded. Yea what a fair garment hath been made out of the very shreds and Remains of that greater Work?</p>
                     <p>It is most worthy observation with what diligence he inquired after ancient places, making Hue and Crie after many a City which was run away, and by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain marks and tokens pursuing to find it; as by the situation on the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Watlin Ermin street</hi>
                        </note>Romane high-wayes, by just distance from other ancient cities, by some affinity of name,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65716:82"/>
by tradition of the inhabitants, by Romane coyns dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up, and by some appearance of ruines. A broken urn is a whole evidence, or an old gate still surviving, out of which the city is run out. Besides, commonly some new spruce town, not farre off, is grown out of the ashes thereof, which yet hath so much naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as dutifully to own those reverend ruines for her Mother.</p>
                     <p>By these and other means he arrived at admirable knowledge, and restored Britain to her self. And let none tax him for presumption in conjectures where the matter was doubtfull; for many probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures have stricken the fire, out of which Truths candle hath been lighted afterwards. Besides, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, like parcells of unknown ore, are sold but at low rates: If they prove some rich metall, the buyer is a great gainer; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> base, no looser, for he payes for it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>His candour and sweet temper was highly to be commended, gratefully acknowledging those by whom he was assisted in the work (in such a case confession puts the difference betwixt stealing and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing) and surely so heavy a log needed more levers then one. He honourably mentioneth such as differ from him in opinion; not like those Antiquaries, who are so snarling one had as good dissent a mile as an hairs breadth from them.</p>
                     <p>Most of the English ancient Nobility and Gentry he hath unpartially observed. Some indeed object that he <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> claws and flatters the Grandees of his own age, extolling some families rather great then ancient, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to flow from a farre fountain because they had a great channell, especially if his private friends. But this cavil hath more of malice then truth: indeed 'tis pitty he should have a tongue, that hath not a word for a friend on just occasion; and justly might the stream of his commendations run broader, where meeting
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65716:83"/>
with a confluence of desert and friendship in the same party. For the main, his pen is sincere and unpartiall, and they who complain that Grantham steeple stands awry will not set a straiter by it.</p>
                     <p>Some say that in silencing many gentile families, he makes baulks of as good ground as any he ploweth up. But these again acquit him, when they consider that it is not onely difficult but impossible to anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize the English Gentry so exactly, as to shew where every smallest vein thereof runs. Besides, many Houses, conceived to be by him omitted, are rather rightly placed by him, not where they live, but whence they came. Lastly, we may perceive that he prepared ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work on purpose for the English Gentry.</p>
                     <p>I say nothing of his learned Annalls of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, industriously performed. His very enemies (if any) cannot but commend him. Sure he was as farre from loving <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <head>CHAP. 11. Of Phancie.</head>
                     <p>IT is an inward Sense of the soul, for a while retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining things brought in thither by the Common sense. It is the most boundles and restlesse faculty of the soul: for whilest the Understanding and the Will are kept as it were in <hi>Libera Custodia</hi> to their objects of <hi>Verum</hi> &amp; <hi>Bonum,</hi> the Phancie is free from all engagements: it digs without spade, sails without ship, flies without wings, builds without charges, fights without bloudshed, in a moment striding from the centre to the circumference of the world, by a kind of omnipotencie creating and annihilating things in an instant; and things divorced in Nature are married in Phancie as in a lawlesse place. It is also most restlesse: whilest the Senses are bound, and Reason in a manner asleep, Phancie like a sentinell walks the round, ever working, never wearied. The chief diseases of the Phancie are, either that they are too wild and high-soaring, or else too low and groveling, or else too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultory and overvoluble. Of the first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thy Phancie be but a little too rank,</hi>

                        <hi>age it self will correct it.</hi> To lift too high is no fault in a young horse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with travelling he will mend it for his own ease. Thus lofty Phancies in young men will come down of themselves, and in processe of time the overplus will shrink to be but even measure. But if this will not do it, then observe these rules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take part alwayes with thy Iudgement against thy Phancie in any thing wherein they shall dissent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2</note> If thou suspectest thy conceits too luxuriant, herein account thy suspicion a legall conviction, and damne whatsoever thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of.

Mark the arguments and reasons of his alterations, why that phrase least proper, this passage more cautious and advised, and after a while thou shalt perform the place in thine own person, and not go out of thy self for a censurer.

I confesse there is more required to teach one to write then to see a coppy: however there is a secret force of fascination in reading Poems to raise and provoke Phancie. If thy Phancie be over voluble, then</p>

                        <hi>Whip this vagrant home to the first object whereon it should be settled.</hi> Indeed nimblenesse is the perfection of this faculty, but levity the bane of it. Great is the difference betwixt a swift horse, and a skittish, that will stand on no ground. Such is the ubiquitary Phancie, which will keep long residence on no one subject, but is so courteous to strangers that it ever welcomes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit most which comes last; and new species supplant the old ones, before seriously considered. If this be the fault of thy Phancie, I say whip it home to the first object, whereon it should be settled. This do as often as occasion requires, and by degrees the fugitive servant will learn to abide by his work without running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

True, at the first it will be as welcome to thee as a prison, and their very solutions will seem knots unto thee. But take not too much at once, lest thy brain turn edge. Taste it first as a potion for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and by degrees thou shalt drink it as beer for thirst: Practice will make it pleasant. Mathematicks are also good for this purpose: If beginning to try a Conclusion, thou must make an end, lest thou losest thy pains that are past, and must proceed seriously and exactly. I meddle not with those Bedlam-phancies, all
whose conceits are antiques, but leave them for the Physician to purge with hellebore.</p>

A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having led a company of children beyond their usuall journey, they began to be weary, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried to him to carry them; which because of their multitude he could not do, but told them he would
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65716:99"/>
provide them horses to ride on. Then cutting little wands out of the hedge as nagges for them, and a great stake as a gelding for himself, thus mounted Phancie put mettall into their legs, and they came cheerfully home.</p>

But if the Prince himself be pleased not onely to wink at them with his permission, but also to smile on them with his encouragement, there is great hope of successe: for then he will grant them some immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and priviledges.

                     <head>CHAP. 17. Of Contentment.</head>
                     <p>IT is one property which (they say) is required of those who seek for the Philosophers stone, that they must not do it with any covetous desire to be rich; for otherwise they shall never find it. But most true it is that whosoever would have this jewell of Contentment (which turns all into Gold, yea Want into Wealth) must come with minds devested of all ambitious and covetous thoughts, else are they never likely to obtain it. We will describe Contentment first negatively:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is not a senselesse stupidity what becomes of our outward estates.</hi>

                           <hi>Maxime</hi> 1</note> God would have us take notice of all accidents which from him happen to us in worldly matters. Had the Martyrs had the dead palsie before they went to the stake to be burnt, their suffrings had not been so glorious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is not a word-braving,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2</note> 
                        <hi>or scorning of all wealth in discourse.</hi> Generally those who boast most of Contentment have least of it. Their very boasting shews that they want something, and basely beg it, namely Commendation. These in their language are like unto kites in their fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which mount in the aire so scornfully, as if they disdaind to stoop for the whole earth, fetching about many stately circuits: but what is the Spirit these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers with so many circles intend to raise? a poore chicken, or perchance a piece of carrion: And so the height of the others proud boasting will humble it self for a little base gain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But it is an humble and willing submitting our selves to Gods pleasure in all conditions.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3</note> One observeth (how truly I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute not) that the French naturally have so elegant and gracefull a carriage, that what posture of body so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in their salutations, or what fashion of attire soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65716:107"/>
they are pleased to take on them it doth so beseem them, that one would think nothing can become them better. Thus Contentment makes men carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves gracefully in wealth, want, in health, sicknesse, freedome, fetters, yea what condition soever God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">4</note>
                        <hi>It is no breach of Contentment for men to complain that their suffrings are unjust, as offered by men</hi>: provided they allow them for just, as proceeding from God, who useth wicked mens injustice to correct his children. But let us take heed that we bite not so high at the handle of the rod, as to fasten on his hand that holds it; our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments mounting so high as to quarrell with God himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">5</note>
                        <hi>It is no breach of Contentment for men by lawfull means to seek the removall of their miserie, and bettering of their estate.</hi> Thus men ought by industrie to endeavour the getting of more wealth, ever submitting themselves to Gods will. A lazy hand is no argument of a Contented heart. Indeed he that is idle, and followeth after vain persons shall have enough, but how? Prov. 28.19. <hi>Shall have poverty enough.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">6</note>
                        <hi>Gods Spirit is the best Schoolmaster to teach Contentment</hi>: A Schoolmaster who can make good Scholars, and warrant the successe as well as his endeavour. The School of Sanctified afflictions is the best place to learn Contentment in: I say, Sanctified; for naturally, like resty horses, we go the worse for the beating, if God blesse not afflictions unto us.</p>

                        <hi>Contentment consisteth not in adding more fuell, but in taking away some fire</hi>: not in multiplying of wealth, but in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting mens desires. Worldly riches, like nuts, teare many clothes in getting them, spoil many teeth in cracking them, but fill no belly with eating them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing onely the stomach with toughnes, and filling the guts with windinesse: Yea our souls may sooner surfet then be satisfied with earthly things. He that at

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pious meditations much advantage Contentment in adversitie.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">9</note> Such as these are, to consider first, that more are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us then above us; secondly, many of Gods dear Saints have been in the same condition; thirdly, we want rather superfluities then necessities; fourthly, the more we have the more we must account for; fifthly, earthly blessings through mans corruption are more prone to be abused then well used. In some fenny places in England, where they are much troubled with gnats, they use to hang up dung in the midst of the room for a bait for the gnats to flie to, and so catch them with a net provided for the purpose. Thus the devil ensnareth the souls of many men by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with the muck and dung of this world, to undo them eternally; sixthly, we must leave all earthly wealth at our death, <hi>and riches avail not in the day of wrath.</hi> But as some use to fill up the stamp of light gold with dirt, thereby to make it weigh the heavier; so it seems some men load their souls with thick clay, to make them passe the better in Gods ballance, but all to no purpose; seventhly, the lesse we have, the lesse it will grieve us to leave this world; lastly, it is the will of God, and therefore both for his glory and our good, whereof we ought to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I have heard how a Gentleman travelling in a misty morning ask'd of a Shepherd (such men
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65716:108"/>
being generally skill'd in the Physiognomie of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens) what weather it would be? <hi>It will be,</hi> said the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, <hi>what weather shall please me</hi>: and being courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously requested to expresse his meaning, <hi>Sir</hi> (saith he) <hi>it shall be what weather pleaseth God, and what weather pleaseth God, pleaseth me.</hi> Thus Contentment maketh men to have even what they think fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, because submitting to Gods will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, A man ought to be like unto a cunning Actour, who if he be enjoyned to represent the person of some Prince or Nobleman, does it with a grace and comlinesse; if by and by he be commanded to lay that aside, and play the Begger, he does that as willingly and as well. But as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in a Tragedy (to spare naming the Person and Place) that one being to act Theseus, in <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Furens,</hi> coming out of Hell, could not for a long time be perswaded to wear old sooty clothes proper to his part, but would needs come out of Hell in a white Satin doublet: so we are generally loath, and it goes against flesh and blood, to live in a low and poore estate, but would fain act in richer and handsomer clothes, till Grace, with much adoe, subdues our rebellious stomachs to Gods will.</p>

                        <hi>It is a very difficult thing to serve the times</hi>; they change so frequently, so suddenly, and sometimes so violently from one extreme to another. The times under Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian were Pagan; under Constantine, Christian; under Constantius, Arian; under Julian, Apostate; under Jovian, Christian again, and all within the age of man, the term of seventie years. And would it not have wrench'd and spraind his soul with short turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who in all these should have been of the Religion <hi>for the time being</hi>?</p>

                        <hi>Time-servers are oftentimes left in the lurch.</hi> If they do not onely give their word for the times in their constant discourses, but also give their bands for them, and write in their defence. Such, when the times turn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to another extreme, are left in the briers, and come off very hardly from the bill of their hands; If they turn again with the times none will trust them; for who will make a staff of an osier?</p>

                        <note place="margin">12</note>
                        <hi>Miserable will be the condition of such Time-servers when

their Master is taken from them.</hi> When as the Angel swore Rev. 10.6. that <hi>Time shall be no longer.</hi> Therefore is it best serving of him who is eternity, a Master that can ever protect us.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, he that intends to meet with one in a great Fair, and knows not where he is, may sooner find him by standing still in some principall place there, then by traversing it up and down. Take thy stand on some good ground in Religion, and keep thy station in a fixed posture, never hunting after the times to follow them, and an hundred to one, they will come to thee once in thy lifetime.</p>

                        <hi>Moderation is not an halting betwixt two opinions,</hi>

                        <hi>when the through-believing of one of them is necessary to salvation</hi>: no pity is to be shown to such voluntary cripples. We reade (Acts 27.12.) of an Haven in Crete <hi>which lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South-West, and towards the North-West</hi>: strange, that it could have part of two opposite points, North and South, sure, it must be very winding. And thus some mens souls are in such intricate postures, they lay towards the Papists, and towards the Protestants; such we count not of a moderate judgement, but of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate unsettlednesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nor is it a lukewarmnesse in those things wherein Gods glory is concernd.</hi>

Discretion puts a difference betwixt things absolutely necessary to salvation to be done and believed, and those which are of a second sort and lower form, wherein more liberty and latitude is allowed. In main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whereof, the stiffnesse of the judgement is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and suppled with charity towards his neighbour. The lukewarm man eyes onely his own ends, and particular profit; the moderate man aims at the good of others, and unity of the Church.</p>

                     <p>GRavity is the ballast of the soul, which keeps the mind steddy. It is either true, or counterfeit.</p>

                        <hi>and heavinesse of temper, is sometimes mistaken for true Gravity.</hi> In such men in whose constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one of the tetrarch Elements <hi>fire</hi> may seem to be omitted. These sometimes not onely cover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but get praise:

                     <p>They do wisely to counterfeit a reservednesse, and to keep their chests alwayes lock'd, not for fear any should steal treasure thence, but lest some should look in, and see that there is nothing within them. But they who are born Eunuchs deserve no such great commendation for their chastity. Wonder not so much that such men are grave, but wonder at them if they be not grave.</p>

Yea God may seem to have permitted the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of primitive History, lest men should be too studious in reading, and observant in practising the customes of that age, even to the neglecting and undervaluing of his written Word.</p>

                        <p>Take then another Answer, namely in denying they had no Temples, they meant it in the same notion wherein they were interrogated, to wit, they had no Temples like the Pagans for Heathen Gods, no <hi>claustra Numinum,</hi> wherein the Deity they served was imprisoned.

                        <hi>Those that may, must frequent the publick Churches.</hi> Such as nowadayes are ambitious of conventicles are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty: for as it had been desperate madnesse in time of persecution publickly to resort to Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, so it is no lesse unthankfulnesse to God now to serve him in woods and holes, not taking notice of the liberty of the Gospel, which he gratiously hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed; yea such people in effect deny the King to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, but make him a Persecuter rather, in that they dare not avouch the truth in the face of his Authority. If it be good they do (thanks be to God) it may be done any where; if bad, it must be done no where. Besides, by their voluntary private meetings, they give occasions to many to supect their actions there: And grant them unjustly traduced for their behaviour therein, yet can they not justly be excused, because they invite slaunderous tongues to censure them, in not <hi>providing for honest things in the sight of men,</hi> and clearing Gods service as well from the suspicion as from the guilt of any dishonesty.</p>

And though Solomon had no mines of Gold and Silver in his own land, yet had he the spoils and gifts of the neighbouring nations, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65716:122"/>
once in three years the golden land of Ophir came swimming to Hierusalem. God being the Landlord of the earth, Solomon was then his Receiver, to whom the World payed in her rent, to build his Temple. And was not he a most wealthy King, <hi>in whose dayes silver was nothing accounted of;</hi> seeing in our dayes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of both Indyes hath so much brasse coin cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his Court? As for Josephus his conceit, that the second edition of the Temple by Zorobabel, as it was new forrelled and filleted with gold by Herod, was a statelier volume then that first of Solomon, it is too weak a surmise to have a confutation fastned to it.</p>

And though it be true, that grave and pious men do study for learning sake, and embrace virtue for it self, yet it is as true that youth (which is the season when learning is gotten) is not without ambition, nor will ever take pains to excell in any thing, when there is not some hope of excelling others in reward and dignity. And what reason is it that whilest Law and Physick bring great portions to such as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65716:125"/>

In after-ages men will rather bind their sonnes to one gainfull, then to seven liberall Sciences: onely the lowest of the people would be made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which cannot otherwise subsist; and it will be bad when Gods Church is made a Sanctuary onely for men of desperate estates to take refuge in it.</p>

If not, yet tire not for want of a spurre: do something for love, and not all for money; for love of God, of goodnesse, of the godly, of a good conscience. Know 't is better to want means, then to detain them; the one onely suffers, the other deeply sinnes: and it is as dangerous a persecution to religion, to draw the fewell from it, as to cast water on it. Comfort thy self that another world will pay this worlds debts, <hi>and great is thy reward with God in heaven.</hi> A reward, in respect of his promise; a gift, in respect of thy worthlesnesse: And yet the lesse thou lookest at it, the surer thou shalt find it, if labouring with thy self to serve God for himself, in respect of whom even hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self is but a sinister end.</p>

He therefore that is known to his Prince, starts in the half way of his race to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. A notable fellow, and a souldier to Alexander, finding this first admission to be the greatest difficulty, put feathers into his nose and eares, and danced about the Court in an antique fashion, till the strangenesse of the Shew brought the King himself to be a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.

Nero, though indeed but a Fidler, counted himself as well Emperour of Musick as of Rome; and his Followers too grossely did sooth him up in the admiration of his skill in that Art. But the most temperate Princes love to taste the sweetnesse of their own praises (if not overluscious with flattery) where their own deserts lay the groundwork, and their Favourites give the varnish to their commendations.</p>

                     <p>To conclude, A Favourite is a trade, whereof he that breaks once seldome sets up again. Rare are the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those who have compounded and thrived well afterwards. Mean men are like underwood, which the Law calls <hi>sylva caedua, quae</hi>

                     <p>Now to shew the inconstancie of Greatnesse not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with virtue, we will first insist in a remarkable pattern in holy Scripture. Next will we produce a parallel of two Favourites in our English Court, living in the same time, and height of honour with their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne, the one through his vitiousnesse ending in misery, the other by his virtuous demeanour shining bright to his death: for I count it a wrong to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to import presidents out of forrein Histories, when our home-Chronicles afford us as plentifull and proper examples.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 2. The life of <hi>HAMAN.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAman the sonne of Amedatha, of the kinred of Agag, and people of Amalek, was highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Ahasuerus Emperour of Persia. I find not what pretious properties he had, sure he was a pearl in the eye of Ahasuerus, who commanded all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to do lowly reverence unto him: onely Mordecai the Jew excepted himself from that rule, denying him the payment of so humble an observance.</p>
                     <p>I fathome not the depth of Mordecai's refusall: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance Haman interpreted this reverence farther then it was intended, as a divine honour, and therefore Mordecai would not blow wind into so empty a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and be accessary to puff him up with self-conceit; or because Amalek was the devils first-fruits, which first brake the peace with Israel, and God commanded an antipathy against them; or he had some private countermand from God not to reverence him. What ever it was, I had rather accuse my self of ignorance, then Mordecai of pride.</p>
                     <p>Haman swells at this neglect. Will not his knees bow? his neck shall break with an halter. But oh, this was but poore and private revenge: one lark will not fill the belly of such a vultur. What if Mordecai will not stoop to Haman, must Haman stoop to Mordecai to be revenged of him alone? wherefore he plotteth with the Kings sword to cut off the whole Nation of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Repairing to Ahasuerus, he requested that all the Jews might be destroyed. He backs his petition with three arguments: first, It was a scattered Nation; had they inhabited one entire countrey, their extirpation would have weakned his empire, but being dispersed, though kill'd every where, they would have been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65716:131"/>
no where; secondly, his Empire would be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form when this irregular people, not observing his Laws, were taken away; thirdly, ten thousand talents Haman would pay into the bargain into the Kings Treasure.</p>
                     <p>What, out of his own purse? I see his pride was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his covetousnesse; and spightfull men count their revenge a purchase which cannot be overbought: or perchance this money should arise out of the confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their goods. Thus Ahasuerus should lock all the Jews into his chest, and by help of Hamans Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry convert them into silver.</p>
                     <p>See how this grand destroyer of a whole Nation pleads the Kings profit. Thus our punie depopulatours alledge for their doings the Kings and countreys good; and we will believe them, when they can perswade us that their private coffers are the Kings exchequer. But never any wounded the Commonwealth, but first they kiss'd it, pretending the publick good.</p>
                     <p>Hamans silver is drosse with Ahasuerus: onely his pleasure is currant with him. If Haman will have it so, so it shall freely be; he will give him and not sell him his favour. 'Tis wofull when great Judges see parties accused by other mens eyes, but condemne them by their own mouthes: and now Posts were sent thorow out all Persia to execute the Kings cruell decree.</p>
                     <p>I had almost forgotten how before this time Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai had discovered the treason, which two of the Kings Chamberlains had plotted against him; which good service of his, though not presently paid, yet was scored up in the Chronicles, not rewarded but recorded, where it slept till a due occasion did awake it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance Hamans envy kept it from the Kings know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and Princes sometimes to reward the desert of men want not mind, but minding of it</p>
                     <p>To proceed: See the Jews all pitifully pensive, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65716:131"/>
fasting in sackcloth and ashes, even to Queen Esther her self, which (unknown to Haman) was one of that nation. And to be brief, Esther invites Ahasuerus and Haman to a banquet (whose life shall pay the reckoning) and next day they are both invited to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Mean time Haman provides a gallows of fifty cubits high to hang Mordecai on. Five cubits would have serv'd the turn; and had it took effect, the height of the gallows had but set his soul so much the farther on his journey towards heaven. His stomach was so sharp set, he could not stay till he had din'd on all the Jews, but first he must break his fast on Mordecai; and fit it was this bell-weather should be sacrificed before the rest of the flock: wherefore he comes to the Court to get leave to put him to death.</p>
                     <p>The night before Ahasuerus had passed without sleep. The Chronicles are called for, either to invite slumber, or to entertain waking with the lesse tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Gods hand in the margin points the Reader to the place where Mordecai's good service was related; and Ahasuerus asketh Haman (newly come into the presence) what shall be done to the man whom the King will honour?</p>
                     <p>Haman being now (as he thought) to measure his own happinesse, had been much too blame if he made it not of the largest size. He cuts out a garment of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, royall both for matter and making, for Mordecai to wear. By the Kings command he becomes Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai's Herauld and Page, lacquying by him riding on the Kings steed (who he hoped by this time should have mounted the wooden horse) and then pensive in heart hasts home to bemoan himself to his friends. Hamans wife proves a true Prophetesse, presaging his ruine. If the feet of a Favourite begin to slip on the steep hill of Honour, his own weight will down with him to the bottome: once past noon with him, it is presently night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65716:132"/>For at the next feast Ahasuerus is mortally incens'd against him for plotting the death of Esther, with the rest of her people. (For had his project succeeded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Jew had not been spared for being a Queen, but the Queen had been killed for being a Jew.) Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a carelesse sorrowfull posture, more minding his life then his lust, had cast himself on the Queens bed. <hi>Will he force the Queen also</hi> (said Ahasuerus) <hi>before me in the house?</hi> These words rang his passing-bell in the Court, and according to the Persian fashion they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his face, putting him in a winding sheet that was dead in the Kings favour. The next news we hear of him is, that by exchange Haman inherits the gibbet of Mordecai, and Mordecai the house and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Haman, the decree against the Jews being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reversed.</p>

From Ipswich he went to Oxford, and from thence was preferred to be Schoolmaster to the Marques of Dorset's children, where he first learnt to be imperious over Noble bloud. By the stairs of a Parsonage or two he climbed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65716:133"/>
up at last into the notice of Fox, Bishop of Winchester, and was received to be his Secretary.</p>
                     <p>There was at that time a faction at Court betwixt Bishop Fox and Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey. The Bishop being very old was scarce able to make good his party; yet it grieved him not so much to stoop to Nature as to the Earl his Corrivall: wherefore not able to manage the matter himself, he was contented to be the stock whereon Wolsey should be graffed, whom he made heir to his favour, commending him to King Henrie the seventh for one fit to serve a King, and command others: And hereupon he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Court.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, when Henrie his sonne came to the Crown, Wolsey quickly found the length of his foot, and fitted him with an easie shoe. He perswaded him that it was good accepting of pleasure whilest youth tender'd it: let him follow his sports, whilest Wolsey would undertake every night briefly to represent unto him all matters of moment which had passed the Counsell-table. For Princes are to take State-affairs not in the masse and whole bulk of them, but onely the spirits thereof skilfully extracted. And hereupon the King referred all matters to Wolsey's managing, on whom he conferr'd the Bishopricks of Duresme, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, and York, with some other spirituall promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Nothing now hindred Wolsey's prospect to overlook the whole Court but the head of Edward Stafford Duke of Buckingham, who was high in birth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and estate. For as for Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, he stood not in Wolsey's way, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides then against him: Brandon being the Kings companion in pleasures, Wolsey his counsellour in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; Brandon Favourite to Henrie, Wolsey to the King. Wolsey takes this Buckingham to task, who (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a brave Gentleman) was proud and popular; and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65716:133"/>
that tower is easily undermin'd whose foundation is hollow. His own folly with Wolsey's malice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him. Vainglory ever lyeth at an open guard, and giveth much advantage of play to her enemies. The Duke is condemned of high treason, though ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrivall with the King for his Clothes then his Crown, being excessively brave in apparell.</p>
                     <p>The ax that kills Buckingham frights all others, who turn contesting into complying with our Archbishop, now Cardinall, Legate <hi>à latere,</hi> and Lord-Chancellour. All the Judges stood at the barre of his devotion. His displeasure more feared then the Kings, whose anger though violent was placable; the Cardinalls of lesse furie, but more malice: yet in matters of Judicature he behaved himself commendably. I heare no widows sighes, nor see orphans tears in our Chronicles caused by him: sure in such cases wherein his private ends made him not a party, he was an excellent Justicer, as being too proud to be bribed, and too strong to be overborn.</p>
                     <p>Next he aspires to the Triple Grown; he onely wants Holinesse, and must be Pope. Yet was it a great labour for a Tramountain to climbe over the Alps to S. Peters Chair; a long leap from York to Rome, and therefore he needed to take a good rise. Besides he used Charles the fift, Emperour, for his staff, gold he gave to the Romish Cardinalls, and they gave him golden promises, so that at last Wolsey perceived, both the Emperour and the Court of Rome delay'd and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him.</p>
                     <p>He is no fox whose den hath but one hole: Wolsey finding this way stopt, goes another way to work, and falls off to the French King, hoping by his help to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his desires. However if he help not himself, he would hinder Charles the Emperours designes; and revenge is a great preferment. Wherefore covertly he seeks to make a divorce betwixt Queen Katharine,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65716:134"/>
Dowager, the Emperours Aunt, and King Henrie the eighth his Master.</p>
                     <p>Queen Katharines age was above her Husbands, her gravity above her age; more pious at her beads then pleasant in her bed, a better woman then a wife, and a fitter wife for any Prince then King Henrie. Wolsey by his instruments perswades the King to put her away, pleading they were so contiguous and near in kinred, they might not be made continuous (one flesh) in marriage, because she before had been wife to Prince Arthur the Kings brother. Besides, the King wanted a male heir, which he much desired.</p>
                     <p>Welcome whisperings are quickly heard. The King embraceth the motion: the matter is enter'd in the Romish Court, but long delayed; the Pope first mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divorce most of the gold from England in this tedious suit. But here Wolsey miscarried in the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his policy. For he hoped upon the divorce of King Henrie from Queen Katharine his wife (which with much adoe was effected) to advance a marriage betwixt him and the King of France his sister, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their nuptiall ring to wed the King of France eternally to himself, and mould him for farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes: whereas contrary to his expectation King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fell in love with Anna Bullen, a Lady whole beauty exceeded her birth (though honourable) wit her beauty, piety all; one for his love not lust, so that there was no gathering of green fruit from her till marriage had ripened it: whereupon the King took her to wife.</p>
                     <p>Not long after followed the ruine of the Cardinall, caused by his own vitiousnesse, heightned by the envy of his Adversaries. He was caught in a Premunire for procuring to be Legate <hi>de latere,</hi> and advancing the Popes power against the Laws of the Realm; and eight other Articles were framed against him, for which we report the Reader to our <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65716:134"/>
main was, his <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> wherein he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his old profession of a Schoolmaster, and forgot his present estate of a Statesman. But as for some things laid to his charge, his friends plead, that where potent malice is Promoter, the accusations shall not want proof, though the proof may want truth. Well, the broad seal was taken from him, and some of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Preferments. Yet was he still left Bishop of Winchester, and Archbishop of York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the Kings goodnesse hitherto might have seemd rather to ease him of burthensome greatnesse, then to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of wealth or honour: which whether he did out of love to Wolsey, or fear of the Pope, I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no opinion.</p>
                     <p>Home now went Wolsey into Yorkshire, and lived at his Mannour of Cawood, where he wanted nothing the heart of man could desire for contentment. But great minds count every place a prison, which is not a Kings Court; and just it was that he which would not see his own happinesse, should therefore feel his own misery. He provided for his enstalling Archbishop State equivalent to a Kings Coronation, which his ambition revived other of his misdemeanours, and by command from the King he was arrested by the Earl of Northumberland, and so took his journeys up to London. By the way his soul was rackt betwixt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tidings; now hoysed up with hope of pardon, then instantly let down with news of the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, till at Leicester his heart was broken with these sudden and contrary motions. The Storie goes that he should breath out his soul with speeches to this effect, <hi>Had I been as carefull to serve the God of Heaven, as I have to comply to the will of my earthly King, God would not have left me in mine old age, as the other hath done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His body swell'd after his death, as his mind did whilest he was living, which with other symptomes gave the suspicion that he poysoned himself. It will
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65716:135"/>
suffice us to observe, If a Great man much beloved dyeth suddenly, the report goes that others poysoned him: If he be generally hated, then that he poysoned himself. Sure never did a Great man fall with lesse pity. Some of his own servants with the feathers they got under him flew to other Masters. Most of the Clergy (more pitying his Profession then Person) were glad that the felling of this oke would cause the growth of much underwood.</p>
                     <p>Let Geometricians measure the vastnesse of his mind by the footsteps of his Buildings, Christ-Church White-Hall, Hampton-Court: And no wonder if some of these were not finished, seeing his life was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broken off then ended. Sure King Henrie lived in two of his houses, and lies now in the third, I mean his Tombe at Windsor. In a word, in his prime he was the bias of the Christian world, drawing the bowl thereof to what side he pleased.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 4. The life of <hi>CHARLES BRANDON,</hi> Duke of Suffolk.</head>
                     <p>CHarles Brandon was sonne to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Standerd-bearer to King Henry the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, in whose quarrell he was slain in Bosworth field; wherefore the King counted himself bound in honour and conscience to favour young Charles, whose father spent his last breath to blow him to the haven of victory, and caused him to be brought up with Prince Henrie, his second sonne.</p>
                     <p>The intimacy betwixt them took deep impression in their tender years, which hardned with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time proved indeleble. It was advanced by the sympathy of their active spirits (men of quick and large-striding minds loving to walk together) not to say, that the loosenesse of their youthfull lives made
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65716:135"/>
them the faster friends. Henry, when afterwards King, heaped honours upon him, created him Viscount Lisle, and Duke of Suffolk.</p>
                     <p>Not long after some of the English Nobility got leave to go to the publick Tilting in Paris, and there behav'd themselves right valiantly, though the sullen French would scarce speak a word in their praise. For they conceived it would be an eternall impoverishing of the credit of their Nation, if the honour of the day should be exported by foreiners. But Brandon bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the credit from all, fighting at Barriers with a giant Almain, till he made an earth-quake in that mountain of flesh, making him reel and <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hollinshed, pag</hi> 833.</note> stagger, and many other courses at Tilt he performed to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea, the Lords beheld him not with more envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then the Ladies with gracious eyes, who darted more glaunces in love, then the other ranne spears in anger against him; especially Mary the French Queen, and sister to King Henry the eighth, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proved his wife.</p>
                     <p>For after the death of Lewis the twelfth her husband, King Henry her brother imployed Charles Brandon to bring her over into England; who improved his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice so well that he got her good will to marrie her. Whether his affections were so ambitious to climbe up to her, or hers so courteous as to descend to him (who had been <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>First married to Margaret Nevil, after to Anne, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Brown.</hi>

Then wrote he in humble manner to request King Henries leave to marrie his sister; but knowing that matters of this nature are never sure till finisht, and that leave is sooner got to do such attempts when done already; and wisely considering with himself that there are but few dayes in the Almanack, wherein such <hi>Marriages come in,</hi> and subjects have opportunity to wed Queens, he first married her <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hollinshed, pag.</hi> 836.</note> privately in Paris.</p>
                     <p>King Henrie after the acting of some anger, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65716:136"/>
shewing some state-discontent, was quickly contented therewith; yea the world conceiveth that he <hi>gave this woman to be married to this man,</hi> in sending him on such an imployment. At Calis they were afterward re-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, or if you will their former private marriage pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly solemniz'd, and coming into England liv'd many years in honour and esteem, no lesse dear to his fellow-subjects then his Sovereigne. He was often imployed Generall in Martiall affairs, especially in the warres betwixt the English and French, though the greatest performance on both sides was but mutuall indenting the Dominions each of other with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes.</p>
                     <p>When the divorce of King Henry from Queen Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine was so long in agitation, Brandon found not himself a little agrieved at the Kings expence of time and money: for the Court of Rome in such matters, wherein money is gotten by delayes, will make no more speed then the beast in Brasil, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards call <hi>Pigritia,</hi> which goes no farther in a fortnight then a man will cast a stone. Yea Brandon well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Cardinall Campeius and Wolsey in their Court at Bridewell, wherein the divorce was judicially handled, intended onely to produce a solemn No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, their Court being but the clock set according to the diall at Rome, and the instructions received thence. Wherefore knocking on the table, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the two Cardinalls, he bound it with an oath, That <hi>It was never well in England since Cardinalls had any thing to do therein</hi>: And from that time forward, as an active instrument, he indeavoured the abolishing of the Popes power in England.</p>
                     <p>For he was not onely (as the Papists complain <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sanders. de Schismate Anglicano, p.</hi> 108.</note> of him) a principall agent in that Parliament, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1534. wherein the Popes supremacy was abrogated, but also a main means of the overturning of Abbeys, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that though the head was struck off, yet as long
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65716:136"/>
as that neck and those shoulders remained there would be a continuall appetite of reuniting themselves. Herein his thoughts were more pure from the mixture of covetousnesse then many other imployed in the same service: For after that our eyes, justly dazled at first with the brightnesse of Gods Justice on those viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fraternities, have somewhat recovered themselves, they will serve us to see the greedy appetites of some instruments to feed on Church-morsels.</p>
                     <p>He lived and dyed in the full favour of his Prince, though as Cardinall Pool observed, they who were highest in this Kings favour, their heads were nearest danger. Indeed King Henrie was not very tender in cutting off that joynt, and in his Reigne the ax was seldome wiped, before wetted again with Noble bloud. He dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1544. much beloved, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of all, for his bounty, humility, valour, and all noble virtues, since the heat of his youth was tamed in his reduced age, and lies buried at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</p>

                     <p>TO describe the Statesman at large, is the subject rather of a Volume then a Chapter, and is as farre beyond my power, as wide of my profession. We will not lanch into the deep, but satisfie our selves to sail by the shore, and briefly observe his carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, his King, himself, home-persons, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Princes.</p>

Let not any plead for the contrary Hushai's dealing with Absalom, which strongly favour'd of double-dealing; for what is a question cannot be an argument, seeing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65716:137"/>
the lawfulnesse of his deed therein was never decided; and he is unwise that will venter the state of his soul on the litigious title of such an example. Besides, we must live by Gods precepts, not by the godlies practice. And though God causeth sometimes the sunne of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to shine as well on bad as good projects, yet commonly wicked actions end in shame at the last.</p>

We know what worthy Father wrote his own Retractation; and it matters not though we go back from our word, so we go forward in the truth and a sound judgement.

                        <item>1 When the party discloses himself in his wine: for though it be unlawfull to practise on any to make them drunk, yet no doubt one may make a good use of another mans abusing himself. What they say of the herb Lunaria ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously gathered at some set times, that laid upon any lock, it makes it flie open, is most true of drunkennesse, unbolting the most important se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</item>
                        <item>2 When he discovereth himself in his passions. Physicians to make some small veins in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients arms plump and full, that they may see them the better to let them bloud, use to put them into hot water: so the heat of passion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth many invisible veins in mens hearts to the eye of the beholder; yea the sweat of anger washeth off their paint, and makes them appear in their true colours.</item>
                        <item>3 When accidentally they bolt out speeches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to themselves. More hold is then to be taken of a few words casually uttered, then of set solemn speeches, which rather shew mens arts then their natures, as endited rather from their brains then hearts. The drop of one word may shew more then the stream of an whole oration; and our Statesman by examining such fugitive passages (which have stollen on a sudden out of the parties mouth) arrives at his best intelligence.</item>

Thus is it easie for one to interest and embarque himself in others quarrells, but much difficulty it is to be disengaged from them afterwards.

For although even such gifts tacitly oblige him by way of gratitude to do all good offices to that forein Prince whose Pensioner he is; yet his counsells passe not but with an open abatement, in regard of his known engagements, and so the State is armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the advice of such, who are well known to lean to one side. But secret pensions which flow from forein Princes, like the river Anas in Spain, under ground, not known or discerned, are most mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. The receivers of such will play under-board at the Counsell-table; and the eating and digesting of such outlandish food will by degrees fill their veins with outlandish bloud, even in their very hearts.</p>

                     <p>To conclude: Some plead that dissembling is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the State-craft, upon the presupposition that men must meet with others which dissemble. Yea they hold, that thus to counterfeit, <hi>se defendendo,</hi> against
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65716:140"/>
a crafty corrivall, is no sinne, but a just punishment on our adversary, who first began it. And therefore States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sometimes must use crooked shoes, to fit hurl'd feet. Besides, the honest Politician would quickly be begger'd, if, receiving black money from cheatours, he payes them in good silver, and not in their own coin back again. For my part, I confesse that herein I rather see what then whither to flie; neither able to answer their arguments, nor willing to allow their practice. But what shall I say? They need to have steddy heads who can dive into these gulfs of policy, and come out with a safe conscience. I'le look no longer on these whirl-pools of State, lest my pen turn giddy.</p>

a slander if this worthy man had not been slandred by them: The servant is not above his master; and we know what aspersions their malice sought to cast on the Queen her self.</p>
                     <p>He being first bred in S. Johns Colledge in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, went thence to Grayes Inne (and used it as an Inne indeed, studying there in his Passage to the Court) where he attained good learning in the Laws: yet his skill in fencing made him not daring to quarrell, who in all his life-time neither <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>As for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Edward Montague Lord chief Justice,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65716:141"/>
what he did was by command against his own will, as appears by his written protestation at his death, still in the hands of his honourable posterity. But whilest in this army of offenders, the Nobility in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ront made an escape for themselves, Queen Maries displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure overtook the old Judge in the rere, the good old man being not able with such speed to provide for himself; yea though he had done nothing but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent and command, the rest of the Lords laid load on him, desirous that the Queens anger should send him on an errand to the prison, and thence to the scaffold, to excuse themselves from going on the same message. However, after some imprisonment he was pardon'd; a sufficient argument, that the Queen conceived him to concurre passively in that action.</p>
                     <p>In Queen Elizabeths dayes he was made Secretary of State, Master of the Wards, Lord Treasurer, and at last after long service Baron of Burleigh. For the Queen honoured her honours in conferring them sparingly, thereby making Titles more substantiall, wherewith she payed many for their service. The best demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his care in stewarding her Treasure was this, that the Queen, vying gold and silver with the King of Spain, had money or credit, when the other had neither; her Exchequer, though but a pond in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, holding water, when his river, fed with a spring from the Indies, was dreined dry.</p>
                     <p>In that grand faction betwixt Leicester and Sussex, he meddled not openly, though 'tis easie to tell whom he wish'd the best to. Indeed this cunning Wrestler would never catch hold to grapple openly with Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester (as having somewhat the disadvantage of him both in height and strength) but as they ran to their severall goles, if they chanced to meet, Burleigh would fairly give him a trip, and be gone; and the Earl had many a rub laid in his way, yet never saw who put it there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65716:142"/>Tis true, the Sword-men accus'd him as too cold in the Queens credit, and backward in fighting against forein enemies. Indeed he would never engage the State in a warre, except necessity, or her Majesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, sounded the alarm: But no reason he should be counted an enemie to the Sparks of Valour, who was so carefull to provide them fewel, and pay the Souldier. Otherwise, in vain do the brows frown, the eyes spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, the tongue threaten, the fist bend, and the arm strike, except the belly be fed.</p>
                     <p>The Queen reflected her favour highly upon him, counting him both her Treasurer, and her principall Treasure. She would cause him alwayes to sit down in her presence, because troubled with the gout, and used to tell him: <hi>My Lord, we make much of you, not for your bad legs, but for your good head.</hi> This caused him to be much envied of some great ones at Court; and at one time no fewer then the <note n="*" place="margin">

But the Queen understanding hereof, and standing, as I may say, in the very prison-doore, quash'd all their designes, and freed him from the mischief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against him.</p>
                     <p>He was a good friend to the Church, as then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law; he used to advise his eldest sonne Thomas never to bestow any great cost, or to build any great house on an Impropriation, as fearing the foundation might fail hereafter.

                     <p>No man was more pleasant and merry at meals; and he had a pretty wit-rack in himself, to make the dumbe to speak, to draw speech out of the most sullen and <note n="*" place="margin">

For forein intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, though he traded sometimes on the stock of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Walsingham, yet wanted he not a plentifull bank of his own. At night when he put off his gown, he used to say, <hi>Lie there, Lord Treasurer,</hi> and bidding adieu to all State-affairs, disposed himself to his quiet rest.</p>
                     <p>Some looking on the estate he left, have wondered that it was so great, and afterwards wondred more that it was so little, having considered what Offices he had, and how long he enjoyed them. His harvest lasted every day for above thirty years together, wherein he allowed some of his servants the same courtesie Boaz granted to Ruth, to glean even among the sheaves, and to suffer some handfulls also to fall on purpose for them, whereby they raised great estates.</p>
                     <p>To draw to a conclusion: There arose a great questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in State, whether warre with Spain should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, or a peace drawn up? The Sword and Gown-men brought weighty arguments on both sides, stamping also upon them with their private interests, to make them more heavy: Burleigh was all against warre, now old, being desirous to depart in peace, both private in his Conscience, and publick in the State. But his life was determined before the question was fully decided. In his sicknesse the Queen often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited him, a good plaister to asswage his pain, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to prolong his life; so that, <hi>Cum satis naturae, satisque gloriae, putriae autem non satis vixisset,</hi> in the seventy seventh yeare of his age, <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. he exchanged this
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65716:143"/>
life for a better. God measured his outward happinesse not by an ordinary standard: How many great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in State set in a cloud, whereas he shined to the last? Herein much is to be ascribed to the Queens constancy, who to confute the observation of Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ficklenesse, where her favour did light it did lodge; more to his own temper and moderation, whereas violent &amp; boysterous meddlers in State cripple themselves with aches in their age; most to Gods goodnesse, who honoureth them that honour him. He saw Thomas his eldest sonne richly married to an honourable coheir; Robert, able to stand alone in Court, having a competent portion of favour, which he knew thriftily to improve, being a pregnant profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in State-discipline.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 8. The life of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>JOHN MARKHAM.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IOhn Markham was born at Markham in Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamshire, descended of an ancient and worthy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. He employed his youth in the studying of the Municipall Law of this realm, wherein he attained to such eminencie, that King Edward the fourth Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and made him Lord chief <note n="*" place="margin">13. <hi>Maii.</hi> 1. <hi>Edwardi.</hi> 4.</note> Justice of the Kings Bench in the place of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Fortescue, that learned and upright Judge, who fled away with King Henrie the sixth.</p>
                     <p>Yet Fortescue was not miss'd, because Markham succeeded him: and that losse, which otherwise could not be repair'd, now could not be perceiv'd. For though these two Judges did severally lean to the sides of Lancaster and York, yet both sate upright in matters of Judicature.</p>
                     <p>We will instance and insist on one memorable act of our Judge, which though single in it self, was plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in the concernings thereof. And let the Reader know, that I have not been carelesse to search, though unhappy not to find, the originall Record, perchance abolished on purpose, and silenced for telling tales to the disgrace of great ones. We must now be contented to write this Story out of the English Chronicles; <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> and let him die of drougth without pity, who will not quench his thirst at the river, because he cannot come at the fountain.</p>
                     <p>King Edward the fourth having married into the family of the Woodvills (Gentlemen of more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity then wealth, and of higher spirits then fortunes) thought it fit for his own honour to bestow honour upon them: But he could not so easily provide them of wealth, as titles. For honour he could derive from himself, like light from a candle, without any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65716:145"/>
of his own lustre; whereas wealth flowing from him, as water from a fountain, made the spring the shallower. Wherefore he resolved to cut down some prime subjects, and to engraff the Queens kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into their estates, which otherwise like suckers must feed on the stock of his own Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>There was at this time one S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Cook, late Lord Maior of London, and Knight of the Bath, one who had well lick'd his fingers under Queen Margaret (whose Wardroper he was, and customer of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton) a man of a great estate. It was agreed that he should be accused of high Treason, and a Commission of Oyer and Terminer granted forth to the Lord Maior, the Duke of Clarence, the Earl of Warwick, the Lord Rivers, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Markham, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. John Fogg, &amp;c. to try him in Guild Hall: And the King by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate instructions to the Judge appear'd so farre, that Cook, though he was not, must be found guilty, and if the Law were too short, the Judge must stretch it to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>The fault laid to his charge was for lending moneys to Queen Margaret, wife to King Henrie the sixth; the proof, was the confession of one Hawkins, who being rack'd in the Tower had confessed so much. The Counsell for the King, hanging as much weight on the smallest wier as it would hold, aggravated each particular, &amp; by their Rhetoricall flashes blew the fault up to a great height. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Cook pleaded for himself, that Hawkins indeed upon a season came to him, and requested him to lend one thousand marks, upon good security. But he desired first to know for whom the money should be: and understanding it was for Queen Margaret, denyed to lend any money, though at last the said Hawkins descended so low as to require but one hundred pounds, and departed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any peny lent him.</p>
                     <p>Judge Markham in a grave speech did recapitulate,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65716:146"/>
select and collate the materiall points on either side, shewing that the proof reached not the charge of high Treason, and misprision of Treason was the highest it could amount to, and intimated to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to be tender in matter of life, and discharge good consciences.</p>
                     <p>The Jurie being wise men (whose apprehensions could make up an whole sentence of every nod of the Judge) saw it behoved them to draw up Treason into as narrow a compasse as might be, lest it became their own case; for they lived in a troublesome world, wherein the cards were so shuffled, that two Kings were turn'd up trump at once, which amazed men how to play their games. Whereupon they acquitted the prisoner of high Treason, and found him guilty, as the Judge directed.</p>
                     <p>Yet it cost S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Cook, before he could get his libertie, eight hundred pounds to the Queen, and eight thousand pounds to the King: A summe in that age more sounding like the ransome of a Prince, then the fine of a Subject. Besides, the Lord Rivers (the Queens Father) had, during his Imprisonment, despoyled his houses, one in the city, another in the countrey of plate and furniture, for which he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a penie recompence. Yet God righted him of the wrongs men did him, by blessing the remnant of his estate to him, and his posterity, which still flourish at Giddy Hall in Essex.</p>
                     <p>As for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Markham, the Kings displeasure fell so heavy on him, that he was outed of his place, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Billing put in his room, though the one lost that Office with more honour then the other got it; and gloried in this, that though the King could make him no Judge, he could not make him no upright Judge. He lived privately the rest of his dayes, having (besides the estate got by his practice) fair lands by Margaret his wife, daughter and coheir

                     <p>Being made a Presbyter in the Church of Hippo, this great favour was allowed him, to preach constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though in the presence of <note n="*" place="margin">

Yea, S.

Out of Spain they came into Africa, and massacred all before them. The neighbouring villages like little children did flie to Hippo the mother-City for succour: thirteen moneths was Hippo besieged by the Gothes, and S. Augustine being therein prayed to God either to remove the siege, or to give the Christians therein patience to suffer, or to take him out of this miserable world, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and dyed in the third moneth of the siege.</p>
                     <p>Falling very sick (besides the disease of age and grief) he lay languishing a pretty time, and took order that none should come to him save when his meat was brought, or Physicians visited him, that so he might have elbow-room the more freely to put off the clothes of his mortality.</p>
                     <p>The motion of Piety in him (by custome now made naturall) was <hi>velocior in fine,</hi> daily breathing out most pious Ejaculations. He died intestate, not for lack of time to make a will, but means to bestow, having formerly passed his soul to God, whilest his body of course bequeathed it self to the earth. As for the books of his own making, a treasure beyond estimation, he carefully consigned them to severall Libraries. He dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the seventy sixth yeare of his age, having lived a Bishop almost fourty years. Thus a Saint of God, like an oke, may be cut down in a moment; but how many years was he a growing! Not long after his death the City of Hippo was sack'd by the Gothes, it being no wonder if Troy was taken, when the Palladium was first fetch'd away from it.</p>

                     <p>He was after chosen Master of Penbroke Hall, and kept the same whilest Bishop of Rochester and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, till outed in the first of Queen Marie. Not that he was covetous to hold his place in the Colledge, but the Colledge ambitious to hold him; as who would willingly part with a jewell.

and yet is it none, for 'tis necessary. I have within the narrow scantling of my experimentall remembrance observed strange alteration in the worlds valuing of those learned men which lived in that age; and take it plainly without welt or gard, for he that smarts for speaking truth hath a playster in his own conscience.</p>
                     <p>When I was a child I was possessed with a reverend esteem of them, as most holy and pious men, dying Martyrs in the dayes of Queen Marie for profession of the truth; which opinion having from my Parents ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken quiet possession of my soul, they must be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible reasons which eject it.</p>
                     <p>Since that time they have been much cried down in the mouthes of many, who making a <hi>Coroners enquest</hi> upon their death, have found them little better then <hi>Felons de se,</hi> dying in their own bloud, for a mere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, <hi>de modo,</hi> of the manner of the Presence, and a Sacrifice in the Sacrament, who might easily with one small distinction have knockt off their fetters, &amp; saved their lives. By such the Coronet of Martyrdome is pluckt off from their memories; and others more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate equally part their death betwixt their enemies cruelty, and their own over-forwardnesse.</p>

However their reall worth flotes not with peoples phancies, no more then a rock in the sea rises and falls with the tide: S. Paul is still S. Paul, though the Lycaonians now would sacrifice to him, and presently after would sacrifice him: These Bishops, Ministers, and Lay-people, which were put to death in Queen Maries dayes, were worthy Saints of God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and godly men, but had their faults, failings, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.

                     <p>But to return to Ridley: One of the greatest things objected against him, was his counsell to King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (which the good Prince wash'd away with his tears) about tolerating the Masse for Princesse Mary, at the intercession of Charles the fifth Emperour, which how great it was, let the indifferent party give

                     <p>Another fault, wherewith he was charged, was that wofull and unhappy discord betwixt him and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishop Hooper, about the wearing of some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall garments at his consecration (then in use) which Ridley press'd, and Hooper refused with equall violence, as being too many, rather loading then gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him; and so affectedly grave, that they were light again.

Sure it is, Ridley and Hooper were afterwards cordially reconciled; and let not their discords pierce farther then their reconciliation: The worst is, mens eyes are never made sound with the clearnesse, but often are made sore with the bleernesse of other mens eyes in their company.

Indeed he condescended to peoples ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; and many men unjustly count those low in learning, who indeed do but stoop to their Auditours. Let me see any of our sharp Wits do that with the edge, which his bluntnesse did with the back of the knife, and perswade so many to restitution of ill-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods. Though he came after Ridley to the stake, he got before him to heaven: his body, made tinder by age, was no sooner touch'd by the fire, but instantly this old Simeon had his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> and brought the news to heaven that his brother was following after.</p>
                     <p>But Ridley suffered with farre more pain, the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him being not well made: And yet one would think that age should be skilfull in making such bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, as being much practised in them. The Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that was given him did him little service, and his Brother-in-law, out of desire to rid him out of pain, encreased it, (great grief will not give men leave to be wise with it) heaping fewell upon him to no purpose; so that neither the fagots which his enemies anger, nor his Brothers good will cast upon him, made the fire to burn kindly.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, not much before, his dear friend Master <note n="*" place="margin">

Of all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in those dayes, these two endured most pain, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true that each of them,
<q>
                           <l>Quaerebat in ignibus ignes:</l>

Both desiring to burn, and yet both their upper parts were but Confessours, when their lower parts were Martyrs, and burnt to ashes: Thus God, where he hath given the stronger faith, he layeth on the stronger pain. And so we leave them going up to Heaven, like Eliah, in a chariot of fire.</p>

                        <item>1 It is clear: in all points necessary to Salvation, except to such whose eyes are blinded.</item>
                        <item>2 It is true: not like those false glasses some Ladyes dresse themselves by. And how common is flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at Court, when even glasses have learnt to be parasites?</item>
                        <item>3 It is large; presenting all spots Cap-a-pe, behind and before, within and without.</item>
                        <item>4 It is durable: though in one sense it is broken too often (when Gods Laws are neglected) yet it will last to break them that break it, and <hi>one tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thereof shall not fall to the ground.</hi>

A Ladyes credit is of equall nicenesse, a small touch may wound and kill it; which makes her very cautious what company she keeps. The Latine tongue seems somewhat injurious to the feminine sex; for whereas therein <hi>Amicus</hi> is a friend, <hi>Amica</hi> alwayes signifies a Sweetheart, as if their sex in reference to men were not capable of any other kind of familiar friendship but in way to marriage, which makes our Lady avoid all privacie with suspicious company.</p>
                     <p>

But if our Lady heares any speaking dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully of God or Religion, she counts her self bound by her tenure (whereby she holds possession of grace here, and reversion of glory hereafter) to assert and vindicate the honour of the King of Heaven, whose Champion she professeth to be. One may be a lambe in private wrongs, but in hearing generall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to goodnesse, they are asses which are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                        <note place="margin">9</note> If very handsome, no whit the more proud, but farre the more thankfull: If unhandsome, she labours to better it in the virtues of her mind, that what is but plain cloth without may be rich plush within. Indeed such naturall defects as hinder her comfortable serving of God in her calling may be amended by art; and any member of the body being defective, may thereby be lawfully supplied. Thus glasse-eyes may be used, though not for seeing, for sightlinesse. But our Lady detesteth all adulterate complexions, finding no presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereof in the Bible save one, and her so bad, that Ladyes would blush through their paint to make her the pattern of their imitation. Yet are there many that think the grossest fault in painting is to paint grossely (making their faces with thick daubing not onely new pictures, but new statues) and that the greatest sinne therein, is to be discover'd.</p>

He is no friend to the tree, that strips it of the bark; neither do they mean well to Majesty, which would deprive it of outward shews, and State-solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which the servants of Princes may in loyalty and respect present to their Sovereigne; however, our Lady by degrees is brought from delighting in such Masques, onely to be contented to see them, and at last (perchance) could desire to be excused from that also.</p>

                        <hi>Yet in her reduced thoughts she makes all the sport she hath seen earnest to her self</hi>: It must be a dry flower indeed out of which this bee sucks no honey: they are the best Origens who do allegorise all earthly vanities into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly truths. When she remembreth how suddenly the Scene in the Masque was altered (almost before moment it self could take notice of it) she considereth, how quickly mutable all things are in this world, God <hi>ringing the changes</hi> on all accidents, and making them tunable to his glorie: The lively representing of things so curiously, that Nature her self might grow jealous of Art, in outdoing her, minds our Lady to make sure work with her own soul, seeing hypocrisie may be so like to sincerity. But O what a wealthy exchequer of beauties did she there behold, severall faces most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, most excellent, (so great is the variety even in bests) what a rich mine of jewells above ground, all so brave, so costly! To give Court-masques their due, of all the bubbles in this world they have the greatest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65716:159"/>
of fine colours. But all is quickly ended: this is the spight of the world, if ever she affordeth fine ware, she alwayes pincheth it in the measure, and it lasts not long: But oh, thinks our Lady, how glorious a place is Heaven, <hi>where there are joyes for evermore.</hi> If an herd of kine should meet together to phancy and define happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they would place it to consist in fine pastures, sweet grasse, clear water, shadowie groves, constant summer, but if any winter, then warm shelter and dainty hay, with company after their kind, counting these low things the highest happinesse, because their conceit can reach no higher. Little better do the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poets describe Heaven, paving it with pearl, and roofing it with starres, filling it with Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses, and allowing them to drink (as if without it no Poets Paradise) Nectar and Ambrosia; Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being <hi>Poetarum dedecus,</hi> the shame of Poets, and the disgrace of all their Hyperboles, falling as farre short of truth herein, as they go beyond it in other Fables. However the sight of such glorious earthly spectacles advantageth our Ladyes conceit by infinite multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to consider of Heaven.</p>

                        <hi>She reades constant lectures to her self of her own mortality.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13</note> To smell to a turf of fresh earth is wholsome for the body; no lesse are thoughts of mortality cordiall to the soul. <hi>Earth thou art, to earth thou shalt return</hi>: The sight of death when it cometh will neither be so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, nor so strange, who hath formerly often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it in her serious meditations.

                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:65716:160"/>To conclude: We reade how Henry a Germain Prince was admonished by revelation to search for a writing in an old wall, which should nearly concern him, wherein he found onely these two words written, <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Surius in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Sancti Henr. Iuly</hi> 14 <hi>&amp; Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius in Anno</hi> 1007.</note> POST SEX, AFTER SIX. Whereupon Henry concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that his death was foretold, which after six dayes should ensue, which made him passe those dayes in constant preparation for the same. But finding the six dayes past without the effect he expected, he successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persevered in his godly resolutions six weeks, six moneths, six years, and on the first day of the seventh yeare the Prophecie was fulfill'd, though otherwise then he interpreted it; for thereupon he was chosen Emperour of Germany, having before gotten such an habit of piety that he persisted in his religious course for ever after. Thus our Lady hath so inur'd her self <hi>all the dayes of her appointed time to wait till her change cometh,</hi> that expecting it every houre, she is alwayes provided for that, then which nothing is more certain or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>JAne Grey, eldest daughter of Henry Grey Marquesse of Dorset, and Duke of Suffolk, by Francis Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don eldest daughter of Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, and Mary his wife youngest daughter to King Henry the seventh, was by her parents bred according to her high birth in Religion and Learning. They were no whit indulgent to her in her childhood, but extremely severe, more then needed to so sweet a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65716:161"/>
temper; for what need iron instruments to bow wax?</p>
                     <p>But as the sharpest winters (correcting the ranknesse of the earth) cause the more healthfull and fruitfull summers; so the harshnesse of her breeding compacted her soul to the greater patience and pietie, so that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards she proved the miroir of her age, and attained to be an excellent Scholar through the teaching of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer her Master.</p>
                     <p>Once M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Roger Ascham, coming to wait on her at Broad-gates in Leicestershire, found her in her chamber reading <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ascham's Schoolmaster, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 10.</note> Phoedon-Platonis in Greek, with as much delight as some Gentleman would have read a merry tale in Bocchace, <hi>Whilest the Duke her father with the Dutchesse and all their houshold were hunting in the Park</hi>: He askt of her, how she could lose such pastime? who smiling answered, <hi>I wisse all the sport in the Park is but the shadow of what pleasure I find in this book,</hi> adding moreover, that one of the greatest blessings God ever gave her, was in sending her sharp parents, and a gentle School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, which made her take delight in nothing so much as in her studies.</p>
                     <p>About this time John Dudley Duke of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland projected for the English Crown: But being too low to reach it in his own person, having no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of royall birth, a match was made betwixt Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his fourth sonne, and this Lady Jane; the Duke hoping so to reigne in his daughter-in-law, on whom King Edward the sixth by will, passing by his own sisters, had entayled the Crown: And not long after that godly King, who had some defects, but few faults (and those rather in his age then person) came to his grave: it being uncertain whether he went, or was sent thither. If the latter be true, <hi>the crying of this Saint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar,</hi> beneath which he was buried in King Henries Chappell (without any other monument, then that of his own virtues) hath been heard long since for avenging his bloud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:65716:161"/>Presently after Lady Jane was proclaimed Queen of England.<note place="margin">1553</note> She lifted not up her least finger to put the Diadem on her self, but was onely contented to sit still, whilest others endeavoured to Crown her; or rather was so farre from biting at the bait of Sovereignty, that unwillingly she opened her mouth to receive it.</p>
                     <p>Then was the Duke of Northumberland made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of an Army, and sent into Suffolk to suppresse the Lady Marie, who there gathered men to claim the Crown. This Duke was appointed out of the policie of his friend-seeming enemies for that employment: For those who before could not endure the scorching heat of his displeasure at the Counsell-table, durst after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards oppose him, having gotten the skreen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-walls betwixt him and them. They also stinted his journeys every day (thereby appointing the steps by which he was to go down to his own grave) that he should march on very slowly, which caused his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. For lingring doth tire out treacherous designes, which are to be done all on a sudden, and gives breath to loyalty to recover it self.</p>
                     <p>His army like a sheep left part of his fleece on every bush it came by, at every stage and corner some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying themselves from him, till his Souldiers were wash'd away before any storm of warre fell upon them. Onely some few, who were chain'd to the Duke by their particular engagements, and some great Persons hopelesse to conceal themselves, as being too bigge for a cover, stuck fast unto him. Thus those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises need a strong hand which are thrown against the bias of peoples hearts and consciences. And not long after the Norfolk and Suffolk Protestant Gentry (Loyalty alwayes lodgeth in the same breast with true Religion) proclaimed and set up Queen Marie, who got the Crown by <hi>Our Father,</hi> and held it by <hi>Pater noster.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65716:162"/>Then was the late Queen, now Lady Jane Grey, brought from a Queen to a prisoner, and committed to the Tower. She made misery it self amiable by her pious and patient behaviour: Adversity, her night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, becoming her as well as her day-dressing, by reason of her pious deportment.</p>
                     <p>During her imprisonment many moved her to alter her religion, and especially M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fecnam sent unto her by Queen Mary: but how wisely and religiously she answer'd him, I referre the Reader to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox,<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>And because I have mentioned that Book, wherein this Ladyes virtues are so highly commended, I am not ignorant that of late great disgrace hath been thrown on that Authour, and his worthy Work, as being guilty of much falsehood: chiefly because sometimes he makes Popish Doctours, well known to be rich in learning, to reason very poorely, and the best Fencers of their Schools worsted and put out of their play by some countrey poore Protestants. But let the cavillers hereat know, that it is a great matter to have the oddes of the weapon, Gods word on their side; not to say any thing of supernaturall assistance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. Sure for the main, his Book is a worthy work (wherein the Reader may rather leave then lack) and seems to me, like Aetna, alwayes burning, whilest the smoke hath almost put out the eyes of the adverse party, and these <hi>Foxes firebrands</hi> have brought much annoyance to the <hi>Romish Philistines.</hi> But it were a miracle if in so voluminous a work there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be justly reproved; so great a Pomgranate not having any rotten kernell must onely grow in paradise. And though perchance he held the beam at the best advantage for the Protestant party to weigh down, yet generally he is a true Writer, and never wilfully decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, though he may sometimes be unwillingly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

                     <p>But Majesty which dyeth not will not suffer it self to be so abused, seeing the best assurance which living Princes have, that their memories shall be honourably continued, is founded (next to their own deserts) in the maintaining of the unstained reputation of their Predecessours. Yea divine Justice seems herein to be a compurgatour of the parents of Queen Elizabeth, in that Nicholas Sanders, a Popish Priest, the first raiser of these wicked reports, was accidentally famished as he roved up and down in Ireland; either because it was just he should be sterved that formerly surfeted with lying, or because that Iland out of a naturall antipathy against poysonous creatures would not lend life to so venemous a slanderer.</p>
                     <p>Under the reigne of her Father, and Brother King Edward the sixth, (who commonly called her his Sister Temperance) she lived in a Princely fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the case was altered with her when her Sister Mary came to the Crown, who ever look'd upon her with a jealous eye and frowning face: chiefly, because of the difference betwixt them in religion. For though Queen Mary is said of her self not so much as to have bark'd, yet she had under her those who did more then bite; and rather her religion then disposition was guilty in countenancing their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty by her authority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:65716:164"/>This antipathy against her Sister Elizabeth was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased with the remembrance how Katharine Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Queen Maries Mother, was justled out of the bed of Henry the eighth by Anna Bullen, Mother to Queen Elizabeth: so that these two Sisters were born, as I may say, not onely in severall but opposite horizons, so that the elevation and bright appearing of the one inferr'd the necessary obscurity and depression of the other; &amp; still Qu. Mary was troubled with this <hi>fit of the Mother,</hi> which incensed her against this her half Sister.</p>
                     <p>To which two grand causes of opposition, this third may also be added, because not so generally known, though in it self of lesser consequence. Queen Mary had released Edward Courtney Earl of Devonshire out of the Tower, where long he had been detained prisoner, a Gentleman of a beautifull body, sweet nature, and royall descent, intending him, as it was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to be an husband for her self. For when the said Earl petitioned the Queen for leave to travel she advised him rather to marry, ensuring him that no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the land, how high soever, would refuse him for an husband; and urging him to make his choyce where he pleased, she pointed her self out unto him as plainly as might stand with the modesty of a maid, and Majesty of a Queen. Hereupon the young Earl (whether because that his long durance had some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on his brain, or that naturally his face was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his head, or out of some private phancie and affection to the Lady Elizabeth, or out of loyall bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, not presuming to climbe higher, but expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be call'd up) is said to have requested the Queen for leave to marry her Sister the Lady Elizabeth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy that his choyce either went so high or no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: For who could have spoken worse Treason against Mary (though not against the Queen) then to preferre her Sister before her? and she, innocent Lady, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dearly pay the score of this Earls indiscretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:65716:164"/>For these reasons Lady Elizabeth was closely kept and narrowly sifted all her Sisters reigne, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field her keeper using more severity towards her then his place required, yea more then a good man should, or a wiseman would have done. No doubt the least tripping of her foot should have cost her the losing of her head, if they could have caught her to be privy to any conspiracies.</p>
                     <p>This Lady as well deserved the title of Elizabeth <hi>the Confessour</hi> as ever Edward her ancient predecessour did. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ascham was a good Schoolmaster to her, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction was a better, so that it is hard to say whether she was more happy in having a Crown so soon, or in having it no sooner, till affliction had first laid in her a low (and therefore sure) foundation of humility, for highnesse to be afterwards built thereupon.</p>
                     <p>We bring her now from the Crosse to the Crown; and come we now to describe the rare endowments of her mind, when behold her virtues almost stifle my pen, they crowd in so fast upon it.</p>

She was a good Poet in English, and fluently made verses. In her time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, when a Popish Priest pressed her very hardly to declare her opinion concerning the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, she truly and warily presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her judgement in these verses,
<q>

Nor was her Poetick vein lesse happy in Latine. When a little before the Spanish Invasion in eighty eight, the Spanish Embassadour (after a larger representation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters demands) had summed up the effect thereof in a Tetrastich, she instantly in one verse rejoined her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65716:166"/>
loved rather to tell her self, then to be told of her mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, because the open mention thereof made (as she conceived) her subjects divide their loyalty betwixt the present and the future Prince. We need look into no other cause of her sicknesse then old age, being seventy years old (Davids age) to which no King of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland since the Conquest did attain. Her weaknesse was encreased by her removall from London to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in a cold winter day, sharp enough to pierce thorow those who were arm'd with health and youth. Also melancholy (the worst naturall Parasite, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever seeds him shall never be rid of his company) much afflicted her, being given over to sadnesse and silence.</p>
                     <p>Then prepared she her self for another world, being more constant in prayer, and pious exercises then ever before: yet spake she very little to any, sighing out more then she said, and making still musick to God in her heart. And as the red rose, though outwardly not so fragrant, is inwardly farre more cordiall then the damask, being more thrifty of its sweetnesse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it in it self; so the religion of this dying Queen was most turn'd inward in soliloquies betwixt God and her own soul, though she wanted not outward expressions thereof. When her speech fail'd her, she spake with her heart, tears, eyes, hands, and other signes, so commending herself to God the best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, who understands what his Saints desire to say. Thus dyed Queen Elizabeth, whilest living, the first maid on earth, and when dead, the second in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Surely the kingdome had dyed with their Queen, had not the fainting spirits thereof been refresh'd by the coming in of gratious King James.</p>
                     <p>She was of person, tall; of hair and complexion, fair, well-favoured, but high-nosed; of limbes and feature, neat; of a stately and majestick deportment.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65716:166"/>
She had a piercing eye wherewith she used to touch what metall strangers were made of, which came into her presence. But as she counted it a pleasant conquest with her Majestick look to dash strangers out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, so she was mercifull in pursuing those whom she overcame, and afterwards would cherish and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them with her smiles, if perceiving towardlinesse, and an ingenuous modesty in them.

                           <item>3. By sharing with them in their wants. When victuals have grown scant, some Generalls have pinched themselves to the same fare with their souldiers, who could not complain that their messe was bad, whilest their Generall was Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-commoner with them.</item>
                           <item>4. By taking notice, and rewarding of their deserts; never disinheriting a worthy souldier of his birthright, of the next Office due unto him. For a worthy man is wounded more deeply by his own Generalls neglect, then by his enemies sword: The latter may kill him, but the former deads his courage, or, which is worse, mads it into discontent; Who had rather others should make a ladder of his dead corps to scale a city by it, then a bridge of him whilest alive for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to give him the <hi>Goe-by,</hi> and passe over him to preferment. For this reason chiefly (beside some others) a great and valiant English Generall in the daies of Queen Elizabeth was hated of his souldiers, because he disposed Offices by his own absolute will, without respect of orderly advancing such as deserved it, which made a Great man once salute him with this letter: <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if you will be pleased to bestow a Captains place on the bearer hereof, being a worthy Gentleman, he shall do that for you which never as yet any souldier did, namely pray to God for your health and happinesse.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:65716:172"/>He was but seventeen years old at his Fathers death, being left not onely a young King, but also in a young kingdome; for his title to the Crown of Sweden was but five years old, to wit since the beginning of his Fathers reigne. All his bordering Princes (on the North nothing but the North bounded on him) were his enemies; the Duke-Emperour of Muscovy on the East, the King of Denmark on the West, and of Poland on the South: The former two laid claim to parcels, the latter, to all his kingdome. Yet was he too great for them in his minority, both defending his own, and gaining on them. <hi>Wo be to the kingdome whose King is a child,</hi> yet blessed is that kingdome whose King, though a child in age, is a man in worth.</p>
                     <p>These his first actions had much of glory, and yet somewhat of possibility and credit in them. But Chronicle and belief must strain hard to make his Germane Conquest probable with posterity; coming in with eleven thousand men, having no certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, but some of his alliance, whom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had outed of all their estates: And yet in two years and foure moneths he left the Emperour in as bad a case almost, as he found those Princes in.</p>
                     <p>Gods Providence herein is chiefly to be admired, who to open him a free entrance into Germany, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Imperiall and Spanish forces into Italy, there to scramble against the French for the Dukedome of Mantua. For heaven onely knows how much Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant flesh the Imperialists had devoured, if that bone had not stuck in their teeth.</p>
                     <p>If we look on second causes, we may ascribe his victories to this Kings piety, wisedome, valour, and other virtues. His piety to God was exemplary, being more addicted to prayer then to fight, as if he would rather conquer Heaven then Earth. He was himself exceeding temperate, save onely too much given to anger, but afterwards he would correct himself, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65716:173"/>
be cholerick with his choler, shewing himself a man in the one, and a Saint in the other.</p>
                     <p>He was a strict observer of Martiall discipline, the life of Warre, without which an Army is but a crowd (not to say herd) of people. He would march all day in complete armour, which was by custome no more burthen to him then his armes, and to carry his helmet, no more trouble then his head; whilest his example made the same easie to all his souldiers. He was a strict punisher of misdemeanours and wanton intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in his camp: And yet let me relate this story from one present therein.</p>
                     <p>When first he entred Germany, he perceived how that many women followed his souldiers, some being their wives, and some wanting nothing to make them so but marriage, yet most passing for their landresses, though commonly defiling more then they wash. The King coming to a great river, after his men and the wagons were passed over, caused the bridge to be broken down, hoping so to be rid of these feminine impediments; but they one a sudden lift up a panick schrick which pierced the skies, and the souldiers hearts on the other side of the river, who instantly vowed not to stirre a foot farther, except with baggage, and that the women might be fetch'd over, which was done accordingly. For the King finding this ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour so generally dispers'd in his men, that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to purge it all at once, smiled out his anger for the present, and permitted what he could not amend: yet this abuse was afterwards reformed by degrees.</p>
                     <p>He was very mercifull to any that would submit. And as the iron gate miraculously opened to S. Peter of its own accord, so his mercy wrought miracles, making many city-gates open to him of themselves, before he ever knock'd at them to demand entrance, the inhabitants desiring to shroud themselves under his protection. Yea he was mercifull to those places
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65716:173"/>
which he took by assault, ever detesting the bloudinesse of Tilly at Magdenburg, under the ashes whereof he buried his honour, coming valiant thither, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruell thence. In such cases he was mercifull to women (not like those Generalls who know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Sex in their lust, but not in their anger) yea the very Jesuites themselves tasted of his courtesie, though merrily he laid to their charge, that they would neither <hi>Preach faith</hi> to, nor <hi>keep faith</hi> with others.</p>
                     <p>He had the true art (almost lost) of Encamping, where he would lie in his Trenches in despight of all enemies, keeping the clock of his own time, and would fight for no mans pleasure but his own. No seeming flight or disorder of his enemies should cousen him into a battel, nor their daring bravado's anger him into it, nor any violence force him to fight, till he thought fitting himself, counting it good manners in Warre to take all, but give no advantages.</p>
                     <p>It was said of his Armies, that they used to rise when the swallows went to bed, when winter began, his forces most consisting of Northern Nations, and <hi>a Swede fights best when he can see his own breath.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept a long vacation in the dog-dayes, being onely a saver in the summer, and a gainer all the yeare besides. His best harvest was in the snow; and his souldiers had most life in the dead of winter.</p>
                     <p>He made but a short cut in taking of cities, many of whose fortifications were a wonder to behold; but what were they then to assault and conquer? at scaling of walls he was excellent for contriving, as his souldiers in executing: it seeming a wonder that their bodies should be made of aire, so light to climbe, whose armes were of iron, so heavy to strike. Such cities as would not presently open unto him, he shut them up, and having businesse of more importance then to imprison himself about one strength, he would consigne the besieging thereof to some other Captain. And indeed
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65716:174"/>
he wanted not his Joabs, who when they had reduced cities to terms of yielding knew (with as much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as loyalty) to entitle their David to the whole honour of the action.</p>
                     <p>He was highly beloved of his souldiers, of whose deserts he kept a faithfull Chronicle in his heart, and advanced them accordingly. All valiant men were Swedes to him; and he differenced men in his esteem by their merits not their countrey.</p>
                     <p>To come to his death, wherein his reputation suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the judgements of some, for too much hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own person in the battel. But surely some conceived necessity thereof urged him thereunto. For this his third grand set battel in Germany, was the third and last asking of his banes to the Imperiall Crown; and had they not been forbidden by his death, his marriage in all probability had instantly followed. Besides, <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Never Prince hath founded great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but by making warre in person, nor hath lost any, but when he made warre by his lieutenants</hi>: which made this King the more adventurous.</p>
                     <p>His death is still left in uncertainty, whether the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of open enemies, or treachery of false friends caused it. His side <hi>won the day,</hi> and yet <hi>lost the sunne</hi> that made it; and as one saith,
<q>
                           <l>Upon this place the great Gustavus dy'd,</l>
                           <l>Whilest victory lay bleeding by his side.</l>
                        </q>
Thus the readiest way to lose a jewell is to overprise it: for indeed many men so doted on this worthy Prince, and his victories (without any default of his, who gave God the glory) that his death in some sort seemed necessary to vindicate Gods honour, who usually maketh that prop of flesh to break where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men lay too great weight of their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>After his death, how did men struggle to keep him alive in their reports? partly out of good will, which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65716:174"/>
made them kindle new hopes of his life at every spark of probability, partly out of infidelity that his death could be true. First they thought so valiant a Prince could not live on earth; and when they saw his life, then they thought so valiant a Prince could never die, but that his death was rather a concealment for a time, dayly expecting when the politickly dead should have a Resurrection in some noble exploit.</p>

He was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1329, on the fifteenth of June, being friday, at Woodstock in Oxfordshire. His Parents perceiving in him more then ordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall perfections, were carefull to bestow on him such education in Piety, and Learning, agreeable to his high

birth. The Prince met their care with his towardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being apt to take fire, and blaze at the least spark of instruction put into him.</p>
                     <p>We find him to be the first Prince of Wales, whose <note n="*" place="margin">

He in the whole course of his life manifested a singular observance to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to comply with their will and desire; nor lesse was the tendernesse of his affection to his Brothers and Sisters, whereof he had many.</p>
                     <p>But as for the Martiall performances of this Prince, they are so many and so great that they would fill whole volumes: we will onely insist on three of his most memorable atchievements, remitting the Reader for the rest to our English Historians. The first shall be his behaviour in the battel of <note n="*" place="margin">1346 <hi>in the twenty yeare of Ed. the third.</hi>
                        </note> Cressy, against the French, wherein Prince Edward, not fully eighteen years old, led the sore front of the English.</p>
                     <p>There was a causlesse report (the beginning of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is sometimes all the ground thereof) spread through the French army, that the English were fled: whereupon the French posted after them, not so much to overcome (this they counted done) but to overtake them, preparing themselves rather to pursue then to fight. But coming to the town of Cressy, they found the English fortified in a wooddy place, and attending in good array to give battel. Whereat the French falling from their hopes were extremely vext (a fools para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise is a wisemans hell) finding their enemies faces to stand where they look'd for their backs. And now both armies prepared to fight, whilest behold flocks of ravens and vulturs in the aire flew thither; bold guests to come without an invitation: But these smell-feast birds when they saw the cloth laid (the tents of two
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65716:179"/>
armies pitch'd) knew there would be good cheere, and came to feed on their carcases.</p>
                     <p>The English divided themselves into three parts: The formost consisting most of Archers, led by the Black Prince; the second, by the Earl of Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton; the third, commanded by King Edward in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The French were treble in number to the English, and had in their army the three Kings, of France, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and Majorca: Charles Duke of Alenson, with John the Bohemian King, led the vanguard; the French King Philip, the main battel; whilest Amie Duke of Savoy brought up the rere.</p>
                     <p>The Genoan Archers in the French forefront, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with marching, were accus'd for their slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and could neither get their wages nor good words, which made many of them cast down their bows, and refuse to fight; the rest had their bowstrings made uselesse, being wetted with a sudden showre which fell on their side: But Heavens smiling offended more then her weeping, the sunne suddenly shining out in the face of the French, gave them so much light that they could not see.</p>
                     <p>However Duke Charles, breaking through the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noans, furiously charged the fronts of the English, and joyned at hand-strokes with the Princes battel, who though fighting most couragiously was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Therefore King Edward was sent unto (who hitherto hovered on a hillock, judiciously beholding the fight) to come and rescue his sonne. The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending his case dangerous but not desperate, and him rather in need then extremity, told the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Is my sonne alive, let him die or conquer, that he may have the honour of the day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The English were vext, not at his deniall, but their own request; that they should seem to suspect their Kings fatherly affection, or Martiall skill, as needing a remembrancer to tell him his time. To make amends,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65716:179"/>
they laid about them manfully, the rather because they knew that the King looked on, to testifie their valour, who also had the best cards in his own hand, though he kept them for a revie.</p>
                     <p>The victory began to incline to the English, when, rather to settle then get the conquest, the King (hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a spectatour) came in to act the Epilogue. Many English with short knifes for the nonce stabb'd the bellies of their enemies, cut the throats of more, letting out their souls wheresoever they could come at their bodies: and to all such as lay languishing, they gave a short acquittance, that they had paid their debt to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This makes French Writers complain of the English cruelty, and that it had been more honour to the Generall, and profit to the souldiers to have drawn lesse bloud, and more money in ransoming captives, especially seeing many French Noblemen, who fought like lions, were kill'd like calves. Others plead that in Warre all wayes and weapons are lawfull, where it is the greatest mistake not to take all advantages.</p>
                     <p>Night came on, and the King commanded no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit should be made for preventing of confusion; for souldiers scarce follow any order, when they follow their flying enemy; and it was so late, that it might have proved too soon to make a pursuit.</p>
                     <p>The night proved exceeding dark (as mourning for the bloud shed) nor was the next morning comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rising of the sun, but remained sad and gloomy, so that in the mist many French men lost their way, and then their lives, falling into the hands of the English: so that next dayes gleanings for the number, though not for the quality of the persons slain, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the harvest of the day before. And thus this victory, next to Gods Providence, was justly ascribed to the Black Princes valour, who there wonne and wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Estridge feathers, then the Arms of John King of Bohemia, there conquer'd and kill'd, and therefore
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65716:180"/>

                           <hi>Vid. Cambd. Remains pag.</hi> 344.</note> hereditary Emblemes of honour to the Princes of Wales.</p>
                     <p>The battel of Poictiers followed ten years after, which was fought betwixt the foresaid Black Prince, and John King of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>September</hi> 19. 1356.</note> France. Before the battel began the English were reduced to great straits, their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing six to one. The French conceived the victory, though not in hand, yet within reach, and their arm must be put out not to get but take it. All articles with the English they accounted alms, it being great charity but no policy to compound with them. But what shall we say? warre is a game wherein very often that side loseth which layeth the oddes. In probability they might have famished the English without fighting with them, had not they counted it a lean conquest so to bring their enemies to misery, without any honour to themselves.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion was, that the French would have the English lose their honour to save their lives, tendring them unworthy conditions, which being refused, the battel was begun. The French King made choice of three hundred prime horsmen to make the first assault on the English; the election of which three hundred made more then a thousand <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. in the life of King Iohn, pag.</hi> 286.</note> heartburnings in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: every one counted his loyalty or manhood su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, who was not chosen into this number; and this took off the edge of their spirits against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and turned it into envy and disdain against their friends.</p>
                     <p>The French horse charged them very furiously, whom the English entertain'd with a feast of arrows, first, second, third course, all alike. Their horses were galled with the bearded piles, being unused to feel spurres in their breasts and buttocks. The best horses were worst wounded, for their mettall made one wound many; and that arrow which at first did but pierce, by their struggling did tear and rend. Then
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65716:180"/>
would they know no riders, and the riders could know no ranks; and in such a confusion, an army fights against it self. One rank fell foul with another, and the rere was ready to meet with the front: and the valiant Lord Audley, charging them before they could repair themselves, overcame all the Horse, <hi>Qua parte belli</hi> (saith my Authour) <hi>invicti Galli habebantur.</hi> The Horse being put to flight, the Infantry consisting most of poore people (whereof many came into the field with conquered hearts, grinded with oppression of their Gentry) counted it neither wit nor manners for them to stay, when their betters did flie, and made post hast after them. Six thousand common souldiers were slain, fifty two Lords, and seventeen hundred Knights and Esquires; one hundred Ensignes taken, with John the French King, and two thousand priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of note.</p>
                     <p>The French had a great advantage of an after-game, if they had returned again, and made head, but they had more mind to make heels, and run away. Prince Edward, whose prowesse herein was conspicuous, overcame his own valour, both in his piety, devoutly giving to God the whole glory of the conquest, and in his courtesie, with stately humility entertaining the French Prisoner-King, whom he bountifully feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that night, though the other could not be merry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was supped with great cheere, and knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be very welcome.</p>
                     <p>The third performance of this valiant Prince, wherein we will instance, was acted in Spain, on this occasion. Peter King of Castile was driven out of his kingdome by Henry his base Brother, and the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of some French forces. Prince Edward on this Peters petition, and by his own Fathers permission, went with an army into Spain, to re-estate him in his kingdome: For though this Peter was a notorious Tyrant, (if Authours in painting his deeds do not
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65716:181"/>
overshadow them, to make them blacker then they were) yet our Prince, not looking into his vices but his right, thought he was bound to assist him: For all Sovereignes are like the strings of a Basevioll equally tuned to the same height, so that by sympathy, he that toucheth the one moves the other. Besides, he thought it just enough to restore him, because the French helpt to cast him out; and though Spain was farre off, yet our Prince never counted himself out of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whilest in any part of the world; valour natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing a brave spirit through the Universe.</p>
                     <p>With much adoe he effected the businesse through many difficulties, occasioned partly by the treachery of King Peter, who performed none of the conditions promised, and partly through the barrennesse of the countrey, so that the Prince was forced to sell all his own plate (Spain more needing meat then dishes) to make provision for his souldiers; but especially through the distemper of the climate, the aire (or fire shall I say) thereof being extreme hot, so that it is conceived to have caused this Princes death, which happened soon after his return. What English heart can hold from inveighing against Spanish aire which deprived us of such a jewell? were it not that it may seem since to have made us some amends, when lately the <hi>breath of our nostrills</hi> breathed in that climate, and yet by Gods providence was kept there, and returned thence in health and safety.</p>
                     <p>Well may this Prince be taken for a Paragon of his age, and place, having the fewest vices, with so many virtues. Indeed he was somewhat given to women, our Chronicles fathering two base children on him; so hard it is to find a Sampson without a Dalila. And seeing never King or Kings eldest sonne since the conquest before his time married a subject, I must confesse his Match was much beneath himself, taking the double reversion of a subjects bed,

marrying Joan Countesse of Salisbury, which had been twice a widow. But her surpassing beauty pleads for him herein, and yet her beauty was the meanest thing about her, being surpass'd by her virtues. And what a worthy woman must she needs be her self, whose very <hi>garter</hi> hath given so much honour to Kings and Princes?</p>

But whatsoever the Theories of absolute Monarchy be, our King loves to be legall in all his practices, and thinks that his power is more safely lock'd up for him in his Law then kept in his own will; because God alone makes things lawfull by willing them, whilest the most cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Princes have sometimes gusts of Passion, which meeting with an unlimited Authority in them may prove dangerous to them and theirs. Yea our King is so suspicious of an unbounded power in himself, that though the widenesse of his strides could make all the hedge stiles, yet he will not go over, but where he may. He also hearkneth to the advise of good Counsellers, remembring the speech of Antoninus the Emperour, <hi>Aequius est ut ego tot taliumque amicorum consilium sequar, quam tot talesque amici meam unius voluntatem.</hi> And yet withall our King is carefull to maintain his just Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, that as it be not outstretched, so it may not be overshortned.</p>
                     <p>Such a gratious Sovereigne God hath vouchsafed to this Land. How pious is he towards his God! atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in hearing the Word, preaching Religion with his silence, as the Minister doth with his speech! How lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to his Spouse, tender to his Children, faithfull to his servants whilest they are faithfull to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; otherwise leaving them to Justice under marks of his displeasure. How doth he with David walk in the <hi>midst of his house</hi> without partiality to any! How just is he in punishing wilfull murder! so that it is as easie to restore the murthered to life, as to keep the murtherer from death. How mercifull is he to such who not out of leigier malice, but sudden passion may chance to shed bloud! to whom his pardon hath allowed leisure to drop out their own souls in tears by constant repentance all the dayes of their lives. How many wholsome Laws hath he enacted for the good of his Subjects! How great is his humilitie in so great height! which maketh his own praises painfull for himself to heare, though pleasant for others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. His Royall virtues are too great to be told, and too great to be conceal'd. All cannot, some must break forth from the full hearts of such as be his thankfull Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But I must either stay or fall. My sight fails me da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell'd with the lustre of Majestie: all I can do is pray.</p>
                     <p>Give the King thy judgements, O Lord, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings Sonne: smite through the loins of those that rise up against his Majestie, but upon him and his let the Crown flourish: Oh cause his Subjects to meet his Princely care for their good, with a proportionable cheerfulnesse and alacrity in his service, that so thereby the happinesse of Church and State may be continued.

To describe her is very difficult; it being hard to draw those to the life, who never sit still: she is so various in her humours, and mutable, 'tis almost impossible to character her in a fixed posture; yea indeed some cunning Harlots are not discernable from honest women.

                        <hi>As she sees, so her self is seen by her own eyes.</hi> Sometimes she stares on men with full fixed eyes; otherwhiles she squints forth glances, and contracts the beams in her burning glasses, to make them the hotter to inflame her objects; sometimes she dejects her eyes in a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civility, and many mistake in her a cunning for a modest look. But as those bullets which graze on the ground do most mischief to an army; so she hurts most with those glances which are shot from a down-cast eye.</p>

                        <hi>Yet some Harlots continue a kind of strange coynesse even to the very last:</hi> which coynesse differs from modesty as much as hemlock from parsely. They will deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours, because they are too small to be granted: They will part with all or none, refuse to be courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and reserve themselves to be dishonest; whereas women truly modest will willingly go to the bounds of free and harmlesse mirth, but will not be dragg'd any farther.</p>

out of the sheath; but where the back and edge of the knife are shown, 'tis to be feared they mean to cut the fingers of others. I must confesse some honest women may go thus, but no whit the honester for going thus. The ship may have Castor and Pollux for the badge, and notwithstanding have S.

                     <p>Some conceive that when King Henry the eighth destroyed the publick Stews in this Land (which till his time stood on the banks side on Southwark next the Bear-garden, beasts and beastly women being very fit neighbours) he rather scattered then quenched the fire of lust in this kingdome, and by turning the flame out of the chimney where it had a vent, more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the burning of the Commonwealth. But they are deceived: for whilest the Laws of the Land tolerated open uncleannesse, God might justly have made the whole State do penance for whoredome; whereas now that sinne though committed, yet not permitted, and though (God knows) it be too generall, it is still but personall.</p>

CHAP. 2. The life of <hi>JOAN</hi> Queen of Naples.</head>
                     <p>JOan, grandchild to Robert King of Naples by Charles his sonne, succeeded her grandfather in the Kingdome of Naples and Sicily, <hi>Anno</hi> 1343. a woman of a beautifull body and rare endowments of nature, had not the heat of her lust soured all the rest of her perfections, whose wicked life <note n="*" place="margin">

Neopol. lib.</hi> 3.</note> and wofull death we now come to relate: And I hope none can justly lay it to my charge, if the foulnesse of her actions stain through the cleanest language I can wrap them in.</p>
                     <p>She was first married unto her cosen Andrew, a Prince of royall extraction, and of a sweet and loving disposition. But he being not able to satisfie her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, she kept company with lewd persons, at first privately, but afterwards she presented her badnesse visible to every eye, so that none need look through the chinks where the doores were open.</p>
                     <p>Now Elizabeth Queen of Hungary, her husband Andrews mother, was much offended at the badnesse of her daughter-in-law, whose deeds were so foul she could not look on them, and so common she could not look besides them; wherefore in a matronly way she fairly advised her to reform her courses. For the lives of Princes are more read then their Laws, and generally more practised: Yea their example passeth as current as their coin, and what they do they seem to command to be done. Cracks in glasse though past mending are no great matter; but the least flaw in a diamond is considerable: Yea her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall fault was a nationall injury, which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive and put the Sceptre into a wrong hand.</p>
                     <p>These her mild instructions she sharpned with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatnings: But no razor will cut a stony heart. Queen Joan imputed it to ages envy, old people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65716:189"/>
youth to leave those pleasures, which have left themselves. Besides, a Mother-in-laws Sermon sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome takes well with an audience of Daughter-in-laws. Wherefore the old Queen finding the other past grace (that is never likely to come to it) resolved no longer to punish anothers sinne on her self, and vex her own righteous soul, but leaving Naples return'd into Hungary.</p>
                     <p>After her departure Queen Joan grew weary of her husband Andrew, complaining of his insufficiency, though those who have <hi>caninum appetitum</hi> are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges what is sufficient food: And she caused her husband in the city of Aversa to be hung upon a beam and strangled in the night time, and then threw out his corps into a garden, where it lay some dayes unburied.</p>
                     <p>There goes a <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Collenusius, l.</hi> 5. <hi>Regn. Neop.</hi>
                        </note> story that this Andrew on a day coming into the Queens chamber, and finding her twisting a thick string of silk and silver, demanded of her for what purpose she made it: She answered, <hi>To hang you in it,</hi> which he then little believed, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because those who intend such mischief never speak of it before. But such blows in jest-earnest are most dangerous, which one can neither receive in love, nor refuse in anger.</p>
                     <p>Indeed she sought in vain to colour the businesse, and to divert the suspicion of the murther from her self, because all the world saw that she inflicted no punishment on the actours of it which were in her power. And in such a case, when a murther is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, the sword of the Magistrate cannot stand neuter, but doth justify what it doth not punish.</p>
                     <p>Besides, his corps was not cold before she was hot in a new love, and married Lewis Prince of Tarentum, one of the beautifullest men in the world. But it was hard for her to please her love and her lust in the same
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65716:189"/>
person. This Prince wasted the state of his body to pay her the conjugall debt, which she extorted beyond all modesty or reason, so unquenchable was the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of her wantonnesse.</p>
                     <p>After his death (she hating widowhood as much as Nature doth <hi>vacuum</hi>) maried James King of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca, and commonly styled Prince of Calabria. Some say he dyed of a naturall death: Others, that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed him for lying with another woman (who would suffer none to be dishonest but her self) O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he was unjustly put to death, and forced to change worlds, that she might change husbands.</p>
                     <p>Her fourth husband was Otho of Brunswick, who came a Commander out of Germany, with a company of souldiers, and performed excellent service in Italy. A good souldier he was, and it was not the least part of his valour to adventure on so skittish a beast: But he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to feast his hungry fortune on this reversion. By all foure husbands she had no children; either because the drougth of her wantonnesse parched the fruit of her wombe; or else because provident Nature prevented a generation of Monsters from her.</p>
                     <p>By this time her sinnes were almost hoarse with crying to heaven for revenge. They mistake who think divine Justice sleepeth when it winks for a while at Offenders. Hitherto she had kept herself in a whole skin by the rents which were in the Church of Rome. For there being a long time a Schisme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Popes, Urban, and Clement, she so poysed herself between them both, that she escaped unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is that Queen Joan that gave Avignon in France (yet under a pretence of sale) to Pope Urban and his Successours: the stomach of his Holinesse not being so squeamish, but that he would take a good almes from dirty hands. It may make the chastity of Rome suspicious with the world that she hath had so good fortune to be a gainer by Harlots.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:65716:190"/>But see now how Charles Prince of Dyrachium, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next of kin to Prince Andrew that was murdered, comes out of Hungary with an army into Naples to revenge his uncles bloud. He was received without resistance of any, his very name being a Petrard to make all the city-gates fly open where he came. Out issues Otho the Queens husband with an army of men out of Naples, and most stoutly bids him battel, but is overthrown; yet was he suffered fairly to depart the kingdome, dismiss'd with this commendation, That never a more valiant Knight fought in defence of a more vitious Lady.</p>
                     <p>Queen Joan finding it now in vain to bend her fist, fell to bowing of her knees, and having an excellent command of all her passions save her lust, fell down flat before Charles the Conquerour, and submitted her self: <hi>Hitherto,</hi> said she, <hi>I have esteemed thee in place of a sonne, but seeing God will have it so, hereafter I shall acknowledge thee for my Lord.</hi> Charles knew well that Necessity, her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, endited her speech for her, which came little from her heart; yet, to shew that he had as plentifull an Exchequer of good language, promis'd her fairly for the present: But mercy it self would be asham'd to pity so notorious a malefactour. After some moneths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment she was carried to the place where her husband was murder'd, and there accordingly hang'd, and cast out of the window into the garden, whose corps at last was buried in the Nunnery of S. Clare.</p>

                     <p>BEfore we come to describe her, we must premise and prove certain propositions, whose truth may otherwise be doubted of.</p>

                        <item>2 <hi>There are Witches for the present, though those Night-birds flie not so frequently in flocks since the light of the Gospel.</hi> Some ancient arts and mysteries are said to be lost; but sure the devil will not wholly let down any of his gainfull trades. There be many Witches at this day in Lapland, who sell winds to Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for money (and must they not needs go whom the devil drives?) though we are not bound to believe the old story of Ericus King of Swedeland, who had a <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <item>3 <hi>It is very hard to prove a Witch.</hi> Infernall contracts are made without witnesses. She that in presence of others will compact with the devil deserves to be hang'd for her folly as well as impiety.</item>
                        <item>4 <hi>Many are unjustly accused for Witches.</hi> Sometimes out of ignorance of naturall, &amp; misapplying of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causes; sometimes out of their neighbours mere malice, and the suspicion is increas'd, if the party accused be notoriously ill-favoured; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as deformity alone is no more argument to make her a Witch, then handsomnesse had been evidence
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65716:191"/>
to prove her an Harlot; sometimes out of their own causlesse confession. Being brought before a Magistrate they acknowledge themselves to be Witches, being themselves rather bewitch'd with fear, or deluded with phancy. But the self-accusing of some is as little to be credited, as the self-prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of others, if alone without other evidence.</item>
                        <item>5 <hi>Witches are commonly of the feminine sex.</hi> Ever since Satan tempted our grandmother Eve, he knows that that sex is most licorish to tast, and most carelesse to swallow his baits. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <item>6 <hi>They are commonly distinguished into white and black Witches.</hi> White, I dare not say good Witches (<hi>for woe be to him that calleth evil good</hi>) heal those that are hurt, and help them to lost goods. But better it is to lap ones pottage like a dog, then to eat it mannerly with a spoon of the devils giving: Black Witches hurt, and do mischief. But in deeds of darknesse there is no difference of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: The white and the black are both guilty alike in compounding with the devil. And now we come to see by vvhat degrees people arrive at this height of profanenesse.</item>

                     <head>CHAP. 4. The Witch of<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.</note> Endor.</head>
                     <p>HEr proper name we neither find, nor need curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously enquire: without it she is describ'd enough for our knowledge, too much for her shame.</p>
                     <p>King Saul had banish'd all Witches and Sorcerers out of Israel; but no besom can sweep so clean as to leave no crumme of dust behind it: This Witch of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor still keeps her self safe in the land. God hath <hi>his remnant</hi> where Saints are cruelly persecuted; Satan also his remnant, where offenders are severely prosecuted, and (if there were no more) the whole <hi>species</hi> of Witches is preserved in this <hi>individuum,</hi> till more be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>It happened now that King Saul, being ready to fight with the Philistines, was in great distresse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God answered him not concerning the successe of the battel. With the silent, he will be silent: Saul gave no reall answer in his obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, God will give no vocall answer to Sauls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
                     <p>Mens minds are naturally ambitious to know things to come: Saul is restlesse to know the issue of the fight. Alas, what needed he to set his teeth on edge with the sourenesse of that bad tidings, who soon after was to have his belly full thereof.</p>
                     <p>He said to his servants, <hi>Seek me out</hi> (no wonder she was such a jewell to be sought for) <hi>one with a familiar Spirit</hi>: vvhich vvas accordingly perform'd, and Saul came to her in a disguise. Formerly Samuel told him
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65716:193"/>
that his <hi>disobedience was as witchcraft</hi>; now Saul falls from the like to the same, and tradeth with Witches indeed (the receiver is as bad as the thief) and at his request she raiseth up Samuel to come unto him.</p>
                     <p>What, true Samuel? It is above Satans power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade a Saint from glory, though for a moment; since his own fall thence, he could fetch none from heaven. Or was it onely the true body of Samuel? no; the pretious ashes of the Saints (the pawn for the return of their souls) are lock'd up safe in the cabinet of their graves, and the devil hath no key unto it. Or lastly was it his seeming body? he that could not counterfeit the least and worst of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.18.</note> worms, could he dissemble the shape of one of the best and greatest of men?</p>
                     <p>Yet this is most probable, seeing Satan could change himself into an Angel of light, and God gives him more power at some times then at other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we will not be too peremptory herein, and build standing structures of bold assertions on so uncertain a foundation: rather with the Rechabites we will live in tents of conjectures, which on better reason we may easily alter and remove.</p>
                     <p>The devils speech looks backward and forward, relates and foretells: the Historicall part thereof is easie, recounting Gods speciall favours to Saul, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to God, and the matter thereof very pious. <hi>Not every one that saith Lord, Lord</hi> (whether to him or of him) <hi>shall enter into the kingdome of heaven</hi>: for Satan here useth the Lords name six times in foure verses. The Propheticall part of his speech is harder, how he could foretell <hi>to morrow shalt thou and thy sonnes be with me</hi>: what, with me true Samuel in heaven? that was too good a place (will some say) for Saul: or with me true Satan in hell? that was too bad a place for Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. What then? with me pretended Samuel in <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the state of the dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:65716:193"/>But how came the Witch or Satan by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? surely that uggly monster never look'd his face in that beautifull glasse of the Trinity, which (as some will have it) represents things to the blessed Angels. No doubt then he gathered it by experimentall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, who, having kept an exact Ephemerides of all actions for more then five thousand years together, can thereby make a more then probable guesse of future contingents; the rather because accidents in this world are not so much new as renewed. Besides, he saw it in the naturall causes, in the strength of the Philistines, and weaknesse of the Israelitish army, and in Davids ripenesse to succeed Saul in the Throne. Perchance as vulturs are said to smell the earthlinesse of a dying corps; so this bird of prey resented a worse then earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly savour in the soul of Saul, an evidence of his death at hand. Or else we may say the devil knew it by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revelation; for God to use the devil for his own turn might impart it unto him, to advance wicked mens repute of Satans power, that they who would be deceived should be deceived to believe that Satan knows more then he does.</p>
                     <p>The dismall news so frighted Saul, that he fell along on the earth, and yet at last is perswaded to arise and eat meat, she killing and dressing a fat calf for him.</p>
                     <p>Witches generally are so poore they can scarce feed themselves: see here one able to feast a King. <hi>That which goeth into the mouth defileth not:</hi> better eat meat of her dressing, then take counsell of her giving; and her hands might be clean, whose soul meddled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits. Saul must eat somewhat, that he might be strengthned to live to be kill'd, as afterwards it came to passe. And here the mention of this Witch in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture vanisheth away, &amp; we will follow her no farther. If afterward she escaped the justice of man, Gods judgement, without her repentance, hath long since overtaken her.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 5. The life of <hi>JOAN</hi> of Arc.</head>
                     <p>IOan of Arc was born in a village called Domren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon the Marches of Bar, near to Vaucoleurs. Her parents, James of Arc and Isabell, were very poore people, and brought her up to keep sheep: where for a while we will leave her, and come to behold the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable estate of the kingdome of France wherein she lived.</p>
                     <p>In her time Charles the seventh was the distressed French King, having onely two entire Provinces left him, Gascoigne and Languedoc, and his enemies were about them, and in all the rest, which were possessed by the English, under their young King Henrie the sixth, and his aged Generalls the Duke of Bedford, and the Earls of Salisbury and Suffolk. Besides they had besieged the city of Orleance, and brought it to that passe that the highest hopes of those therein was to yield on good terms.</p>

                        </note> Noblemen projected with themselves to make a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall for the consumption of the spirits of their King and Countreymen; but this seemed a great difficulty to perform, the French people being so much dejected: and when mens hearts are once down, it is hard to fasten any pullies to them to draw them up. However they resolved to pitch upon some project out of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary road of accidents, to elevate the peoples phancies thereby, knowing that mens phancies easily slip off from smooth and common things, but are quickly catch'd &amp; longest kept in such plots as have odde angles, and strange unusuall corners in them.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon they concluded to set up the foresaid Joan of Arc, to make her pretend that she had a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

from heaven, to be the leader of an army, to drive all the English out of France: and she being an handsome, witty, and bold maid (about twentie years of age) was both apprehensive of the plot, and very active to prosecute it. But other Authours will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any such complotting, but make her moved thereunto either of her own, or by some Spirits insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>By the mediation of a Lord she is brought to the presence of King Charles, whom she instantly knew, though never seen before, and at that time of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose much disguised. This very thing some heighten to a miracle, though others make it fall much beneath a wonder, as being no more then a Scholars ready saying of that lesson, which he hath formerly learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book. To the King she boldly delivers her mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, how that this was the time wherein the sinnes of the English, and the sufferings of the French, were come to the height, and she appointed by the God of heaven to be the French leader to conquer the English. If this opportunity were let slip, let them thank hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens bounty for the tender, and their own folly for the refusall; and who would pity their eternall slavery, who thrust their own liberty from themselves.</p>
                     <p>He must be deaf indeed who heares not that spoken which he desires. Charles triumphs at this news: Both his armes were to few too embrace the motion. The Fame of her flies through France, and all talk of her, whom the Divines esteem as Deborah, the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as Semiramis. People found out a nest of miracles in her education, that so lyon-like a spirit should be bred amongst sheep like David.</p>
                     <p>Ever after she went in mans clothes, being armed cap-a-pe, and mounted on a brave Steed: and which was a wonder, when she was on horseback, none was more bold and daring; when <note n="*" place="margin">

Her first service was in twice victualling of Orleance, whilest the English made no resistance, as if they had eyes onely to gaze, and no arms to fight.</p>
                     <p>Hence she sent a menacing <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>See the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thereof in Speeds King Hen. sixth, pag.</hi> 654.</note> letter to the Earl of Suffolk, the English Generall, commanding him in Gods and her own name to yield up the keyes of all good cities to her, the Virgin sent by God to restore them to the French. The letter was received with scorn; and the trumpeter that brought it commanded to be burnt, against the Law of Nations, saith a French <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Du Serres in his French Hist. translat. by Grimston, p.</hi> 326.</note> Author, but erroneously: for his coming was not warranted by the authority of any lawfull Prince, but from a private maid, how highly soever self-pretended, who had neither estate to keep, nor commission to send a trumpeter.</p>
                     <p>Now the minds of the French were all afloat with this the conceit of their new Generall, which miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously raised their Spirits. Phancie is the castle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the city; and if once mens heads be possest with strange imaginations, the whole body will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and be infinitely transported therewithall. Under her conduct they first drive away the English from Orleance: nor was she a whit daunted, when shot through her arm with an arrow; but taking the arrow in one hand, and her sword in another, <hi>This is a</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>favour,</hi> said she; <hi>let us go on, they cannot escape the hand of God</hi>: and she never left off, till she had beaten the English from the city. And hence this virago (call her now John or Joan) marched on into other countreys, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly revolted to the French crown. The example of the first place was the reason of all the rest to submit. The English in many skirmishes were worsted and defeated with few numbers. But what shall we say?
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65716:196"/>
when God intends a Nation shall be beaten, he ties their hands behind them.</p>
                     <p>The French followed their blow, losing no time, lest the height of their Spirits should be remitted: (mens Imaginations when once on foot must ever be kept going, like those that go on stilts in fenny coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, lest standing still they be in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) and so keeping the conceit of their souldiers at the height, in one twelvemoneth they recovered the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of that the English did possesse.</p>
                     <p>But successe did afterwards fail this She-Generall: for seeking to surprise S. Honories ditch near the city of S. Denis, she was not onely wounded her self, but also lost a Troup of her best and most resolute souldiers; and not long after, nigh the city of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne, being too farre engaged in fight, was taken prisoner by the bastard of Vendosme, who sold her to the Duke of Bedford, and by him she was kept a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner a twelvemoneth in Rohan.</p>
                     <p>It was much disputed amongst the Statists what should be done with her: Some held that no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be inflicted on her, because
<q>
                           <l>Nullum memorabile nomen</l>
                           <l>Foeminea in poena.</l>
                           <l>Cruelty to a woman,</l>
                           <l>Brings honour unto no man.</l>
                        </q>
Besides, putting her to death would render all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men guilty which should hereafter be taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners by the French. Her former valour deserved praise, her present misery deserved pity; captivity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ill action but ill successe: let them rather allow her an honourable pension, and so make her valiant deeds their own by rewarding them. However, she ought not to be put to death: for if the English would punish her, they could not more disgrace her then with life, to let her live though in a poore mean way, and then she would be the best confutation of her own
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65716:197"/>
glorious prophesies; let them make her the Laundresse to the English, who was the Leader to the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>Against these arguments necessity of State was urged, a reason above all reason; it being in vain to dispute whether that may be done which must be done. For the French superstition of her could not be reformed except the idole was destroyed; and it would spoil the French puppet-playes in this nature for ever after, by making her an example. Besides she was no prisoner of warre, but a prisoner of Justice, deserving death for her witchcraft and whoredomes; whereupon she was burnt at Rohan the sixth of July 1461, not without the aspersion of <note n="*" place="margin">Sententia post homines natos durissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>Pol.

                           <hi>Gerson in the book which he wrote of her, after long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing the point leaves it uncertain, but is rather charitably inclined.</hi>
                        </note> men are in a great doubt what to think of her. Some make her a Saint, and inspired by Gods Spirit, whereby she discovered strange secrets and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told things to come. She had ever an old <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Serres, pag.</hi> 325.</note> woman which went with her, and tutoured her; and 'tis suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, seeing this clock could not go without that rusty wheel, that these things might be done by confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, though some more uncharitable conceive them to be done by Satan himself.</p>
                     <p>Two customes she had which can by no way be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. One was her constant going in mans clothes, flatly against Scripture: yea mark all the miracles in Gods Word, wherein though mens estates be often chang'd (poore to rich, bond to free, sick to sound, yea dead to living) yet we reade of no old Aeson made young, no woman Iphis turn'd to a man, or man Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias to a woman; but as for their age or sex, where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture places them, there they stand, and miracle it self will not remove them. Utterly unlawfull therefore was this Joans behaviour, as an occasion to lust; and our English Writers say that when she was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned she confess'd her self to be with <note place="margin">

triall thereof, it was found false. But grant her honest: though she did not burn herself, yet she might kindle others, and provoke them to wantonnesse.</p>
                     <p>Besides, she shaved her hair in the fashion of a <note n="*" place="margin">

Herein she had a smack of Monkery, which makes all the rest the more suspicious, as being sent to maintain as well the Friers as the French Crown. And if we survey all the pretended miracles of that age, we shall find what tune soever they sung, still they had something in the close in the favour of Friers, though brought in as by the by, yet perchance chiefly intended, so that the whole sentence was made for the parenthesis.</p>

Sure after her death the French went on victoriously, and wonne all from the English, partly by their valour, but more by our dissensions; for then began the cruell warres betwixt the Houses of York and Lancaster, till the Red rose might become White, by losing so much bloud, and the White rose Red by shedding it.</p>

                     <p>CEsar Borgia was base-son to Rhoderick Borgia, otherwise called Pope Alexander the sixth. This Alexander was the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>His Father first made him a Cardinall, that thereby his shoulders might be enabled to bear as much Church-preferment as he could load upon him. But Borgia's active spirit disliked the profession, and was <hi>ashamed of the Gospel,</hi> which had more cause to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him; wherefore he quickly got a dispensation to uncardinall himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:65716:201"/>The next hindrance that troubled his high designes was, that his elder brother, the Duke of Candia, stood betwixt him and preferment. It is reported also that these two brothers justled together in their <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Idem lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 179.</note> incest with their own sister Lucretia, one as famous for her whoredomes, as her namesake had <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 1.</note> formerly been for her chastity. The throne and the bed cannot severally abide partners, much lesse both meeting together as here they did. Wherefore Cesar Borgia took order that his brother was kill'd one night as he rode alone in the city of Rome, and his body cast into Tyber; and now he himself stood without competitour in his fathers and sisters affection.</p>
                     <p>His father was infinitely ambitious to advance him, as intending not onely to create him a Duke, but also to create a Dukedome for him, which seemed very difficult if not impossible; for he could neither lengthen the land, nor lessen the sea in Italie, and petty Princes therein were already crouded so thick, there was not any room for any more. However the Pope by fomenting the discords betwixt the French and Spanish about the kingdome of Naples, and by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyling all the Italian States in civill dissensions, out of their breaches pick'd forth a large Principality for his sonne, managed in this manner.</p>
                     <p>There is a fair and fruitfull Province in Italie, called Romania, parcelled into severall States, all holding as feodaries from the Pope, but by small pensions, and those seldome paid. They were bound also not to serve in armes against the Church, which old tie they little regarded, and lesse observed, as conceiving time had fretted it asunder; souldiers generally more weighing his gold that entertaineth them, then the cause or enemy against whom they fight. Pope Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander set his sonne Borgia to reduce that countrey to the Churches jurisdiction, but indeed to subject it to his own absolute hereditary Dominion. This in short
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65716:201"/>
time he <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Guicciard. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 237.</note> effected, partly by the assistance of the French King, whose pensioner he was (and by a French title made Duke Ualentinois) and partly by the effectuall aid of the Ursines, a potent Family in Italie.</p>
                     <p>But afterward the Ursines too late were sensible of their errour herein, and grew suspicious of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For they in helping him to conquer so many petty States, gathered the severall twigs, bound them into a rod, and put it into his hands to beat them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Whereupon they began by degrees to withdraw their help, which Borgia perceived, and having by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and fair promises got the principall of their Family into his hands, he put them<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Machiavill in his Prince, cap.</hi> 7.</note> all to the sword. For he was perfect in the devilish art of dealing an ill turn, doing it so suddenly his enemies should not heare of him before, and so soundly, that he should never heare of them afterwards, either striking alwayes surely, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>And now he thought to cast away his crutches, and stand on his own legs, rendring himself absolute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beholden to the French King or any other: Having wholly conquer'd Romania, he cast his eyes on Hetruria, and therein either wan to submission or compliance most of the cities, an earnest of his future finall conquest, had not the unexpected death of his father Pope Alexander prevented him.</p>
                     <p>This Alexander with his sonne Cesar Borgia intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to poyson some rich Cardinalls, to which purpose a flagon of poysoned wine was prepared: But through the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Guicciard. l.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 307.</note> errour of a servant, not privy to the project, the Pope himself and Borgia his sonne drank thereof, which cost the former his life, and the other a long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing sicknesse.</p>
                     <p>This Cesar Borgia once bragg'd to Machiavill, that he had so cunningly contrived his plots, as to warrant himself against all events. If his father should die first, he had made himself master of such a way, that by the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65716:202"/>
strength of his party in the city of Rome, and conclave of Cardinalls, he could chuse what Pope he pleased, so from him to get assurance of this province of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania to make it hereditary to himself. And if (which was improbable) Nature should crosse her hands, so that he should die before his father, yet even then he had chalked out such a course as would ensure his conquest to his posterity: so that with this politick dilemma he thought himself able to dispute against heaven it self.</p>
                     <p>But (what he afterwards complained of) he never expected that at the same time, wherein his father should die, he himself should also lie desperately sick, disenabled to prosecute his designes, till one unexpected counterblast of Fortune ruffled yea blew away all his projects so curiously plaited. Thus three aces chance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not to rub; and Politicians think themselves to have stopp'd every small cranny, when they have left a whole doore open for divine providence to undo all which they have done.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinalls proceed to the choice of a new Pope, whilest Borgia lay sick abed, much bemoaning himself; for all others (had they the command of all April showrs) could not bestow on drop of pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Pius the third was first chosen Pope, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering his name, being a devout man (such black swans seldome swim in Tyber) but the chair of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence choked him within twenty six dayes, and in his room Julius was chosen, or rather his greatnesse chose himself, a sworn enemy to Cesar Borgia, who still lay under the Physicians hands, and had no power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the election, or to strengthen his new-got Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Romania: the state of his body was to be preferred before the body of his state, and he lay stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep life, not to make a Pope. Yea the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this poyson made him vomit up the Dukedome of Romania which he had swallowed before, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65716:202"/>
whilest he lay sick the States and cities therein reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their own liberties formerly enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>Indeed this disease made Borgia lose his nails, that he could never after scratch to do any mischief; and being banished Italie, he fled into Navarre, where he was obscurely kill'd in a tumultuous insurrection.</p>
                     <p>He was a man master in the art of dissembling, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looking the same way he rowed; extremely lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, never sparing to tread hen and chickens.

And the prodigality of his lust had long before his death made him bankrupt of all the moysture in his body, if his Physicians had not dayly repaired the decayes therein. He exactly knew the operations of all hot and cold poysons, which would surprise nature on a sudden, and which would weary it out with a long siege. He could contract a hundred toads into one drop, and cunningly infuse the same into any pleasant liquour, as the Italians have poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their fingers ends.

heavie censuring of others for light faults: secondly, boasting of his own goodnesse: thirdly, the unequall beating of his pulse in matters of pietie, hard, strong and quick, in publick actions; weak, soft and dull, in private matters: fourthly, shrinking in persecution; for painted faces cannot abide to come nigh the fire.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 9. The life of Iehu.</head>
                     <p>IEhu the sonne of Jehosaphat, the sonne of Nimshi, was one of an active spirit, and therefore employed to confound the house of Ahab; for God, when he means to shave clear, chooses a razour with a sharp edge, and never sendeth a slug on a message that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth haste.</p>
                     <p>A sonne of the Prophets sent by Elisha privately anointed him King at Ramoth Gilead, whereupon he was proclaimed King by the consent of the army. Surely God sent also an invisible messenger to the souls of his fellow-captains, and anointed their hearts with the oyl of Subjection, as he did Jehu's head with the oyl of Sovereignty.</p>
                     <p>Secrecie and celerity are the two wheels of great actions. Jehu had both: he marched to Jezreel faster then Fame could flie, whose wings he had clipt by stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all intelligence, that so at once he might be seen and felt of his enemies. In the way meeting with Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram and Ahaziah, he conjoyned them in their deaths who consorted together in idolatrie. The corps of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam he orders to be cast into Nabaoths vineyard, a garden of herbs royally dung'd, and watered with bloud.</p>
                     <p>Next he revengeth Gods Prophets on cruell Jezabell, whose wicked carcase was devoured by dogs to a small reversion, as if a head that plotted, &amp; hands that practis'd so much mischief, &amp; feet so swift to shed bloud were not meat good enough for dogs to eat. Then by a letter he commands
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65716:204"/>
the heads of Ahabs seventy sonnes (their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians turning their executioners) whose heads being laid on two heaps at the gate of Jezreel served for two soft pillows for Jehu to sleep sweetly upon, having all those corrivalls to the Crown taken away.</p>
                     <p>The Priests of Baal follow after. With a prettywile he fetches them all into the temple of their Idole, where having ended their sacrifice, they themselves were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed. However I dare not acquit Jehu herein. In Holy Fraud I like the Christian but not the sirname thereof, and wonder how any can marry these two together in the same action, seeing surely the parties were never agreed. This I dare say, Be it unjust in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu, it was just with God, that the worshippers of a false God should be deceived with a feigned wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I like Jehu as well as Josiah; his zeal bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as much: But having now got the Crown, he discovers himself a dissembling Hypocrite. It was an ill signe when he said to Jonadab the sonne of Rechab, <hi>Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.</hi> Bad inviting guests to feed their eyes on our goodnesse. But Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites rather then they will lose a drop of praise will lick it up with their own tongue.</p>
                     <p>Before, he had dissembled with Baal, now he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits with God. <hi>He took no heed to walk in the way of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart</hi>: formerly his sword had two edges, one cut for Gods glory, the other for his own preferment. He that before drove so furiously, whilest his private ends whipt on his horses, now will not go a footpace in Gods commandments, <hi>He departed not from the golden calves in Dan and Bethel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know what Flesh will object, that this State-sinne Jehu must commit to maintain his kingdome: for the lions of gold did support the throne of Solomon, but the calves of gold the throne of Jeroboam and his Successours. Should he suffer his Subjects to go up to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65716:205"/>
                        <hi>thrice a yeare</hi> (as the Law <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.23.</note> of Moses command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) this would un-King him in effect, as leaving him no able Subjects to command. And as one in the heathen Poet complains,
<q>
                           <l>Tres sumus imbelles numero, sine viribus uxor,</l>
                           <l>Laertesque senex, Telemachusque puer.</l>
                           <l>Three weaklings we, a wife for warre too mild,</l>
                           <l>Laertes old, Telemachus a child.</l>
                        </q>
So thrice a yeare should Jehu onely be King over such an impotent company of old men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Besides, it was to be feared that the ten Tribes going to Jerusalem to worship, where they fetch'd their God, would also have their King.</p>
                     <p>But Faith will answer, that God that built Jehu's throne without hands, could support it without but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, or being beholden to idolatry: And therefore herein Jehu, who would needs piece out Gods providence with his own carnall policie, was like a foolish greedy gamester, who having all the game in his own hand steals a needlesse card to assure himself of winning the stake, and thereby loses all. For this deep diver was drown'd in his own policie, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael King of Syria was raised up by God to trouble and molest them. Yet God rewarded him with a lease of the Kingdome of foure successive lives, who had he been sincere would have assured him of a Crown here and hereafter.</p>

The elder Donatus being one of tolerable parts, and intolerable pride, rais'd a Schisme in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage against good Cecilian the Bishop there, whom he loaded unjustly with many crimes, which he was not able to prove; and vexed with this disgrace he thought to right his credit by wronging religion, and so began the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>His most dominative tenet was, that the Church was perished from the face of the earth, the reliques thereof onely remaining in his party.

                     <p>The epithet of <hi>rigid</hi> I therefore do adde, to seperate the Donatists from themselves, who seperated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from all other Christians. For there were two principall sides of them: first, the Rogatists, from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus their teacher, to whom S.

Besides, Africa Cesariensis (where the Donatists were) was much more West then South from Judea. But Gods Church cannot be contracted to the Chapell of Donatus, to which God himself (the truest surveyour)

                        <p>That their Church consisted of an holy company, pure and undefiled indeed.

                        <p>Because severall places of Scripture commend, yea command, a separation from them. Jerem. 15.19. <hi>Take forth the pretious from the vile.</hi> 2. Cor. 6.17. <hi>Be ye se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate

                        <p>In these and the like places two things are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: first, a separation from intimate familiarity with profane persons; secondly, a separation from their vices and wickednesse, by detesting and disclaiming them: but neither civill State-society, nor publick Church-communion is hereby prohibited. By <hi>purging out the old leven,</hi> Church-censures are meant, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the openly profane. But that mixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions pollute not, appears, because S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 11.28. <hi>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,</hi> &amp;c. but enjoyns not men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine others; which was necessary if bad Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants did defile. It neither makes the cheere or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the worse to sit next to him at Gods table who wants a wedding-garment, for he that touches his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but disclaims his practices, is as farre from him, as the East from the West, yea as heaven from hell.

                        <p>That the godly were bound to sever from the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the wicked, and not to keep any communion with them. Thus the most rigid of modern Factours for the Independent congregations would draw their files out of the army of our Nationall Church, and set up a congregation wherein Christ shall reigne in Beautie and Puritie.

                        <p>The answer is the same with the former: But the tares shall grow with the corn. And in the visible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church and kingdome of grace, that wicked men shall be unseparablie mingled with the godly, besides our Saviours testimonie, Matt. 13.30. these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons do approve: first, because Hypocrites can never be severed, but by him that can search the heart; secondly, because if men should make the separation, weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would be counted no Christians, and those who have a grain of grace under a load of imperfections would be counted reprobates; thirdly, because Gods vessells of honour from all eternitie, not as yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but wallowing in sinne, would be made casta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; fourthly, because God by the mixture of the wicked with the godly will try the watchfulnesse and patience of his servants; fifthly, because thereby he will bestow many favours on the wicked, to clear his justice, and render them the more inexcusable: lastly, because the mixture of the wicked, grieving the godly, will make them the more heartily pray for the day of judgement. The desire of future glory makes the godly to cry, <hi>Come Lord Iesus</hi>; but the feeling of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent pain (whereof they are most sensible) causeth the ingemination, <hi>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> In a word as it is wholsome for a flock of sheep for some goats to feed amongst them, their bad sent being good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for the sheep to keep them from the <hi>Shakings</hi>; so much profit redounds to the godly by the necessary mixture of the wicked amongst them, making the pious to stick the faster to God and goodnesse.</p>

                        <p>The Donatists also did mightily boast of miracles and visions: they made nothing to step into the third heaven, and have familiar <note n="*" place="margin">Donatus ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, respondet ei Deus de coelo, <hi>Aug. in Iohann. tract.</hi> 3. <hi>prope finem.</hi>

to kill them, or threatning to kill him. Yet he refus'd to do it, unlesse first they would suffer him to bind them all; for fear, said he, that when I have kill'd one or two of you, the rest alter their minds and fall upon me. Having fast bound them all, he soundly whipt them, and so let them alone. Herein he shewed more wit then they wanted, and more charity then wit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them their desires, and giving them their deserts, seeking to make true Saints by marring of false Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>

Augustine (no Heresie could bud out, but presently his pruning-hook was at it) and by whole Councells, one at Carthage, another at Arles. But the Donatists, whilest blessing themselves, cared not for the Churches Anathema's, being so farre from fearing her excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, that they prevented them in first excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating themselves by separation; and they count it a kindnesse to be shut out, who would willingly be gone. Besides, they called at <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <head>CHAP. 12. The Lyer</head>
                     <p>IS one that makes a trade to tell falshoods with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deceive. He is either open or secret. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Lyer or Equivocatour is such a one as by mentall reservations and other tricks deceives him to whom he speaks, being lawfully called to deliver all the truth. And sure speech being but a coppy of the heart, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avouched for a true coppy, that hath lesse in it then the originall. Hence it often comes to passe,
<q>
                           <l>When Iesuites unto us answer <hi>Nay,</hi>
                           </l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Such an Equivocatour we leave, more needing a Book then Character to describe him. The open Lyer is first, either Mischievous, condemn'd by all; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Officious, unlawfull also, because doing ill for good to come of it; thirdly, Jesting, when in sport and merriment. And though some count a Jesting lie to be like the dirt of oysters, which (they say) never stains, yet is it a sinne in earnest. What Policie is it for one to wound himself to tickle others, and to stab his own soul to make the standers by sport? We come to describe the Lyer.</p>

                        <hi>He hath a good memory which he badly abuseth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3</note> Memory in a Lyer is no more then needs. For first lies are hard to be remembred, because many, whereas truth is but one: secondly, because a lie cursorily told takes little footing and settled fastnesse in the tellers memory, but prints it self deeper in the hearers, who take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er notice because of the improbability and deformity thereof; and one will remember the sight of a monster longer then the sight of an handsome body. Hence comes it to passe that when the Lyer hath forgotten himself, his Auditours put him in mind of the lye, and take him therein.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 16. The Pazzians conspiracie.</head>
                     <p>IN the city of <note place="margin">

                        </note> Florence, being then a Popular State, the honourable familie de-Medices ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged all chief affairs, so beloved of the people for their bounty, that the honour they had was not extorted by their greatnesse, but seemed due to their goodnesse. These Mediceans depressed the Pazzians, another familie in that State, as big set, though not so high grown, as the Medicei them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, loading them with injuries, and debarring them not onely from Offices in the city, but their own right. The Pazzians, though highly wrong'd, counterfeited much patience, and, which was a wonder, though malice boyled hot in their hearts, yet no scumme ran over in their mouthes.</p>
                     <p>At last, meeting together, they concluded, that seeing the Legall way was stopp'd with violence, the violent way was become Legall, whereby they must right themselves; and they determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Julian and Laurence Medices, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the State, to dinner, with Cardinall Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael Riarius, and there to murther them. The matter was counted easie, because these two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were but one in effect, their heads in a manner standing on the same shoulders, because they alwayes went together, and were never asunder. Fifty were privy to this plot; each had his office assigned him. Baptista Monteseccius was to kill Laurence, Francis Pazzius and Bernardus Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinius were to set on Julian, whilest the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Pisa, one of their allies, was with a band of men to seise on the Senate-house. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Raphaels company rather then assistance
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65716:220"/>
was required, being neither to hunt, nor kill, but onely to start the game, and by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to bring the two brothers to the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. All appointed the next morning to meet at Masse, in the chief Church of S. Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</p>
                     <p>Here meeting together, all the designe was dash'd: for here they remembred that Julian de Medices never used to <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Machiav. disput. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 397.</note> dine. This they knew before, but considered not till now, as if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the vapours arising out of their ambitious hearts had clouded their understanding. Some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to referre it to another time, which others thought dangerous, conceiving they had sprung so many leaks of suspition, it was impossible to stop them, and feared, there being so many privie to the plot, that if they suffered them to consult with their pillows, their pillows would advise them to make much of their heads; wherefore not daring to stay the seasonable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of their designe, they were forced in heat of passion to parch it up presently, and they resolved to take the matter at the first bound, and to commit the murther (they intended at dinner) here in the Church, taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the two Mediceans would come to Masse, according to their dayly custome.</p>
                     <p>But changing their stage, they were fain also to alter their Actours. Monteseccius would not be employed in the businesse, to stain a sacred place with bloud; and the breaking of this string put their plot quite out of tune. And though Anthony Volateran and Stephen a Priest were substituted in his room, yet these two made not one fit person; so great is the difference betwixt a choice and a shift. When the Host was elevated, they were to assault them; and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65716:220"/>
was a signe to them, not of Christs death past, but of a murther they were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                     <p>But here again they were at a losse. Treason, like Pope Adrian, may be choak'd with a flie, and marr'd with the least unexpected casualtie. Though Laurence was at Church, Julian was absent. And yet by beating about, they recover'd this again: for Francis Pazzius and Bernard Bandinius going home to his house, with comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and courteous discourse brought him to the Church. Then Bandinius with a dagger stabb'd him to the heart, so that he fell down dead, and Francis Pazzius insulting over his corps (now no object of valour but cruelty) gave it many wounds, till blinded with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he strook a deep gash into his own thigh.</p>
                     <p>But what was over-measure in them, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting their parts, was wanting in Anthony and Stephen, who were to kill Laurence in the Quire. <hi>You</hi>

                        <hi>Traitour,</hi> said Anthony; and with that Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence starting back avoided the strength of the blow, and was wounded onely to honour, not danger, and so recovered a strong chapell. Thus Malice, which vents it self in threatning, warns men to shun it, and like hollow singing bullets, flies but halfway to the mark. With as bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse did the Archbishop of Pisa seise on the Senate-house, being conquered by the Lords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in assembled, and, with many of his Complices, hung out of a window.</p>
                     <p>The Pazzians now betake themselves to their last refuge which their desperate courses had left them. James the chief of their family with one hundred more repair to the market-place, and there crie, <hi>Liberty, Liberty.</hi> A few followed them at first,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65716:221"/>
but the snow-ball by rolling did rather melt then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and those, who before had seen the foul face of their treason naked, would not be allured to love it now masked with the pretences of the publick good; and at last, the whole strength of the State subdued them.</p>
                     <p>Every tree about the city bare the fruit of mens heads, and limbes: many were put to death with torment, more with shame, and onely one Renatus Pazzius with pity, who loved his conscience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his kinred, that he would not be active in the conspiracy; and yet his kinred better then his conscience, that he would not reveal it; Treason being like some kind of strong poyson, which though never taken inwardly by cordiall consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it, yet kill's by being held in ones hand, and concealing it.</p>

He loves not to be prodigall of mens lives, but thriftily improves the objects of his cruelty, spending them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and epicurizing on their pain: So that as Philoxenus wished a cranes throat, he could desire asses eares, the longer to entertain their hydeous and miserable roaring. Thus Nature had not racks enough for men (the Colick, Gout, Stone, &amp;c.) but Art must adde to them, and devils in flesh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedate hell here in inventing torments; which when inflicted on malefactours, extort pitie fom merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beholders, (and make them give what is not due) but when used by Tyrants on innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, such tender hearts as stand by suffer what they see, and by the proxie of sympathy feel what they behold.</p>

have wronged and abused the times they live in, they endeavour to make them speechlesse to tell no tales to posterity. Herein their folly is more to be admired then their malice, for learning can never be dreined dry: though it may be dambd up for one Age, yet it will break over; and Historians pens, being long kept fasting, will afterwards feed more greedily on the memories of Tyrants, and describe them to the full.

                        </note> descended of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Emperiall bloud, was a Prince most vicious in his life, and perfidious in his dealing, and for his severall offenses, after long banishment, was at length by Emmanuel the Grecian Emperour, his kinsman, confined to a private city in Paphlagonia.</p>
                     <p>Here Andronicus hugg'd himself in his privacie, though all that time he did but levell, and take aim, intending at last to shoot at the Empire, though for a while he lay very still, and with the Hedgehog seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dead, he rounded himself up in his own prickles without any motion.</p>
                     <p>Leave we him there, and come to behold the face of the Grecian Empire, which presents us with all the Symptomes of a dying State. Emmanuell being dead Alexius his sonne succeeds him, a Minor of twelve years of age, wanting wit to guide himself, and his friends care to govern him. Xena the Mother-Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wholly given to her pleasures, with her minion Alexius Protosebastus, who ruled all in the State. The Nobility factious, snatching what they could get, and counting violent possession the best and onely title. The people of Constantinople valiant onely to make mutinies on every occasion, in confused multitudes, without any Martiall discipline; as who could expect that a rolling snow-ball should have any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fashion?</p>
                     <p>Andronicus, hearing of these misdemeanours, found that opportunity courted him to procure the Empire for himself. Wherefore he remonstrates to the whole world the great grief he conceived at these disorders: For though patience had made him past feeling of any
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65716:224"/>
private injuries offered to himself, yet he must be stark dead indeed, if he were not moved with these generall miseries of the Empire. He being a Prince of the bloud could not without grief behold how Xena the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, and Protosebastus had conspired to abuse the tender age of young Alexius, so to draw all dominion to themselves; and who kowing that their strength consisted in the young Emperours weaknesse, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so to breed him, that in point of judgement he should never be of age, and onely <hi>able in pleasures.</hi> Whereupon Andronicus resolved to free his young kinsman, and the Empire from this thraldome. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is so uggly in her self, that every one that sees it will cast stones at it, which makes her seldome appear but with a borrowed face, for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but especially when ambition hath caught hold on pretended religion, how fast will it climbe?</p>
                     <p>Andronicus with an army of Paphlagonians march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Constantinople, in which city he had a great party on his side, Maria Cesarissa, half sister to the Emperour, with her husband, and many other good Patriots, which bemoaned the distempers in the State, applying themselves to Andronicus for help, counting a bad physician better then none at all. Besides, there were in the city many turbulent spirits, desirous of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, as profitable unto them, counting themselves the petty-Landlords of the times, to whom rich fines and herriots would accrue upon every exchange, and all those took part with Andronicus.</p>
                     <p>Many more did Andronicus winne to his party by his cunning behaviour, for he could speak both elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and religiously. He would ordinarily talk Scripture-language (often fouly misapplyed) as if his memory were a Concordance of the whole Bible, but especially of S. Pauls Epistles, which he had by heart. Besides, no man had better command of rain and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65716:224"/>
sunshine in his face, to smile and weep at pleasure: his tears flowed at will, which caught the affections of many, though others, better acquainted with his tricks, no more pitied his weeping, then they bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moist dropping of stone walls against rainy weather.</p>
                     <p>Small resistance was made against him, onely some seemed to fight against him in complement, so that with ease he made himself master of Constantinople, and not long after he caused Xena the Empresse to be choked, the eyes of whose Favourite Protosebastus he had formerly bored out.</p>
                     <p>The next care of Andronicus was to cut off all those steps by which he had ascended to this height, lest leaving those stairs still standing, others also might climbe up the same way. All those friends who had assisted him in this his designe, he reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death: yea though at first his cruelty might seem to shoot at a mark, in taking of some prime men, for whose death some reason might be rendred, his malice afterwards shot at rovers, as if he had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at mankind, killing all he came near. When any party accused recriminated the accuser, the sword of Andronicus cut on both sides; the accuser and accused were sent the same way, and what cup one began, the other was made to pledge. Those Sycophants which ingratiated themselves with him, escaped no better then others, it being equally dangerous to please and displease him. Men met every where with his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but no where with the reasons thereof. But who can expect other reasons of Tyrants actions, but that they are Tyrants actions?</p>
                     <p>But his dealing with young Alexius the Emperour (whose death was methodically contrived with some politick pauses) deserves observation. At first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the city, Andronicus observed his awfull distance towards the Emperour, teaching others that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65716:225"/>
the minority of Princes ought not to lessen their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reverence unto them. Afterwards, he emboldned himself to make his nearer approches, chalenging in young Alexius that interest which carefull tutours claim in those whose protection they tender. Hence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to set a guard about him, not to defend but watch him, and to guard him from his friends; who, though allowed to follow his sports in hunting, was indeed made sport of himself, and the hunter kept in a net. Then Andronicus was forced by his friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity (whom he himself had secretly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd) to be elected joynt-Emperour with Alexius, and with much unwillingnesse this great dissembler (who could have taught Tiberius craft, and Nero cruelty) was driven up the Emperiall throne. Next day in all publick Edicts the name of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus was set before Alexius, it seeming preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that a child should be preferred before so sage and grave a man.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the life of Alexius was profitable to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus, but now his death would be more behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Wherefore Andronicus counting it cumbersome now any longer to wear a cloke in the sunshine and heat of his happinesse, abandoned all uselesse dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and appear'd like himself. The next news we heare of Alexius, is that his neck is broken with a bowstring by command from Andronicus;<note place="margin">1181</note> his body was spurn'd and abus'd, a hole bored in his ear with a spit, his head cut off, and shamefully dealt with, his body cast into the sea, with many more cruell out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, as much against policie as piety, and not onely needlesse, but scandalous to Andronicus. Thus Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, having once given the rains to their cruelty, are not able to stop themselves.</p>
                     <p>But this innocent bloud cryed to God for revenge, and obtained it. Next yeare Isaacius Angelus was chosen Emperour by the people, and Andronicus
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65716:225"/>
chased out of the city and pursued after. Andronicus got into a ship, and had conveyed himself away, had not the winds and the waves (as if knowing him though disguis'd) refused to be accessary to his escape, and beaten him back again, till he was taken by his pursuers. Being carried into the presence of Isaacius the new Emperour, he there was beaten, spurn'd, kick'd on, and had an arm cut off, and an eye bored out. But all this was mercy, in respect of what he next day suffered by the rascall multitude, being carried on a scabb'd Camell thorow Constantinople, happy he that could do most unhappinesse unto him: all sorts of people sought to mischief him, throwing that upon him, in comparison whereof that which runneth in the channell may be counted rosewater. Thus orphanes thought to revenge the death of their fathers, widows of their husbands: one ran him thorow with a spit, another threw scalding water in his face. At last he could hardly die, being hang'd up by the feet betwixt two pillars after a thousand abuses offer'd unto him.</p>
                     <p>It may seem miraculous how his body could make room for all their blows, or that he so old a man could find so many lives for their cruelty, were it not that passing with some speed thorow the city, few had their full blows at him; and they were somewhat mannerly in their revenge, in that they would not take all to themselves, but leave some to others. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed after long throwing of dirt upon him, their darts became his shield, being so covered over with the filth, that the mire kept him from the mire.</p>
                     <p>All which time he brake not out into any impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but still cryed, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> and, <hi>Why break you a bruised reed</hi>? and bore all with an invincible quietnesse of mind. Surely God measured unto him a time of repentance by a large houreglasse; and haply (it were tyranny to think otherwise of the worst Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) the tempest of the peoples fury might drive his
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65716:226"/>

                     <p>Andronicus reigned two years, having a beautifull aspect, and majestick stature, almost ten foot high, of a strong constitution, advantaged by the temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his diet.

                     <p>FErdinand Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, one bred abroad in the world in severall warres (whom Charles the fifth more employed, then affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, using his churlish nature to hew knotty service) was by Philip the second, King of Spain, appointed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Netherlands.</p>
                     <p>At his first arrivall there, the loyalty of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers to the King of Spain was rather out of joint,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65716:227"/>
then broken off, as not being weary of his government but their own grievances. The wound was rather painfull then deadly, onely the skirts of their lungs were tainted, sending out discontented not rebellious breath, much regretting that their Priviledges, Civil and Ecclesiasticall, were infringed, and they grinded with exactions against their Laws and Liberties.</p>
                     <p>But now Duke D'Alva coming amongst them, he intended to cancell all their charters with his sword, and to reduce them to absolute obedience. And whereas every city was fenced not onely with severall walls, but different locall liberties, and municipall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, he meant to lay all their priviledges levell, and casting them into a flat to stretch a line of absolute command over them. He accounted them a Nation rather stubborn then valiant, and that not from stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of nature, but want of correction, through the long indulgence of their late Governours. He secretly accused Margaret Dutchesse of Parma, the last Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for too much gentlenesse towards them, as if she meant to cure a gangren'd arm with a lenitive plaister, &amp; affirmed that a Ladies hands were too soft to pluck up such thistles by the root. Wherefore the said Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, soon after D'Alva's arrivall (counting it lesse shame to set, then to be outshin'd) petitioned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe her regencie, and return'd into Italie.</p>
                     <p>To welcome the Duke at his entrance, he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with prodigies and monstrous <note n="*" place="margin">

The Duke, nothing moved hereat, proceeds to effect his project, and first sets up the <hi>Counsell of troubles,</hi> consisting of twelve, the Duke being the President. And this Counsell was to order all things in an arbitrary way, without any appeal
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65716:227"/>
from them. Of these twelve some were strangers, such as should not sympathize with the miseries of the countrey; others were upstarts, men of no bloud, and therefore most bloudy; who being themselves grown up in a day, cared not how many they cut down in an houre. And now rather to give some colour, then any virtue to this new composition of counsellours, foure Dutch Lords were mingled with them, that the native Nobility might not seem wholly neglected. Castles were built in every city to bridle the inhabitants, and Garisons put into them. New Bishops Seas erected in severall cities, and the Inquisition brought into the countrey. This Inquisition, first invented against the Moores, as a trappe to catch vermine, was afterwards used as a snare to catch sheep, yea they made it heresie for to be rich. And though all these proceedings were contrary to the solemn oath King Philip had taken, yet the Pope (who onely keeps an <hi>Oath-office,</hi> and takes power to dispence with mens consciences) grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a faculty to set him free from his promise.</p>
                     <p>Sure as some adventurous Physicians, when they are posed with a mungrell disease, drive it on set purpose into a fever, that so knowing the kind of the maladie they may the better apply the cure: So Duke D'Alva was minded by his cruell usage to force their discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents into open rebellion, hoping the better to come to quench the fire when it blazed out, then when it smok'd and smother'd.</p>
                     <p>And now to frighten the rest, with a subtle train he seiseth on the Earls of Egmond and Horn. These counted themselves armed with innocencie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, having performed most excellent service for the King of Spain. But when subjects deserts are above their Princes requitall, oftentimes they study not so much to pay their debts, as to make away their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. All these victories could not excuse them, nor the laurel wreaths on their heads keep their necks from the ax, and the rather, because their eyes must first be
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65716:228"/>
closed up, which would never have patiently beheld the enslaving of their countrey. The French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was at their execution, and wrote to his Master Charles the ninth, King of France, concerning the Earl of Egmond, <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Fam. Strad. de bell. Belgico, pag.</hi> 449.</note> 
                        <hi>That he saw that head struck off in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of Brussels, whose valour had twice made France to shake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Counsell of troubles having once tasted Noble bloud, drank their belly-fulls afterwards. Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to inferiour persons by apprehensions, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confiscations, and banishments, they raged on mens lives and states. Such as upon the vain hope of pardon returned to their houses, were apprehended, and executed by fire, water, gibbets, and the sword, and other kinds of deaths and torments: yea the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of the dead (on whom the earth as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mother bestowed a grave for a childs portion) were cast out of their <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Grimst. Hist. of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, pag.</hi> 413.</note> tombes by the Dukes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whose cruelty outstunk the noysomnesse of their carcases.</p>
                     <p>And lest the maintaining of Garisons might be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to the King his Master, he laid heavy impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions on the people: the Duke affirming that these countreys were fat enough to be stewed in their own liquour, &amp; that the Souldiers here might be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the profits arising hence; yea he boasted that he had found the mines of Peru in the Low-countreys, though the digging of them out never quitted the cost. He demanded the hundredth peny of all their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and immoveable goods, and besides that, the tenth peny of their moveable goods that should be bought and sold, with the twentieth peny of their immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods; without any mention of any time, how long those taxes and exactions should continue.</p>
                     <p>The States protested against the injustice hereof, alledging that all trading would be press'd to death under the weight of this taxation: weaving of stuffs (their staple trade) would soon decay, and their shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65716:228"/>
would be very slow, having so heavy a clog hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them; yea hereby the same commodity must pay a new tole at every passage into a new trade. This would dishearten all industry, and make lazinesse and painfulnesse both of a rate, when beggery was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of both, by reason of this heavy imposition, which made men pay dear for the sweat of their own brows. And yet the weight did not grieve them so much, as the hand which laid it on, being impos'd by a forein power against their ancient priviledge. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many Netherlanders, finding their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey too hot, because of intolerable taxes, sought out a more temperate climate, and fled over into England.</p>
                     <p>As for such as stayed behind, their hearts being brimfull before with discontents, now ran over. 'Tis plain these warres had their originall, not out of the Church, but the State-house. Liberty was true doctrine to Papist and Protestant, Jew and Christian. It is probable that in Noahs Ark the wolf agreed with the lambe, and that all creatures drowned their antipathy, whilest all were in danger of drowning. Thus all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall religions made up one Commonwealth to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Spaniard: and they thought it high time for the Cow to find her horns, when others not content to milk her, went about to cut off her bag.</p>
                     <p>It was a rare happinesse that so many should meet in one chief, William of Nassaw, Prince of Orange, whom they chose their Governour. Yea he met their affections more then halfway in his loving behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; so that Alva's cruelty did not drive more from him, then Nassaw's courtesie invited to him. His po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular nature was of such receipt, that he had room to lodge all comers. In peoples eyes his light shined bright, yet dazled none, all having free accesse unto him: every one was as well pleased as if he had been Prince himself, because he might be so familiar with the Prince. He was wont to content those, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65716:229"/>
his too much humanity, with this saying,<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>I report the Reader to the Belgian Histories, where he may see the changes of warre betwixt these two sides. We will onely observe that Duke D'Alva's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse was above his policy in fencing the rich inland and neglecting the barren maritime places. He onely look'd on the broad gates of the countrey whereby it openeth to the continent of Germany and France, whilest in the mean time almost half the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands ran out at the postern doore towards the sea. Nassaw's side then wounded Achilles in the heel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and touch'd the Spaniard to the quick, when on Palm-sunday (as if the day promised victory) at Brill they took the first livery and seasin of the land, and got soon after most cities towards the sea. Had Alva here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prevented him, probably he had made those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as low in subjection as situation.</p>
                     <p>Now at last he began to be sensible of his errour, and grew weary of his command, desiring to hold that staff no longer, which he perceived he had taken by the wrong end. He saw that going about to bridle the Netherlanders with building of castles in many places, they had gotten the bit into their own teeth: He saw that warre was not quickly to be hunted out of that countrey, where it had taken covert in a wood of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: He saw the cost of some one cities siege would pave the streets thereof with silver, each city, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ort, and sconce being a Gordian knot, which would make Alexanders sword turn edge before he could cut tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it, so that this warre and the world were likely to end together, these Netherlands being like the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block in the chimney, where the fire of warre is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept in (though out every where else) never quite quench'd though rak'd up sometimes in the ashes of a truce. Besides, he saw that the subdued part of the Netherlands obeyed more for fear then love, and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65716:229"/>
their loyalty did rather lie in the Spanish Garisons, then their own hearts, and that in their sighes they breathed many a prosperous gale to Nassaw's party: Lastly, he saw that forrein Princes, having the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards greatnesse in suspicion, desired he might long be digesting this break-fast, lest he should make his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on them, both France and England counting the Low-countreys their outworks to defend their walls: wherefore he petitioned the King of Spain his Master to call him home from this unprofitable service.</p>
                     <p>Then was he called home, and lived some years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Spain, being well respected of the King, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him in conquering Portugall, contrary to the expectation of most, who look'd that the Kings displeasure would fall heavy on him, for causing by his cruelty the defection of so many countreys; yet the King favourably reflected on him, perchance to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate on purpose the hopes of many, and to shew that Kings affections will not tread in the beaten path of vulgar expectation: or seeing that the Dukes life and state could amount to poore satisfaction for his own losses, he thought it more Princely to remit the whole, then to be revenged but in part: or lastly, because he would not measure his servants loyalty by the successe, and lay the unexpected rubs in the allie to the bowlers fault, who took good aim though missing the mark. This led many to believe that Alva onely acted the Kings will, and not willed his acts, following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions he received, and rather going beyond then against his Commission.</p>
                     <p>However most barbarous was his cruelty. He bragg'd as he sate at dinner (and was it not a good grace after meat) that he had caused eighteen thousand to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ordinary minister of justice within the space of six years, besides an infinite more murthered by other tyrannous means. Yea some men he killed many times, giving order to the executioners to
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65716:230"/>
pronounce each syllable of torment long upon them, that the thred of their life might not be cut off but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell'd, as counting it no pain for men to die, except they dyed with pain; witnesse Anthony Utenhow, whom he caused to be tied to a stake with a chain in <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Grimst. Hist. of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, pag.</hi> 411.</note> Brussells, compassing him about with a great fire, but not touching him, turning him round about like a poore beast, who was forced to live in that great torment and extremity, roasting before the fire so long, untill the Halberdiers themselves, having compassion on him, thrust him through, contrary to the will both of the Duke and the Spanish Priests.</p>
                     <p>When the city of Harlem surrendred themselves unto him on condition to have their lives, he suffered some of the Souldiers and Burgers thereof to be starved to death, saying that <hi>though he promised to give them their lives, he did not promise to find them meat.</hi> The Netherlanders used to fright their children with telling them, Duke. D'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va was coming; and no wonder if children were sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him, of whom their fathers were afraid.</p>
                     <p>He was one of a lean body and visage, as if his eager soul, biting for anger at the clog of his body, desired to fret a passage through it. He had this humour, that he neglected the good counsel of others, especially if gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him before he ask'd it, and had rather stumble then beware of a block of another mans telling.</p>
                     <p>But as his life was a miroir of cruelty, so was his death of Gods patience. It was admirable, that his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall acts should have a comicall end; that he that sent so many to the grave, should go to his own, &amp; die in peace. But Gods justice on offenders goes not alwayes in the same path, nor the same pace: And he is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for the fault, who is for a while reprived from the punishment; yea sometimes the guest in the inne goes quietly to bed, before the reckoning for his supper is brought to him to discharge.</p>
