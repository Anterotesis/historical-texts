         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

build their Conclusions upon the clear Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Nature, Scripture, or Vniversal Tradition, They
may be sure enough, (and so may their Reader too) that
they are not actually false, nor what they so write erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.
However if the Reader find any errors of what
nature soever, and can make it appear, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
errors, I shall not (as I said before) deprecate his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Censure, but concur with him, and Censure them

to retract them, and heartily thank him for the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

a Title (as he saies it is) let them have it, I shall not
envy them that honour, but pity their error, who glory in
that which is indeed their sin and shame: For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Title of <hi>Catholick,</hi> which our Adversaries, (without
and against reason) appropriate to themselves; we grant,
and know, that anciently it was, and (when rightly used)
is a word of a good sound &amp; signification, when it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to persons, (as a <hi>Catholick Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Catholick
Doctor,</hi> &amp;c.) it signified such persons as were, 1. <hi>In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Faith, Orthodox;</hi> who intirely believed
and profess'd the true Christian Faith, rejecting all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and dangerous errors, and so were <hi>no Hereticks.</hi>
2. <hi>In respect of their Charity,</hi> such as were in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of Christ, without any uncharitable
Separation from it, and so no <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> Now that
our Adversaries of <hi>Rome</hi> are (as they pretend) such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
is absolutely deny'd; not only by Protestants, but
(except themselves) by all Christians in the World, and
that upon evident and great reason; Considering, 1. Their
many and monstrous<note n="c" place="margin">Concerning the Errors, Superstition and Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (with which I charge them) I do not here name the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, much less the proofs of them. It is not the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of this Epistle. But many of our learned Writers have long since effectually done it. Such I mean, as Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Bp. <hi>Morton, Davenant, John White, Chillingworth</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crakanthorp,</hi> and (to omit many more) lately, my learned Friend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi> The Reader (if he please) may consult these and find satisfaction. Some thing also is said to that purpose, in the following Papers. But if my Popish Adversaries (who are not easily, if at all to be satisfy'd) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me particularly to make good my Charge; I shall undertake it; and hope (by the blessing of God, and the help of the Writings of those learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons I have named) to say that which might (though may be it will not) satisfie my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</note> Errors (contradictory to sacred
Scripture, and the sense and belief of the Christian World
for a thousand years after Christ our blessed Saviour) which
they approve and publickly receive as Articles of their
Faith, in their new Creed, the <hi>Trent-Council,</hi> and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catechism; Considering also their many Superstitions


<pb facs="tcp:53979:7"/>
and stupid Idolatry, professed and practised by them in
their sacred Offices (their <hi>Missal, Breviary, Horae B.
Virginis,</hi> their <hi>Ritual and Pontifical, &amp;c.</hi>) I say, these
things impartially considered, they may be (and really
are) Idolatrous Hereticks; but 'tis impossible they should
be, (what they against greatest evidence pretend to) true
Catholicks. 2. Considering the unchristian (indeed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian)
Pride and Tyranny of the Pope and his Party,
Excommunicating, Cursing and Damning all Christians,
save themselves, (without and against that Charity which
the Gospel requires) and so Schismatically cutting off
from the Body of Christ whole Kingdoms at a Clap (as
<hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth does,<note n="d" place="margin">Declaramus praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam Elizabetham Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticam, eique Adhaerentes Anathematis Sententiam inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things inconsistent with the Christian Temper and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a true Catholick; I say these things considered, and
that the Pope and his Party are really guilty of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Actions, dividing and violating the Vnion of
the Church; it evidently follows, that they are so far from
being true Catholicks that they are great and formal
Schismaticks; And therefore they must pardon me, if in
these Papers, I do not call them (what really they are not)
<hi>Catholicks;</hi> and for the same Reason, I do not call them
<hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> For, as it is neither reason nor sense
to call him an English Gentleman, who is no Gentleman
at all; or him a <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor, who never saw <hi>Paris,</hi> or
ever had or desired that Degree; so it is alike irrational
to call him a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> who really is an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Schismatick,</hi> and no <hi>Catholick</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>5. I know some (otherwise learned and pious) Writers,
who say that those words <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
and imply a Contradiction, as signifying a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

approves it too; and (with the other <hi>Decretals</hi>) confirms
it for Law; and 'tis continued in all Editions of that
Law, ever since. It is then certain and confess'd, That
the Pope <hi>Exalts himself above all that is call'd God,</hi>
above all Kings and Emperors; and that he is far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then they: And if you inquire of the Proportion, how
much he is greater? I say, 2. That their approved and
received Glosses on their Law, (with some difference of
Opinion) calculate how many times the Sun is greater
then the Moon, and then infer the Pope's Greatness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Emperor. And here</p>
            <p>1. The Author of the Gloss, (<hi>Bernardus de Botono</hi> was
the man) a good Lawyer, but (sure I am) no good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomer,
tells us, (ignorantly and ridiculously)—
<hi>That the Sun is greater than the Moon, (and

               <hi>Forty seaven times.</hi> This is pretty well,
but much short of that Magnitude the Pope meant,

            <p>3. But this (as too little) does not please the Pope's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Parasites; and therefore <hi>Laurentius</hi> (another
Canonist) says, <hi>That it is</hi>

            <p>4. But this also comes far short of that Magnitude, which
they ascribe to the Sun above the Moon, (and so to the
Pope above the Emperor) for they tell us,<note n="y" place="margin">Palam est, quod mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo Solis continet mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudem Lunae septies mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies septingenties &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragies quater, &amp; insuper ejus medietatem. <hi>Ibidem in dicta additione ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam Glossam.</hi>

the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> exalt himself. So that if St. <hi>Paul</hi>
say true, <hi>(That he is Antichrist, who exalts himself

follow, that the Pope is Antichrist; for never
man did, or (without Antichristian Pride and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
can so exalt himself. They sometimes tell us in
their Law,—<note n="z" place="margin">Aurum non tam pretiosius est plumbo, quam Regia Dignitate sit Altior Dignitas Sacerdotalis. <hi>Gratian. Can. Duo sunt.</hi> 10. <hi>Distinct.</hi> 96.</note>

think so too, and yet it has heretofore, and still is

            <p>In short, whether the Champions of the Church of

what is said in these Papers, worthy of any Answer, or no,
I know not. But in case they do, I shall make them (if I
mistake not) a very fair offer, which (if accepted) will
much lessen their pains and labour, yet so, as (if they
perform the Condition annexed) they may (as to my self)
effectually do their business, and make me their Proselyte:

(by any one Cogent and Concluding Argument) prove any

Now if it neither do, nor can appear, that in all that
time he exercised any such Monarchical Power or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;
we may safely conclude, either that he had
no such Power (which is most true) or betray'd his trust
in not making use of it, for his Masters Glory, and his
Churches good; which (I suppose) our Adversaries will
not say. In this Case, <hi>Idem est non esse &amp; non

pretences to such Power, (as Vicars of our B. Saviour)
will be vain and irrational; it being impossible that
the Pope or <hi>Peter</hi> should derive from him that power
which he himself neither had, nor ever here on Earth
exercis'd.</p>
            <p>These are the Foundations upon which the Papal
Monarchy (Spiritual and Temporal) is built; and if


<pb facs="tcp:53979:11"/>
these fail, the whole Fabrick will and must fall; and
therefore they are concern'd, by some real and rational
proof, to make them good. Now if our Adversaries can
and will make it appear, from Sacred Scripture, that
<hi>Peter</hi> ever had or exercised such a Power, as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was not personal in him, but to be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Successor; that he was 25. years Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and actually transferred that Power to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
there; or that our blessed Saviour ever had or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
such a terrene and temporal power, as they pretend
the Pope (as his Vicar) has from him: I say, let them
make all, or any one of these Pariculars appear from
Scripture, and I will confess, and retract my error. Nor
is the Condition unjust or unequal, when I require Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proof. For they themselves constantly affirm that
the Pope has Right to his Monarchical Supremacy <hi>Jure

Divine Right; and this their Popes, Canonists and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines

<pb facs="tcp:53979:11"/>
I shall make our Popish Adversaries two further, and (if
that be possible) fairer offers.</p>
            <p>1. Let them prove by any just and concluding reason
whatsoever, that any Christian Church in the World
acknowledg'd, or the Church of Rome her self assumed
and publickly pleaded for such a Papal Supremacy,
as<note n="p" place="margin">They do now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>potestatem Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Temporalem;</hi> as the Book of their Sacred Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies (a little before cited) tells us.

B. Saviour; and (for my own part) I will confess and
retract my Error.</p>
            <p>2. Let them prove, by any such concluding reason, that
any Church in the World (Eastern or Western, Greek
or Latin) did acknowledge (what now the Pope and
his Party so earnestly and vainly contend for) the
<hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> and <hi>his Supremacy over all
General Councils,</hi> for 1500. years after our blessed
Saviour; and for my part, <hi>Cedat Jülus Agris, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

have affirmed, and be (what I hope I never shall be)
their Proselyte.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, I have no more to say, (my Adversaries will
think I have said too much) save only to desire the
Readers, who sincerely and impartially desire truth
and satisfaction, to read and consider the Margent as
well as the Text. In this, they have my Positions,
and the proofs of them, in plain English: In the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
the Authorities and Authors I rely upon, in their
own words, and the Language in which they writ:
and I have (for the Readers ease, not my own) cited
not only the Authors and their Books, but the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Paragraph, Page, and mostly the Editions of them:
That so the Reader may with more ease, find the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces


<pb facs="tcp:53979:12"/>
quoted, and judge whether I have cited and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
them aright. It is notoriously known, that our
Popish Adversaries have published many forged Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Councils, many spurious<note n="a" place="margin">It is notoriously known how many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epistles have been forged, and fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ancient Bishops. I shall only instance in the fifth Epistle of that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pope and Martyr, <hi>Clemens</hi> the first; in which he pleads for a <hi>community</hi> of all things in the world, <hi>even of Wives.

That <hi>Constantinople</hi> should be equal to <hi>Rome,</hi> in Ecclesiastical Matters, <hi>etiam in Ecclesiasticis.</hi> But <hi>Gratian</hi> (in contradiction to the Canon) says, <hi>Non tamen in Ecclesiasticis, &amp;c.</hi> So it was in <hi>Gratian,</hi> in the old Editions; only in the Later E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of <hi>Gratian</hi> (An. 1612. 1618. 1661. &amp;.) this last corruption is acknowledg'd, and (which is not usual) mended. But other corruptions remain still, in their last and best Editions of <hi>Gratian.</hi>
               </note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and thousands of other Authors; making them
(by adding and substracting words or Sentences) say
what they never meant, or not to say what indeed
they did both mean and say: and this they themselves
have (without shame or honesty) publickly own'd, in
their Expurgatory Indices; and after all this fraud
and falsification of Records, these Apocryphal Books
and supposititious Authors, are continually produced
by them (for proofs of their Errors) against Protestants
who well know, and (as many sober men of their own
Communion) justly condemn such impious Roman
Arts—<hi>Nec tali auxilio, nec defensoribus istis
Christus eget.</hi> Truth needs no such forg'd and false;
Medium's to maintain it; nor will any honest man
use them. Sure I am, I have not, in this Discourse,
built the truth of my Positions upon the Testimonies
of our own Protestant Authors, (knowing that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
would with scorn reject their Testimony) nor


<pb facs="tcp:53979:12"/>
of any supposititious or spurious ones. The Testimonies
and Proofs I have quoted, and rely upon, are drawn
from <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>genuine Works of the ancient
Fathers and Councils,</hi> or (which <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
must be valid) from <hi>their own Councils,</hi> the <hi>Popes
Bulls,</hi> their <hi>Canon Law,</hi> their <hi>Casuists, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Summists,</hi> the <hi>Trent Catechism,</hi> the <hi>Book
of the Sacred Ceremonies of the Rom. Church,</hi>
their approved and <hi>received Publick Offices,</hi> (such
as their <hi>Missal, Breviary, Ritual, Pontifical, &amp;c.)</hi>
which Authorities (if I do not misquote, or mistake
their meaning) are, and (to them) must be just proofs
of those Positions for which I have produced them.
But let the Evidence of the Testimonies, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Authors quoted, be what it will; I have
little hope, that they will gain any assent from our
Adversaries; so long as they believe the <hi>Infallibility
of their Pope and Church,</hi> and their Learned Men
are <hi>solemnly sworn, firmly to believe their new
Trent Creed,</hi> (the whole Body of Popish Errors)
<hi>to their last breath,</hi> and to Anathematize and
Damn what Doctrine soever contradicts it. For
while they are possess'd with these Principles, it
may be truly said of them, what was said of the
<hi>Luciferian Hereticks</hi> in St. <hi>Hierome—Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius

may sooner bassle, then perswade them: They

            <p>BEfore I come to a particular and distinct
Examination of the several parts and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
of this Impious Popish Bull, I shall
in general observe,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Pius</hi> V. was not the first or only Pope,<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note>
who usurped this Extravagant and Antichristian
power over Kings and Emperors; to damn, depose,
and deprive them of all their Royal Rights and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53979:17"/>
Jurisdiction; for both his Predecessors and
Successors approved, and with prodigious pride and
impiety, exercis'd such power. That this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
I shall give the Reader some Instances, extant
upon Record, in their own Popish Annals and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.</p>
            <p>1. Pope<note n="a" place="margin">Carolus Sigonius de Regno Italiae, lib. 3. pag. 58.</note> 
               <hi>Constantine</hi> in a Council of <hi>Italian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
(it was about the Year 711.) Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
all who deny'd the worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and<note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>particularly, and by name damns the
Emperor</hi> Philippicus <hi>to the Torments of Hell.</hi> So
<hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> tell us, and <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi>
and the <hi>Fasciculus Temporum</hi> concur with him.</p>
            <p>2. After Pope <hi>Constantine, Gregory</hi> the second, and
<hi>Gregory</hi> the third, succeed<note n="c" place="margin">Car.

               </note>; and both of
them Excommunicate the Emperor <hi>Leo Isau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
for this only Crime, because he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
worshipping of Images; and though the
<hi>Italians</hi> had sworn Allegiance to him, yet they
null that Oath: And the Historian commends
these Actions of those two Popes, as excellent
Examples for Posterity. And <hi>Platina</hi> says,
that <hi>Gregory</hi> the third<note n="d" place="margin">Gregorius 3. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> Imperio &amp; Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione fidelium privat. <hi>Plat. in vita Greg.</hi> 3.</note>

of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi>'s deposing <hi>Childeric</hi> (and,
what the Gloss says of it) is neither left out,
nor any way censur'd. Whence it is evident,
that they approve the Doctrine of deposing
Kings, and (having no just reason for it) forge
Instances to prove it.</p>

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only private Persons, but some Synods

<hi>Father Caron</hi> in his <hi>Remonstrantiâ Hibernorum</hi> (if
some have rightly told the Number) has cited Two
hundred and fifty Popish Authors, who deny the
Popes Power to depose Kings: And though I
know that many of his Citations are Impertinent;
yet I shall neither deny nor doubt, but that there
are many thousand honest Papists in the outward
Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who dislike
this Doctrine. But this will neither Justifie or
Excuse the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so long as her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
and Ruling part publickly approves and
maintains it. For, 1. Father<note n="c" place="margin">Remonstrant: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernorum, part. 1. Cap. 3. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Caron</hi> himself

Power of their Church, resides either in the
Pope, or Council, or both together; And 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
certain, That their Popes, in their approved, and

approved, and (for this Six hundred years last past)
many times practis'd this Doctrine of Deposing
Kings; nor has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (I mean the
Governing and Ruling part of it) by any Publick
Act or Declaration disown'd or censur'd it, as
doubtless she would, had she indeed disliked it.
<hi>Quae non prohibet, cum possit, jubet.</hi> If any man
think otherwise, and can really shew me, that their
Popes and General Councils have not formerly
approved, or since have disown'd and disapprov'd
this Doctrine: I shall willingly acknowledge my

which (at present) I really believe I shall never

            <p>3. Seing it is Evident that Pope <hi>Pius.</hi> V. (and his
Predecessors in the like Cases) calls the Anathema
and Curse contain'd in this Bull, <hi>The Damnation of Q.
Elizabeth;</hi> The next Query will be, What that
hard word signifies, and what they mean by it, in
their Bulls? For the Solution of which doubt, and
Satisfaction to the Query: 1. I take it to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and confess'd; That the word <hi>Damnum</hi> (from


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53979:23"/>
whence <hi>Damnation</hi> comes) signifies a<note n="f" place="margin">Damnum à demendo, quia damnum est Rei di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutio unde Damna Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, apud Gellium. <hi>Noct.

               <hi>loss of some good things,</hi> had and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
before, or of a right to future good things,
and then <hi>Damnation</hi> (as to our present Case) will
be a judicial sentence, which (by way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
imposes such loss and diminution. 2. As
the <hi>Damnum</hi> or loss may be either of Temporal
things here (as loss of Honours, Liberty, Lands
or Life) or of Spiritual and Eternal things, (as
Heaven and Salvation) hereafter; so the <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
also (according to the Nature of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and the mischief intended by it) may be
Temporal or Eternal, or both; if it penally inflict
the loss both of Goods Temporal and Eternal.
3. I say then (and I hope to make it evident) that
the mischief intended by this Papal Bull, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
(so far as the malice and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of an Usurped Power could) endeavoured
to be brought upon that good Queen, was not
only <hi>Temporal,</hi> but also <hi>Spiritual and Eternal.</hi> This
the word <hi>Damnation,</hi> in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Title of
the Bull, (in their Popish Construction) intends
and signifies. For the Temporal mischiefs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be brought upon that Good Queen,
there is no question; they are all particularly
named in the Bull it self, as we shall see anon. For
the Spiritual, that is, a seclusion out of Heaven
and Happiness, and Eternal Damnation of Body
and Soul; that these also were the intended and
designed Effects of this Impious Bull and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
is now to be proved. And here it is
to be Considered,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53979:24"/>
1. That they constantly say, and (having strong
Delusion) possibly may believe it; That Hereticks
(and such the Queen is declared to be in the Bull)
dying Excommunicate, (as that Queen did, and all
true Protestants do) are <hi>Eternally Damn'd.</hi> For,

Controversies of Faith; yet their whole Discourse
and Deductions from the Text of the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
is inconsequent, and indeed ridiculous, and
no way concerns either <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Successors. For,</p>
            <p>1. This Power which God gave to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> was
Personal, to himself only, not hereditary or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death to be continued to any Successor;
much less to <hi>Peter,</hi> who came above Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after. That the Popes of this or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, were Successors to <hi>Peter,</hi> both the
Popes themselves, and Popish Authors univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
affirm; but (as yet) I have found none (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Pope and some few of his Party) who
say that either <hi>Peter,</hi> or any Pope, was Successor
to <hi>Jeremy.</hi> It's true, Pope <hi>Alexander.</hi> III. (in the
Place quoted a little before) says; <hi>That that
Power over Nations and Kingdoms, to pull up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dissipate, and destroy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was (by God) given to</hi>
Jeremy, <hi>and in Him to</hi> Peter. So that (by this
wild Supposition) <hi>Peter</hi> succeeded into that
Power, which before him, <hi>Jeremy</hi> had. But
(notwithstanding his Infallibility) this is <hi>gratis
dictum</hi> without any shadow or pretence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
For he who succeeds into a Right which
another possess'd before him, must do it either,
1. <hi>Per generationem &amp; Jure Sanguinis;</hi> as a Son
succeeds his Father, or the next Heir, <hi>In jus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functi:</hi>
and that <hi>Peter,</hi> or any Pope did this way
succeed <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as none (with any reason) can,
I suppose none will say. 2. <hi>Per Consecrationem
&amp; Jure Ordinis;</hi> so one Bishop succeeds another


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53979:27"/>
in the same Bishoprick. Neither could <hi>Peter</hi>
succeed <hi>Jeremy</hi> this way; for <hi>Jeremy</hi> was never
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place; and then
'tis impossible that they should succeed him in a
Place he never had, and be Successor to one
who never was their Predecessor. 3. A man
may be said to succeed another, who has a new
Commission given him, to Execute an Office
which (though intermitted) some had lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
before him. So suppose the King should give
one a Commission to be High Constable of
<hi>England,</hi> after the Place had been long void;
he who had such Commission, may be said to
succeed him, who had that Office last, though
One or Two hundred years before. Now if
the Pope (or any for him) can shew, that our
blessed Saviour gave <hi>Peter</hi> the same Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which God gave <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and set him over
Nations and Kingdoms, to pull up, dissipate,
and destroy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as Pope <hi>Pius.</hi> V. expresly says
<note n="o" place="margin">Regnans in Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis (<hi>i.e.</hi> Christus) Ecclesiam soli Petro &amp; Successoribus tradidit Gubernandam. <hi>And then it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows</hi>—Hunc Vnum (Petrum scilicet) super Omnes Gentes, &amp; Omnia Regna Principem Constituit, qui evellat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struat, dissipet, disperdat, plantet, &amp;c. <hi>Bulla dicta in Principio.</hi>
               </note>he did, in this His Impious Bull against Q.
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>) then I will Confess, that in this Sense
<hi>Peter</hi> may be called <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Successor. But
that our blessed Saviour gave <hi>Peter</hi> any such
Commission (though the Pope say it) is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
untrue; not only without any foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or ground of Reason for it in Scripture, (and
nothing else can prove it) but point blank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
it. <hi>As our Saviour's Kingdom was not of
this World,</hi> no Temporal Power or Dominion;
so he neither exercis'd any such Power himself,
nor gave <hi>Peter</hi> or his Apostles, (who, all of them


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53979:28"/>
had Equal Power with <hi>Peter</hi>) any such<note n="p" place="margin">Pope <hi>Nicol.</hi> 1. (and he as Infallible as any of his Successors) tells us; That <hi>Ecclesia non habet Gladium nisi Spiritualem, qui non occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, sed vivisicat.</hi> Luit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prandus in vita, Nicol. 1.

Quaest. 2.) yet the Case is alter'd since, and the Gloss upon that Canon (<hi>verbo Gladium</hi>) tells us, that the meaning is; that the Pope has not the Temporal Sword, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad Executionem</hi> only: the Power of the Temporal Sword belongs to the Emperor, but the Pope makes him Emperor, and gives him that Power: and this he proves out of a Decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3.

Imprisonment) nor <hi>in his purse,</hi> by imposing and
exacting Pecuniary Mulcts; as has been, and
might be farther demonstrated, were it now my
business: Only (by the way) I crave leave to
observe, That Pope <hi>Pius</hi> in this Bull, makes that
Commission, which he says, our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
gave <hi>Peter,</hi> far larger than that which God
gave <hi>Jeremy.</hi> For he tells us, 1. <hi>That our blessed
Saviour did</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hunc unum</hi> (Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum scilicet) <hi>Principem Constituit, &amp;c.</hi> Ibid. in dicta Bulla.</note> 
               <hi>Constitute</hi> Peter <hi>a Prince, to pull

but <hi>Jeremy</hi> had not such Universal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as is evident from the<note n="s" place="margin">Jer. 1. 10.</note> Text. But to
make this further appear, it is to be Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Jeremy</hi> was a Priest, and a Prophet; so that
if <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors succeeded him, it
must be in one of those two Capacities. But,
1. 'Tis certain, that neither <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Bishop did, or could succeed him, as a
Priest; he being a Priest of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Order,
which absolutely ceased at our Saviour's death.
2. Nor did he succeed <hi>Jeremy</hi> as to his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Office. 1. Because that was, Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
Temporary, and Expired with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53979:28"/>
The Prophetical Office was not Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
or Successive. 'Tis true, some Prophets

               <hi>Jeremy</hi> was after <hi>Isaiah</hi> about One
hundred sixty five years; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> after him Four
and thirty years; <hi>Daniel</hi> after him Twenty
years. But each Prophet had a new Call and
Commission, and that for particular and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
purposes, as is evident by the Prophecies
themselves. 2. <hi>Jeremy</hi> and those Prophets were

               </gap>, Divinely Inspired, and that to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
and their Prophecies (as Divine, and
the Word of God) referr'd into the Sacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of Scripture; Now although <hi>Peter,</hi> (not

<gap reason="foreign">

that (unless they repented) he would pull down,
destroy, and dissipate those Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,

no Power or Authority to pull down,

Kings and Emperors; nor did he ever do, or
attempt any such thing; he only Prophetied,

would come upon them for their sins, but
it was God only who could and did execute that
Sentence, and when they repented not, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. So in Scripture, the Prophet is said
to do that, which he foretells will be done. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>

               <hi>Pius.</hi> V. in this Bull against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
says, That <hi>our blessed Saviour Committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Church to One Only, to</hi> Peter, <hi>and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
him Only a Prince over all Nations and Kingdoms</hi>
(so he in his Bull) and yet the same Pope, in this
<hi>Roman Breviary,</hi> (for it was Approved and Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him) and the Hymn here cited, says, That
all the Apostles were <hi>Ecclesiarum Principes;</hi> and if
so, then <hi>Peter</hi> was not the <hi>Only Prince</hi> to whom
the Government of the Church was Committed;
no, the Commission of every Apostle (given by
our blessed Saviour) was as unlimited and as large
as <hi>Peters.</hi> This will appear in all the Particulars
of it, equally given to all, as they are expresly set
down in Scripture, from whence alone, we can


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53979:33"/>
surely know, what their Authority and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was. Our blessed Saviour tells them, and us,
—<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 20. 21.</note> 1. <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you.</hi> There
we have the Author and Authority of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
The same blessed Saviour of the World
sends them all. 2. Then he breath'd upon them,
and said,<note n="i" place="margin">Ibidem. vers. 22.</note>
               <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</hi> There we
have the Principle inabling them to discharge that
great Office and Trust reposed in them; It was
that Holy Spirit, which gave them, 1. <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their Doctrine. 2. Power to work Miracles for</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Mark. 16. 20.</note>
               <hi>Confirmation of it.</hi> 3. Then he adds,<note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 23.</note> 
               <hi>whose

the great Spiritual Power given them for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <hi>The Power of the Keys;</hi> which Consists

Power or Promise was (in Scripture) given pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
to <hi>Peter,</hi> whereby he had an Authority and
Dominion over the other Apostles and the whole
Church, to make <hi>him Only a Prince over all Nations

Bull confidently affirms) I say, he who can and
will make both or either of these appear, shall have
my hearty thanks for the Discovery, and I shall

Though this be Erroneous, and evidently Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet <hi>Tirinus, Gratian,</hi> and their Canonists are
not singular in this point, another Learned Jesuit
(in his Commentary on this Place) tells us, That

               <hi>That though our blessed Saviour

            <p>To this, I say, 1.<note place="margin">Responsio. 1.</note> That all they say, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
is <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> for they only say it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pretence of proof. If we will take their

for they bring no proof to prove their Exposition
of this Text, such as might command and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
our Assent. And then a bare denial, is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
enough to a bare Assertion. For (as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
says in the like case) an unproved Position,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53979:34"/>
               <hi>eâdem facilitate rejicitur, quâ Affirmatur.</hi> 2. When
they say, <hi>our blessed Saviour was the chief Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Rock on which the Church was built, and that St.</hi>
Peter <hi>and the Popes succeeded him, with Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
They consequently must say Two things;
1. That our blessed Saviour left his Place and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of being the Fundamental Rock, to <hi>Peter,</hi> when
he left this World. For if he kept it, and still do
keep it, neither the Pope nor <hi>Peter</hi> could be his
Successors. No man can be Successor and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
into a Place till his Predecessor leave it. <hi>Linus</hi>
neither did, nor could succeed <hi>Peter</hi> in the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst <hi>Peter</hi> liv'd, and possess'd it
himself; so that by this Erroneous and Impious
Doctrine, they have displac'd our blessed Saviour
from being the Fundamental Rock, on which the
Church is built, and instead of him, have plac'd
<hi>Peter</hi> first, and then particular Popes successively.
And then let the World judge, in what a miserable
Condition the Church of Christ must be. 1. When
the Fundamental Rock on which it was built, was

Now if these (and such other) Popes be the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Rock</hi> upon which the Church is built,
(and this they say, and would have us believe it)
She must of necessity be in a miserable Condition,
and the Gates of Hell must prevail against Her;
when they evidently prevail against the Rock, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which (they say) she is built; for if the Rock
and Foundation fail, that which is built upon it,
must evidently fall and come to Ruin. This is
the first Consequence of their Doctrine, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Erroneous: but this is not all; For there is a
second Consequence of it, both Erroneous, and
indeed Blasphemous. For, 2. when <hi>they say,</hi> that
our <hi>blessed Saviour was the Fundamental Rock on
which the Church was built,</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> and the

<hi>cum Potestatis plenitudine,</hi> (says <hi>Pius.</hi> V. here)
<hi>Cum Summâ Potestate</hi> (as others Generally) Hence
it follows, That the present Pope has (and every
one of his Predecessors had) the same Power requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the being of a Fundamental Rock, which

That the Rock on which the Church was

the Contradiction amongst our Adversaries, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the pretended Infallibility of their

               <hi>That</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Only was the Rock on which our blessed Saviour built
his Church.</hi> And this the Author (or Authors) of the
Catechism pretends to prove out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp; some
others there named. So that if the <hi>Trent Council</hi> say
True: the <hi>Creed,</hi> or the <hi>Confession of the Cathol. Faith,</hi>
is the <hi>Only Foundation</hi> on which the Church is built,
but if the <hi>Trent Catechism</hi> be in the Right, <hi>Peter
Only is that Rock and Foundation.</hi> Now seeing it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that both these Positions should be true,
it Evidently follows, that there is an Error in the
<hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Catechism,</hi> or (which I rather believe) in
both. That this may further appear, I say,</p>
            <p>4. That 'tis certain, and generally Confess'd,
That <hi>a Lively Faith, and a firm belief of the Gospel,
is a Rock and Foundation against which the Gates of
Hell cannot prevail.</hi> Our blessed Saviour tells us, That

Twelve Apostles on whom the Wall of the <hi>New
Jerusalem,</hi> or the Church of Christ was built;
and therefore their Names (as St. <hi>John</hi> says)
were written on those Foundations, to signifie,
that the Apostles (<hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) were
Founders or Foundations of the Christan
Church. And that this may more distinctly
appear, and from Scripture it self, that every
Apostle, (as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) is a Foundation of
the Christian Church; we are to Consider, First,
That in Scripture the Church is commonly
call'd<note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 15. 1. Cor. 3. 9. 16.</note>

<hi>Peter</hi>) were <hi>Master-Builders</hi> of this House. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
it is (in the Text Cited) that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
a <hi>Master-Builder,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> was no more; nor
is he any where in Scripture, expresly said to be
so much; though I believe, and grant he was.
4. The Means by which these <hi>Master-Builders</hi>
edify'd and built the Church, were these:
Their diligent <hi>Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> (first,
and more Infallibly Communicated to them,
then to any others) Their Pious and Exemplary
Conversation, which made their Preaching
more Effectual, and gave Reputation to it, and
themselves; Their Confirming with Miracles,
and Sealing the Truth of it, with their Blood
and Martyrdom. 5. Hence, the <hi>Gospel it self</hi>
and our Christian Faith, is call'd the <hi>Foundation
of the Church;</hi> as may appear by what is said
before, and by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who expresly<note n="n" place="margin">Ye are Gods build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as a skilful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Builder, I have laid The Foundation. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11: 12. <hi>where</hi>

               <hi>Gospel</hi> he had preach'd
among them. So that (by the Authorities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Cited) I think it may appear, that Divines
(Ancient and Modern, Protestant and Papist)
seem to agree in this; That there is a double
Foundation of the Church, <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal:</hi>
The first is the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or those Holy


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53979:40"/>
Precepts, and gracious Promises contain'd in it;
On the belief and practise whereof, the Church
solely relyes for Grace here, and Glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
And therefore, they are Commonly and
Justly call'd the Foundation on which the
Church is built. Whence it is very usual in
Scripture, to say, that by Preaching the Gospel,
the<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 9. 31. 1. Cor 14. 3. 5. 12. so St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s

               <hi>Church is Edify'd or Built.</hi> And because
our blessed Saviour immediately call'd all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
gave them Authority, and the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Assistance of his Spirit, and sent them to
Preach the Gospel, and they (with great success)

Founders,</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Now (as to this Particular) as the Apostles were

were Shepherds too (sent by, and subordinate to
the great and chief Shepherd <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Church and Christians, over which
the<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> Holy Ghost had set them. 3. Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

no Apostle, (not <hi>Peter,</hi> much less any succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pope) ever did, or could do; nor (without
great folly and impiety) can pretend to. 4. Our
blessed Saviour is such a Rock, such a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Proprietary and the sole true Owner of it; 'tis <hi>his

2. And 'tis as certain, (from the express words
of the Text) and the undoubted meaning of
them) that the Power of the Keys is here given
Equally to all the Apostles, as well as <hi>Peter;</hi>
For so the words of their Commission, <hi>I send

               <hi>Confess'd,</hi> and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truly affirm'd, by a very Learned Popish
Author, That all the Apostles (as well as <hi>Peter</hi>)
are by this Commission <hi>Vicars</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> of


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53979:49"/>
Christ, and have the Power of the Keys (to
<hi>bind</hi> and <hi>loose, retain</hi> and <hi>remit</hi> sins) Equally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them All. Now, if this be true, then it
will inevitably follow, That all the Arguments
they usually bring to prove the Pope's Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
Supremacy (even over Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors)
because he was Christ's Vicar, and had the
Power of the Keys given him; I say, All such
Arguments, from such Topicks, will not only
be inconsequent, but indeed altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and ridiculous. For if this Argument
be good and concluding, <hi>The Keys were given to</hi>
Peter, <hi>and he is the Vicar of Christ:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He is
the sole Supream Monarch of the whole Church.</hi>
Then this will be as good and concluding—<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Apostle</hi> (as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>was the Vicar of
Christ, and had the Keys given him:</hi> Ergo, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Apostle was sole Supream Monarch of the whole
Church.</hi> And then (by this wild Logick) we
shall have Twelve or Thirteen Persons, <hi>and every
one of them sole Supream Monarch of the whole
Church.</hi> That the Power of the Keys, was by
our blessed Saviour, given to All the Apostles
as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> seems to me Evident by the
Premisses, and that all of them (as much and as
well as He) were <hi>Christi Vicarij, Christ's Vicars,</hi>
may be as Evident, and must be Confess'd, even
by our Adversaries; unless they will deny the
plain Truth of Scripture, and their own recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Principles. For, 1. Our blessed Saviour
tells us—<hi>As my</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Father sent me, so send I you.</hi>

               <hi>Ambrose</hi> says) And our blessed

               <hi>Missal,</hi> as does manifestly appear
by the place quoted in the Margent. This
then being certain, and (by our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
Confess'd, That every Apostle (as well

of the Keys given him</hi> by our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

               <hi>words</hi> when and wherein they were
given to <hi>Peter:</hi> I say, this being granted (as
it is, and must) it will be absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to prove any Superiority
in <hi>Peter</hi> (much less a Monarchical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy)
over the other Apostles, from his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Christ's Vicar,</hi> or <hi>the Power of the Keys,</hi>
both which every Apostle had as well and
as much as He, unless you will say, That
very Power which only makes <hi>Peter</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the rest, makes him their Monarch
and Superior. Sure I am, if this Argument
be good (and they have no better) <hi>Peter
is Christ's Vicar, and has the Power of the Keys:</hi>
Ergo, <hi>he is Superior to</hi> John. Then this
will be good too—<hi>John is Christ's Vicar,
and has the Power of the Keys:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He is
Superior to</hi> Peter. But enough (if not too
much) of this. For the Arguments they
bring for the Popes Supremacy, drawn from

The Premises considered, I think it is Evident,

            <p>1. That every Apostle, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> was

to him,</hi> by our blessed Saviour, and that
<hi>Immediately</hi> without <hi>Any dependence on Peter,</hi> or

(though a zealous Assertor of the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy)

St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and so he might for the Rest) and

so it appears by the Premises, and is <hi>Confess'd
by our Adversaries</hi> (in the Places before Cited)
that all of them transferred that Title and

            <p>2. As Antiquity did, so we do grant (all that
with any Reason or Just ground they can desire)
that <hi>Peter</hi> had a Primacy of Order (but not of


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53979:52"/>
Power or Jurisdiction) amongst the Apostles. For
the Evangelist naming the Apostles,<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 10. 2.</note> says—
<hi>The First was Peter.</hi> First in Order, or (if you
will) first <hi>respectu vocationis;</hi> as first call'd by our
blessed Saviour; not to be one of his Disciples;
for so <hi>Andrew</hi> was call'd before him (as is evident
in the<note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 1. 40. 41. 42.</note> Text) but in respect of his Call to
be an Apostle. For when, out of his Disciples
he chose Twelve to be his Apostles, <hi>Matthew</hi> (in
the Place Cited) saith; <hi>The first was Peter.</hi> So we
grant to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (what anciently was
given him) a <hi>Primacy of Order,</hi> and Precedency,
before all the Bishops in the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> But
not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right (which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>John, Feed my Sheep:</hi> &amp;c. And here I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
            <p>1. That, if the Supremacy was <hi>first given to Peter,</hi>
in those words—<note n="h" place="margin">John 21. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Pasce Oves, Feed my Sheep,</hi>
(as is confess'd, and by our Adversaries posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirm'd in the Objection) which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our blessed Saviours Resurrection: then it
is Evident he had it not before: It being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he should have it before it was given him.
And then it will as Evidently follow, that all
those Places in the Gospel, spoken of, or to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
before our blessed Saviour's Passion, are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
urged to prove <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy,
which he had not till after the Resurrection. And
yet <hi>Innocent.</hi> III. <hi>Boniface.</hi> VIII. and other Popes

<hi>Pasce Oves</hi>) to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> had the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

            </p>
            <p>2. But admit, (<hi>dato non Concesso</hi>) which is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
untrue, That <hi>Peter</hi> had such a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Monarchical Power (as they Erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend to) yet it might be <hi>Personal,</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and for his Life only, (as his Apostolical
power was; as to that part of it, which was
properly Apostolical) and not Hereditary, to
be transferred to any Successor. So that the
Hinge of the Controversie will be here, and our
Adversaries concern'd to prove two Things.
1. That <hi>Peter</hi>'s Power (be what it will) was
not Personal, but Hereditary, and to be Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Successor. 2. And that the Pope
and Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was his Legal Successor.
For if they do not, upon just Grounds, make
both these good, good night to their pretended
Supremacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:53979:60"/>
For the First; That the greatest Power St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the Apostles had, was Extraordinary and
Personal, not to be Transmitted to any Successor
(what Power they did transmit, I shall anon shew)
will be Evident, in these Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles, had <hi>Vocationem à Christo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Immediatam.</hi> Our blessed<note n="t" place="margin">Matth. 10. 1. Mark. 3. 14. Luk. 9. 1.</note> Saviour call'd
them all (except <hi>Matthias</hi>) Immediately; as is
evident from the Text. And, sure I am, that
the Pope cannot pretend to such an Immediate
Call.</p>
            <p>2. The Apostles (every one as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) had a
Power given them to do Miracles, <hi>to Cast out</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. Matth. 10. 1.</note>
               <hi>Devils, and heal all manner of Diseases, and
Sicknesses.</hi> Nor can <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be) pretend to this.</p>
            <p>3. The Jurisdiction, which was by our blessed
Saviour given to every Apostle, (to <hi>James</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi>) was Universal;
the whole World was their Diocese. Not that
every one could possibly be in every place, but
where ever any of them came, they had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Preach, Administer the Sacraments,
Constitute and Govern Churches. So <hi>Paul</hi>

2. That this largeness of their Jurisdiction, was

and Folly.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, All the Apostles were <hi>Fundamenta Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae, Domus Dei,</hi> Foundations of the Church,
or House of God, (as has before been evidently
proved from Scripture) and this was in all the
Apostles Extraordinary, and a Personal Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Priviledge, to which, (as it was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles)
none of their Successors (no not the
Pope,) ever did, or (with any reason) could
pretend. And as this Apostolical Priviledge,
so the other four before mention'd (1. <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Vocation. 2. Power to work Miracles. 3. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality
of Jurisdiction. 4. Infallibility in all
things they preach'd or writ.)</hi> I say, all these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
were Extraordinary and Personal to


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53979:66"/>
the Apostles, and never were transmitted to any
of their Successors. And this being granted,
(as of necessity it ought and must) it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follow, that <hi>Peter</hi> neither had, nor could
have, that Monarchical Supremacy over the
Apostles and Universal Church, to which the
Pope and his Party vainly, and without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or ground pretend. For that Papal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Monarchy they pretend <hi>Peter</hi> had,
(according to their Hypothesis) consisted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
in the Universality of his Jurisdiction
over the whole Church, and his Infallibility, as
a Judge, to determine Controversies of Faith;
both which every Apostle had, as much and
as well as he) and therefore it was impossible,
that (in these respects) he should have any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
(much less Supremacy) over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apostles, more than they over him; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
seeing in Scripture, (to men who have
good Eyes, and will Impartially use them) there
is not one Syllable looks that way. Nay, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our blessed Saviour hath expresly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
the contrary. The Apostles were dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and reasoning amongst themselves, which
of them should be <hi>greatest:</hi> (they had their
Infirmities and ambitious desires). But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells them—<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 20. 26. 27.</note>

               <hi>any man,</hi> nor one from another. Our

There may be amongst Scholars of the
same School, and Brethren, an inequality, (and
so there was amongst the Apostles) 1. In respect
<hi>of Age;</hi> Some might be elder, some younger.
2. <hi>In respect of their coming to that School;</hi> some
might come before others; So <hi>Andrew</hi> was first
call'd to our blessed Saviours School, (before
<hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 1. 40, 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>). 3. <hi>In respect of Natural Parts and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
some might have greater Capacities then
others. 4. <hi>In respect of their Masters Love and

So amongst the Twelve, <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>belovod

them, and we willingly grant it. But to say,
(as the Pope, and many of his Party most vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do) that amongst these <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>School-fellows</hi>
in our blessed Saviour's School, <hi>Peter,</hi>

all the rest, this is so contradictory to our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour's plain words, and the manifest and
undoubted meaning of them; that were it not,
that we know men may be sway'd with worldly
Interests, and sometimes have strong Delusions
to believe a Lye; it were incredible that any
Learned men should (with so much Confidence,
and no Reason, assert the Contrary. To pass by

<hi>Peter</hi> was one, not Superior (much less a

he thinks, that both in the Colledge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53979:67"/>
there was (for Orders sake) to be a President,
(not a Monarch, for that was Inconsistent with
<hi>Aristocratie</hi>) And (if this will content them) we
will grant it. Because we do know, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church allow'd the Pope the prime Place
and Precedency in Councils, (for Orders sake)
and that not by any <hi>Divine Right,</hi> (which was

conclude this Point, if our Adversaries assent
not to this manifest Truth, as (being Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to their worldly Interest and misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Infallible Pretensions) 'tis probable they will
not; I shall make them this (to all unprejudiced
Lovers of Truth) fair offer. Let them give
me any one cogent Argument from Scripture
or Universal Tradition (and nothing else can
do it) whereby they can prove, the following
Positions; I will thank God and them for the
discovery, and promise hereby to be their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte.</p>
            <p>1. If they can (by any such Argument) prove
that <hi>Peter</hi> (by <hi>Divine Right</hi>) had such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Supremacy and Jurisdiction over the


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53979:68"/>
Apostles, and the whole Church, (as is vainly
pretended) I will yield the Cause. But if he had
no such Power, 'tis impossible he should transmit
the Power (he never had) to his Successors.</p>
            <p>2. Let it be suppos'd, (which yet is evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true)
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had such a Monarchical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Jurisdiction, even over the rest of
the Apostles, let them prove by any such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as is before mention'd; that it was not only
Temporal, &amp; his only for his life; that it was not
to have an end and period with his Person. For
if it was, then his Successor (whoever he be)
can have no pretence to it. For 'tis impossible,
that any Successor, can have any legal or just
Claim to that Power, which vanish'd and ceas'd
to be, with his Predecessor, who possess'd it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his life.</p>
            <p>3. Admit both these to be true, (which yet are
equally and evidently false) that <hi>Peter had such a
Power,</hi> and that it was <hi>not Personal,</hi> but to be
transmitted to his Successor, seeing such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
must either be done by our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
immediately, or (by Power deriv'd from
him) by <hi>Peter.</hi> Let our Adversaries make it
appear, that either our blessed Saviour himself,
or <hi>Peter</hi> (by Power deriv'd from him) did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
transmit that Power to any Successor, and
I submit.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, Suppose all these to be (what not one of
them is) true; yet unless it do appear, that the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (and not the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
(where they say <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop first) was


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53979:68"/>
that Successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom such Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
was transmitted; he can have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to it. For in this Case, <hi>Idem est non esse &amp;
non apparere.</hi> Let our Adversaries then make
it appear, that either our blessed Saviour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by himself, or <hi>Peter</hi> (by Authority from
him) did<note n="o" place="margin">I know that some of them (eminent for Learning and Dignity in their Church) say; That our blessed Saviour did give <hi>Peter</hi> power to transfer his great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his Successor, and only to him, not to any of the other Apostles; But this they say only, without any pretence of proof. And I commend their Prudence, not to attempt Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities. Johan. Franciscus Bordinus Archbishop of <hi>Avignion,</hi> has published his Opinion, in these words—<hi>Christus Vniversale Totius Ecclesiae Caput Petrum Constituit, qui suas Vices in Terris ageret. Quo quidem in Munere, &amp; si dum viveret, Aequales</hi> (mark that) <hi>habuit caeteros Coapostolos, Nulli tamen Eorum, quod à Domino accipissent, jus per Successionem in alios transferendi facult as fuit.

Pope, and we shall be satisfy'd; and thankful

and how it may appear that the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Peters</hi> Successor. Our Adversaries say,
(and vainly say it only) that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Supream

Nor is it possible to prove the Bishop of Rome to

being impossible, they should shew that to be,

            <p>2. That ever <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> (much less that
he was Bishop there, for Five and twenty
years (as is vainly pretended) cannot be made
appear out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any Apostolical or
Authentick Record; and therefore that he was
there at all, (where he might be, as he was in


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53979:69"/>
many other good Cities, and not Bishop of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them) must depend solely upon <hi>human
and fallible Testimonies,</hi> (I say, Testimonies cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
fallible, if not absolutely false; which
many Learned men have, and do believe). Now
seeing the whole Papal Monarchy and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
depend upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the grounds we have to assure us, that he
ever was there, are fallible and dubious; and
seeing it is irrational (if not impossible) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
considering Person, should give a firm and
undoubted assent to any Conclusion, inferr'd
only upon fallible and dubious premisses. Hence
it evidently follows, That our Faith and belief
of the Papal Monarchy and Infallibility is, and
(till they find better, and more necessary premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
must be fallible and dubious. And here I
desire to be inform'd how it comes to be an
Article of Faith, in their new <hi>Roman Creed;
That the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is Vicar of Christ, and</hi>

            <p>3. I know, that the Assertors of the Papal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
(according to their Interest) are very
desirous to prove out of Scripture, that <hi>Peter</hi>

               <hi>At the same time</hi> (says <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
renders him) <hi>Papias was famous; a man very
Eloquent and Learned, and well skill'd in Scripture.</hi>
But <hi>Christopherson</hi> (his other Translator) goes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
(as usually he does when it makes for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cause) and in his Translation says more in
Commendation of <hi>Papias,</hi> then is in the Text:
For he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Papias (besides his knowledge

               </note> 
               <hi>certainly most learned in
the Knowledge of All Other Arts.</hi> Now if this be
true, then that Character I have given him before,
is not so; and then his Antiquity (which was<note n="h" place="margin">

that <hi>Babylon,</hi> whence St. <hi>Peter</hi> writ, was
<hi>Rome,</hi> will be more valid, and of greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> I say, 1. That all this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Papias</hi> before mention'd, is so far
from having any Authority from <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that
'tis a plain Forgery. <hi>Eusebius</hi> (as to this passage)
is evidently corrupted; and this Commendation
of <hi>Papias</hi> (by whose Ignorance or Knavery, I
know not) shuffled into the Text, long after <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
his death. For, 2. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (who Translated
<hi>Eusebius</hi> his History above One thousand two

says only thus—<hi>About this time flourished</hi> Polycarpe

               <hi>John</hi> tells us,
he had writ so many and such things, as were
necessary and sufficient to Salvation, yet left
out thousands of things, which he thought not

and Impiety) prefers the unwritten Tradition of
those things concerning our blessed Saviour,
which the Apostles had omitted, as not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,

and prime Witness <hi>Rome</hi> has, to prove

4. But let it be granted, that it could be proved
out of Scripture (which is manifestly untrue)
that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet thence it will not
follow that ever he was Bishop there: much
less for Five and twenty years, as is vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
For, 1. That he was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
(or any place else) there is not one syllable in
Scripture; and so from thence there can be no
proof of his <hi>Roman Bishoprick.</hi> And, 2. If it
be granted (which is evidently untrue) that it
could (out of Scripture) be clearly proved, that
he was at <hi>Rome</hi> a longer time, yet hence it does
not follow that he was Bishop there: For he was
at <hi>Jerusalem, Samaria, Joppa, &amp;c.</hi> (as is evident
in Scripture) and yet our Adversaries neither
do, nor (with any sense or reason) can say, that
he was Bishop of all those places. 3. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>

By the way, let me observe; That <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

over the whole Church and the Apostles themselves;</hi>
it had been a great Affront and Injury to St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and such an Incivility as St. <hi>Paul</hi> would

place last cited; For there we have these things

Consent and Agreement of the Apostles) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Bishop of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> (as our

For to take the charge of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi>
too, was not only against his Commission, but


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53979:75"/>
against that Solemn Consent, and Agreement of
the Apostles before mention'd, wherein it was
agreed and promised, That <hi>Peter</hi> should go (not
to <hi>Rome</hi>) but to the Circumcision, and <hi>Paul</hi>
to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Nor can it be credible that
<hi>Peter</hi> would Act in Contradiction to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and his Agreement so solemnly made
with the Apostles. But if at the time of that
Agreement, (which was <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 51.) he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was not, (which is most true) Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or then left it; then it evidently follows,
That he Continued not Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for Five
and twenty years, as is by our Adversaries,
(with great confidence and no reason) asserted.
7. And this is further manifest, from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries

Five and twenty years; nay, he does not so

much less that he was Five and twenty years
Bishop there. But the Latin Copies (Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and Corrupted, as thousands others are
by Roman Arts) deceived him. But to let
this pass; <hi>Baronius</hi> says, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>was Seven
years Bishop of</hi> Antioch, <hi>and Five and twenty of</hi>
Rome. So that (in the whole) he was Two
and thirty years Bishop in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and
took upon him the Charge and Cure of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> in those Provinces. Now our blessed
Saviour's Passion and Ascension was<note n="h" place="margin">Baronius Annal. Tom. 1. ad Ann. Christi, 34. §. 1. &amp; 2.</note> 
               <hi>Anno

wherein <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome)</hi>
the product will be. 66. So that from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
of our blessed Saviour till the year. 66.
<hi>Peter</hi> had taken the Episcopacy and particular
Charge of a <hi>Gentile-Church;</hi> and his<note n="i" place="margin">Idem. Tom. 1. ad Ann. Christi. 69. §. 9.</note> Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was. 13. <hi>Neronis,</hi> that is, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 68. or
(as <hi>Baronius</hi> Computes) 69. whence (by this their
Account) it evidently follows, that during all
the time from our blessed Saviour's Ascension
to his Martyrdom (about two years only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<hi>Peter</hi> was the Apostle and Bishop of
a <hi>Gentile-Church.</hi> Which is, 1. Manifestly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
and inconsistent with what is said of <hi>Peter</hi>


               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53979:76"/>
in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> with his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which the care of the Circumcision was
concredited to him by our blessed Saviour, and
with his Solemn Agreement with the Apostles
to go to the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
And, 2. It is without any the least ground
in Scripture, by which, it neither does, nor can
appear that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> so much as
for one Day, much less that he was Bishop there
Five and twenty years. Nor can it appear in
Scripture, that ever he was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> save<note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 2. 11. 12. 13. &amp;c.</note>
once; nor is there any mention of any thing
he then did there; save that he dissembled, and
was justly reprehended for it, by St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
whereas it is evident in Scripture, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was at <hi>Antioch</hi> for a <hi>whole</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>year</hi> at one time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted

               <hi>afterwards in the Faith,</hi> and<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note>

               <hi>continued there preaching the Gospel;</hi> and
yet (notwithstanding all this) if we will believe
them; <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop there, and not <hi>Paul.</hi>
The truth is; though it be Evident that <hi>Paul,</hi>
as Apostle, did all Episcopal Acts there; yet 'tis
certain, that neither he nor <hi>Peter,</hi> was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
Bishop of that, or any other place.
3. It is utterly incredible, that <hi>Peter</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head and Monarch of the Church (as
they pretend) should for Two and thirty years
be Bishop, and have the particular Charge and
Cure of two of the greatest Cities in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53979:76"/>
and yet none of them (nor he himself) in any

            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Baronius</hi> states the Question thus. <hi>Peter came
to</hi> Antioch <hi>Anno Christi. 39. and was Bishop

               <note n="u" place="margin">Baronius Ibidem. §. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Seven years;</hi> that is, till the year

               <hi>Five and twenty years;</hi> that is, till

<hi>Peter</hi> must be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> two years after

though this Account of <hi>Peter's</hi> Episcopacy
at <hi>Rome,</hi> be not only Erroneous, but (to all
Intelligent Persons) Ridiculous; yet<note n="z" place="margin">Vide Bellarm. de Script. Eccles. in Petro Aposto; &amp; Chronol. suae Part. 2. ad Annum 39. &amp; 44.</note>

In short, as there is no ground in

that he was Twenty five years Bishop there,
neither Scripture nor purer Antiquity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords

years after our blessed Saviour, being
that they must rely upon.</p>
            <p>5. Our Adversaries had ill luck, when they made
<hi>Peter</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> attributed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
to him, and (that he might have it)
made the Pope his Successor. For had they

had far more (though not enough) to prove
(and that out of express Scripture) both <hi>Paul's</hi>
Supremacy, and the Popes Succession to him.
For these following Particulars (every one of
them) may evidently be proved out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
1. That the <hi>Romans</hi> were<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1. 13.</note>

or primitive and pure Antiquity. 6. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> writ a Long and Excellent Epistle to the
<hi>Romans, Peter</hi> did no such thing. Had the
Holy Ghost in Scripture expresly told us,
1. That our <hi>blessed Saviour had Appointed,</hi> and
Commission'd <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>the Apostle of the

Care and Cure of All the Churches lay upon him.</hi>
4. <hi>That he made Orders and Constitutions for the
Government of All The Churches. 5. That he
had writ an Epistle to the</hi> Romans, <hi>to Confirm them
in that Faith he had preach'd amongst them:</hi> I say,
had all these things been in Scripture expresly
said of <hi>Peter,</hi> our Adversaries with great noise
and confidence would (and with far more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and probability might) have asserted <hi>Peter's</hi>
Supremacy, and his Roman Episcopacy, and
that the Pope was, and is his Successor. But
seeing not one of all these is said of <hi>Peter,</hi> and
every one of them expresly said of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is
Evident, that there is far more reason and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
(and that grounded upon express
Scripture) that <hi>Paul</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (and
not <hi>Peter</hi>) and so the Pope might be his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.
And yet our Adversaries<note n="i" place="margin">I confess <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> would (out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> as he vainly thinks) perswade us, that both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome.

the highest Prudential Motives and Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

though the Probabilities, grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he was so, be far greater then <hi>Peter</hi>

            <p>I confess that these, and many such<note n="m" place="margin">Bellarmine <hi>gives us a Catalogue of fifteen such Papal Titles; which are these</hi>—Papa, Pater Patrum, Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Pontifex, summus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos, Princeps Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Vicarius Christi, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Ecclesiae, Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Ecclesiae, Pastor Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Domini, Pater &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Omnium Fidelium, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Domus Dei, Custos vineae Dei, Sponsus Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Dei, Apostolicae Sedis Praesul, Episcopus Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salis, ex quibus Omnibus &amp; Singulis Apertè Colligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Ejus Primatus. <hi>De Romano Pont. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 31.</note> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars

upon by several Popes in their Bulls,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> their Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Constitutions and Epistles, and generally by
all their Party; especially the Clergy (Secular
and Regular) whose great and principal Interest
it is, to maintain the Papal Supremacy: for if
that fail, they irrecoverably fall with it. In some
Centuries past, while gross Ignorance and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
benighted and overaw'd this Western Part of
the World, such Arguments did their Business;
For few could, and (the danger being very great)
few, or none, durst Answer them. But after <hi>Luther</hi>
arose, and Learning reviv'd, all knowing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Persons did see and know, that all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
they did (or could) bring from such To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
were not only Inconsequent, but indeed
impertinent and ridiculous. That this may not
be <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> I shall indeavour to make it Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by plain Instances, (and I hope Effect it) that
none of those Honorary Titles or Priviledges do,
or can afford any just ground of that Supremacy,
and Papal Monarchy, they now so earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for; And here</p>
            <p>1. It is to be observed, that the word <hi>Apostolicus,</hi>
which (for some Ages last past) the Pope has
Assumed, and his Flatterers given him, as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53979:79"/>
to himself, was Anciently a Title given
to all Archbishops.

               <hi>Alcuinus Flaccus</hi>

him,</hi> ad Apostolicum, <hi>that he might Consecrate
him.</hi> The Learned Archbishop<note n="o" place="margin">Petrus de Marca de Concordiâ Sacerdotij &amp; Imperij. Tom. 2. lib. 6. cap. 3. §. 3. pag. 67.</note> of <hi>Paris,</hi>
tells me this; and also that this was the use of
that word in the Sixth Century, in the time of
<hi>Gregorius Turonensis,</hi> who was made Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year. 572. but afterwards, That Title
was<note n="p" place="margin">Sequens aetas absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit—&amp; deinceps Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici Titulus Soli Summo Pontifici attributus est ab Authoribus. <hi>Idem Ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>

desire to know of our Adversaries, how The
Title, being Appropriated to the Pope, does
make more for his Supremacy, then it did for
the Archbishops, when it was common to them
all?</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Sedes Apostolica,</hi> and <hi>Cathedra
Apostolica,</hi> we grant. Because we are sure St.
<hi>Paul</hi> (though not as Bishop) <hi>sate there.</hi> But
that <hi>Peter</hi> ever was there, neither we nor our
Adversaries are, or can be sure. But it is,
and (by our Adversaries) must be granted
too; That <hi>Jerusalem, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>other</hi>

<hi>Peter</hi> had such Supremacy, and that it was not
Personal, but to be transmitted to some Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor;
(both which are manifestly untrue)
yet seeing such Transmission of his Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
must be done either, 1. By some Act of
our blessed Saviour. Or, 2. By some Act of
<hi>Peter,</hi> transmitting his Supremacy to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to <hi>Euodius</hi> at <hi>Antioch:</hi>
it will concern our Adversaries to shew such Act
of our blessed Saviour, or <hi>Peter.</hi> For if they
can, we will submit, and give the Cause; but
if they cannot, then seeing, <hi>idem est non esse &amp;
non apparere;</hi> they must pardon our unbelief,
if we assent not to that, which they cannot
prove. I say, cannot prove; there being not
one syllable in Scripture or Antiquity for Six
hundred years, (I might give more) either
expresly affirming, or from which it may (by
good Consequence) be deduced, that either
our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> did transmit such a
Monarchical Supremacy and Infallibility to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then to the Bishop of
<hi>Antioch.</hi> If any man think otherwise, let him


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53979:81"/>
give us good proof of the contrary, and we
will give him thanks and the Cause. 2. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that the Pope succeeds <hi>Peter,</hi> and really
sits in <hi>Cathedrâ Petri,</hi> as his Successor, (which
is evidently untrue) yet this will not prove his
Monarchical Supremacy; if it do appear that
any other Apostle succeeded our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
(before <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop any where) and
by his own Appointment, sat in our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Place and Episcopal Chair, as his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor;
I say, if this appear, then as our blessed
Saviour is far greater then <hi>Peter,</hi> so his Succes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sor
will be greater then the Pope, and have a
fairer pretence for the Supremacy, as our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

he constantly preached the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and did all those Acts a Bishop
should do in his Diocese. 3. And <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
being the Metropolis of the Jews, <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

Sentence. So that these things seem to me
certain, 1. That our blessed Saviour, though
Bishop of the Universal Church, yet he had a
Particular Episcopal Cure, and Charge of the
Jews, As his Father was King of all the World,
yet Particularly of the Jews.<note n="f" place="margin">

say true) our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him his Successor. Let our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

was our blessed Saviour's Successor, either at
<hi>Rome,</hi> (as some of them, before mention'd, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend) or any where else; and (for my
part) let them take the Cause. Otherwise, if
they cannot, then we may evidently conclude,


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53979:82"/>
That if <hi>James</hi> never did, nor could pretend

<hi>the Bishop is Christ's Vicar;</hi> and they prove it
well, from the express and plain words of the

2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. And <hi>Henry Holden,</hi> a Learned

Supremacy, then all Bishops and Priests (who

this is, to prove any Supremacy

and erroneous, who think that the Exercise of the
Ministery and Power of the Keys, belong to any,
save The Bishops and Presbyters; and who think
those words—Whatsoever you shall bind on Earth,
&amp;c. And whose sins you remit shall be remitted,
&amp;c. to be spoken indifferently to all the Faithful;
and so think that any of the faithful may bind and
loose, remit and retain sins.</hi> In which words
the Council does (I suppose) Infallibly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
(at least in our Adversaries Opinion)
1. That those two<note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 16. 19. &amp; Joh. 20. 23.</note> Texts (which are cited
in the Margent of the<note n="z" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Antv. 1633. p. 152.</note> Council) are to be
understood of the Power of the Keys; though
in one of them (that of <hi>John</hi>) the Keys be not
expresly named. 2. That the Exercise of that
Power of the Keys belongs <hi>To the Bishops and
Presbyters,</hi> but to none else; neither to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
nor any Inferior Orders.</p>
            <p>By the Premisses, I think it evident, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
by our Adversaries) that every Apostle had
the Power of the Keys, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and (since
they left the World) every <hi>Bishop and Priest,</hi> as
well as the Pope. Whence it further (and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly)
follows; <hi>That 'tis impossible that the Bishop
of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any of his party, should (as they vainly
indeavor) prove his Supremacy from his Power of the
Keys; which is common, and really possess'd by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands beside himself.</hi> For this is just as if <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
should brag, that he is far richer then <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
because he has Five hundred pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
when <hi>Sempronius</hi> has an equal Estate, and of
the very same Value. Or as if <hi>Sejus</hi> should say he


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53979:84"/>
had far greater Power then <hi>Cajus,</hi> when the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
given them by the Emperor was equal and the
same. And yet such is the vanity and folly of
their pretended Infallible Judges, that in their
Bulls, and Papal Constitutions, received into the
Body of their Canon Law, <hi>Dabo Tibi Claves,</hi> this
Power of the Keys, is laid as a (Sandy and Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant)
Foundation, on which they build the
vast and Insupportable Fabrick of their Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
I shall Instance only in two (though I might
in many more,) 1. In that famous Decretal of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
the Third (before cited) wherein he impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and ridiculously indeavors to prove, that the
<hi>Papal Dignity,</hi> is as much<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Cap. Solicit. 6. Extra de Major. &amp; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiâ. Where the <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> or Title prefix'd to that Decretal is thus—<hi>Imperium non praeest Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotio, sed subest, &amp; ei Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire Tenetur.</hi> This he indeavours to prove by several ridiculous Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and then comes with <hi>Dabo Tibi Claves, &amp; quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Ligaveris,</hi> as a most known ground of his Supremacy. <hi>Illud tanquam Notissimum omittamus, quod Dominus dixit Petro &amp; in Petro ad Successores Ipsius; Quodcunque Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris, erit ligatum in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp;c. Nihil excipit, qui dixit Quodcunque, &amp;c.</hi> And a little before he tells the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> (to whom he writes) <hi>Quanta est Inter Solem &amp; Lunam, Tanta inter Pontifices &amp; Reges, Differentia Cognoscatur.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>greater then the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial,</hi>
as the <hi>Sun is greater than the Moon:</hi> And
amongst other wild and ridiculous Arguments to
prove his equally wild and extravagant Position,
he comes at last, to this, <hi>Dabo Tibi Claves,</hi> to the
Power of the Keys, as the <hi>most known</hi> ground of
his Supremacy. 2. The second Instance, is that
of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, in his Impious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
and Deposition of the Emperor
<hi>Frederick,</hi> (who had been before Excommunicated
by his Predecessor <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth) in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lions.</hi> It is<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. ad. Apostol. 2. De Sent. &amp; re Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. In. 6.</note> Extant in the Canon Law,
and two things there prefix'd to that most Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Decretal. 1. <hi>That he depos'd</hi> Frederick <hi>in the
Council, for a perpetual</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Innocentius Sacro praesente Concilio in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam Sempiternam.</note> 
               <hi>memory of it.</hi> And so
it stands for a perpetual memory of his Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Pride and Impiety. 2. <hi>That the Pope can De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Papa Imperatorem depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Emperor for lawful Causes.</hi> And then,
in that Impious Decretal, he grounds his Power


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53979:84"/>
to Depose the Emperor principally upon the
<hi>Power of</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Cum à Christo No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis in Petri Persona dictum sit; Quodcunque Ligaveris super Terram, Ligatum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Coelis, &amp;c.

is evident that, (in the sense and plain meaning

            <p>3. But that we may better know their meaning

            <p>By the Premisses, I hope it may (and does)

(beside the Pope) who never had, nor dream'd
of any Supremacy: Though in these late, and
worst Ages, they have been appropriated to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and (though Old and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Titles) made use of, to amuse and deceive
the Ignorant, to cover, and give some Colour
and Credit to New Errors, and made Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

appropriates the name <hi>Pope</hi> to himself and See,
which had for Eight hundred years (he might

Now I desire to know, how this, or any of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Honorary Titles or Priviledges, (which
were common to all Bishops, and usually given
them, for many Ages, as well as to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi>); can be an Argument or Ground of the
Popes Supremacy, which were confessedly no


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53979:86"/>
ground of any such Supremacy in other Bishops,
who had the very same Titles and Priviledges, as
well, and as much as he? Suppose twenty Swans
(<hi>possibili posito in esse, nil absurdi sequitur</hi>) to have
equal whiteness, and the same Degree of that
Quality; To say that any one of those Swans was,
by far, the whitest Swan in the World, when as
nineteen others were as white as that one: Or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
twenty men of Equal Piety, all having the
same Degree of Goodness and Vertue; to say,
that any one of them, was, by far, the most Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man in the World, when nineteen others
were as Pious as he; this were certainly irrational,
and ridiculous. And yet our Adversaries reason
no better, when they say; <hi>The Pope being Christ's
Vicar, and having the Power of the Keys, has a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Supremacy over all the Bishops in the World;</hi>
when all those Bishops are Christ's Vicars, and
have the Power of the Keys, as well as he. But
enough (if not too much) of this. For were it
not for the great noise, number, and confidence
of our Adversaries, such miserable inconsequent
Reasonings, might deserve Pity and Contempt,

the Pope speaks here (notwithstanding his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility)
is neither Reason, nor Sense; for
if her Right to the Crown, was only (as he
calls it) <hi>Pretended;</hi> he could not possibly take
it away, no not by his <hi>Plenitude of Apostolical
Power</hi> (if he really had it): For, 1. (Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

she might keep that Right, and as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend a Right to the Crown after, as before

in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days; (after the Bull
and Excommunication was publish'd, (as many
did, and do, either as Merchants or Travellers)
and obey'd the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> (as of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
they must, and ought to conform to the
Civil Laws of the Country where they live)
all these, (by this wild Bull) did stand Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
Nor had they any way to Escape
it, but either by Leaving the Kingdom, and all
their Trade and Interest in it, to their great
loss, and possibly the ruin of some: Or by
staying here, and disobeying the Queens Laws,
(which never was, nor would be permitted)
to undergo all the Severity and Penalties of
those Laws. 2. But (which is yet much more
strange) suppose any <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> in the Queens time; he Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
all those, if they obey the Queen; But
surely this Rash and Impious Sentence, was
not pronounc'd <hi>è Cathedrâ;</hi> for (which is no
good Sign of his Infallibility) he does in this
undertake a thing beyond all the Power he did
or could pretend to, an absolute Impossibility.
For Excommunication being a Selusion and
Depriving a man of Ecclesiastical Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a turning out of the Christian Church;


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53979:88"/>
it was absolutely Impossible that either <hi>Peter,</hi> or
the Pope his pretended Successor, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
those of a Communion they never had,
or turn them out of a Church in which they
never were.</p>
            <p>6. He Excommunicates all Papists, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
if they obey'd any of the Queens
Laws or Commands. So that their Case was
this; If they obey'd the Queen, their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
(to whom they ought a natural and
sworn Allegiance) the Pope Curses and Damns
them; and if they did not obey her, (as St.
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note>
               <hi>Paul</hi> assures us) God himself <hi>would Condemn
them.</hi> Certainly, all pious and considering
Persons will think this an easie choice; and that
it is better <hi>rather to Obey God then Men,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
St. <hi>Paul</hi> rather then the Pope; and yet
such is the Power of Error and strong Delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the generality of the Papists, (I do
not say all) choose to obey the Pope; as shall
appear evidently anon, by their many open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and continual Plots and Conspiracies
to disquiet the Government, and their Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
(by Pistol or Poyson) to Assassinate and
take away the Queens Life. 2. That all Papists
who gave any Obedience to the Queens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
or Laws, were Excommunicate, as well
as Protestants, is evident by this: That the
Popish Party<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Their Petition was, That</hi> Their most holy Lord <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, would give a Declaratory Explication of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth's Bull, against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; that it might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood so, as always to bind her and the Hereticks, but not the Catholicks, as matters then stood; but hereafter, when Publick Execution of the Bull may be had. <hi>The Answer was,</hi> These Graces the highest Bishop hath granted to <hi>Rob.

hereafter only, when That Bull might be put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</hi>
They were willing to Obey the Pope,
and Disobey their Queen, when they had an
Opportunity; They Petition the Pope to give
them leave to do, what God (by Divine Law,
Natural and Positive) had Commanded them
to do; that is, to obey their Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and that they will Obey no longer,
then till they have a Power and Ability, (with
Security to themselves and Estates) to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>

before any Judge can Legally Condemn any;
Two things are necessary to preceed; 1. <hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">The necessity of these things ariseth from the Infirmity and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of all Human Judges; which is attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the Canon Law; <hi>Judicium Dei ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati, semper inititur, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium aut em Ecclesiae, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunquam opinionem sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quam &amp; fallere Saepe contingit, &amp; falli; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quod contingit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ut Qui Ligatus est apud Deum, apud Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am sit solutus; &amp; qui liber est apud Deum, Ecclesiastica sit Sententiâ innodatus.</hi> Innocent. 3.

               <hi>Causae,</hi> a Convenient Knowledge of the

brings; what Answer and Defence the <hi>Reus,</hi> or

a Damnatory Sentence. If either of these be
wanting, either the Judge or Sentence, (or both)
are unjust.

more signally in taking away the Cup in the

               </gap>, an Adversary to Christ, let
the Reader Judge, by that which follows. Our
blessed Saviour expresly Commands, that in the
Assemblies of Christians all things should be in
a Tongue understood by the People, for their
Edification, (and the Apostle thinks it<note n="s" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 23.</note> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do otherwise) that they might know his
Precepts and gracious Promises; and so their
Duty, and Incouragements to do it. But the
Pope (as all know) in Contradiction to this,
absolutely forbids what our blessed Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
Commands; and prohibits all Publick

<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, an Adversary and Enemy to our

is; That whereas the Gospel was writ to be
read and studied (by all who had ability) as
the great means of their Salvation; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
was Translated into all Christian
Languages, and all permitted to have and read
it; that they might (for their direction and

to this Day in all Christian Churches (except

neither the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> nor any Book in the World,
is so fatal to their miscall'd Catholick Religion,
as (when truly understood and believ'd) the
Bible. That Book evidently discovers, and
condemns their Errors; and therefore they are
concern'd to keep it from the People, least they
should find (as by that Divine Light they easily
might) and forsake their Errors. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses

himself above all that is called God,</hi> (as all
Magistrates Subordinate and Supream, Kings

This then (<hi>in Thesi</hi>) being granted; we must
next (<hi>in Hypothesi</hi>) Inquire, <hi>Whether this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteristical
Note and Mark of Antichrist, may be
truly affirm'd of the Pope, and be really found in
him?</hi> In Answer to which Query, I say; I hope
it may, and does appear by the Premisses, That
the Pope does Exalt himself, far above all Kings
and Emperors, more then any man in the
World ever did, or (Antichrist excepted) ever
will; and therefore I shall only add two or
three things in Confirmation of the Premisses.

that a man would think it might satisfie

that he Exalts himself, as Universal Monarch,

half the World, from the true Owners,
<hi>Causa incognita, inaudita, indicta;</hi> the Persons
and their Quality being utterly unknown to
him. If it be said, <hi>They were Pagan Idolaters:</hi>
Grant that. Yet, 1. What they all were, he
neither did, nor could know. 2. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
were such, (as probably they were) yet
<hi>dominium non fundatur in gratiâ;</hi> a Pagan and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater
may (<hi>jure naturae</hi>) have as just a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Right to his Estate, as a Christian. <hi>Caesar</hi>
was a <hi>Pagan</hi> in our blessed Saviours time; and
yet he Commands them to<note n="s" place="margin">Matth. 22. 21.</note> 
               <hi>give to Caesar
the things which were Caesars.</hi> Some things were
<hi>Caesars</hi> in which he had a propriety, and to
which he had a right, and his Subjects an
Obligation to pay him tribute, and other things
<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 13. 7. The Apostle commands the Romans to pay tribute to whom it was due, that is, to <hi>Caesar;</hi> for to him only they were Subjects, and to him only Tribute was due from them. Our blessed Saviour (as man, born in the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) was subject to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and paid him Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. Matth. 17. 25.

               </note>due to him. But I hope this will not be
deny'd: For if none, but pious men, and true


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53979:98"/>
Christians have any just Right to what they
possess, it will (I fear) go hard with his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and he will have no Propriety in St. <hi>Peters</hi>
Patrimony, or any other thing he does possess.
And therefore (if he Impartially consider it)
he may find some reason, if not for Truths
sake (which with him is not always a prevailing
Motive) yet for his own, to be (in this) of my
opinion: By the Premisses, I hope it may, and
does appear, <hi>That the Pope Exalts himself above

            <p>But some say,<note place="margin">Dubium.</note> 
               <hi>That Antichrist is not yet come; nor

               <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
says, <hi>That this is the Opinion of Catholicks.</hi> And
some Learned Protestants (as <hi>Grotius</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Hammond</hi>) say, <hi>That Antichrist is both come, and
gone, 1600. years ago.</hi> For <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> (<hi>Grotius</hi>
his Antichrist) died<note n="p" place="margin">Baronius Annal. Tom. 1. ad Ann. 43. §. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 43. And

               <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 68. So


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53979:101"/>
that both <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> (who are their
supposed Antichrists) are dead above a thousand
six hundred years ago. Whence it will follow,
That the Pope neither is, nor ever was, or can be
Antichrist. For if either <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperor, or
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> were then, when they lived, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
then the Pope was not; (neither of them
being Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) and both of them being
(so many Ages since) dead; the Pope neither is,
nor ever can be Antichrist, unless you will have
two great Antichrists; which no man yet ever
did, or (with any Reason or Sense) can
say.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> I shall say a few things: And,
1. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (who says, <hi>That the Catholick O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is, That Antichrist is not yet come</hi>) I confess he,
and all his Party are highly concern'd to say so.
For if Antichrist be Actually come, then the Pope
must be that <hi>Man of Sin;</hi> He (and none in the
World but he) having all the Characters and
Marks of Antichrist mention'd in Scripture, so
plain, that he who runs may read them. 2. Though
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> say, <hi>'Tis the Catholick Opinion, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
is not yet come;</hi> yet it evidently appears (by
the many Authentick Testimonies before Cited,
and the Authors were Papists) That Antichrist is
come Six hundred years ago, and that the Pope
was he, <hi>Plerique Omnes Boni, &amp;c.</hi> (says the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
before Cited) <hi>Most Good Men believed</hi> Rome
<hi>to be</hi> Babylon, <hi>and the Pope Antichrist. 3. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>

in a Synod call'd by him at <hi>Florence.</hi> But <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
might have named Five hundred more,
(which he wisely conceal'd, because they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and he neither had, nor could have
any just Answer to so many, and so evident Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies)
I shall only add (besides those before
mention'd) one signal Testimony more, to shew,
That even at <hi>Rome</hi> it self, it was believ'd, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
should come in the end of the Tenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.
I have seen (and the Book, if any desire it,
is still to be<note n="u" place="margin">In <hi>Bodley</hi>'s Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Oxon. Cod. 76, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per D. Arts.

MS. Missal, belonging anciently to the
Church and City of <hi>Rome,</hi> (for there are some
particular Services in it, to be said in some of the

the beginning of it, there is a Chronological Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in which (amongst other things) we are told,
That <hi>à Christo ad Antichristum sunt Anni.</hi> 999. So
that it was believ'd then at <hi>Rome,</hi> that Antichrist
should come in the last year of the tenth Century:
and if he did so, (and so it was believed then) <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester</hi>

for me (and not more immodestly) to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them, as it was for them to contradict all
(Ancient and Modern) who ever writ on those
Passages in the Second to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning
Antichrist. I had, and have great
respect and reverence for their Persons, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
but more for Truth; and therefore, the
Apology of <hi>Aristotle</hi> (concerning the Errors of
his Master <hi>Plato</hi>) may, and shall be mine. <hi>Amicus
Plato,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He (whoever he be) who
out of Reverence and Respect to any men (how
great soever) either imbraces, or (when he knows
them) conceals their Errors, wants Charity to
himself, and others; who possibly (if he had not
conceal'd them) might have avoided those Errors,
and gain'd the knowledge of Truth. In short
then, I consider</p>
            <p>1. That it is evident in the Apostle, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
was not come when St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle;
for he tells them,<note n="c" place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That an Apostacy
must first come, and that which hindred the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53979:102"/>
of Antichrist, must be taken out of the way,</hi>
(neither of which was done, when he writ that
Epistle) <hi>Grotius</hi> saw this, and therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he would Contradict Truth and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
he could not make <hi>Caius</hi> Antichrist, unless
the Epistle were so dated, that it was writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Caius</hi> appear'd. For this purpose, he tells
us, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>writ the Epistle,</hi> Anno<note n="d" place="margin">Secundum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putum Dionysij vulgat. 38. sed Ann. Christ. 40. secundum verum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putum. <hi>Collegi</hi> (inquit Grotius) <hi>scriptam hanc Epistolam Anno Altero Caiani Principatus.</hi> Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Prologo ad 2. ad Thess.</note> Christi,
38. or, 40. <hi>in the Second year of</hi> Caius Caligula;
<hi>and</hi> (he says) <hi>that although</hi> Caius <hi>was Emperor
before St.</hi> Paul <hi>writ this Epistle, yet his Impiety
did not appear till afterwards; He in the beginning
of his Reign carrying himself like a good Prince.</hi>
So that the main Hinge on which <hi>Grotius</hi> his
Opinion turns, is this date of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle:
For if it was not writ before <hi>Caius</hi> appeared,
(or the year, 40.) then 'tis evident that <hi>Caius</hi>
cannot be Antichrist, nor <hi>Grotius</hi> his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
true. Now that this Epistle was writ in the
Second year of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> (which <hi>Grotius</hi>
affirms) is so far from being true, that (by the
Judgment and Consent of the most Learned
Chronologers (Papists and Protestants) it was
writ at least Seaven or Eight years after <hi>Caius</hi>
was dead. Such, I mean, as the late Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

Ten or Eleven years after; let it be consider'd,
1. That it is a received Truth, that <hi>Paul</hi> was

<hi>Paul</hi> had pass'd through and preach'd in all

and <hi>Timothy</hi> was returned to him; then (and

overthrown, and <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be that Antichrist St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks
of; who was not come, when he writ that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</p>
            <p>2. And by the same. Principles, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has
evidently Confuted his own Opinion, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> from all possibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Antichrist. For that Doctor expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
two things; 1. That the Second Epistle
to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> was writ, in the year of


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53979:104"/>
our blessed Saviour, 51. 2. That then Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
(when that Epistle was writ) was not
come or reveal'd: which two things being
granted, (as they must, for the Doctor says
the one, and the Apostle the other) it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> neither was, nor
could be that Antichrist the Apostle speaks of in
that Epistle. For it is certain, that <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
was come, and his Heresie and Prodigious
Impiety discovered many years before. For,
1. It is certain, that when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were
sent to<note n="s" place="margin">Act. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Samaria,</hi> they met <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
there; who though he had been<note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 13.</note> baptiz'd
by <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon, was no better for it, and
Impiously offer'd<note n="u" place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> Money to purchase Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to give the Holy Ghost; <hi>Peter</hi> (cursing both
<note n="x" place="margin">They Money perish with thee, <hi>vers.</hi> 20.</note>him and his Money) told him, <hi>That he was
in the</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Gall of Bitterness, and the Bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
2. Now this was done, in the year of
our blessed Saviour<note n="z" place="margin">Baronius Annal. Tom. 1. ad Ann. 35. §. 9. Ita etiam Hen. Holden, Dr. Theol. in Tabulâ Gestorum Petri, in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce N. Test. cum Annot. suis Edit. Paris. 1660. p. 881.</note> 35. which was Fifteen

that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> should be that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
the Apostle speaks of. For that from
the year. 35. till after. 51. (for Sixteen years
together) he should not discover, but conceal
his Impiety, (who was a Magician and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious

against our blessed Saviour and his Apostles,

all the Magick and Malice he had, he publickly

and be drunk with their blood. 2. But (that
I may not trouble the Reader, nor my self, with
any more Particulars) I say (and think it an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
Truth) that there is nothing said in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or in the Works of the Fathers, or in
any Writings of Ecclesiastical Authors, for Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred years after our blessed Saviour,


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53979:106"/>
from which it may but probably be concluded,
that <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperor, or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> was
that great Antichrist mention'd by St. <hi>Paul</hi> and
St. <hi>John;</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on the contrary, it
does appear both by Scripture and the Consent
of Christendom, for Sixteen hundred years,
that neither of the two was, or possibly could
be that great Antichrist. For,</p>
            <p>1. It does appear (by what is above said) that
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of Antichrist, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.
cannot be meant of <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus;</hi>
because St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place says expresly,
that when he writ that Epistle, the <hi>Man of
Sin,</hi> and Son of Perdition <hi>was not come and
reveal'd.</hi> And yet that Epistle being writ (as
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Confesseth) <hi>Anno Christ.</hi> 51.
<hi>Caius</hi> was both come and dead at least Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Eight years before the year. 51. and
therefore could not possibly be that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
who was not come till after it. And
for <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he was (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
grants and proves) both come and reveal'd
as many years (as <hi>Caius</hi> was dead) before St.
<hi>Paul</hi> writ that Epistle; and consequently
before Antichrist was come or revealed.
And so he (who was come and reveal'd)
could not be that Antichrist, who (as St.

3. What the Apostle in this Epistle speaks of
the Apostasie and Antichrist which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is not of things past or then in being,
but of things to come afterwards. For he
expresly says—<note n="u" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Apostasie</hi> nor <hi>Antichrist were then come;</hi>
but afterwards, <hi>in the Latter times, should
come.</hi> 4. Now he writ this Epistle, as some
<note n="x" place="margin">So <hi>Ed. Simpson</hi> Chronol. Cathol.

            <p>Now let my Adversaries chuse which Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they will, for the date and time of writing
this Epistle; let it be (if they please) the year 54.
which is furthest from Truth, yet most favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Opinion. I say, admit that this first
Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was writ by St. <hi>Paul, Ann.</hi> 54.
yet it will appear by the Premisses, 1. That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
was not then come, nor revealed, because
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says so. 2. And therefore, that neither
<hi>Caius</hi> nor <hi>Simon Magus</hi> could be Antichrist; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Caius</hi> was both come and dead ten or eleven
years before; and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was come, and his
Heresie and Impieties revealed (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>

'tis certain <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> could

            <p>5. In the <hi>Revelation,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> does more fully

that the <hi>great Antichrist was not come,</hi> when St.

was writ after <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
were dead, then it will be undeniably Evident,

that neither of them could be that <hi>great Antichrist,</hi>
of whom St. <hi>John</hi> speaks; who (when he writ this

to be considered,</p>
            <p>1. That 'tis a common and received Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

be true, (as in the Opinion of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

follows, That both <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> and
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> were dead before the year. 72.
when Antichrist (as St. <hi>John</hi> assures us) was
not come. <hi>Caligula</hi> being dead thirty, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>By the Premisses (I believe) it <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that in Scripture, Antichrist</hi> (the <hi>great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ)
is never spoken of, but as future and to come:</hi>
and therefore it is impossible by <hi>Scripture,</hi> (and
there is <hi>no other Medium</hi> can do it) to prove that
Antichrist <hi>was come,</hi> in any part of that time <hi>in
which Scripture was writ.</hi> 2. And as the <hi>Apostles
believed and writ,</hi> that in their times, (even in St.

said for him, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has said for <hi>Caligula</hi>) but
they said, that he was to rise again, and come <hi>Sub
Seculi Finem,</hi> and Act as Antichrist. But I never
yet read or heard of any, besides the Learned
<hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who (in <hi>Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after our blessed Saviour</hi>) ever seriously
<hi>affirm'd,</hi> that <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:</hi>
The two Learned Persons (before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd)
are the first, and they <hi>Contradict each other,
themselves,</hi> the <hi>received Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Christian
World,</hi> and <hi>gratifie Rome;</hi> whilst they indeavour


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53979:112"/>
(which neither they, nor any body else can do)
to free the Pope from being the <hi>great Antichrist.</hi>
For if either <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (who have
been <hi>dead this Sixteen hundred years and more</hi>) be
<hi>that Antichrist,</hi> then (unless you will <hi>have two or
three such Antichrists) The Pope is secure,</hi> and
(wrong'd by those who call him so) miscall'd An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
<hi>Sed salva res est,</hi> there is little danger
from such extravagant Opinions; they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be beneficial to the Pope, nor prejudicial to
his Adversaries, to believe and prove him to be
Antichrist. That <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> was
that great Antichrist, <hi>none,</hi> or (if any) <hi>very few
believe.</hi> The <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> say, that the <hi>Pope
is Antichrist,</hi> and have great reason to say so: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Propheties,</hi> and <hi>Predictions of him</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
being <hi>now actually fulfilled,</hi> and so the truth
of the Prediction made <hi>Evident,</hi> and easie to be
<hi>understood by the Event.</hi> On the other side the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Party say, <hi>that Antichrist is not yet come;</hi> and so
neither Party does believe <hi>Caligula</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
to be Antichrist; because it is a Novel and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
Hypothesis (take which of the two you
will) without truth or probability. Sure I am,
that the Reasons those two Learned Persons bring
for their Opinions, are evidently Illogical and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent.
For, 1. If <hi>Grotius his proofs</hi> for
<hi>Caligula,</hi> be cogent and concluding, then Dr.
<hi>Hammonds</hi> for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> are Inconsequent;
and if Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> be Good, those of <hi>Grotius</hi>
are not. Whence 'tis evident, that all the proofs
of the one Party, (at least) are Impertinent, and


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53979:112"/>
to prove his Position Insufficient. 2. But indeed
all the Reasons they both bring, to prove their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Positions, are (as I said) Illogical and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.
That this may not be <hi>gratis dictum; I</hi>
say,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>both their proofs</hi> are built and rely <hi>upon the
same ground;</hi> they take (not all, but) only some
of the <hi>Characters and Marks of Antichrist</hi> which
the Apostles give him in Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. They indeavor to accommodate and apply
those Marks to <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> and
think they make it appear, that such Marks are
really found in <hi>Caligula</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. And hence they Argue and Conclude thus—
<hi>Such Marks of Antichrist are to be found in</hi> Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,
<hi>or</hi> Simon Magus: Ergo, <hi>They (the one of
them at least) are that Antichrist:</hi> Or (which is
all one) <hi>Magus</hi> and Antichrist agree in some
things; <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are the same.</p>
            <p>4. Now such Arguing is <hi>miserably Illogical and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent;</hi>
and no better then this—<hi>A Duck and
a Goose do agree in many things</hi> (each of them has
one Head, two Legs, two Eyes, a flat Bill or
Beak, and sometimes Feathers of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
&amp;c.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> A Duck is a Goose. Or thus
—<hi>Sempronius and Titius agree in many things (they
have the same Father and Mother, Romans both,
born in the same Hour,</hi> (being Twins) <hi>bread at the
same School, both good Scholars, &amp;c.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Titius</hi> is
<hi>Sempronius.</hi> The Reasons those Learned men
bring to prove their several Antichrists, prove
no more then those I have given; that is, just
nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53979:113"/>

1. That seeing it is their <hi>Received Doctrine,</hi> that an
<hi>Implicite Faith</hi> in their <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>profession
and resolution</hi> to <hi>believe as she believes,</hi> is enough
to <hi>free a Papist from Heresie,</hi> and the <hi>punishment</hi>
of it: though otherwise (through Ignorance)
he <hi>hold some heretical Errors,</hi> contrary to what
his <hi>Church believes:</hi> why may not a Protestants
Implicite Faith in Scripture, with a Profession
and Resolution to believe every thing in it, as
it comes to his knowledge; free him from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
and the punishment of it; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(in the mean time) he may believe some
things contrary to Scripture? Certainly, if an
<hi>Implicite Faith</hi> in the <hi>Doctrines taught by the Pope</hi>
and <hi>his Party,</hi> (for they are the <hi>Roman Church)</hi>
with a <hi>resolution to believe them all,</hi> when they
come to <hi>their knowledge,</hi> be sufficient to free <hi>a
Papist from Heresie</hi> and the <hi>Punishment</hi> of it;
much more, will an <hi>Implicite Faith in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
taught by our blessed Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> with <hi>a Resolution to believe them
all,</hi> when they really come to <hi>their knowledge,</hi>
be sufficient to free a <hi>Protestant from Heresie</hi> and
the <hi>punishment of it.</hi> Because the Doctrines
taught by our blessed Saviour and his <hi>Apostles
are Divine,</hi> and in such a <hi>measure and degree</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
as the Doctrines taught by the Pope,
and his Party, (without great Error and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
cannot pretend to.</p>
            <p>2. Seeing it is their <hi>Received Doctrine</hi> (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the Premisses) that if any Bishop preach
to his People, (the Laity and Unlearned Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks)


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53979:116"/>
some <hi>Heretical Doctrine,</hi> they are bound
to believe it, and may not only <hi>Lawfully,</hi> but
<hi>Meritoriously</hi> do so, till it appear that their
Church is against it. Hence it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
That if the Bishop preach'd this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>That 'tis lawful to kill an Heretical King,
who is actually Anathematiz'd, and Deposed by the
Pope;</hi> they were <hi>bound to believe it,</hi> and might
lawfully and <hi>meritoriously do so;</hi> and then, if it
was <hi>meritorious</hi> to <hi>believe such a Doctrine,</hi> then
to put it in Execution, and actually <hi>kill such a
King,</hi> could <hi>not be unlawful</hi> and vitious. So that
we need not wonder, that those <hi>prodigious Popish
Villains</hi> who were <hi>hired to Assassinate</hi> our <hi>Gracious

(which they were bound to believe) to

brings me to the third Inquiry, What those Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
are? And here, because the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Heresie are very many, and very
great, it is neither my present business nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
particularly to set them all down, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them; Only I shall (in favour to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Reader, for to the Learned they are
better known) name some Authors, where he
may find a Distinct and full Explication of the


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53979:120"/>
Nature of Heresie (according to the Popish
Principles) and the Number of its Punishments.
And here,</p>
            <p>1. The Gloss of their Canon Law reduces the
Punishments of Hereticks to Four Heads, in the
General: <hi>Hereticks</hi> (says the<note n="i" place="margin">

(both Kings and Subjects, Princes and Common
People) It is called <hi>Bulla Coenae Domini,</hi> because it
is published every year on <hi>Maundy Thursday,</hi> the
Day in which our blessed Saviour Instituted (<hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
Domini</hi>) the Sacrament of his last Supper.
And here, (by the way) we may observe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<hi>between Christ,</hi> and (his pretended Vicar)
Antichrist. 1. On that Day our blessed Saviour
Institutes that Sacrament, as a blessing and seal
of the mutual Love between him and his
Church, and of the Communion and Charity
of Christians amongst themselves; but the Pope
(far otherwise and unlike him, whose Vicar he
pretends to be) on the very same Day, (without
and against Christian Charity) Anathematizes
and Curses the greatest part of Christians. 2. Our
blessed Saviour was that Day ready <hi>to Dye</hi> for the
Salvation of <hi>Sinners;</hi> but his pretended Vicar is
ready, (on the same Day) and (so far as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
does <hi>actually Damn</hi> the greatest part of the
Christian World, and has been drunk with the
blood of the Saints. 3. Nor did Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
stand Accursed (before <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
of her) only in that <hi>Bulla Coenae,</hi>

and to our present purpose) give some short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

            <p>By the Premisses, I think it may be, and is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (by most Papal Bulls
and Constitutions) stood Actually Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and Depos'd before this Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth.
Sure I am, the Popish Party never own'd her as
their lawful Sovereign, but call'd her an Usurper
of the Crown, to which (as a Declared and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
Heretick) she had no right at all.
And it seems, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> himself was of the same
Opinion. For in this very Bull, he speaks of her
only as<note n="z" place="margin">Elizabetha Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensa Angliae Regina. <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

her; he does (notwithstanding his Plenitude
of Power and Infallibility) ridiculously undertake
(what he could not do) an Impossibility. For as
it is impossible to turn <hi>Sempronius</hi> out of a House
in which he never was; or deprive him of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
which he never had, (turning out of a
House, necessarily presupposing his being in it,
and deprivation presupposing Right and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
so it is a like Impossibility for the Pope, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Excommunication, to turn the Queen out of
the Communion of the Popish Church, in which
she never was; (being born, baptiz'd and always
bred in the Protestant Church and Religion) or
deprive her of those Dignities and Dominions,

of any such Dominions or Dignities.</p>
            <p>11. It is evident that the Pope in this Impious
Bull,<note place="margin">Observ. II.</note> does (by his usurp'd Antichristian Power)
Depose and Deprive Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of all her
Royal Authority, Dominion and Dignity, and so
puts her into the Condition of a poor private
Person, without any Power or Jurisdiction over
all, or any of her Subjects. Whence these dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrines and Impious Conclusions evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follow,</p>
            <p>1. That if any Jesuit, any Villanous <hi>Raviliac,</hi> or
through pac'd Papist had kill'd, or with Poyson
or Pistol had taken away her Life, (as they often


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53979:124"/>
Indeavor'd) it had been no Treason. For all
know, that Treason is <hi>Crimen</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Justinianum F. ad. Leg. Juliam Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis; &amp; Statut. 25. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vardi. 3. c. 2. in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Purveyors, Anno Domini. 1350.</note> 
               <hi>Majestatis,</hi> or
<hi>Laesa Majestas;</hi> a Crime against Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
either Immediately, against the Person,
or Persons in whom Majesty resides; or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
against those who are his nearer Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,
as the Lord Chancellor, Treasurer
and the Judges, when they are in Execution
of their Office. And though there be an
Inferior Degree of Treason, (as of a Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Lord and Master, a Wife against
her Husband) yet no Treason ever was (either
by the Imperial and Civil, or our National and
Common Laws) but against a Superior. And
therefore the Queen being deposed by the Pope
as an Heretick, and actually deprived, not only
of all her Royal Power and Majesty, but of all
Jurisdiction and Superiority over her Subjects
(and they absolved from their Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Fidelity) and so a private Person on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without any Power to command Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I say, upon these Impious Popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
to kill the Queen could not possibly have
had the Nature or Name of Treason. Had
they by open War, or privately by Poyson or
Pistols, taken away her life (as they Intended,
and often Indeavor'd, as we shall see anon)
they might have been Murderers, but not
Traitors. So that the Pope and his Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the Queen was Actually deposed
and deprived of all her Royal Dignity and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
as a Heretick; they must consequently


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53979:124"/>
believe, that the Murdering of her, by any of
her former Subjects, neither was, nor could be
Treason. But this is not all, For</p>
            <p>2. Admit she had not been deposed, by any Papal
Law, Bull or Decretal Constitution; yet any of
their Popish Clergy might have murder'd her,
and been no way guilty of Treason, though
they were English men, and born her Subjects;
nay, though they had actually taken the Oaths
of Allegiance before they took Popish Orders.
The reason of this is evident, and a necessary
Consequent, from their Impious and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principles. For they say, <hi>That the Clergy</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Clerici Rebellio in Regem non est Crimen Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae Majestatis, quia nen est Subditus Regi. <hi>Eman. Sa Aphoris. Confess. verbo Clericus. p.</hi> 41.</note>
               <hi>Are no Subjects of any Prince; and therefore
they themselves conclude (as well they may) that

(in them) it is no Treason.</hi> This <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi>

it is, (their Inquisitors Commanding it to be

such Passages (out of their School-men,

3. Let it be granted, (which is both Impious and
Evidently untrue) That any Popish Assassin or
Roman <hi>Raviliac,</hi> had not been Guilty of any
Treason, if he had kill'd the Queen, after the
Pope had Deposed her, as a Heretick; yet sure,
they must grant that it was Murder, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Act, to kill a Person overwhom he had no
Jurisdiction. No; this they deny: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and received Principles of the Popish
Church acquit such Prodigious Villains not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Rebellion and Treason, but from <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

Excommunication and Deposition by the Pope,

on their Principles) that they may lawfully be

be lawful. 4. But we have greater Evidence to
prove, that (at <hi>Rome</hi>) the killing of Protestant
Princes, (as Excommunicate Hereticks) is not
Murder. For in the year 1648. when the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
was, (or seemed to be) severe against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
as believing and maintaining Principles In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent

               <hi>Did Institute</hi> Peter <hi>and his Successors his

Kings) it was so necessary to yield Obedience, that
Whosoever would not (as no true Protestant ever would

was not pleased to tell us, <hi>what Book of Kings</hi> (for
in their Vulgar Latin Version, there are four
Books of that name) nor what Chapter or Verse
he meant: and he did wisely to conceal what Place

It is indeed ridiculous, for any man to
think, that any thing said in those Books of <hi>Kings,</hi>
can prove, that our blessed Saviour Constituted a

refer the Reader. By the Premisses, I think it may
appear, that, if (after the Popes Damnation and
Deposition of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) any of her Popish
Subjects, (Laity or Clergy, Regular or Secular)
had by taking Arms publickly, or by Poyson or
Pistol, Privately taken away her life, (according
to their approved Principles) it had been no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
Treason or Murder, but (in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
an Action Just and Innocent. But this
(though too much) is not all; their Error and
Impiety rises higher. For,</p>
            <p>4. Had any of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Subjects (after
the Popes Excommunication) kill'd her, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
Fact had been so far from being Murder,
that (in their opinion) it had been an Action not
only <hi>Indifferent, or Morally good, but Meritorious.</hi>
In the year 1586. (which was the Nine and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth

Giffard,</hi> Dr. of Divinity, <hi>Gilbert Giffard</hi> and <hi>Hodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>

him, and promises him Eternal Salvation, and so (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<hi>where (notwithstanding all the Jesuits blessings) he
was taken, confess'd all this, and was Executed in the

               <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. p. 499.</note> there tells us,
<hi>That a Pestilent Opinion</hi> (as he truly calls it) <hi>was
got amongst the Popish Party (even amongst their
Priests) That to take away Kings Excommunicate,
was Nothing Else, but to Weed the Cockle out of the
Lords Field.</hi> It is true, none of those impious
and damnable Designs, had their desir'd Effect;
God Almighty protecting that good Queen, (it
being impossible that any Power or Policy should
prevail against his Providence) yet the Matter of
Fact (confessed by themselves, or evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Legal Witnesses) manifestly shews, <hi>that they
thought killing the Queen,</hi> (for the benefit of their
Catholick Cause) <hi>was a Meritorious Work,</hi> which
they designed to do, and (had their Ability been
Equal to their Impiety) would have done. 2. Nor
was this the <hi>private opinion</hi> of some <hi>Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
only; but the <hi>definitive Sentence</hi> of several
Popes, (their<note n="k" place="margin">All the Popes <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> (they say) are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine (Can. sic Omnes. 2. dist. 19.) <hi>as if</hi> Peter <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had made them.</hi> And no wonder, seeing they tell us, That God by his Holy Spirit, speaks in the mouth of the Pope, <hi>Deus ipse, Spiritu suo, per Ora Pontificum loquitur.</hi> Pet.

died in that Service, it was for the true Faith, for which
Heaven should be their Reward.</hi> So the Pope in
that Canon. And because some of those Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
might fear (as there was great reason they


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53979:131"/>
should) that the Persecuting those poor Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whom the Pope call'd Hereticks, with Fire
and Sword, might rather deserve punishment then
a Heavenly Reward; <hi>John Semeca</hi> (the Glossator)
tells us, <hi>That the Popes meaning was,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Hortatur Papa, ut virilitèr pugnet contra Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos Ecclesiae; &amp; si qui pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter hoc moriatur, Non Poenam, sed Coeleste Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium Consequetur. <hi>Glossa Ibidem.</hi>

               <hi>that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>These, and such other Principles, must (of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity)
be a great Incouragement to the Popish
Party, who believe (though without, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to Truth and Reason) the vast usurped
Papal Power and Infallibility, to Execute the Popes
Damnatory Bulls and Excommunications, and
kill all Hereticks (even Kings and Emperors) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Heaven promised for doing it. This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much, but there are more and greater Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made by the Pope, for <hi>killing Hereticks.</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>5. The Pope (out of his great Ability and
Bounty) promises such Impious and Bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
of Hereticks, not <hi>Heaven only, but a higher
Degree of Glory in it,</hi> and many other great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
to be injoy'd here, before they came to
Heaven; and this Promise the <hi>Pope</hi> makes, not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
by himself, but in, and with the consent of the
<hi>greatest General Council Rome</hi> ever had. <hi>Innocent</hi>
the Third is the Pope, and the<note n="t" place="margin">Conc. Later. mag. num sub Innocentio. 3. Ann. 1215.</note> fourth <hi>Lateran</hi>
is the Council I mean; in which<note n="u" place="margin">Ita Abbas Ursperg. in Chronico ad dictum Ann. 1215. Binius in Hist. Conc. Later. 4. praesixa.</note> there were,

               <hi>Destruction of Hereticks</hi> (the poor <hi>Wab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses)</hi>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53979:132"/>
which were granted to those who fought

those Priviledges were Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> (in his<note n="a" place="margin">Const. Innocent. 3. 12. data Lateran. 19. Cal. Jan. 1215.</note> Bull)
tells us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By the Premisses I think it evident, that if any
of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Subjects (after her Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Excommunication by the Pope) had by
raising Arms against her publickly, or by Poyson
or Pistol privately taken away her Life, it had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
been <hi>Rebellion, Treason,</hi> nor <hi>Murder,</hi> but an
innocent Action; And that not one of those
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Naturae Mediae,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
which are morally neither good nor
bad; but (in the Judgment of the Church of


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53979:132"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon those her approved Principles) it
had been an Action <hi>Morally Good,</hi> nay, (which is
far more) <hi>Meritorious:</hi> For which they <hi>should have
Remission of All their Sins here,</hi> and not <hi>only Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
but (in it) <hi>A higher Degree of Glory</hi> hereafter:
And if it happened, that any of them miscarried
in this their <hi>meritorious</hi> Act of killing Heretical
Kings, and were (according to their desert) hang'd
for Treason, then (with the Pope and his Party)
they pass for <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and as such, shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd,

            <p>The Premisses consider'd, there can be little
reason to doubt, but the Popish Party (as ever
since the Reformation they constantly have, so
they) always will indeavour by secret Plots and
Conspiracies, by Poyson, Pistols, or (when they
have Ability) by open War, to ruin and utterly


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53979:133"/>
extirpate and destroy all the Protestants of this
Nation (King and Subjects) who are by the Pope
Declared and Excommunicated Hereticks, seeing
there are such exceeding great Rewards (afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd)
assured to them, for doing it; not
only by private and fallible persons, but by the
Constitutions of their Popes, and the Canons of
their greatest and approved General Councils;

all Papists (by the Principles of their Religion)

Profess all Things deliver'd, defin'd, and declared in
the Sacred Canons, and General Councils, Especially
in the Council of</hi> Trent; <hi>and all this they swear to do
most constantly so long as they live, and to take care (to
the utmost of their Ability) that all under them, or
committed to their Charge, shall do so too.</hi> And the
Pope there further tells us,<note n="y" place="margin">Deus Omnipotens Patribus (Tridentinis) Divinitus Inspirare Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus est. <hi>Ibidem, in dictae Bullae Initio.</hi>

               <hi>That God Almighty
did by the Holy Ghost Inspire the</hi> Trent <hi>Fathers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
That this Oath should be taken.</hi> Seeing then
there are so many thousands in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who do and must take this cursed Oath, to
Obey the Pope, and <hi>receive,</hi> and without doubting
believe all their Rebellious Canons before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
and (to the utmost of their Power) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
and induce all who are under their Cure
and Charge (that is, all the Laity in the whole
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> for all of them are under the Charge
and Cure of some of those who take that Oath)
to <hi>receive</hi> and believe them too. Hence it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
follows, 1. <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>approves
those impicus and rebellious Doctrines to which so many


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53979:134"/>
thousands swear, by the Command of the Pope and</hi>
Trent <hi>Council. 2. That all their Ecclesiasticks (Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

Charge over others, are bound, not only by their Papal
Constitutions and Decrees of their General Councils; but
by a Personal Promise, Vow, and Oath,</hi> (in facinus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasse
putes) <hi>to believe and profess, and (as there is
opportunity) to practise according to these Principles.</hi>
3. And hence it appears, <hi>That Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was</hi>
(and all Protestant Kings and Princes are, and in
the like case, will be) <hi>in most eminent Danger of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination
by her Popish Subjects, especially after Pope</hi>
Pius <hi>the fifth had damn'd, and deposed her, absolved
all her Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, and
Commanded them (on pain of Excommunication) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to obey her, or any of her Laws or Commands;</hi> it
being also declared, by their Supream Infallible
Power, <hi>That the killing the Queen, by open War pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
or privately by Poyson or Pistol, had neither been
Rebellion, Treason, nor Murder, but an Act morally
good and meritorious; by which they should merit, not
only Heaven, but a higher Degree of Glory in it, and
be, as Glorious Martyrs (if they died in that Cause)
commended to Posterity;</hi> Nay, when their Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks
(both Secular and Regular) who had any
Cure of Souls, or Authority and Charge over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
had promised, vow'd, and solemnly sworn,
<hi>That they would obey the Pope as Christs Vicar, &amp;c.</hi>
I say, those who had such great Promises to allure
them, and their Promise, Oath and vow to oblige
them to it, would certainly indeavour (as indeed
they did, as will appear anon) the ruin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53979:134"/>
of that good Queen. Neither is this all. For</p>
            <p>6. Lastly; the Pope and his Party have further
Inducements, more efficacious and powerful to
perswade their Instruments to Assassinate Princes
and Extirpate Hereticks, <hi>especially</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">They are more affraid of Protestants, then of all others they call Hereticks, and there is good reason for it.

carried on, principally by the Jesuits) to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Life of our Gracious King (whom God
preserve) one of the Assassins had Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds pay'd or promised, and another,
Thirty thousand Masses to be said for him, if he
miscarried, to Incourage them to that Monstrous
Popish Villany. Now their Impiety in this their
Ingagement, was equal; both undertaking the
Commission of the same Sin, the Murder of their
King: But their folly seem'd unequal. For Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand pounds might possibly (in this
World) have been some benefit to him who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
for it: But the 30000. Masses, were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

Insignificant, and could be no way benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
or profitable to him to whom they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
either in this, or the World to come. The
poor Miscreant was cozen'd by his Party, with
the noise and number of their Masses. For they
knew, and (had he not been a Fool as well as
Knave and Villain) so might he too; that those
Masses could never do him any good. For even
by their own approved and received Principles,
killing of Hereticks (especially an Excommnica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Prince) was such a meritorious Work, as (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Masses) deserved a Plenary Indulgence and
pardon of all his Sins, and an higher place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

(had there been any such Place) nor could the

due to them remitted; I say, they could not
justly do it: or admit the Devil (had he power and
permission) might be willing to punish an innocent
Soul, which had no Sin to punish; yet sure his
Holiness (who as Christs Vicar has the Keys of
Purgatory as well as Heaven) would not do, or
at least not own (for otherwise he does, and has
done as Impious things) the doing of that, which
is so evidently injust. So that (if their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
be true) those Thirty thousand Masses could
no way be profitable to that miserable deluded
Person, in Purgatory, whither he was never to

unless he can turn those out of the Christian

speaks only of the Infidel and Mahometan

            <p>4. But all this notwithstanding, the Jesuites (and
others of their Party and Principles) did, and do
approve and practise that Diabolical Doctrine;
and when they conceive Princes to be Enemies
to their Interest, or the Catholick Cause, (as
they call it) indeavour (by Lying Calumnies)
to disaffect the People, and to raise Rebellions
against those Princes; that so they may cut
them off, by Publick War and Seditions; and
when this succeeds not, by private Assassinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This is (by sad Experience) notoriously
known to our Western World; as may appear
by the Premisses, and further Testimonies of
their own <hi>Roman Catholick Historians</hi> (in this
Case) of Indubitable Truth and Veracity.

               <hi>Davila</hi> will tell you,
<hi>That he was a Disciple of the Jesuites; That he
himself freely confessed, that he was bred up in the
Schools of the Jesuites, and had often heard it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd,
and disputed, That it was not Only Lawful,
but Meritorious to Kill</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Bourbon, <hi>a
Relapsed Heretick, and Persecutor of the Holy
Church; That Father</hi> Gueret <hi>a Jesuite, was his
Confessor, &amp;c. so that being possess'd with their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Principles and Perswasions, he undertook
that prodigious and damnable Parricide.</hi> In
short, it was notoriously known to all <hi>France,</hi>
that the Jesuites both approved and designed
the Execrable Assassination of their King.
Whence it was, (as <hi>Davila</hi> goes on) <hi>that the
Parliament of</hi> Paris <hi>pass'd this Sentence—That
Father</hi> Guignard <hi>and</hi> Gueret <hi>(Jesuites) should
be Condemned to the Gallows; that the rest of the
Jesuites (profess'd or not profess'd) should be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out of</hi> France, <hi>as Enemies to the Crown and
publick Tranquility, their Goods and Revenues
Jeiz'd and distributed to pious Vses, &amp;c.</hi> And it
had been well for <hi>France</hi> had they stood bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

Impiety, and a Cursed hand Murder'd
his King, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; And it was the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
and their Traiterous Principles, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and incouraged him to Commit that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Unchristian and Antichristian Parricide.
For (after the Fact was done) <hi>Raviliac</hi> freely
and publickly confessed, <hi>That it was the Jesuite</hi>
Mariana's <hi>Book which moved and incouraged him
to that Impious Design.</hi> I know that the Jesuites
did then indeavour to<note n="b" place="margin">See Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> the Jesuites Declaration, with the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> his Preface prefixed to it, to this purpose.</note> 
               <hi>free themselves</hi> from

was the Motive which induced</hi> Raviliac <hi>to
Murder his Prince.</hi> Which Doctrine has never

            <p>6. Nor is this all; For although, only privately
to approve and incourage Rebellion and Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination
of Kings and Princes, be an Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Villany, to be abhorr'd by all men (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Christians) as being repugnant to that

Reason and Religion; yet in Publick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to vindicate and justifie such Actions, to
perswade the World, <hi>that they are not only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good, but meritorious:</hi> This argues a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degree of Impiety and Impudence. We
know (by sad Experience) that many Pagans
and Christians have blasphem'd their Gods,
committed Adulteries, Murders, Perjuries, &amp;c.
yet we do not find, that any Christians, (the
Jesuites and their Accomplices excepted) or any
sober Pagan (who acknowledg'd a God) did
ever justifie Blasphemy, Adultery, Murder, or
Perjury; but when they were Apprehended,
Convict and brought to Execution, they
would confess the Crime, pray for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and desire others to pray for them. But
the Jesuites (and those possess'd with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
though they be Convict, and Legally
Condemn'd for Rebellion and Assassination of


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53979:144"/>
Princes, yet they neither do, nor can repent;
believing such Actions not to be any Vices, but
Vertues; and themselves (if they suffer for
them) not Traytors or Murderers, but Holy
Martyrs. That this is their approved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Doctrine, which they publickly defend,
and industriously (in their Publick Writings)
indeavour to justifie, is evident to the Western
World, and may appear by the Premisses. Yet

this Doctrine was approved at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by

the Fifth) by Rebellions at home, and Invasions
from abroad, to rob Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her
Crown and Kingdoms, and of her Life too, by
Roman and Mahometan Assassinations. I say, we
need not wonder at this. For let the aforesaid
Doctrines (which they approve and constantly
contend for) be granted, (<hi>That the Pope is Supream
Judge and Monarch of the World (directè or indirecte)
that all Kings and Emperors are His Subjects, that he
has Power to Depose and Deprive them of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
that when he has Judicially deprived them, any
Private Person may Murder them; that he has Power
to Absolve their Subjects from all Obligations and Oaths
of Allegiance, and to Command them, upon pain of an
Anathema never to obey any of their Princes Laws or
Commands; that the People may depose their King,
with His Consent and Counsel; and that he may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Compel them to do it; and this so</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53979:149"/>
Kingdom.</hi> (Prodigious Error and Impiety! as if
Rebellion, Assassinations and Murdering their
Kings, conduc'd to the Salvation of the Subjects.)
I say, these Erroneous and Impious Doctrines
granted, and (as they are at <hi>Rome</hi>) believ'd, it
is certain, that (so far as they have opportunity
and ability) they will (as they ever have done)
prosecute their Interest, and practise according
to those Principles; and all Christian Kings
will be in perpetual danger to loose their
Crowns, their Kingdoms, and their Lives too;
unless they can please the Pope, and become
his dutiful Servants, and indeed Slaves to his
Anti-Christian Tyranny. I say no Christian
King, <hi>Tros Tyriusve,</hi> Papist or Protestant can be
out of eminent Danger, where such Doctrine
is, by such Doctors maintain'd. We have sad
and certain Instances of this Truth: For, 1. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Third and Fourth of <hi>France</hi> were neither
<hi>Calvinists</hi> nor <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but declared Sons of
the <hi>Roman Synagogue;</hi> yet because they did not
Comply with the Popish Interest, in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and measure, the Pope and his Party ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
they fatally fell by the Traiterous and
Prodigious Villany of bloody Assassins, <hi>Ridente
&amp; gaudente Roma;</hi> The Pope and his Jesuitical
Party, (with an Extasie of Joy) Approving and
Commending the Treason, and (in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Pictures) Canonizing the Traitors.
2. For Protestants, and (as they call them) He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Princes, their danger (proportionable to
<hi>Romes</hi> hatred of them) is greater. They may


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53979:149"/>
(by the Power and Gracious Providence of God)
want ability, but they neither do, nor (unless
they renounce their Erroneous and Impious
Principles) ever will want a desire and indeavour
to ruine those they call Hereticks, either by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Hostility and Rebellions, or by Poyson, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols,
and private Assassinations. Their many
known Plots and Conspiracies against Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi>
King <hi>James, Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and
his Gracious Majesty now Reigning, (whom
God preserve) are undeniable Demonstrations of
this Truth. The Ark of God and Dagon, Light
and Darkness, Truth and Error, the Bible and
Popish Bullary, Protestancy and Popery cannot
possibly Consist, and be in Peace. Nothing is
(or can be) so destructive of Darkness and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
as Truth and Light; And 'tis evidently known
to this Western World, That the Evangelical
Light and Truth, which the Protestants have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hily
and clearly discovered, to the long deluded
Church of God, have awakened thousands, to a
detestation of that Superstition and Idolatry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they formerly lay, to the dishonour of
God, and ruine of their Souls, and to a shaking
and great diminution of the Papal Monarchy and
Tyranny; so many Kingdoms forsaking <hi>Rome,</hi>
and shaking off the Heavy and Intollerable Yoke
of Sin and Popish Servitude. <hi>Et hinc illae Lacrymae;</hi>
Hence it is, that the Pope, and his inraged Party,
when they cannot, by any probable pretence of
Reason confute, what they call Heresie, (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion) they indeavour to Confound and


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53979:150"/>
(by Fire and Sword) Consume the Hereticks—
<hi>Aeterna bella, pace sublatâ, gerunt, Jurant odium, nec
prius hostes esse desinunt, quam esse desinunt.</hi> They
excite and incourage<note n="e" place="margin">This is evident (to omit others) by the Bull of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, wherein King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. is Excommunicated and Deposed. For in that Bull having declared that King an Heretick and deposed him; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (Kings or Emperor) to take Arms against K. <hi>Henry</hi> and his Adherents—<hi>Insuper, tam Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes, praedictos (quacunque etiam Imperiali aut Regali dignitate fulgentes.</hi> §. 15.) <hi>quam quoscunque alios, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ad stipendia quorum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque Christi fidelium mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litantes &amp; alias quascunque personas, tam Per Mare quam Per Terras, Armigeros habentes, eis Mandan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ut contra Henricum Regem, eique adhaerentes, dum in erroribus adversus Sedem praedictum permanserint, Armis Insurgant, eosque &amp; eorum singulos Persequantur, &amp;c.</hi> And then (such is his liberality) he gives those Souldiers all the Goods of those Anathematiz'd Hereticks, wherever they can find them—<hi>Eorumque Bona, Mobilia, &amp; Immobilia, Mercantias, Navigia, Credita, Res, &amp; Animalia, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am extra territorium Henrici Regis, Vbi Libet Consistentia, Capiant, &amp;c.</hi> Vide Pauli Papae. 3.

               <label>I.</label>
               <item>THE Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth (containing
the Damnation and Excommunication of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>) in Latin and English. <hi>P.</hi> 1.</item>
               <label>II.</label>
               <item>The first Observation, that <hi>Pius V.</hi> was neither the first
nor last Pope, who Excommunicated and damn'd Kings
and Emperors. For, 1. before him Pope <hi>Constantine, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the Second, <hi>Greg.</hi> the Third, <hi>Greg.</hi> the Seventh,


<pb facs="tcp:53979:162"/>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Paul</hi> the
Third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did the same thing: And, 2. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Thirteenth, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, after him. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</item>
               <label>III.</label>
               <item>The second Observation, concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or
Title prefix'd to <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth his Bull; that it is <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio
&amp; Excommunicatio Elizabethae.</hi> Where it is
proved, 1. That not only <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, but other Popes
(not short of him in time or impiety) use the same hard
word (<hi>Damnation</hi>) in the Titles prefix'd to their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory
Bulls, wherein they Excommunicate Kings and
Emperors. 2. The uncharitable Error, and Invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their reasons they do, or can pretend for doing so. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</item>
               <label>IV.</label>
               <item>The third Observation, wherein, 1. The notion and
significations of the word Damnation are explain'd.
2. That by the word Damnation in their Anathema's
and Damnatory Bulls, not only some temporal loss or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
(as to their Bodies or Estates) but eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Body and Soul, is meant, by the Pope and his
Party; together with the invalidity of their reasons and
pretences to justifie them in this particular. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</item>
               <label>V.</label>
               <item>The fourth Observation, wherein we have, 1. The
grounds on which <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, and other Popes, build
their Power to Excommunicate and Depose Kings; and


<pb facs="tcp:53979:162"/>
that in the Supremacy and Plenitude of Power, which
(they pretend) our blessed Saviour gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> and in
him to all his Successors. So that <hi>Peter</hi> (and so every
Successor of his) was <hi>constituted a Prince over all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Kingdoms, to pull up, and throw down,
to dissipate and destroy, to plant and build, &amp;c.</hi>
2. That such Power was (by our blessed Saviour) given
to <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors, they indeavour to prove out
of Scripture, (and in their Bulls, cite the places) <hi>Gen.</hi>
1. 16. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 10. 3. The ridiculous inconsequence
and impertinence of such Papal reasoning, which shews
them rather to be Fools, then Infallible. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</item>
               <label>VI.</label>
               <item>The fifth Observation, against the Pope's pretended
Supremacy. 1. That <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy (much less the
Popes) cannot be proved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 2. where he is
called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>primus</hi> (or as in the Latin Fathers) <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps
Apostolorum.</hi> 2. Nor from that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
18. 19. 3. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> in Scripture, hath a far better
pretence to the Supremacy and the Bishoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi>
then St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and yet neither he, nor any for him, ever
pretended to any Papal Supremacy. 4. How our blessed
Saviour and the Apostles (yet <hi>Peter</hi> no more then the
rest) are in Scripture, said to be Foundations of the
Church. 5. That the Power of the Keys was given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Apostle, as well and as much as to <hi>Peter.</hi> Nay, 6. To
every Bishop and Priest, as is expresly affirm'd in the
Authentick Offices of the Roman Church, and in their
<hi>Trent</hi> Council and Catechism. 7. That every Apostle
was Christ's Vicar as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> that the Jesuites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,


<pb facs="tcp:53979:163"/>
(and in their Institutions do publish it) that their
Superiors are Christ's Vicars. 8. That <hi>Pasce Oves, Joh.</hi>
21. 15. 16. 17. (though usually) is most impertinently
urged to prove <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy. 9. That the 28. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (which utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the Popes Supremacy) is basely corrupted by <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
and the Canonists, and (that it might not appear)
left out of their old Editions of the Councils. <hi>p.</hi> 36. 37.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>VII.</label>
               <item>The sixth Observation, In which a further examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and confutation of the Popish pretended grounds for
the Popes Supremacy. That they neither do, nor can prove
that <hi>Peter</hi> ever had any such Monarchical Supremacy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Apostles and all Christians, with the reasons why
they cannot. 2. If it were granted (which is evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true)
that he had such a Power, yet it neither does, nor
can appear (by Scripture, or any just Medium) that it was
hereditary, and to pass to his Successor, but might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
and (as his Apostleship did) dye with him. 3. And
if it were granted (which neither is, nor ever can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
that that Power was hereditary, and to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to his Successor, yet they neither have, nor can have
any just grounds to prove, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is
that Successor, and not the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where
(they say) <hi>St. Peter</hi> first sate. 4. That 'tis certain from
Scripture, that <hi>Peter</hi> neither was nor could be (as they
pretend) 25. years Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 5. Nor can it (by
Scripture) appear that ever he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor can
<hi>Rome</hi> be meant by <hi>Babylon, 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 13. 6. Nor can
it appear by any just Testimonies of Antiquity, that ever


<pb facs="tcp:53979:163"/>
he was at <hi>Rome. Papias</hi> is the ground and Author on
whom they rely for that Fable; and he an ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Arch-Heretick. 7. That to get credit to <hi>Papias,</hi>
they have impiously corrupted <hi>Eusebius.</hi> 8. If it were
granted, that he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they have no ground
or probability for it, that he was Bishop there; seeing
there are far greater probabilities grounded on Scripture,
that <hi>Paul</hi> was Bishop there, than <hi>Peter</hi> (or any for him)
can pretend to; and yet they do not say, nor (without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to their own Principles) can say, that he was
Bishop there. 9. That those other honorary Titles or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,
which their Authors every where use as proper to
the Pope, and marks of his Supremacy, or (at least) supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
over all Bishops (such as <hi>Apostolicus Pontifex
Summus, Papa, Sedes Apostolica, Vicarius Christi,
Cathedra Apostolica, Successor Petri, &amp;c.)</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
made use of, without any proof or probability.
<hi>p. 91. 92. &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <label>VIII.</label>
               <item>
                  <hi>The seventh Observation, concerning the Censures,
Punishments and Curses contain'd in this Bull; and the
Antichristian impiety of them. 1. He miscalls the Queen,</hi>
an Heretick, a favourer of Hereticks, a Slave of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and then Anathematizes her, and cuts her off
from the Unity of Christ's Body. 2. He deposes
and deprives her of her pretended Right to the
Crown, and of all manner of Dignity, Dominion
and Priviledge. 3. He absolves her Subjects, and all
others, who are bound to her by any Oath, from
all their Oaths, and all debt of Fidelity and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and that for ever. 4. <hi>He severely prohibits them


<pb facs="tcp:53979:164"/>
all, to obey any of her Laws or Commands. 5. If any of
them do otherwise, he Excommunicates and Curses them,
whether they be Papists or Protestants.</hi> p. 145. 146. &amp;c.</item>
               <label>IX.</label>
               <item>The eighth Observation, That the <hi>Pope is the great
Antichrist, the Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition,
spoken of 2. Thess.</hi> 3. 4. That the Opinions of <hi>H. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
(that <hi>Caius Caligula</hi>) and of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
(that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was Antichrist) are inconsistent
and contradictory to each other, and to themselves. That
they are (both of them) repugnant to Scripture, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the primitive Fathers, of Protestants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and the sense of Christendom for about 1600. years
after our blessed Saviour, &amp;c. <hi>p. 151. 152. &amp;c. ad p.</hi> 199.</item>
               <label>X.</label>
               <item>The ninth Observation, What the Popes Power is, (and
whence they pretend to have it) which inables them with
Authority to sit Judges, and pass damnatory Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against Supream Princes, for Heresie. 2. What that
Heresie is, and who the Hereticks, who by the Pope are
so severely damn'd. 3. What those punishments are, which
they pretend they may, and (when and where they can)
actually do inflict on such Hereticks. 4. Of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,</hi>
that (by the testimony of their Enemies) 1. They
had continued ever since the Apostles times. 2. That there
was scarce any Christian Country in which they were not.
3. That they lived justly before men, and believ'd all
things well of God, and all the Articles of the Creed:


<pb facs="tcp:53979:164"/>
but their fault was, They said <hi>Rome was Babylon, and
the Pope Antichrist, &amp;c. p. 199. 200. &amp;c.</hi>
