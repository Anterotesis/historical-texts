            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>Verſe 1. The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book of holy Scripture has for the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thereof, (we ſee) <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings; for the matter, the worthieſt ſubject, the mutuall love between Chriſt and his Church; for the ſtyle, the moſt ſublime and pleaſant, being amorous and a ſong; and for the ſpeakers therein, the moſt heavenly and excellent, Chriſt Jeſus and his Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe wherefore the holy Ghoſt repreſents this love and union between theſe two, in all this Song, by the ſimilitude of matrimoniall conjunction, is, becauſe in all other Londs of love or friendſhip, there is not either ſo ſacred a ground of ſo holy and particular intire affection, nor ſuch a communion of ſo deere things, as hearts, bodies, and goods, nor ſo ſtrait a conjunction of parties, becomming thereby one fleſh, not ſo durable for time, being diſſolvable only by death, and the effect rather divine then humane, God uſing men thereby but as inſtruments to propagate his Church. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt being to repreſent unto us that which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in it ſelfe unconceiveable, could chuſe no fitter ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude then this affection and union matrimoniall: Therefore alſo it is, that in other places of Scripture the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bride and the Lamb's wife. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 9. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 29. our Saviour is called the bridegroom, &amp; the Church his bride; whereby is evident, though this Bride and bridegroome bee not named by any proper names in all this Song, yet that it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114769:5"/>
is without all controverſie, that Chriſt and his Church are meant; theſe things being attributed in this ſong to both, to wit ſuch beauty, glory, and excellency, as far ſurmounts all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beautie, glory and excellency in the world, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in like manner, the ſpirituall and heavenly ornaments &amp; gifts which he beſtoweth on her, and the fruits of her love againe which ſhe rendereth to him for the ſame, here are reckoned up all the ſweeteſt, richeſt, and moſt precious things that are in the world.</p>
                  <p>This book then in generall is a continued amorous confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Chriſt and his Church for the moſt part, wherein either they ſpeake by way of a love-dialogue each to other, or elſe encomiaſtickly and by way of commendation one of another.</p>
                  <p>And in particular to come to this Chapter. 1 Wee have therein the generall title or inſcription of the whole book contained in the firſt verſe. 2. We have the three ſeverall parts of the chapter; the firſt, wherein the church ſpeakes, and which is ſupplicatory, the firſt ſix verſes after the ſecond, wherein Chriſt ſpeakes, and which is directorie. ver. 8. and the laſt, where both ſpeake, which is mutually laudatorie, in the laſt verſes of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the generall title then, and inſcription of the whole book, we have firſt the Title it ſelfe, or ſort of writing, to wit, <hi>a Song.</hi> 2 The excellency thereof, <hi>a Song of Songs,</hi> ſo called after the Hebrew phrayſe, as one would ſay, A ſong that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all other ſongs, as our Saviour is called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. the King of kings and Lord of lords. 3. The Author, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther penman thereof, which is <hi>Solomons</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then it is called <hi>A ſong</hi> and men uſe to ſing for joy, as we ſee <hi>Jam</hi> 5. 13. and <hi>Epheſ. 5. 18. Exod. 15. 1. Judg.</hi> 5. 1. &amp;c. And indeed the ground of the greateſt joy that a chriſtian ſoule can have, is this, that Chriſt Jeſus hath vouchſafed to be joyned in ſuch a ſtraight and ſpirituall Union with man, that he hath maried himſelfe to his Church, ſhe to be his Bride, and he her Bridegroome; and wherefrom flowes ſuch a communion of good things to her, which the heart cannot conceive enough, nor the tongue expreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is called for excellency, a <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all others, ſo that it may be ſaid of it, as is ſaid of the vertuous woman, Many daughters have done worthily, but thou exceeds them all: the ſame being of the moſt excellent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114769:5"/>
ſubject, the moſt excellent perſons, and the moſt excellent and pleaſant manner of Setting downe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the author or rather penman, is <hi>Solomon</hi> who was a type of Chriſt and whoſe marriage with his Queen, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Pſal</hi> 45. was a type of this ſpoken of here between Chriſt and his Church, and who wrote this ſong as he was a Prophet, and as <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews us, not of the will of man, but as he was moved by the holy Ghoſt 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not carnally to be underſtood, but in a ſpirituall and a holy manner.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Out of this holy and Heavenly deſire of her's, while ſhe is on earth, yet having her heart on him and the deſire of his love, and Love-tokens who is in Heaven, we ſee what is the diſpoſition of the godly, like <hi>Jacobs, Gen. 32. Moſes, Heb. 11. Davids, Pſalm.</hi> 4. or others. And how contrary the ſame is to worldlings who have their portion in this life, which is their <hi>Non ultra,</hi> and ſing a <hi>requirem</hi> to their ſouls, when their barns are full, which they think to enjoy many yeares when they have not perhaps many hours to remaine therewith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing more particularlie, the gift of reconciliation, and ſenſe of Gods love to her thereby, and with a neerer union, is her deſire above all things; Let us try, if we be true members of Chriſts Church, if this be our's in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

                     <p n="3">3. Seeing the ſpirituall benefits which we receive do come to us by his Word and miniſtrie thereof, as the kiſſes of his mouth; Let us highly eſteem of the ſame, as that man did, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 13. 44.) of the Field wherein the rich treaſure was: and as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19 and 119. which if we do not, but vilifie his mouth, we will alſo vilifie the kiſſes of his mouth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p>
                        <hi>For thy loves</hi> &amp;c. This is the reaſon of her ſo great deſire of the kiſſes of his mouth as the evidence of his love towards her, becauſe his love is ſo ſweet and comfortable, that it is beyond all compariſon; and therefore is not onely like, but better nor wine. Which being the principall thing that is uſed in banquets to make the heart cheerfull, is therefore put here for all the moſt comfortable, delicate and delightfull dainties which are uſed at moſt royall banquets, as we ſee <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. the ſweetneſs of whoſe love (which ſhe ſo commends) ſweetens the moſt bitter things that the godly can ſuffer for him even death it ſelf, and makes all other things which were ſweet to fleſh and blood before and offenſive to him, to be moſt bitter and diſguſtfull, as we ſee in all true converts.</p>
                     <p>This love of Chriſt, is twofold towards his Church; or there are two ſorts thereof: the firſt is called <hi>amor bene placiti ſeu benevolentiae,</hi> or the love of his good pleaſure the other is called <hi>amor complacentiae,</hi> or the love of his good liking: the love of good pleaſure is before man was and eternall, and is that whereby from before all beginning in that decree of his election he choſe ſo many as the freely loved unto eternall ſalvation the love of his good likeing is in time, when man is, and walking in the wayes of the Lord's obedience, the Lord is well pleaſed with him.</p>
                     <p>This love of Chriſt towards his Church has theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties enſuing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a love whereby he loves us firſt, as we have it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a free love, without either foreſeene merit againſt the <hi>Papist</hi> or for foreſeene faith, againſt the Arminian, and as we have it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a ſervent and great love, as is ſhowne us <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 15. that he gave his life for us, eſpecially being his enemies: and which is ſo great that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, it paſſes all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. as <hi>Augustin</hi> ſayes, <hi>quod tantus, tantillos, et tales, tantum dilexerit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is an eternall love, as we ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9. both <hi>à priori</hi> in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neplacito,</hi> &amp; therefore our ſalvation being grounded thereon is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114769:7"/>
ſure, &amp; <hi>à poſteriori</hi> becauſe it ſhal continue towards us for ever.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is a matchles and incomparable love, ſo that the love of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Rachel,</hi> or <hi>Jonathan's</hi> to <hi>David</hi> or a mother's to a child cannot be compared thereto. And therefore, as is ſaid of Chriſts ſorrow <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 12. ſo may it be ſaid of his love, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſee, if ever the like love was, as is my love, or as the Jewes ſaid of his love to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſo may we with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration ſay, <hi>Ecce quam amavit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Laſtly, it is an Immutable love, <hi>Joh. 13. 1. Ro.</hi> 8. 35. ſo that though we ſin, by <note n="*" place="margin">Note, a difference between the godly and wicked. Rom. 8. 1.</note> fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (but not walking therein) he may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectus with the rods of men, but his loving kindneſs he will never take from us.</p>
                     <p>But why ſpeakes he of <hi>loves</hi> in the plurall number? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 1. this is to ſhew, not onely the plentifull and ſuper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant meaſure of this love, which I may rather call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſureable, and, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes, paſſing all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but likewiſe, 2. to ſhew the diverſity of the manner of manifeſtation of the ſame, and how from this inexhauſtible and large Ocean ſo many lovely ſtreames do flow, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vocation juſtification, Sanctification, and, in end, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; all which proceed from Chriſts free love to us, and are as ſo many loves, or love tokens of his.</p>
                     <p>Now this love is compared and preferred to wine, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as wine is pleaſant and delectable as we ſee <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 31. ſo there is nothing ſo pleaſant and delectable to the chriſtian ſoule at all times and in all eſtates, as Chriſts love and the meditation and perſwaſion thereof. 2. As wine rejoyces the heart, &amp; therefore is called a cheering liquor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15. See <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 6. ſo nothing rejoyces the heart of a true Chriſtian ſo much as Chriſts love, though one injoyed all the honours &amp; pleaſures of the whole world, &amp; although the whole world ſhould hate him, yet he cares not, if he have the love of God and of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, 3. Wine is medicinall, as we ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 34. And ſo is the love of God both in the effects, and aſſurance thereof to a wounded ſpirit, or ſick ſoule longing for cure and comfort as the ſpouſe does, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5. 4 It ſtirres up courage in hoſtlie encounters, &amp; ſo doth Chriſts love (the meditation and perſwaſion thereof) againſt all our ſpirituall enemies, yea and death it ſelf, <hi>Rom. 8. 35. Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. 5 It refreſhes and repaires (like <hi>Jonathan's</hi> hony comb) decayed ſtrength in fainting; and ſo does the contemplation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114769:8"/>
of Chriſt's love, when the ſoul beginnes to faint in trouble or temptation. 6. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 7. that wine makes a man forget his miſery, and ſo does the love of Chriſt and the aſſurance thereof, whatſoever miſery or hard eſtate he be in, in this preſent life, becauſe he lookes over all that: and, as the people did in the wilderneſſe on the braſen ſerpent, ſo he fixeth his eye upon the love of Chriſt, and the ſweet fruit thereof, which he ſhall enjoy at laſt. 7. Wine was uſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in legall ſacrifices, as we ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 5. And ſo in all our ſpirituall ſacrifices of prayer and praiſe, a main ingredient to ſtirre up our devotion, and to thank the Lord therefore, is, his love towards us: This alſo is an encouragement giving us confidence to be heard, and accepted; and this ſhould be (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) a maine motive, to offer up our bodies as an acceptable, holy, and living ſacrifice to God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee that the Church takes the kiſſes of Chriſts mouth, which are the aſſurance to her ſoul of her reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God and ſuch ſpirituall gifts, as the onely ſure teſtimonies of his love towards her; and therefore how farre is ſhe different in judgement from the worldlings, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure gods love to themſelves by temporall things and worldly proſperity? which thing, like that woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. ſhe treads upon in affection, ſeeking <hi>quae ſupra,</hi> and with <hi>Jacob</hi> the <hi>birthright</hi> and bleſſing; or with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. the light of Gods countenance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee, the cauſe why ſo earneſtly ſhe ſuits theſe tokens of Chriſts love, &amp; conſequently his love it ſelf, is, her due and right valuation of the ſame, better nor wine, or the moſt pleaſant and comfortable thing in nature: therefore till we learn ſpiritually to diſcerne, and accordingly highly to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſpirituall things, like <hi>Jacob</hi> who valued the birthright and bleſſing otherwiſe then <hi>Eſau;</hi> Or the wiſe merchant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that valued the pearle otherwiſe than did <hi>Eſop's</hi> Cock, we will never earneſtly ſeek after ſuch things, but as moſt men do, we will viliſie and deſpiſe them and ſeek after other things buſily with <hi>Martha,</hi> which we moſt account of, neglecting this one thing which is moſt neceſſary of all; yea after ſinne, and ſinfull pleaſures which ſhould be bitter and moſt diſguſtfull to us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As due valuation of ſpirituall things makes earneſtneſs

                  <p>In this verſe then wherein ſhe renders a reaſon of her love, to her well beloved, we have to conſider, 1. What is meant by theſe oyntments ſpoken of, 2.

                  <p>Firſt then, by theſe Oyntments, no other thing is meant but the ſaving graces of the holy ghoſt; which out of Chriſts fulneſſe, according to the Lords promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. 3. and <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. are powred upon the Elect, and whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. which graces are compared to Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Becauſe He is the full fountain where from they flow, therefore ſaid the Baptiſt of him, And of his fulneſſe we have all received grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. as likewiſe ſayes he to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> I counſell thee that thou buy of me Gold tryed in the fire that thou mayſt be rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. 2 They are called <hi>his,</hi> becauſe as they are from him; ſo they ſhould be for him, that is, for his glory and his Churches good, in their imployment, as of the Talents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the faithfull ſervants gained to their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are called <hi>(good)</hi> 1. in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Fountaine where from they ſpring, who is not only good, but goodneſſe it ſelf, and from whom every good gift commeth as from the Father of lights, 2. In reſpect of their operation and effect, which is, that the riches of grace makes all thoſe who have them to be good, whereas other riches oftentimes produce the contrary effect.</p>
                  <p>Next, they are ſaid to be ſavory, 1. to the ſenſible ſoul, to which nothing is ſo ſavory and odoriferous as ſaving grace,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114769:10"/>
and therefore they have not only ſuch an eager deſire after the ſame, and ſweet contentment therein, but likewiſe ſuch a delight in the very meanes thereof, that the ſame (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> teſtifies) is ſweeter to them than the Hony, and the hony Comb, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. and 119. and the ſavour of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. when it is made manifeſt inlarges their hearts and mouths with joy to give praiſe to the Lord, 2. Theſe ſaving graces are ſavory, and (like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice which he offered) are ſweet ſmelling to God, to whom nothing can make our ſelves, or our actions ſo pleaſing and acceptable (like <hi>Abel's</hi> Sacrifice and himſelf) as true grace, whereby the ſoul is, like <hi>Eſter,</hi> purified and perfumed to make her lovely to her heavenly King. So that of grace it may be ſaid, as it is, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 133. 1. of brotherly unity, How good and how pleaſant a thing is grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, followes the fruit or effect of the fragrancie of theſe good Oyntments, and 1. that the ſame is ſo delectable and ſweet, that the very meanes whereby they are gotten and procured are ſo ſweet and pleaſant, that they are like Oyntment powred out that gives a fragrant ſmell, and fills the houſe therewith, and this is ſignified by theſe words <hi>Thy Name is as Oyntment powred out.</hi> Where we have to conſider 1. what is meant by his <hi>name.</hi> 2. What is meant by the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out</hi> of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, omitting the diverſe acceptions of this word (name): by <hi>his name</hi> is here underſtood the goſpell, or word of God, whereunto is annexed the adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments, as the ſame is taken, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9. 15. whereby as a man is made known by his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo is our Saviour and what he has done for us, by his word: that ſo thereby knowing him we may love him, loving him we may ſeek after him, ſeeking after him we may find him, and finding him we may enjoy him, and all good things by him, even eternall life; and therefore this knowledge is called ſo, becauſe it is the meanes that leads thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Next, this name of Chriſt is ſaid to be like Oyntment <hi>powred out,</hi> by which powring out is meant, the preaching of the Goſpell, or as the Apoſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſavour of the knowledge of Chriſt, and work of mans redemption by his death and paſſion, which before time was kept up as it were in the uncloſed Veſſell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114769:10"/>
of Gods ſecret and hid Decree, but there after revealed more and more cleerly by myſticall promiſes, typicall ordinances and propheticall predictions, till at laſt it was fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted under the cleer light of the Goſpell; that light and pouring out of this ointment which was before and under the Law, being but dimme and by drops, as it were; but this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell being both plaine and plentifull.</p>
                  <p>The other fruit or effect of the ſavor of his ſweet ointments, is the love of the virgins ſpoken of here: Where we have, 1. who they are and why ſo called, 2. what is this love of theirs, and the object thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, theſe virgins are all the chaſte worſhippers of God, who worſhip him in ſpirit and truth and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the pollutions of this preſent world, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective number of which is that chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt, who in the ſingular number is called a chaſte virgin, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſpeakes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. This title the true members of Chriſts myſticall body receive, both in the Hiſtoricall, doctrinall and propheticall parts of the New teſtament. In the Hiſtoricall, where they are likned and compared to wiſe virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 1. In the doctrinall part, where they are called a chaſte virgin, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. And in the propheticall part, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 4. where they are called undefiled virgins who follow the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why they are ſo called, is, there are two things whereby one is polluted, the one is error in opinion or the mind, in matters intellectuall which are converſant about <hi>Verum et falſum,</hi> or truth and falſhood: the other is error in action, or life and converſation, in things morall, which are converſant about <hi>bonum et malum,</hi> good and evill: from both theſe ſorts of pollution, they labour to keep themſelves pure and free, 1. worſhipping the Lord according to the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word, without being ſeduced by hereticall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or drawne to <hi>Idolatry</hi> which is ſpirituall whoredome, and, 2. Living holily and not being wedded to any ſinne, worldly Mammon, or carnall concupiſcence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the love of theſe virgins here ſpoken of towards their welbeloved, is not a naturall or carnall love which comes of fleſh and blood, (for as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion, Fleſh and blood reveales no ſuch love,) but it is a holy, heavenly, and ſpirituall Love, comming from above, and is an effect of the love of God wherewith he firſt loved
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114769:11"/>
us, and which love is the Chriſtians tribute due to his God; who ſayes, My ſonne give me thy heart: and may be the Lords queſtionary tryall to every ſoule to know if it be his, as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Loveſt thou me, and, If any man love not the Lord Jeſus (ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle)</hi> let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22.</p>
                  <p>Of this love we have to conſider, 1. what it is, or <hi>quid ſit,</hi> 2. The ſorts thereof, or <hi>quotuplex ſit,</hi> 3. The properties of it, or <hi>qualis ſit,</hi> 4. The marks or tokens thereof, 5. The fruits and effects of it: and Laſtly, the motives or perſwaſions thereto.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, this love, is a holy affection of the heart wrought in the elect by the holy ſpirit, whereby out of the ſenſe of his love to them, and of that excellency that is in him, they love him with a holy, fervent and conſtant affection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Love to Chriſt is twofold, intenſive and appreciative, 1. The intenſive is that whereby the ſoule in a full benſell (as it were) is caried to love Chriſt, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may ſometimes in temptation be ſeen to ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and to faile in the fruit thereof, as we ſee in the falls of the <hi>Saints,</hi> 2. The appreciative, is that whereby the ſoul ſtill eſteemes the Lord and his favour, and values the ſame with <hi>David</hi> above all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the properties of this love are theſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a fervent love, and not like that <hi>Laodicean-</hi>zeale, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. but like that of <hi>Jacob's</hi> to <hi>Rachel,</hi> which therefore facilitates their ſervice and obedience to him, and makes his yoke light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is faithfull, like that of <hi>Jonathan's</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for Chriſt, as well as in peace and proſperity from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is fruitfull, like that tree ſpoken of in the firſt <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and ſo not in word only, but as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhowes, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. reall and indeed: therefore ſayes our ſaviour to <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to all paſtors; <hi>Peter,</hi> loveſt thou me? then feed my ſheep. And in like manner to all Chriſtians, if yee love me, then keep my commandements.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt be tranſcendent, above the love that we carry to whatſoever is deareſt to us, even our owne life, therefore ſayes our Saviour, he who loves father or mother better nor me, is not worthy of me. As it is ſaid then of the vertuous woman, Many daughters have done worthily but thou ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeſt them all; ſo, what ever love we carry to other things, this muſt ſurpaſſe all in like manner.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114769:11"/>
5. It muſt be conſtant, as his love is to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. and therefore not like <hi>Amnon's</hi> to <hi>Tamar,</hi> but as our Saviour ſaies to the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2. 10. be thou faithfull unto death and I will give unto thee the crowne of life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the marks and tokens of this love are theſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To have him often in our mind and mouth, the firſt by Heavenly meditation, the ſecond by holy communication, both by ſpeaking of him, and ſpeaking to him:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To delight in his ſpeech to us by the Miniſtry of his word; for which cauſe we ſee that <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 103. How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte, yea, ſweeter then hony to my mouth: and the ſpouſe, <hi>Gant.</hi> 5. 16. and 13. ſayes; His mouth is moſt ſweet, and his lippes like lillies, dropping ſweet ſmelling Mirrh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To eſteeme highly of his love-tokens, to wit, the graces of his holy ſpirit, both in account and valuation, and care of their right uſe and conſervation; and therefore neither to greeve nor quench the ſpirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To rejoyce in his preſence above all things, in whoſe preſence at laſt is fulneſs of joy, and (like the <hi>Solſequium)</hi> to be ſad for his abſence, as we ſee was <hi>David's</hi> querimony <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. and the churches ſad condition, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To obey and pleaſe him, therefore, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. the loving of him, and keeping of his commandements are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we ſee our ſaviour does in like manner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. And ſpecially to do this in the upright diſcharge of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings, therefore ſaid our Saviour to <hi>Peter,</hi> Loveſt thou me? then feed my ſheep.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To love thoſe whom he love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or whatſoever has a neer relation to him, as his friends, his cauſe, his image, (which every true Chriſtian is) and his poor members. For we know that the uſuall proverb is, He that loves me, will love my dog.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To ſtudy an aſſimilation of manners, or complying to him, in being holy as he is holy, &amp; learning of him to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek. For we know that this procures greatly, increaſes, and conſerves friendſhip, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Impatience to ſee him wrong'd, as we ſee in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Phinea's</hi> zeale. Therefore where this Love is, there will be a hatred and rebuking of ſinne, as wee ſee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. and Chriſt's quarrel will be a common quarrel, as we uſe to ſay, If
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114769:12"/>
we dearly love a man, we will party him and never ask his quarrell.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Where one loves, he lives, as we ſay, <hi>(anima eſt potius ubi amat, qudm ubi animat,)</hi> therefore the drunkard lives where his cups and Companions are, becauſe he loves them, and ſo does avaricious perſon where his Gold is which he makes his God and where his heart is: even ſo the godly ſoul his life is, where Chriſt is, in the Heavens, becauſe his love is there and his heart is where his treaſure is, above.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where love is, there is longing for a full fruition of the thing loved, as the Bride of the Bridegroom; even ſo where the love of Chriſt is, there is a longing till we get that full fruition of him in glory, ſpoken of by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. 11. when as the ſpouſe ſpeaketh, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 17. that joyfull day ſhall break, and the ſhadows that are here ſhall then flee away, therfore is the Churches prayer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 20. Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the fruits and effects which this love we carry to God produces are theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Proſpering, therfore it is ſaid <hi>Pſ.</hi> 122. 6. they ſhall proſper who love thee, this being the beſt and ſureſt way to thrive whereas the want of the Lords love has bin the cauſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and deſtruction to Kingdomes, Cities, great families and perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Protection, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 105. 20. the Lord preſerves them who love him; for which cauſe Satan acknowledged, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10. that the Lord had hedged <hi>Joh.</hi> about, as he promiſeth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 84. 11. to be unto all ſuch a ſunne and a ſhield.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If any thing fall out croſs unto them, according as the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. he makes all things work together for their beſt, as we ſee in <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſelling by his brethren, and the Princes of the Philiſtins their cauſing <hi>Achiſh</hi> through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſuſpition to dismiſs <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 29. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This love which is carried to Chriſt, as Moſes rod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Rod of the Aegyptians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orcerers when they were turned into Serpents; even ſo it mortifies in us that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love which is an enemy to ſalvation, and the love to ſinne; to the Mammon of iniquity, and all the inordinate affections which by the Apoſtle we are commanded to mortifie, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As this love to Chriſt procures ſo many good things
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114769:12"/>
to the Elect while they are here, ſo likewiſe (as we ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.) it procures unto them ſuch good things hereafter, as the eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, neither entred into the heart of man, which God has prepared (ſayes the Apoſtle) for them that love him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As this love which theſe Virgin-worſhippers carries to Chriſt, procures ſuch good things both temporall, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and eternall to themſelves; ſo in like manner, the Lord himſelf declares what thereby they procure to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to it as he ſayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. mercie to thouſands of them that love him and keep his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, we have to ſpeak of the Motives which may the more forceably induce and perſwade to this love of Chriſt, which are theſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Equity, therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Joh. 4. 19. we love him becauſe he has first loved us,</hi> and that with ſuch a matchleſſe love, as juſtly there may be put upon it, that <hi>(non ſicut)</hi> which is upon Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 12. ſo that we may now ſay, if we ow our ſelves to him becauſe he not only gave us to our ſelves in the firſt work of creation but being loſt thereafter he reſtored us in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: being therefore ſo given, and thereafter reſtored, we ow our ſelves to him by a double Obligation, but in reſpect that he not only reſtored us, but alſo gave himſelf for us, What can we render to him for that benefit, for although, we ſhould be able a thouſand times for that benefit to give our ſelves, yet what are we to our Lord?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neceſſity ſhould perſwade us; for elſe he that loves no Chriſt incurres that curſe whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. ſo that (as he ſayes) a neceſſity is laid upon me, and wo to me if I preach not the Goſpell; ſo may one juſtly ſay, a neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe to me if I love not my Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The excellency of him whom we love, ſhould move our hearts thereto, in whom there is 1. beauty unſpeakable as the ſpouſe ſhows and ſets it forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. or what is moſt pleaſant to the Eye of Faith, and ſpirituall ſenſes of the ſoul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Unſpeakable bounty in <hi>re et spe,</hi> or what is profitable for this life, or the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſweet ſavour of his Oyntments which come from him, whereof we have ſpoken, which makes the Virgins love him, and ſhowes the difference between Gods love to us &amp; our love to him, he loves us as <hi>Hoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> ſpeaks, freely, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114769:13"/>
and not for any thing in us, or can proceed from us, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhowes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. But we do not ſo love him, for our love is procured by that which we find in him, as in <hi>Sampſons</hi> dead Lyon, Hony was found; and for that which comes to us from him, as the cure that came by the diſeaſed woman of a bloudy iſſue from our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Where ever Chriſt is, he is not alone without ſweet Oyntments. Which, (as has bin ſaid) are the graces of his holy Spirit, which he beſtowes on that Soul wherein he comes to dwell, and which by that unction he makes a Royall Prieſt wherefore let us try our ſelves hereby, if ever Chriſt yet came to our Souls, or that Salvation, (as to <hi>Zacheus)</hi> came to our houſes if we have gotten of theſe ſweet Oyntments, and that grace be moſt ſavoury to us; elſe if the Spirit of Chriſt be not ſo in us, we cannot plead but that we are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe Oyntments are called <hi>(his)</hi> for the reaſons fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, which teach us, 1. from whom in our ſpirituall wants we ſhould ſeek, as he teaches the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> 2. in what humility we ſhould poſſeſs any gifts or graces that God hath beſtowed upon us, remembring that of the Apoſtle what haſt thou which thou haſt not received? And 3. the ſanctified uſe which we ought to make of them to wit to God's glory who is the giver, and his Churches good, like the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants who gained with their Talents.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where ever theſe good Oyntments are, they give a delightfull and fragrant ſmell both to thoſe who have them and to others (like <hi>Mary Magdalen's</hi> box of Oyntment that perfum'd the whole houſe) who ſee our light to be ſhining will glorify God our Heavenly father; and as a good ſmell drawes to it, ſo the good ſmell of a Holy life will draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the love of our profeſſion, beſides that it will ſeal up to our ſelves our own Election, and make us ſmell ſweetly in the Lord's Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Where ever true grace is in the ſoul, there is a high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of the meanes of grace or miniſtry of the Word, the preaching whereof is like Oyntment poured out, fragrant and Odoriferous: for how ſweet is it to a Soul ſenſible of its own miſery and God's mercy, to hear of Chriſt natures, offices, merits, and benefits, even as God's word was to <hi>David,</hi> ſweeter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114769:13"/>
than Hony and the Hony comb. Wherefore let us try if we have true grace by our love, account of, and carefull reſort to the meanes thereof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſweetneſs that the Elect ſoul finds in Chriſt and his graces, makes them to love him againe, So that where a ſoul loves not Chriſt with ſuch a love as has bin ſpoken of, it is a Token that it never taſted of true ſaving grace, nor is it marvell that thoſe that ſavour only the World, and delight in the uncleane luſts of the fleſh or to be ever wallowing in the filthy puddle of ſinne, that they ſmell not the ſweetneſs of theſe good Oyntments, nor for the ſavour thereof that they love not Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

In theſe words then we have to conſider, 1. what ſhe ſuits, and, 2. to what end. And in her ſuit, we have to conſider, 1. the action and quality thereof, 2. the reaſon and cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and, 3. the cords whereby the Lord drawes his elect. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in the ſecond, to wit for what end, (which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the duty,) we have, 1. The perſons who promiſes the performance of this duty, 2. The duty it ſelf, or the thing promiſed, and, 3. the rule of the performance of this duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, that which ſhe ſuits, is <hi>(draw me)</hi> which is not meant, 1. Of a corporall but of a ſpirituall drawing, 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it of a violent drawing, as ſometimes this word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 3. and 21. 30. but a voluntary action, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (as here) and delight, as ſweet muſick is ſaid to draw the eare to it, and the fame of a Skilfull Phyſitian is ſaid to draw many to him, or as the loadſtone by a ſecret vertue and power drawes the iron to it, and as is ſaid by the poet, <hi>trahit ſua quemqualut voluptas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this drawing then, mans will ſuffers no Manichean coaction, but by a heavenly influence and inflexion is ſweetly bowed, and made to comply to the Lords obedience, and; by the power of ſaving grace of nilling before, is made to be willing. There being in the text it ſelf two ſtrong arguments againſt any violent or Manichean coaction, 1. becauſe ſhe deſires to be drawne, and ſuch a deſire proceeds not from compulſion, but from a willing mind, 2. upon obtaining her deſire, ſhe promiſes to runne after him, which ſhowes a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alacrity in doing what ſhe promiſes.</p>
                  <p>2. The reaſon and cauſe why ſhe deſires to be drawne, is threefold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the way, which is an aſcent, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſhowes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 3. and therefore laborious and difficult to climb, whereas of ſinne it may be ſaid with the <hi>Poet, facilis deſcenſus Avern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> And as it is an aſcent, ſo is it a narrow and rough way, needing therefore not onely help to draw us up, but alſo a good guide, and watchfull attending.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe of our weakneſſe, which in the beſt of Gods, ſaints has kythed, fra once the hand of divine grace (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 23.) has left them never ſo little to themſelves, as we ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> fall, and <hi>Peters</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe alſo of that weight that hangs on, whereof the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. and ſo ſore complaines, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.

as a draw-back, and therefore ſhowes what need we have of divine grace to be drawne forward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The cords by which he drawes his Church, or any true member thereof, in generall <hi>Hoſea</hi> tell us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. that they are the cords of love. Therefore alſo ſayes the Lord in <hi>Jeremiah, 31. 3. I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving kindneſſe have I drawne thee.</hi> And in particular, theſe cords are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By his Word, as the Lord did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he called him from Vr to go where he ſhould direct him, or as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour drew his <hi>diſciples</hi> from their nets and receipt of cuſtome to follow him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By his Spirit concurring with the Miniſtry of his word whereby at once, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. he drew three thouſand to believ and follow after him; and which drawing is a fruit of Chriſt's aſſenſion, and evidence of his eternall love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By his example of a holy life, and by the example of his <hi>Saints</hi> conforme: therefore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. We are willed to look to Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him our parterne of imitation on earth, as he is our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron for mediation in heaven: therefore alſo for example of his <hi>Saints,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Apostle, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 1. Follow me, as I follow Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By his benefits which he renewes evening and morning, as his providence for us, his protection of us, his long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patience, and the like: beſide his creating us, redeeming us, and calling us to the hope of glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe being love-cords by which he labours to draw us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the promiſe which ſhe makes to runne after him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his drawing of her, which comprehends her duty, we have, 1. The perſons who promiſe this duty, and performance, thereof, ſet downe in the plurall, (We) and ſo the ſingular, in the petition (draw Me) in the promiſe of performance is changed into the plurall number, (&amp; we will runne after thee) which is done to ſhow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That though the Church be one in a cumulative conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as one myſticall body; yet it conſiſts of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in reſpect either of nationall Churches, or individuall members: all which whereſoever they be, are obliged to this duty, cheerfully and willingly to runne after Chriſt by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmiſſion to the draught of his ſpirit, and the imitation of his holy life.</p>

2. This is to ſhow the efficacy of good example, and the godlies excitation one of another to ſpirituall duties, as if ſhe ſhould ſay, <hi>Draw me,</hi> and not onely I, will runne after thee, but others alſo by my example and incitation ſhall runne after thee: as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 13. when I ſhall know thy mercies, I ſhall inſtruct others therein, and men who are brought low as I am, by my example ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The duty it ſelf or thing promiſed is, running after Chriſt, a Chriſtian life being therefore called a running in a race, <hi>Gal. 2. 2.

(as by the ſpouſe here) ſaying, I will runne the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, when thou haſt enlarged my heart; and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the godly ever, as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes of himſelf, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. and 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Which word of <hi>running,</hi> in obedience to God's commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the way, by his grace as our ſtrength, after his ſpirit as our guide, and unto glory as the prize, it hath, or doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe properties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we muſt do the ſame cheerfully, willingly, and diligently or with alacrity, as the <hi>Angels</hi> do God's comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; therefore we pray, Let thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt performe our obedience zealouſly and with all our might, even as thoſe who runne a race bend the whole force and ſtrength of their bodies to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forward, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> profeſſes of himſelf, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 14. And as <hi>David</hi> ſtirres up his ſoule and all that was within him, to praiſe the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Patiently, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Till the Lord call us to his eternall reſt, looking on Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, and never fainting or giving over for any terror or temptation, danger or diſcouragement, croſſe or calamity; but patiently induring what may occurre in our way, and to waite upon the Lord alwayes, to whom this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 31. But they that waite upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114769:15"/>
wings like Eagles, they ſhall runne and not be weary, and they ſhall walk and not faint.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſtantly, that is, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2. So to runne, as we may obtaine the prize, being faithfull to the death that we obtain the Crown of life, as we are exhorted <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. This being the praiſe of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that <hi>David</hi> makes, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. 33. And the Apoſtles practice, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>3ly. The Rule of our performance of this duty, or He after whom ſhe promiſes to runne, is, after Chriſt, the precepts of his word for direction, and the example of his life for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therfore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would not ſimply ſay, Follow me, but with this reſtricton, <hi>as I follow Christ,</hi> he being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our abſolute and perfect patterne. Therefore as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to his ſouldiers, As yee ſee me do, ſo do yee: ſo ſayes he to all his, As yee ſee how I have gone before you, ſo follow yee: for I am the way, the verity, and the life, the way to walk in, the truth to walk by, and the life to walke unto: which way if we keep, we ſhall be ſafe from ſtraying; which truth if we believe, we ſhall be free from erring; and which life if we walk unto, we ſhall be free from periſhing.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt this following after Chriſt be onely in active obedience, but paſſive; ſuffering as he did, innocently, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and perſevering to the end, as we are told, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The Church firſt deſires to be kiſſed with the kiſſes of his mouth, and now ſhe deſires more, to wit, to be drawne that ſhe may runne after him, whereby we ſee the diſpoſition of a Godly ſoule, to be ſtill covering more and more of the Lord's gracious favours towards the ſame, thirſting and hungring after more and more grace, till at laſt her veſſel be full in glory: therefore it is ſaid of the godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 7. That they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they ſee God in Sion, and with the <hi>Apoſtle, Philip.</hi> 3. 13. Forgetting thoſe things that are behind, they reach unto thoſe things which are before, and never can ſay of grace, as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid of his goods, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 9. I have enough.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee the Churches humble acknowledgment of her owne weakneſs and inability to runne after Chriſt except ſhe be firſt drawne by him, as if ſhe ſhould ſay, <hi>te<expan>

curſu non tamen apta ſequi:</hi> as our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 41. The ſpirit being ready, but the fleſh being weak, which made that great Apoſtle confeſs of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. that to will was preſent with him, but how to performe that which was good, he found not; and which much more, may all others moſt truly and humbly confeſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding of the ſenſe of her own weakneſs and inability to follow or run after Chriſt, yet ſhe faints not, nor therefore gives over, but by prayer to him who accepts the will for the deed, and who gives both the will and deed, ſhe deſires to be drawn by him, teaching us when we find or feel our own wants, and weakneſs to performe any ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, commanded, or ſaving grace, never to ſtay in that ſight or ſenſe, but to go to him who is the full and over flowing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all grace, and is both able and willing to ſupply all our wants, and ſupport our weakneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In that ſhe ſaies, <hi>draw me,</hi> we ſee the efficacy of ſaving grace, as in <hi>Manaſſeth, Pauls</hi> converſion, and of thoſe three thouſand at one draught as it were of the Net of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 2. Which ſerves both to trye the truth of Grace in our ſelves, which if it be true, it will draw us from our former ſinnes to the contrary practiſe of holineſs. As alſo this teaches us to deſpair of no mans converſion in Gods own time, who can be ſoon drawn to God when ever the Lords ſaving Grace comes to the ſoul, as Chriſt came to the houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and as he drew <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. In her promiſe to runne after him, we ſee that grace is not given to his Saints in vaine, as <hi>David</hi> ſhowes, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119. 32. but for practicall uſe, cheerfully and diligently to do the duties both of our generall and particular callings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We ſee likewiſe that our life here on Earth is a Race as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhows, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 12. Wherein having turned from ſinne, and entred in the way of the Lords teſtimonies, we muſt cheerfully runne our Race till we come to the end without fainting, or giving over, or ſo much as looking back, like <hi>Lots</hi> Wife; Gods Spirit being our guide; men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſpectators, God our Judge, and the prize the Crown of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We ſee that ſaying <hi>(after thee)</hi> that the right vvay then to run this Race is to follow after Chriſt, and then vve may be aſſured to come to Chriſt by <hi>grace</hi> in glory: but if vve nor not after him on Earth, following the direction of his

                     <p>The ſecond thing is, the Bringing of her into theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, (vvhich vve muſt underſtand to be ſpirituall for the manner, and done by Gods ſpirit as the agent) is, by the ordinary miniſtry of the Word vvhereby both he gives her the Eye of Faith vvhereby ſhe may behold in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell theſe heavenly Riches and treaſure therof in Chriſt; as alſo he layes open theſe things by his invvard revelation to her view, vvhich God hath prepared for them that love him, as the Apoſtle ſhovvs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and vvhich are hid from all thoſe vvho periſh.</p>
                     <p>The third thing is, vvho brought her in, and how is he ſtyled? He is here ſaid to be a King, vvhich is the firſt of Chriſts three Offices, vvho is King, Prieſt, and Prophet; a King for dignity, a Prieſt for Piety, and a Prophet for Heavenly Wiſdome and prudence, and all theſe three tranſcendent, and therefore the King of kings, the true and ſole high Prieſt, and that great prophet of his Church, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized from heaven that all men ſhould hear him. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us as King, having offered himſelf as a ſacrifice for us, and interceding as Prieſt, &amp; inſtructing us by his Word and Spirit as he is our prophet, and who only has made us a Royall Prieſthood to his Father.</p>
                     <p>This ſtyle then of King he frequently gets in Scripture, as <hi>Pſal. 2. 6. Jer.</hi> 33. 5. and <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. vvho has all theſe properties, 1. He is a <hi>good King,</hi> as he is alſo called, the good Shepherd, <hi>John.</hi> 10. 11. diſcharging to the full all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114769:18"/>

Both in power in it ſelf, being almighty; and over all perſons, their ſouls, as well as their bodies, and great alſo in reſpect of the extent of his dominion over Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and ſo onely catholick, 3. He is alſo a gracious king, 1. In patent acceſſe at all times, and to all who in-call upon him, 2. In ready and bountifull granting their petitions, 3. In taking notice of the love, loyalty and obedience of every one of his ſubjects; and, 4.

                     <p>As this bleſſed bridegroom of his Church is a King, ſo he hath a threefold Kingdome, of power, grace, and glory, 1. His kingdome of power is his ſupreame ſoveraignty, whereby, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, He rules and raigneſs as Head over all, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11. 2 His kingdome of grace is that, whereby he rules in a ſpeciall manner by the ſweet influence of grace in the hearts of his elect, and erects there his throne, 3. His kingdome of glory is that which is the inheritance of his <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, prepared for them before the beginning of the world, which is called, the kingdom of God and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mark. 10 14. à donatitione,</hi> therefore ſays our ſaviour, fear not little flock, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32.

And upon whoſe breaſts they are fed and nouriſhed by that ſincere milk of the Word, wherof <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>Having then ſpoken of thoſe, to whom ſhe ſpeaks, follows next what it is, that ſhe ſpeaks, to wit, <hi>I am black</hi> (ſayes ſhe) <hi>but comely:</hi> which ſpeech of hers is by way of conceſſion, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which they might object unto her concerning her blackneſſe, but withall ſhowing them that ſhe was comly, which blackneſſe, (or rather blackiſhneſs) howſoever it may be ſaid to befall her becauſe of the infirmities whereunto ſhe is ſubject in this life, ſo long as fleſh and ſpirit are in her like <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s twins wraſtling; yet ſpecially this blackneſs is ſaid to befall her (as ſhe ſhows in the next verſe) becauſe of perſecution and much affliction, whereunto ſhe is ſubject and all ſuch who will live godly in this preſent World; which perſecution, in the next Verſe, ſhe calls the Suns look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her, and which our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 6. expounds to be ſuch, and wherewith the Lord wiſely ſuffers his Church to be exerciſed for theſe reaſons following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To purge her, as in a furnace from her droſſe, and ſo to further her mortification, therfore called a Fiery tryall, which the Godly ſhould not think ſtrange to be amongſt them.</p>

4. For detecting of Hypocrits and Temporizers, who in the hour of temptation, like chaffe, will not abide with the ſolid graine.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Making this alſo a mean of propagating the Goſpell, which Satan and his Inſtruments thereby would impede, as a Vine by cutting the ſame, becomes more fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. Hereby likewiſe the body is conformed to the Head, by bearing the Croſſe here, that ſhe may come to the Crown hereafter: for all which former reſpects, the godly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in their ſufferings, and, as <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 29. counted it a gift or benefit, and an honour given them, that they were found worthie to ſuffer with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the difference between the troubles of the godly, eſpecially for righteouſneſſe, and theſe of the wicked, 1. In their nature, 2. In the ground wherefrom they come, even the Lords great love, 3. In their fruit, to wit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. And 4. In their end.</p>
                  <p>The next thing whereof he ſpeaks, by way of Apology, is, that ſhe is <hi>comly,</hi> where we have to conſider, 1. What this comelineſſe, is and wherein it conſiſts, 2. From whom ſhe hath it: And 3. Before whom, or in whoſe ſight and eſtimation, ſhe is ſo.</p>
                  <p>But firſt this would ſeem to be contrary to a Virgins mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty chiefly, to praiſe her ſelf, and ſay that ſhe was comely; and to that humility, whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notherman praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth, a ſtranger and not thine own lips, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 2. But hereunto it may be anſwered, that without violation of that precept of <hi>Solomons,</hi> this may be done in two caſes, <hi>Vel quando ad imitationem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit hoc utilitas audientis, vel ad juſtam defenſionem neceſſitas loquentis,</hi> both which we may ſee in <hi>Paul:</hi> The firſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 18. &amp; 35. and againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. The ſecond in two whole Chapters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. &amp; 12,</p>
                  <p>To come then to the firſt poynt to be handled of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114769:22"/>
to wit, what it is, and wherein it conſiſts. It is nothing elſe but that ſpirituall and inward beauty of Holineſs, ſo called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 2. and 110. 3. which (as is ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14.) is that comlineſs which the Lord put upon Her, and whereby (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> Speakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13.) The kings daughter is all glorious within, ſo that, like the cloud which ſtood between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and Egyptians though ſhe have one ſide black, ſhe has another ſide bright and beautifull, and her worſt is her outſide, being in outward ſhow like her Head, who becauſe of his abaſement in this world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of ſorrowes, there was no beauty in Him) that we ſhould deſire him; but her inſide (like his, by inhabitation of the deity) is glorious: and ſo ſhe is contrary to Hypocrites whoſe outſide (like painted Tombs) is the faireſt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they are foul, and full of corruption.</p>
                  <p>Next, having ſpoken what this comlineſs is, we have to ſhow wherein it conſiſts, firſt then it conſiſts in her juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, being clad with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is made her's, as it is ſaid, and ſhe ſhall be called, the Lord our righteouſneſſe, for which cauſe ſhe is deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 1. A woman clad with the Sunne, in the robe of whoſe righteouſneſſe, (as <hi>Jacoh</hi> clad in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s garment) ſhe gets from her Heavenly father gracious acceptation, and that bleſſing whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this comelineſs of her's ſtands likewiſe in her ſanctification, or re-impreſſion of that image of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto man was firſt created, which is called her new birth, or new creation, conſiſting in mortification and vivification, the Lineaments of which image no art can draw, but only the hand of that great God who firſt ſtamped the ſame upon the ſoul, as his owne image and ſuperſcription, by illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the mind, purification of the heart, inflexion of the will, ſanctification of the affections, and renouvation of the life, begunne in Baptiſm, having its progreſſe in our life, and its perfection after death, and which, <hi>Ezek</hi> 16. 13. is called that perfect beauty or comelineſſe that the Lord, put upon her, not by any perfection of degrees, but of parts, as hereafter he ſhowes, to wit, <hi>v.</hi> 10. that her neck is comely by bearing of Chriſts yoke, her cheeks alſo are comely by bluſhing at ſinne; and ſpecially, as <hi>c.</hi> 2. v. 14. when they are bedewed and runne downe with teares of true repentance, like thoſe of Mary Magdalen's, alſo ſhe is comly in her eyes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114769:23"/>
as, <hi>c.</hi> 4. 1. being like dove's eyes, both meek and mournefull: likewiſe in her lips, as, <hi>v.</hi> 3. by her gracious ſpeeches, both to God and of God; which ſhe has from him, and which ſhe uſes for him. And ſhe is comly alſo in her goings, <hi>c.</hi> 7. 1. Walking in the path of righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Thus thou art all faire my love (ſayes the ſpouſe to her welbeloved, <hi>c.</hi> 4. 7.)</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point vvhich vve have to conſider concerning this comelineſſe of the ſpouſe of Chriſt, is, From vvhom ſhe has the ſame, ſeeing ſhe has it not by nature. Therefore this comelineſs ſhe has only from her bleſſed bridgroom, vvho found her not ſo in the time of love, vvhen he looked upon her, any vviſe comely, but a deformed vvretch by ſinne and tranſgreſſion; and, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhovves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3. a filthy abject and object, lying in her blood; or, as our Saviour ſpeaks of the Church of Laodicea, vvretched and miſerable and poore and blind and naked. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. But what others cannot do to any whom they chooſe to be their ſpouſe, he did to her, that is, he made her of a foul and deformed wretch, a comely and beautifull ſpouſe, by his beauty and comlineſſe which he put upon her, as he teſtifies by the forenamed <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, 2 v.</hi> 14. ſaying, Thy renowne went out among the heathen for thy beauty, for it was perfect through my comelineſſe which I put upon thee. So, that from him alone ſhe has her comlineſs, as the moone has her ſplendor from the Sunne, or <hi>Moſes</hi> face had it ſhining, from being with the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayes our Saviour to Laodica, I counſell thee, Buy of me gold and white rayment &amp;c. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> asks, ſaying, What haſt thou, O man, but what thou haſt received, from him? Then we ſhould aſke this beauty of Holineſſe of him, and to him onely we ſhould give due praiſe for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The third point which we are to conſider concerning this comlineſſe of the ſpouſe of Chriſt, is, as, from whom he has the ſame, ſo in whoſe eyes and eſtimation ſhe is ſo comly and beautifull, and this is in His eyes ſpecially who made her ſo comly: and herein ſtands cheefly her joy and contentment, that how vile and contemptible ſoever ſhe be in the ſight or eſtimation of the blind world, as her Head and Saviour was, of whom it is ſaid, that when Herod ſaw him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He counted him at nought: and as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſayes, He was deſpiſed and rejected of men, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53. 3. Yet ſhe is beautifull and comly in his ſight who is her head and Husband, from whom only
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114769:23"/>
ſhe ſeeks approbation. Next, ſhe is comly and beautifull in the ſight of his holy Angels, who become unto her miniſtring Spirits ſent out for her good, to be her guard here, and her guide to eternall bliſſe hereafter. And laſtly ſhe is comly and beautifull likewiſe in the ſight of all the truly godly, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> teſtifies, who becauſe of this comlineſs counted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her true members, to be the only honourable and excellent ones of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. And 15. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(As the Tents of Kedar,</hi> &amp;c.) Followes now the illuſtration of her former ſpeech, Whereby ſhe compares her black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> and her comlineſs to the curtaines of <hi>Solomon,</hi> by which may be underſtood either the Tents or curtaines themſelves, or thoſe who dwelt under the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> or in the Court of <hi>Solomon,</hi> by a figurative forme of ſpeech. Theſe Tents then ſpoken of, were the Tents of thoſe men who were deſcended of <hi>Kedar</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 13. Of whom thereafter his off-Spring kept their denomination, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did from <hi>Iſrael</hi> their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor: whoſe imployment was to keep and feed Cattell in the hot Countries of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where they had their reſidence, and where, becauſe of their removing from place to place, they dwelt in <hi>Tents</hi> or pavillions, which either were artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made black or elſe otherwiſe became of a blackiſh colour and they themſelves likewiſe, becauſe of their living in ſuch a hot Country, were of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>Againe, her comlineſs here is compared to the curtains of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who as he was the richeſt of all Princes in his time, ſo were the curtains or hangings within his Court and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the richeſt and moſt glorious of any: as likewiſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who attended Him, and were of his Court. To theſe therefore is her comlineſs compared, to ſhow, 1. That there is no beauty or comlineſſe comparable to that of true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it being the greateſt and moſt glorious of any, and which the pooreſt and outwardly moſt deformed <hi>Lazarus</hi> may have: all the praiſe whereof is due to the true <hi>Solomon</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2. To ſhow that as the riches and glory of theſe Curtains was not ſeen by every one, or ſuch as were without, as the blackneſs of the forenamed <hi>Tents</hi> was, but by ſuch as were within <hi>Solomons</hi> Court and Palace or Chambers thereof: So the Churches comlineſs and Spirituall beauty is not externally ſeen or by the eye of a carnall mind, who is without the true Church;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114769:24"/>
but by theſe who are ſpirituall themſelves, and can ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerne, with <hi>David,</hi> that excellency beyond others that is in the Godly.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The Church we ſee is compared to Jeruſalem, called in Scripture the holy City: and a City we know is little in reſpect of a kingdome, and farre leſſe in compariſon with the world; even ſo Chriſts Church is but a little Flock, as Chriſt calls it, a few in an Arke that is to be ſaved, one Lilly amongſt many thornes, and though many be called yet few are choſen, and of which few number we ſhould try if our ſelves be.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All particular Churches are daughters only of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick church of Chriſt, therefore no particular church, as Rome unjuſtly claimes, can be the catholick Mother-church and miſtreſſe over all others, but at the beſt were but a Siſter Church, if it were pure and orthodox.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing daughters of one Mother or fellow ſiſters ſhould Love one another, and keep peace one with another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variance as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot,</hi> even ſo ſhould all Chriſtians who are children of this common Mother keep the unity of Love in the band of peace, as they are commanded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 12. And as it is commended, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 133. 1. And is Suteable to the ſignification of the name Jeruſalem, a viſion of peace.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Seeing the Church acknowledges that ſhe is ſomewhat black, the word in the originall (as is ſaid) being a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and denotating a mixture between two, as the dawning is between light and darkneſs: we ſee, 1. The churches inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and humble diſpoſition, acknowledging her infirmity and manifold defects: and, 2. The difference between the wicked and her, ſhe is ſomewhat black becauſe of fleſh and Spirit, but the wicked are altogether black, becauſe all fleſh and no Spirit: and though ſhe be black yet ſhe is comly; but they are black wholly, without any comelineſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Seeing the church of Chriſt is ſaid to be black, becauſe of her owne infirmities partly, and partly becauſe of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her by her Enemies, therefore neither let any dream of perfection here without infirmities, nor (if they will love godly) reſolve otherwiſe but to ſuffer perſecution.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We ſee the worſt that perſecution can do, it may well be a noyſome ſcorching or Sunne-burning, as that was of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114769:24"/>
                        <hi>Jonas,</hi> and alter the externall luſter of the Church, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not marre her comelineſs eclipſing the externall beauty of her ſolemne aſſemblies, or goodly order which is ſeen in her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the time of peace, but, though like the Moon ſhe be a while under cloud, or like the Sunne which is ſaid to have been darkned by the ſmoak that aroſe out of the bottom leſs Pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 3. her externall beauty be, as it vvere, obfuſcat, yet her native ſplendor which ſhe has by her new birth is never a whit diminiſhed nor ceaſſes her glory to the full deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. Though for a ſhort time, ſhe be driven to the wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This comelineſs of hers, is, as has been ſaid, her beauty of holineſs which ſhe has from her Lord, and which makes her ſo lovely and acceptable to him: therefore all her true members ſhould labour for holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee God, beg it from him, and that by it through Chriſt Jeſus they may find favour and acceptation in his ſight.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If this her comelineſs be ſo glorious, in the time of her imperfection and frailty on earth, that it is comparable to <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his royalty, and to the richeſt and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hangings of his Court, how glorious ſhall her ſhining beauty be, when ſhe ſhall be freed of all ſpot or blemiſh, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or temptation in the higheſt Heavens.</p>

                  <p>In theſe words follows her exhortation to theſe forenamed daughters of Jeruſalem, that for her blackneſs they would not therefore look upon her with diſdaine, as either to forſake her, or think her forſaken.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe this her blackneſſe is not native or perpetuall, but accidentall and for a time only, through the ſcorching or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt then, ſhe aſſimilats her perſecution which ſhe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to the ſcorching or burning of the Sunne, as we ſee it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 6. 1. Becauſe as the ſame is grievous to the body through the great and vehement heat thereof, which oftines cauſeth fainting and complaint, as we ſee in <hi>Jonas,</hi> even ſo perſecution and trouble is grievous to fleſh and blood and through the raging violence thereof, has cauſed many to faint and complaine, even of Gods deareſt ſervants why they ſhould be ſo dealt with, as we ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. and elſe where, 2. This ſcorching affects only the body but no more; even ſo does the rage of perſecution, it may kill the body, but no more: therefore ſayes our Saviour, Fear not them that can kill the body, and no more, but feare Him that can kill both ſoul and body. 3. The ſcorching heat of the Sunne, it is but for a ſhort time in the height of the day, but thereafter comes the coole of the evening; even ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution laſts but for a ſhort time, for the Lord will not ſuffer the rod of the wicked to lye ſtill upon the back of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor the ſtorme ever to continue, as we ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 8. But will ſend delivery to his own Sion, and to Iſrael out of all his troubles, 4. In the time of the hort ſcorching of the Sunne men uſe to betake themſelves to ſome ſhaddow, or covering place, even ſo does the Church to ſome Lurking places, as we ſee in <hi>Elias</hi> time, and of the Primitive church; but chiefly they betake themſelves to the ſhaddow and protection of the Almighty, as the dove to the clefts of the rock, which, unlike <hi>Jonas</hi> gourd, never failes them; under the coverture whereof they reſt and are refreſhed till the ſtorme paſſe over. 5. In relation to vegetable things, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 6. Perſecution is ſo compared, to ſhow what it doth to carnall profeſſors and temporizing Hypocrits, who wither as it were thereby, and make finall defection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſhe ſhowes that this Perſecution proceeds from her Mothers children, that is, ſuch as pretended to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the catholick Church as well as ſhe, of one Mother, and under one common Enſigne of the true worſhip or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and therefore theſe her Perſecutors were not open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemies to the Church, nor infidells and diſclaimers of the profeſſion of the true Religion.</p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the moſt corrupt times claimed and cryed, The Temple of the Lord: ſo they, that they were the Children of the true Church, even when they were with hot and fiery perſecution afflicting them who were the true

Church. In a word then, theſe ſonnes, were, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calles them, falſebrethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. Where we have here to advert, that ſhe calles them not her father's children, becauſe, as our faviour ſaid to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> howſoever they called <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, yet he was not, but the divell whoſe works they did: even ſo, howſoever they pretended and claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the true catholick Church to be their mother, yet they were not that truely, but by uſurpation of that name; becauſe they who have her truly to be their Mother, have God to be their Father, and his children they were not, becauſe they did not his words but rather the divells in perſecuting her, who was the true church.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the true Church ſpeaketh here, who is her ſelf the mother, how ſpeaks ſhe of her ſelf as a perſon diſtinct from her Mother, or rather as a daughter to this mother, and of theſe her perſecutors, as her Mothers children? I anſwer. It is the manner of the Hebrew Tongue to call the whole the Mother, and the parts of the whole catholick Church, daughters, and ſiſters, and children Then. remark this, that although there be but one univerſall Church, yet becauſe the ſame is never whole in the world at one time, therefore the true Church of the preſent time, may be called a daughter to the true Church that preceded her in former times, and theſe her perſecutors pretended children of that Mother, as ſhe may be called a Mother to the true Church that ſucceedeth her in future or after times, and of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere individuall worſhippers in the preſent time.</p>

Laſtly, the progreſſe of their anger and rage againſt her is ſet down, or the effect thereof; which is thus farre, that they made her the keeper of their Vines, with the neglect of her own: which words of <hi>their Vines,</hi> and <hi>her Vine</hi> are ſet down by way of oppoſition, their's being Vines of another quality then her's. For there are divers ſorts of Vines ſpoken of in the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, a Vine which is called the Vine of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe grapes are grapes of Gall, and their Cluſters bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Deut</hi> 32, 32. Alſo, there is a Vine which is called an empty Vine, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 1. Alſo, a Vine which is called a Noble Vine, and a right ſeed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. alſo a goodly Vine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 8. and a fruitfull, <hi>Pſalm. 80. 9. Ezek.</hi> 19, 10. and this is the vine which is called <hi>her Vine:</hi> in like manner there is another, whereof <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. and the Lord calls a degenerate plant, of a ſtrange Vine to him, even as it is ſaid <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. that the faithfull City was become a Harlot, and this is the ſort of theſe Vines which are called their Vines, who were themſelves degenerate and baſtard-children of the Church, and ſuch only who uſurped the name of true profeſſor's, but had degenerate from the truth of God to humane traditions, like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Chriſts time; and to groſſe corruption in Religion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sonnes then of her mother, or falſe brethren, they ſeek to draw her to this corruption in religion with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to obſerve humane traditions which is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Vines, forſaking the purity and ſincerity of the true worſhip of God, &amp; the keeping of her own Vine, or elſe to undergo their wrath and cruell perſecution, wherein through the force of their perſecution on the one hand, and her own weakneſſe and frailty on the other, ſhe is made for the moſt part, to ſwerve from her former ſincerity, and, like the ſervants that ſlept while the tares were ſown, to neglect the performance of the Charge and duty that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto her.

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. This place ſorveth to direct us in our judging and eſtimation of Chriſts Church aright, and not to deſpiſe her, or take offence and forſake her (as many have done) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her blackneſſe, that is, want of externall beauty, and worldly luſtre or glory (for ſo was her Head on earth) and that ſhe is under much and many ſufferings (for ſo it behoves her with her Saviour by the Croſſe to come to the Crown,) but we ſhould look to her inward beauty by a ſpirituall diſcerning eye, and to that perfection of glorious beauty to which ſhe ſhall come, when it ſhall be ſaid unto her; <hi>Thouart all fair, my love, and there is no ſpot nor wrinkle in thee;</hi> and when ſhe ſhall be rid of all her Enemies, and no <hi>Canaanite</hi> ſhall be in the Land. The erring in which poynt of right judgement, has bin the cauſe of the ruine of many, who both for the baſe condition of her Head, when He was on Earth, deſpiſed Him; and who likewiſe for the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his true Church (like the two witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. cloathed in ſackcloath and under much ſuffering,) did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſame, and in reſpect of the outward pompous and worldly luſtre of the Antichriſtian Church on the contrary followed the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing the Lot of Chriſts Church here on earth, is to be ſubject to perſecution and trouble, which is compared to the ſcorching of the Sun, therefore in time thereof, let us do as thoſe who are ſo ſcorched in hot Countries, that is, as <hi>Jonas</hi> had his recourſe to his gourd, ſo let us have our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe chiefly to the coverture and ſhadow of the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, by a holy confidence, and to the refreſhing cooling and comfort of the promiſes of his word, and the witneſſing within us with <hi>Job</hi> of a good conſcience; ſubmitting our ſelves to his good will and pleaſure who gives us that cup to drink of as our Saviour by his example taught us in his agonie, and labour to be well rooted and eſtabliſhed by grace, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the moyſture thereof in our ſouls, (like the Oyl of the wiſe Virgins which they had in their Lamps,) we be not like that ſeed ſpoken of, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 5, 6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee that the Church has not only open and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies, but domeſtick and inteſtine, like theſe falſe brethren here mentioned, who claimed to be Children of the ſame Mother as well as ſhe: of which ſort the Apoſtle
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114769:27"/>
forewarnes the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. And the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe were angry at their Virgin-ſiſter, which ſhowes us the wicked diſpoſition of ſuch falſe brethren, who though they be under one name and common enſigne with true profeſſors, and lay claime to the true Church as much as any, yet as <hi>Cain</hi> waxed wroth againſt <hi>Abel</hi> unjuſtly, and <hi>Eſau</hi> in like manner againſt his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo do they for the truths ſake, againſt the true worſhippers; as the Dragon was wrath with the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. and went to make Warre with the remnant of her ſeed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Where ſhe ſaies, that they made her the keeper of their Vineyards, but her own ſhe did not keep, we ſee. 1. the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of many true profeſſors, and deareſt of Gods Saints that through fear and force of perſecution, they have been ſometimes drawn, as <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, to do that which thereafter with many teares and humble confeſſion they have (with the Church here) to Gods glory and their own ſhame acknowledged. And therefore this teacheth us ever to ſuſpect our own ſtrength, and to beg courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy from God; that ſo he who ſtands may take heed leſt he fall, <hi>et ut majoris ruina ſit minoris cautela.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Next in her humble confeſſion and acknowledgement of her infirmitie, fault, and negligence, we ſee the laudable diſpoſition of the godly, in the humble acknowledgement of their ſinnes that God might get glory, and others by their example may be aware, as we may ſee in <hi>Moſes, David, Jonas, Paul,</hi> and many others; far contrary to the contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the wicked, who ſeek to deny, exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Having before acknowledged how in her weaker members throw infirmitie and force of perſecution ſhe was driven and drawn to the obſervation of humane ordinances, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of her own calling, in the duties thereof are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto her. In theſe words, ſhe turneth her ſpeech againe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114769:27"/>
to her wellbeloved, praying him moſt earneſtly for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of her in time-comming, that ſhe may more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adhere to his truth, and feed only on that green pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. As alſo for his grace and protection that ſhe fail not, nor fall away becauſe of perſecution which is compared to the ſcorching heat of the Sunne at Noon day. And this ſhe does in Allegoricall tearmes borrowed from a ſhepheard and his flock, and therefore ſhe deſires her beloved as the Shepheard of his Sheep, that for direction he will ſhow her where he feeds, and for refreſhing, cooling, and protection, <hi>where he cauſeth his Flock to lye down at Noon day,</hi> that ſo ſhe turne not aſide (being otherwiſe deſtitute of theſe) <hi>from him and his Flock, to the Flocks of others,</hi> who are ſeducers, and are here called <hi>his Companions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words then divide themſelves into a petition and a reaſon; the one ſet down by a pathetick expreſſion, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a pithy interrogation. In the petition againe, we have 1. How ſhe ſtyles him to whom ſhe puts up her petition, 2. Whereunto ſhe aſſimilates or compares him; and 3. what are the two things that ſhe petitions from him, to wit, 1. <hi>Where he feeds,</hi> and 2. <hi>Where he makes his Flook to reſt at Noon day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then ſhe ſtyles him thus. <hi>Oh thou whom [my ſoul] loves,</hi> ſhowing thereby the nature of the love which ſhe carries to her Well-beloved, to wit, that it is not a carnall love, but a more ſupernaturall and ſpirituall love, even that which the ſpirituall part of man, or the ſoul carries to him who will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, <hi>And bleſſed is that Soul which is inflamed therewith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſhe aſſimilats him to a ſhepheard, as he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo called in Scripture, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 23. 1. &amp; 80. 1, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 23. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 12. with theſe adjections, <hi>that good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> Joh, 10, 11. and <hi>the great Shepherd,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. and by <hi>Peter, the chiefe Shepherd of our Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 4. Who only can call all the ſheep, <hi>his Sheep,</hi> and is onely and truly Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this aſſimilation are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As a Shepherd knows his Sheep, Joh.</hi> 10. 14. ſo doth Chriſt Jeſus his Elect not onely by a generall knowledge as he is omniſcient, but by a ſpeciall knowledge of particular inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gracious approbation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a Shepherd puts a marke upon his Sheep whereby
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114769:28"/>
they are known to be his: even ſo the Lord Jeſus markes thoſe that are his Elect, as we ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. Which mark, is ſpecially his owne image; that as <hi>Caeſars</hi> Coin was known by his Image and ſuperſcription, ſo hereby they may be in like manner known to be his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a Shepherd feeds his ſheep, as we ſee in this verſe and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23. 3. even ſo doth Chriſt Jeſus feed his ſheep, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exerciſe of the miniſtry, as he ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheep, &amp; by the green paſture of the wholſome food of his word, Ezek.</hi> 34. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As a Shepherd leads out his ſheep, going before, himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 4. and they follow him: even ſo the Lord Jeſus he leads his ſheep by the conduct of his counſell, till he bring them to glory; and goes before them in that holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life which he ſhewed on Earth, and left regiſtrate in his Word for our imitation, that we ſhould learn of him to be humble and meek.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the ſhepherd guids his Sheep, ſo he guards and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them from their ravenous enemies, as we ſee <hi>David</hi> did from the Lyon and Beare: even ſo does our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, guard and defend his own elect from all their ſpirituall and ravening enemies, that they prevaile not over them &amp; therefore, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84. 11. He is ſaid to be both a Sun &amp; a ſhield unto them: ſo that as <hi>David</hi> profeſſes, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 33. 4. though they ſhould walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, they need not fear any evill.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the Shepherd ſeeks any of his ſheep who are gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray &amp; ſeems to be loſt, to find &amp; bring the ſame back againe as we ſee in that parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 12 &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 16. So has Chriſt Jeſus come from the Heaven to the earth to ſeek and find out his loſt ſheep; And dayly ſeeks and follows after them in the miniſtry of his Word to reclaime them from their ſinfull and dangerous ſtraying away from him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As a ſhepherd heals the diſeaſed and ſick amongſt his ſheep, and binds up that which is broken amongſt them, as we ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4. Even ſo was our Saviour, the Lord Jeſus ſent, as he declares, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 61. 1. to bind up the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and proclaime liberty to the captives; and, as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 16. He will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring againe that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and ſtrengthen that which was ſick, for he is that Heavenly Phyſitian who is able, to cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103. 3. and more loving then that <hi>Samaritan</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114769:28"/>
who out of his tender compaſſion towards our wounded ſouls, ſuffered himſelf ſo to be wounded and pierced both in ſoul and body, that of his precious blood a ſoveraigne plaiſter might be made for us to apply by faith to our ſick ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As a ſhepheard tenderly deales with the weake and young, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 11. Even ſo is it ſaid of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 40. 11. That he ſhall gather his Lambs with his arme, and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead them that are with young, which the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> expreſles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like as a father pittyeth his children: ſo the Lord pittyeth them that feare him, for he knowes our-frame, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that we. are but duſt: He layes no more upon them nor they may beare, yea he helps them ſecretly to beare, and wiſely mixes their cup, and makes his grace to be ſufficient for them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As the ſhepheard ſeparates from his flock, the goats, or ſuch as are not his owne; So, ſayes the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 17. Behold I judge between cattell and cattell, between the rammes and the Hee-goats: and will ſeparate at the laſt day his own ſheep who heard his voice and followed Him here, from the wicked that are none of His, but petulant goats, ſetting the one at his right hand, unto Eternall life, and the other as his left hand unto eternall deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But here is a great difference between other ſhepheards, and this ſhepherd ſpoken of here, for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Others may loſe ſome of their ſheep, but not ſo he: therefore ſayes he to his father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 12. Theſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt, neither is any one able to take them out of his hand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſheep are the workmanſhip of his hands; but other ſhepherds though they feed their ſheep, yet they may not ſay, that they made their ſheep.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Other ſhepherds make gaine of their ſheep, and kill ſome of them for their owne food, but no gaine redounds to this ſhepherd by his ſheep, their goodneſſe not extending to him, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. And for, ſaving of his ſheep from death, he was killed, and gave himſelf to the death for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhe aſſimilats all the true members of Chriſts church to ſheep, calling them <hi>His flock</hi> even as our Saviour alſo calles them, <hi>his little flock</hi> for whom the Father has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired a kingdome: which ſtyle of a flock of ſheep, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114769:29"/>
aſcribed to them in Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 2. To remember them, 1. Of their infirmity for their humiliation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 2. 21. 16. 2 Of their duty for their inſtruction: and, 3. Of the care that is had of them, for their conſolation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their infirmity then is this, that like ſheep, they are of themſelves ready and prone to ſtray, as we ſee it told us, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. 6. And in that parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 12. both by reaſon of externall temptation, and that boſome-enemy which we have of our own corruption, as we ſee in the parable of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne, and in the examples of Gods deareſt ſaints, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Ezek</hi> 34. 6.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For admoniſhing them of their duty, 1. Chriſts flock being of ſheep, they are therefore neither of wild beaſts, as Tigers or Lyons, Foxes or Wolves; nor yet are they of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſts, as dogs, and ſwine, or the like: but of ſuch as are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amed from all ſuch ferity, and purged from impurity by the power of God and his ſoveraigne grace, yea in a manner metamorphoſed from ſuch like as they were before by nature, as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Manaſſeh, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As ſheep are ſimple, and not like crafty foxes as <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15. and as Chriſt called <hi>Herod;</hi> ſo are the godly by a Holy ſimplicity and ſincerity, yet mixt with ſerpentime prudence, and are like <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> Behold a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in whom there is no guile.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are meek and harmleſſe, and ſo are the godly, having learned that Leſſon of their Maſter, and being ready to do good to all, but not to requite evill with evill at the hands of any: this meekneſs and quietneſs of ſpirit, (as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us) being of great price in the ſight of God, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sheep are patient in ſuffering; therefore it is ſaid of our Saviour that as a Lamb to the ſlaughter and as a ſheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſhearer is dumb, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53. 7. ſo he opened not his mouth. Even ſo are the godly, patient in ſuffering, either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly what is laid upon them for their ſinnes, or tryall by the Hand of God; or what is done unto them mediatly by the Hand of man, as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Job, David, Joſeph, Stephen,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sheep as they are patient, ſo they are profitable, both in their lives, and by their death, for mans food and clothing: even ſo are the godly profitable, many wayes, both for their company, as we ſee in <hi>Joſephs</hi> being in <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iphars</hi> houſe, <hi>Jacob</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114769:29"/>
in <hi>Labans,</hi> and if ten righteous had been in <hi>Sodom:</hi> as alſo by their converſation and holy example, both in word and deed, making their light ſhine before men, that men ſeeing their good works may glorifie God their Heavenly father. And as they are profitable many wayes in their life, ſo are they likewiſe in their holy deaths and comfortable departure, wherein a man may ſee a ſtrange change of the nature of death in them, and a great difference betweene them and the ungodly therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sheep are obedient and follow whither the ſhepherd leads them; even ſo, as our Saviour ſhowes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 4. his ſheep they hear his voice, and they follow Him, making his precepts to be the directory of their life, and his practice their pattern for imitation, as we ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Follow me as I follow Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Sheep after they have fed in greene paſture, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ruminate and doe chew their cud; even ſo when Chriſts ſheep has read or heard His word, which is that paſture ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 2. With <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 1. and 119. they meditate thereon, apply the ſame, and lay it up in their heart, that they ſinne not againſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 11.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As great is the care that the good and faithfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd has of his ſheep, in feeding guiding and guarding them, reducing the ſtrayers, curing the diſeaſed, caring for the weak, and watching over all, as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> and the ſhepherds of Bethleem, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 8. Even ſo, great is the care that Chriſt Jeſus has of his own elect, in doing the like offices towards them for his glory and their good and comfort.</p>
                  <p>And albeit the ſilly ſheep, (whoſe ſafety ſtands only in the care of the ſhepherd) has many enemies, as Dogs, Foxes, Woolvs, Beares and Lyons, and are killed daily alſo for the uſe of man, yet mightily beyond any other, increaſe: even ſo, although the godly may ſay, as we have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36. We are killed all the day long, and are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, yet maugre all their enemies the Lord makes his flock multiply, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did under <hi>Pharoah's</hi> heavieſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the blood of Martyrs to be the ſeed of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the actions attributed to this ſhepherd in this text are two, 1. feeding as we ſee it attributed to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 23. which he doth, partly externally, meditately, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114769:30"/>
miniſterially, by the preaching of the word, as he ſaid to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Feed my ſheep:</hi> and partly internally, immediately, and as the principall agent; without whoſe concurrence and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Pauls</hi> planting, nor <hi>Apollos</hi> watering, will produce no increaſe.</p>
                  <p>The next action is cooling, refreſhing, making <hi>his Flock to reſt at Noon,</hi> in ſome repoſing and ſhadowiſh reſting place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding ſo to the manner of Shepherds in hot Countryes who in the heare of the day (which is, moſt at Noontide) lead their Sheep to ſome cooling reſting place, where they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and refreſh themſelves, and chew their cud; and being ſaved from the vehemencie of the ſcorching Sunne, might with the greater alacrity thereafter returne to their paſture. Even ſo in the very greateſt heat of perſecution, our Saviour Chriſt makes his own to find comfortable refreſhment, ſhelter of preſervation, and ſuch inward reſt of peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and joy in the holy ghoſt, that they may ſay with <hi>David</hi> in greateſt commotions, My heart is fixed, and cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? <hi>[For why ſhould I be?]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Followes the reaſon of her petition, wherein we have 1. The manner of the proponing it, to wit, by way of interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 What is meant by theſe, whom ſhe calls <hi>his companions.</hi> 3. What is meant by her turning aſide to the flocks of theſe: the ſubſtance of all which is, the incommodity that will fall out, if he tell her not <hi>where he feeds,</hi> to wit, that by her frailty and force of temptation, ſhe may be made to decline aſide from the way of truth, and joyne to falſe worſhippes which will be neither to his honour, nor her good.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the manner of the proponing this Reaſon by way of interrogation, is to ſhew, 1. her earneſt deteſtation of any declyning though, never ſo little, from the truth of Chriſt, in time-comming, as <hi>Hoſ. 14. 8. Ephraim</hi> is brought in, ſaying, What have I to do any more with Idols? who before c. 14. v. 17. ere ſhe was converted, is ſaid to have been joyned or married with ſuch, and which holy indignation is in every one that is truly converted againſt that ſinne they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to, no leſſe then <hi>Amnom</hi> deteſted <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2. This implyes a firme reſolution not to turne afide, as that interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>Nehem. 6. 11. Should ſuch a man as I flee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Theſe whom ſhe calls <hi>companions,</hi> ſhe ſtyles ſo not thereby to aſcribe to them any ſuch dignity in truth, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114769:30"/>
were blaſphemy, but to ſhew what bold uſurpers hereticks are, and eſpecially that grand Antichriſt, who aſcribes to himſelfe infallibility, that he may be the only great Maſter and teacher of Chriſts Catholick Church on earth, and therefore equalls his doctrines and decretalls in authority, with Canonick Scripture, while as Chriſt, is the only great ſhepherd, and teacher of his Church, and who only has no Companion nor Vicar one earth.</p>
                  <p>3. By turning ſide to the flocks of theſe, is meant, the ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the truth and purity thereof, to the ſociety of falſe worſhippers and ſuffering her ſelf to be ſeduced, by ſuch as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, who were deceivers, and ſhould enter in after his departure, and draw diſciples after them, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> made many to follow him in his rebellious courſe, who did ſo in the ſimplicity of their hearts, or as the whole world is ſaid to have been by deceit drawn out of the right way of truth to follow the beaſt.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The Church here in her weaker members being ſenſible of her former errors and having acknowledged the ſame, ſhe now deſires to be ſo directed, and eſtabliſhed by her beloved, that ſhe never deflect nor ſwerve any more from the purity of his worſhip, and for this her direction goes only to him, who is the way and the truth, ſo that we ſee though the godly fall, yet they are not like the wicked who lye and live in ſin, but they riſe againe, by humble acknowledgement, prayer, deteſtation of ſinne and reſolution to eſchew the ſame in all time-comming; all which we ſee in this her practice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Out of her compellation of him, we ſee though through weakneſſe and force of temptation ſhe fell, yet his love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went out of her heart, as we may ſee in Peter, who though he fell foulely, yet he could ſay to Chriſt when he asked him, Loveſt thou me, Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee: ſo that although Satan <hi>Fidem concuſſit, amorem tamen non excuſſit, cujus actum et ſi intermiſit, habitum tamen non amiſit,</hi> which alſo we may ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> fall, and others of Gods Saints, whom he has permitted to fall, but never ſuffered to fall away, becauſe of that ſeed of his love, that ſtill notwithſtanding remained in their heart to him, and flowes from this, that his love to us is immutable, and ours to him is an effect of his love to us, O then, labour to keep Gods love evermore.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114769:31"/>
3. This compellation ſhe uſes now when ſhe goos about prayer to him or invocation, as being a great motive to him to hear, and ground of confidence to her that he would do ſo. Let us try then, if we find the love of God in our hearts, and then we may be aſſured to have the like confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whereas ſhe ſayes, <hi>tell me,</hi> &amp;c. deſiring to be inſtructed aright, and that by his word only, which is now regiſtrate in Scripture, we ſee, 1. Her humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her naturall ignorance needing information. And O happy ſoul, who comes to this ſight and acknowledgement of their own wants, and is not like <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3. and 2. for right direction either in faith or manners. Let us go to Chriſt's mouth, opened in holy Scripture, and there ſay to him, Tell me, and give me reſolution.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The two things whereof ſhe deſires to be inſtructed, are <hi>where he feeds,</hi> and <hi>makes his Flock to reſt at Noon-day,</hi> where we obſerve that the Church depends not only upon Chriſt for food, or wholeſome green paſture, rejecting all humane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or doctrines of men, but in the midſt of hotteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, When the Sunne ſcorches ſoreſt, as at Noon-day, to be refreſhed by him: as the Church and her true members has found when tyrants have moſt raged againſt her, which has made them to find ſhelter from the boſome of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter, and the true prophet from <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, and to have ſuch inward rejoycing and couragious reſolution in the very midſt of their ſufferings as the Apoſtles and Martyrs have kythed, that the World have admired the ſame, and themſelves have found their eſtate to be, as is ſaid here, like Sheep after feeding reſting at Noon-day.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſts people are here called his Flock, and compared to Sheep, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. and elſewhere. Then if we would know if we belong to this Flock, try if we have the properties of the Sheep formerly ſet down, and then we may be well aſſured of all the comforts and care that can ariſe from a faithfull and loving Shepherd.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the manner of ſetting down the reaſon ſubjoyned, which (as is ſaid) ſhows her deteſtation of turning aſide from Chriſt and his Flock to any other, we are taught, That this is a property of the true members of Chriſts Church, to hate and deteſt ſinne, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114769:31"/>
eſchew the practice thereof, and more hardly be tempted therewith, and that it is a mark of a true penitent eſpecially, to deteſt that ſinne moſt in time-comming wherein they have fallen in times by-gone.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Where ſhe ſpeaks of one flock which is Chriſts in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the unity of faith, but of many flocks of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reſpect of the diverſity of profeſſion one from another unto which flocks, ſhe ſayes, ſhe will not turne aſide, We ſee. 1. that there is but one true Church, and which Chriſt calls but a little flock, but there are many falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſects of hereſies, mans nature, beſides Satans ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity having more power to follow lyes then truth. Therefore ſuch ſhould teach us to beware of ſeduction. and 2. That we ſhould not follow the multitude in ſinning, or turning aſide and ſwerving never ſo little from verity and piety: Neither is the multitude a note of the true Church.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Where she craves his inſtruction and aid, implying this to be the danger, if the ſame be not granted her, that she will otherwiſe be eaſily drawn to turne aſide from Chriſt and his truth to error and defection, we learne, If the Lord leave us never ſo little, and aſſiſt us not by his direction and grace, how ſoon and foully we may fall: ſo that when Satan ſeeks to ſift us, it is Chriſt's mediation for us that our Faith fail not; and his Grace which is ſufficient for us, as he ſaid to <hi>Paul,</hi> that makes us to ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Laſtly, where falſe teachers are called Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, we ſee not only their proud uſurpation and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy (as has been formerly ſaid) in broaching doctrines of their own, and obtruding on Gods Church <hi>tanquam ſocii non ſervi,</hi> or fellow Maſters, and not faithfull Miniſters, but alſo this shews us their diſſimulation and hypocriſie, giving out themſelves to be <hi>ſocii,</hi> for and with Chriſt (companion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a terme of friendship and familiarity) while as they are indeed foes and againſt Chriſt, imitating herein Satan, whoſe emiſſaries they are; who when he would bring in greateſt darkneſſe tranſforms himſelfe into an Angel of lighr; or that beaſt and Antichriſt ſpoken of in the Revelations and whoſe ſuppoſts they are, who is ſaid to be horned like the Lamb, but ſpeaks like the Dragon.</p>

In which anſwer we have, 1. How he ſtyles her, 2. What he ſayes to her, the firſt part of which is <hi>Hypothetick;</hi> and the ſecond, directory.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtyle which he gives her, we have, 1. Wherefore he praiſes her, to wit, for fairneſs or beauty, 2. In what degree, to wit, the ſuperlative, 3. Among whom, to wit, women.</p>

Not but that the Church and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof has many ſpots and blemiſhes, but he beholds the beauty of his ſpouſe ſo far as ſhe is regenerat, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Heavenly graces, which are his beauty that He has put upon her, as he ſpeaks in <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and his love covers all her other infirmities, as it is ſaid, he ſees no iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor beholds any perverſneſs in <hi>Iſrael, Num.</hi> 23. 21. ſhe is ſo then in his eyes by acceptation being juſtified and ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>2.

feeds his flock, for from the beginning he has ever fed his flock, ſo as his Church has known how, where, and whereby: but yet falſe Teachers have oftentimes ſo farre prevailed, and ſo confidently challenged to themſelves the name and Title of the true Church, and the knowledge of Gods pure worſhip like the Sunne and air in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> has been oft-times ſo obfuſcat and darkned, that the ſimple and poore ſheep of Chriſt have not known almoſt what way to turne them, till in the end they have had here with the ſpouſe their refuge to Chriſt, to be taught and reſolved by him.</p>
                  <p>The next part of his ſpeech to her, is directory, directing her where to go, to wit, by the ſteps of the flock. But ſeeing it is the church which makes this requeſt, that He would ſhow her where He feeds, what flock does he feed beſide His Church? Is not ſhe His only flock? What other flock is this then, whoſe ſteps ſhe muſt trace to find Him, and where he feeds? Indeed the Church is but one in reſpect of the unity of faith and charity, and Chriſt feeds no other flock beſide Her. But in reſpect of the diverſity of times and places, ſhe may be diverſly conſidered, and may be ſaid to be divers flocks: and therefore we muſt obſerve here, that this is the prayer of the Church ever on earth militant, and there be who were upon earth in former time, that are now in Heaven, triumphant, whoſe ſteps notwithſtanding in ſacred Hiſtory yet may be ſeene, and what truth they profeſt, and how they worſhipped God. It is this flock then, that He meanes, of true and faithfull worſhippers and whoſe ſteps he willes Her to follow, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> yet calls to all, ſaying, Follow me, as I follow Chriſt. Alſo it is to be noted that He bids her go forth, Leaving nature, the practice of ſinne, the ſociety of ſeducers, the ſuggeſtion of fleſh and blood. And Next, he bids her feed her kids by the ſhepherds <hi>Tents:</hi> where we have, 1. What is meant by Her kids, 2. What by the ſhepherds and their <hi>Tents,</hi> Firſt then, by kids are meant young and tender Chriſtians, for the goats whoſe young ones kids are, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometime oppoſed to ſheep ſignifie the wicked, yet uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alſo they figured in the Law the godly offered up by mortification as ſacrifices to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.

                  <p n="1">1. Then, ſhe is compared to warrelike horſes in chariots, as, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 7. 9.

                  <p n="2">2.

By her Spikenard its ſending ſorth the ſmell thereof, we ſee that there is no better way to entertain him, than with the fruits, and fragrant ſmell of his own ſaving graces; and therefore it is ſaid, c 4. v. 16, Let my Beloved come into his garden, &amp; eat his pleaſant fruits, ſo that as it is ſaid of the vertuous woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 31. give her of the fruit of her own hands, and let her own works praiſe her; Or, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. of thine own have we given thee: even ſo, give the Lord of the fruit of his own graces planted in thy heart, and let his own work thereof praiſe him.

                  <p>Here the Church profeſtes her ſpirituall comfort which ſhe had in Chriſt and of his death and reſurrection; the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof is like a ſweet odour to a believing ſoul, and which ſhe would be ſo carefull to conſerve, and apply in all eſtates, unto her ſelfe by the work of faith, that all the night time of his life, or of affliction and tentation (noted, by a dark time) ſhe would make Him her continuall joy and comfort, ſolacing her ſelfe in him, <hi>and that he ſhould lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her breaſts,</hi> and conſtantly dwell in her heart, by Faith and true affection.</p>
                  <p>She compares him then to a <hi>bundle of Mirrhe,</hi> or <hi>Noſegay,</hi>

ſuch as is uſually made of moſt pleaſant and ſweet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for delighting ſight and ſmell, and which Maidens did ſet in their boſomes between their breaſt, that ſo they might have the ſweet ſavour thereof alwaies in their noſe.</p>
                  <p>In which word we have 1. how ſhe calls him, 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhe compares him, to wit, <hi>to myrrh and a bundle of myrrh,</hi> 3. to whom he is ſo, to wit, to her 4. where ſhe places him, <hi>between her Breaſts,</hi> and 5. How long ſhall he lye there, to wit, <hi>all the Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then, ſhe calls him her beloved (whereof <hi>v.</hi> 7.) whom for power and authority before ſhe called, a King, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and whoſe power ſhould confound her, if his love did not comfort her; and to whom ſhe againe as a King, owes loyalty and ſubjection, and as her bleſſed bridegoom ſhe profeſſes to him love and affection.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe compares him to <hi>Myrrh,</hi> which was one of the gifts wherewith the wiſe men of the Eaſt honoured Chriſt at his birth, <hi>Math.</hi> 2. &amp; with which &amp; aloes his body alſo was imbalmed after his death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 39. and which likewiſe was the firſt and ſpeciall ingredient of the holy annointing oyle, that vvas appoynted to be made, for annoynting <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Tabernacle with the pertinents thereof, being of a ſvveet and odoriferous ſmell, as the reſt of the ſweet ſpices were of that conpoſition, and whereby is ſignified the ſweet comfort that the Chriſtian ſoul, indued with ſpirituall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, finds in Chriſt cruciſied, to whom ſinne is firſt ſowre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 23.</p>
                  <p>Neither contents ſhe her ſelf to compare Him only to Myrrh, but <hi>to a bundle of Myrrh,</hi> to ſhow unto us 1. the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that ſpirituall comfort that comes from him to a believing ſoul, as a greater ſmell is yeelded by a bundle of ſweet flovvers or ſpices, than comes from a ſingle flovver or a graine of ſpice. As likewiſe to ſhovv 2. that as from every flovver in a bundle, there comes a ſvveet ſmell; even ſo from every thing conſiderable in Chriſt there ariſes comfort whether we conſider his natures or offices, his birth and conception, his holy life, death, buriall, reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſcention, and now his interceſſion at his Fathers right hand til he come againe to judgement. So that as the carcaſe of <hi>Sampſons</hi> dead Lyon was ſo full of Hony, that <hi>Sampſon</hi> did not only eat abundantly thereof himſelfe, but gave thereof alſo to others, <hi>Judge.</hi> 14. 9. ſo is Chriſt Jeſus ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114769:38"/>
full of comfort, that the believing ſoul may not only have enough to it ſelf, but to impart by inſtruction for the comfort of others. 3 to ſhevv that the Church and every true elect ſoul cannot be content vvith a little of Chriſt, but to injoy much of him, and the power of his death and reſurrection, till they fully injoy him in glory, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, vve have to conſider, to whom is Chriſt a bundle of ſvveet and fragrant myrrh, It is to his Church and every godly ſoul, therefore ſayes ſhe, by a ſpeech of faith and application, he ſhall be <hi>to me</hi> a bundle of myrrh: vvherein vve ſee. 1. the Churches holy reſolution, that let others (as it is ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah)</hi> and contemne them as they pleaſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. not knovving his vvorth, being as <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Cock: but as for her, (as <hi>Joſhua</hi> proteſted what he vvould do, <hi>Joſua</hi> 24. 15.) ſhe ſhould hold him in ſingular eſtimation, ſo that he ſhould be to her as a bundle of Myrrh, which ſhe ſhould place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen her breaſts.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſee vvhat is the proper act of faith, to vvit, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſaid, my God and my Lord; even ſo by a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt as her Saviour to her ſoul, ſhe ſaies <hi>He ſhall be to me,</hi> &amp;c. and herein indeed ſtands the very true comfort of a Chriſtian, as in the locks of <hi>Sampſons</hi> hair conſiſted his ſtrength, vvithout vvhich particular application (like old <hi>Simeons</hi> imbracing of Chriſt in his armes,) the ſoul could have no comfort at all, more then the divels, vvho knew him and confeſſes that he is a Saviour, but not to them: and therefore the prophet ſayes, <hi>For unto us a Child is born,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 6. And the Angel in like manner ſaid at his birth, <hi>For unto you is born a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We ſee, that although Chriſt be full of fragrant ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet he is not ſo to every one, eſpecially vvhoſe ſouls are ſtuffed with groſſe humours, or delight vvith the filthy ſvvine in the ſtinking ſmell and puddle of fleſhly luſts but he is ſo only to his ovvn church and true members thereof, vvho being renevved in the inner man, have their ſenſes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe exerciſed, to deteſt all ſort of ſinne, and ſinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as a moſt noiſeſome and ſtinking hemlock, and to eſteem Chriſt only and the graces thot flow from him, moſt fragrant ann delightfull.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the part vvherein ſhe places him, it is, <hi>He ſhall lye between her Breasts,</hi> or to be laid at, or, to her very heart: and indeed juſtly may and ſhould he be laid there. 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114769:39"/>
He is the only true cordiall to a Chriſtian or ſick ſoul: and, 2. becauſe, whereas other bundles of ſvveet Flovvers or noſegayes are ſo kept in the breaſt, by being placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen them; He ſhall be the keeper and gardian of the heart, being placed on or in the heart, and ſo ſhall be <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum pectoris,</hi> as a pleaſant noſegay, <hi>et munimentum cordis,</hi> like a breſt plate of proof, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 84. 11. a decking of the one and a defence of the other, from evill ſuggeſtions, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans wicked temptations, or, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, both a Sun and a ſhield.</p>
                  <p>She ſayes likewiſe, that ſhe will lay him between her breaſts, 1. for remembrance and contemplation that ſhe may have him ſtill in remembrance and before her eyes, to looke upon; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did upon the braſen Serpent; or as the names of the twelve tribes were on the high Prieſts breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate: 2. for delight and conſolation, as for that end, to delight the eye by colour, and comfort the braine by ſmell, maides uſe to put noſegayes between their breaſts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo for ſpirituall delight, as the moſt beautifull object the eye of faith can look upon, and for the moſt pleaſant and ſweet ſmelling or ſavour to the ſoul, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 1.

                  <p>Fifthly, ſhe ſhowes how long He ſhall lye there, to wit, all night: novv by night is underſtood in Scripture, 1. the time of affliction and trouble, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 21. 12: 2. the day of death, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4: and 3. the time of our life here on earth, as it is ſpecially to be underſtood here, ſo called or compared, 1. as the night is darke, and therefore they who walke in the night-time have a Lanthorne carried before them; ſo in this life-time there is darkneſſe of ignorance, and no light have

we to direct our walking that we ſtumble not or fall into ſinne and damnation, but the Lanterne of Gods Word, as the Pſalmiſt ſhews us. 2. The night is the moſt dangerous time for ſurpriſing or robbing by enemies, and therefore they vvatch in the night time; even ſo this life-time is moſt dangerous for ſurpriſing by our ſpirituall enemie, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing us of Gods favour and graces: and therefore we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted ever to watch and pray that we enter not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 3. The night time is melancholious; and ſo is our life, wherein we ſow in teares, 4. The ſtarres ſhine in the night; and ſo ſhould our Chriſtian vertues ſhine.

As the eye delights in light, and pleaſant objects; ſo doth the eye of the ſoul in the light and promiſes of Gods word, and in Chriſt crucified, which is the moſt beautifull object that the eye of faith can fix upon, and who, in the word, is ſet forth, and (as it were) painted before our eyes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. 4. As by the eye we are guided in our walking, and made to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew ſtumbling, falling, or ſuch like dangers, ſo by faith and the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt in his Word, we are guided in our ſpirituall walking and made to eſchew ſtumbling and falling in ſinne and temptations, and ſuch ſpirituall dangers.</p>
                  <p>Next, her eyes are compared to Doves eyes, 1. Becauſe as a Dove's eyes are cleear and ſharp-ſighted; ſo is the eye of faith piercing within the vaile of Chriſts fleſh, while He was on earth and beholding his Deity, and piercing now into the Heavens, where he ſits at his fathers right Hand, and into ſuch divine myſteries and the truth thereof, whereunto the blind eye of nature, nor no other can or ever could yet reach.</p>
                  <p>2. The eye of the Dove is chaſt, and chaſtity is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in virgins; even ſo, that which our Saviour ſo much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114769:42"/>
commends in his Church by this compariſon, who is a pure virgin to Him, is her ſpirituall chaſtity oppoſit to ſpirituall whordome, ſo much complained on and condemned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and whereby, without doting on any other, ſhe keeps her faith, confidence, and affection whole and entire towards him alone, from whom alone ſhe looks for life and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>3. The doves eyes are meek, and not cruell, fiery, or furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; repreſenting thereby that diſpoſition of a Chriſtian ſoul which is recommended unto the ſame by him who ſaid, Learn of me for I am humble and meek.</p>
                  <p>4. The doves eyes are humble, contrary to ſuch lofty eyes as are ſpoken of, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 13. And ſo is the diſpoſition of a Chriſtian ſoul endowed with true faith, though never ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in godlineſs and good works.</p>
                  <p>5. The doves eyes delights in cleanneſs, and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts to white places, and to clear waters; even ſo doth the ſoul that has true faith in it, loathing all uncleanneſs of ſin and worldly luſts, and knowing that no uncleane thing ſhall enter into that heavenly Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly we ſee here, that unto this commendation of her beauty and comlineſs he prefixes, an <hi>Ecce,</hi> or <hi>behold,</hi> which word is uſed in Scripture, 1. As an <hi>Ecce</hi> of admiration, (as, Behold a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a child.) 2. As an <hi>Ecce,</hi> of demonſtration, as, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As an <hi>Ecce,</hi> of conſideration, as, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 12. Behold and ſee if ever there was ſorrow like to my ſorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo when he would ſtirre up the mind to remark and obſerve, ſome rare, excellent and wonderfull matter, and which is alſo ſure and evident; even ſo hereby the Lord would have it obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1. That the beauty of his Church is a rare beauty, as we ſee the ſame deſcribed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 2. An excellent beauty alſo, being ſpirituall, and not ſubject to fading, 3. A wonderfull beauty likewiſe (conſidering her former deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) put upon her by her bridgroom, who has made her ſo as, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14. And 4. Which is ſo ſure and permanent that death it ſelf ſhall not deface it, but rather be the meane of perfecting the ſame in glory.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, he redoubles this commendation of her beauty, ſaying; Thou art fair, thou art fair.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Showing thereby the excellency of her beauty, as when we ſay good, good; or excellent and very good by a uſuall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm, the doubling of the word expreſſing the ſuperlative degree.</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:114769:42"/>
2. To ſhow the aſſurance that He would give her for her comfort, and againſt all doubting in the contrary, that ſhe was fair and beautifull in His eyes, think of her ſelf in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or let others think of her, as they liſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſhe is wholly beautifull, both in ſoul and body, or in the whole man; or that her beauty is twofold, inward in ſoul, and outward in converſation, as the kings daughter, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45. 13. is ſaid not only to be glorious within, but alſo in her rayment without. Alſo, ſhe hath another double beauty; the one of juſtification, the other of ſanctification: both which the Lord joyns, therfore let no man ſeparate them.</p>

                  <p>Here the church returneth the praiſe of beauty to him who had in the former verſe aſcribed it to her, as if ſhe would ſay, that he is rather only worthy ſo to be called, being ſo, 1.

Next, not contented to call him fair, ſhe calls him alſo pleaſant or comly, as having ſeemly proportion with the brightneſs of colour, which makes up the perfection of beauty, which perfection our Saviour has, 1.

1. He is both owner and builder of this, 2. He is both builder and buyer, 3. The ſtones whereof this houſe is built are living, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. 4 As he is the builder, ſo himſelf is both foundation and corner-ſtone, 5. Himſelf is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweller, and no other by elocation, as ſome are. 6. He is ever preſent in, and with his Houſe; and, 7. No time can make this houſe decay, no fire conſume it, nor ſtorme over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the parts of this Houſe here mentioned, are beams which are ſtrong and laid in walls, as we ſee ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in buildings, and rafters which are leſſe in quantity, and for another uſe; and whereby are underſtood the diverſe office-bearers, and other members of the Church of Chriſt: Some ſtronger, as thoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. who are called pillars, and upon whom the weighty burden is incumbent in church or common-wealth. And others againe weaker gifted or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and in meaner and more private ſtations, as we ſee in the parable of the talents, ſome having more, ſome fewer, and ſome but one talent, and who had moſt, having moſt to count for, and who ought not deſpiſe thoſe, who had fewer neither thoſe who had the feweſt, to envy with an ill eye ſuch as had moſt, but to be carefull to gaine proportionally.</p>
                  <p>Next, as the beams are made ſtrong, not for themſelves, but for the ſupportation of other parts of the houſe, as the floores and ſuch like; even ſo the ſtronger in Chriſts church have their ſtrength not only for their own ſtability, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for the good of thoſe who are weaker: as it was ſaid to <hi>Peter, tu converſus confirma fratres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover as beams and rafters, and ſuch other parts in a Materiall houſe although divers in ſtrength and for divers places and uſes in the fabrick, yet have all a firme connexion amongſt themſelves to make up one compleat ſtructure: even ſo in Chriſts church though there be divers members, diverſly gifted, and placed, as we ſee in the members of the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14.

                  <p>Thirdly the matter whereof thoſe parts are, and from which they are ſo commended, is, that the beams are of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and the rafters, (or as Some expound, the galleries or

walks) of firre, alluding, as ſeemeth, to that of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 15. where both theſe ſorts of timber are mentioned, whereof that Temple was built, and both grew in <hi>Lebanon, 2 King.</hi> 19. 23. and were of greateſt account. And firſt the Cedar, in that ſame place, and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17. 22. is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, 1.

The Cedar is ſaid to caſt forth his roots ſure, for withſtanding rooting up by any wind or violence, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. denotating thereby, the ſtability of God's Saints, who build upon the rock. 3. The Cedar is called Excellent, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 15. and ſo are the godly called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. in reſpect of grace, and their new birth. 4. The Cedar-wood was moſt durable, and therefore the Ark, and orher parts of the Tabernacle, was made thereof; and ſo are the godly by grace, againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing corruption here, and fitted for eternall glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 5. The Cedar-tree was ſuch a one, as brought forth fruit, as we ſee, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17. 23. and ſo are the godly, fruitfull in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and good works.</p>
                  <p>Next, her rafters, or galleries for walks, are ſaid to be of Firre; which, beſides that it is likewiſe a tall, ſtreight, and durable ſort of tree, it has theſe two properties: 1. It is alwaies green in winter, as in ſummer; and ſo are the godly, in ſtedfaſt confidence by grace, alwaies vigorous, without decaying or falling away from Chriſt and his truth, as well in adverſity as proſperity. 2.

                  <p>But it may be asked, why ſhe ſpeaks of the beams and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not of the walls of this houſe? I anſwer, If theſe parts made of timber or wood, be ſo firm and durable, then the firmity, durableneſſe, and ſtrength of the reſt, as the walls, which are made of ſtone, is out of all queſtion; and ſo this houſe, in all the parts thereof, is ſo durable and ſtrongly built, that the very gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, ſeeing the Church ſpeaks here, how ſaies ſhe, <hi>(Our houſe)</hi> being her ſelf God's houſe? I anſwer, She ſpeaks

this, in the perſon of the mother of the family of God's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who make up this houſe; and as Chriſt's Spouſe, who by that myſticall and matrimoniall union with him, hath likewiſe a communion with him in all which is his, as there is a threefold communion between married perſons, of hearts in affection, of bodies in fruition, and of goods in poſſeſſion.

                  <p>Firſt then, he is compared to a Roſe, and then to a Lilly; a Roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> or the field, and a Lilly of the Vallies.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sharon</hi> was a very fruitfull and fair field of paſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof we read, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 29. and when the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth deſolation to the Land, he ſaies of <hi>Sharon,</hi> as of the moſt fruitfull part thereof, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33. 9. that <hi>Sharon ſhall be as a wilderneſſe.</hi> And on the contrary, when he promiſes to bleſſe the Land, to the comfort of his People, that ſought him, he ſaies, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65. 10. that <hi>Sharon ſhall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which flowers, whereunto he is compared, we will conſider conjunctly and more generally; next, ſeverally, and more particularly.

As flowers ſpring, fade, and ſpring up again the next year; ſo Chriſt <hi>nativitate floruit, paſſione exaruit, ſed reſurrectione nunquam ampliùs moritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus refloruit.</hi> 3.

Next to conſider them ſeverally, 1. The redneſs of the Roſe may ſignifie to us (as we ſee alſo, <hi>Iſay</hi> 63. 1, 2.) the blood ſhed of Chriſt in his paſſion, which he ſhed violently, frequently, univerſally and aboundantly to purge us, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to us an eternall inheritance, 2. The Roſe has many prickles with it; and ſo, many are the troubles of the godly who are in Chriſt and get him, but he delivers them out of them all in the end, 3. Roſes diſtilled afford a moſt ſweet and cooling liquor; ſo does Chriſt crucified, and meditated upon, in the ſoul, moſt ſweet comfort, and cooling to a weary and ſcorched conſcience, 4. As, being conſerved and otherwiſe made uſe of, and applyed, it is very cordiall and medicinall even ſo is Chriſt, laid hold on by faith, applyed, and kept: in the ſoul, the moſt ſoveraigne cordiall thereof, and medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to the ſickneſs of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now he is called the Roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> or of the field, to ſhow;</p>
                  <p>1. As flowers, and ſuch ſpecially, are the beauty of the field; ſo is Chriſt the beauty of man-kind, and glory thereof, beyond the Angelicall nature, by aſſuming our nature in his perſon, and ſeating it in glory at the right hand of the father, 2. As ſuch Roſes that grow in fields are not planted by man, ſo neither was Chriſt planted as it were, by man in the womb of the virgin, but conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, 3. As the Roſe in the fields is open to winds, plucking, treading on, and ſuch like; ſo was Chriſt on earth to many ſorts of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53. 4 As there is patent acceſſe for any to ſuch Roſes, ſo is there to Chriſt to any humble and believing ſoul, being like <hi>Manna, and the braſen Serpent,</hi> 5. As the Roſes of <hi>Sharon</hi> were counted the faireſt and moſt fragrant or excellent, ſo is Chriſt Jeſus the moſt excellent fragrant and faireſt amongſt men; and, 6. As <hi>Sharon</hi> was a place of paſture, ſo in ſuch places Chriſt is to be found, as we may ſee, <hi>Cant. 1. 7. Joh. 10. Rev.</hi> 2. 1. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he is called a Lill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Perfect and, 4. Communicative, and Holineſs it ſelf, and no other ſo, (2.) As a Lilly is ſoft and ſmooth, ſo was Chriſt meck and mercifull to the moſt bruiſed reed &amp;c. (3.) It is for divers uſes medicinall, both mollifying and mundifying, &amp;c. And ſo is Chriſt, by his blood and ſpirit.</p>

Next he is called a Lilly in the vallyes, 1. To denotate his own humiliation of himſelfe from the higheſt Heavens to the valley, as it were, of loweſt humiliation in his birth, life, death and buriall, 2. To ſhow us where he is to be found, to wit, in the vallyes of humble hearts, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 57. 15.</p>

To ſhow that as the Lords clothes the Lillies of the field, ſo does he care for his Church and clothes her with his righteouſneſs and garment of Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>It is to be remarked alſo, that he ſpeakes but of one Lilly, but many thorns; not only thereby to ſhow the unity of his Church, though being many members, yet making up but one myſticall body, but alſo the paucity of the godly in reſpect of the wicked; for which cauſe our Saviour ſayes that many are called but few choſen, and that his flock is but a little flock.</p>

                  <p>As He ſet forth her praiſe that She excelled all the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as farre as the Lilly did the thornes; ſo ſhe ſets forth his here, that he excelled all the ſonnes of men as farre as the apple tree excells all the reſt of the common trees of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Which allegory ſhe proſecutes ſhowing what worthy benefits ſhe received from his goodly apple-tree, including them all under theſe two, 1. His ſhaddow, the quality where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo delightfull, that ſhe ſat downe under the ſame; and, 2. Fruit, the quality whereof in like manner was ſo ſweet unto her Mouth, that ſhe did taſte thereof and eate of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>She had before, c. 1. v. 13, 14. compared him to a bundle of ſweet Mirrh, and a cluſter of odoriferous Camphir, both excellent in ſmell, but had not fruit nor ſhaddow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now ſhe compares him to an Apple-tree that afforded unto her both theſe, thereby ſhowing unto us that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſt is ſo great, through the plenty and variety of all grace and comfort that are treaſured up in Him, that no one thing or few, whereon we can fix our conſideration, though never ſo good or excellent, can ſufficiently or fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that all-ſufficiency and full ſtore that is in him, but what ever is good, delightfull, or praiſe worthy in every thing, is all collectively and in the higheſt degree or meaſure, and in the moſt excellent manner, to be found in Him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then ſhe compares him to a Tree, planted by the hand of that Heavenly husbandman, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1. in the earth of our Humane nature, who brought forth much ſweet and comfortable fruit in his life time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 25. And therefore (as trees in the winter ſeaſon ſeeme to be dead) he in his paſſion being deſtitute as it were of leafe and fruit, gave up the Ghoſt and died, but yet, as trees in the ſpring revive, ſo did he after his lying a few dayes in the grave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and riſe gloriouſly, and aſcend to the Heavens thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſpicuouſly, where he ſits at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that Tree of life in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. whoſe leafe and fruit is medicinall.</p>
                  <p>And more particularly ſhe compares him to an apple-tree

commended in Scripture by three things ſpecially, 1. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruit, 2. Comfortable ſhaddow: and, 3. Sweet ſmelling.

In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſhaddow, of refreſhing conſolation and powerfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, having compared Chriſt to an apple-tree, ſhe proſecutes the allegory, ſhowing what excellent benefits ſhe received from him; which ſhe comprehendeth under theſe two, to wit, his ſhaddow which did delight her; his fruit which did refreſh her; under the one whereof ſhe ſat, and of the ſweetneſs of the other ſhe did taſte.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we will ſpeake of this His ſhaddow, 2. Of the Churches ſitting under it; and, 3. Of her delight in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we read of a twofold ſhaddow, the one is, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other is divine and heavenly: the worldly is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which worldlings do ſhelter themſelves, as confidence in earthly things with the rich fool, and that whereof <hi>Job</hi> makes mention, <hi>Job.</hi> 20. 5. as of a thing ſpeedily evaniſhing, ſhort, and but for a moment: therefore it was ſaid to that fool, This night thy ſoul ſhall be taken from thee. The like whereof we ſee in <hi>Balthaſar, Haman, Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Of this ſhaddow therefore of divine refreſhment and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection doth the Church ſpeake, which has theſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, 1.

                  <p>Next, ſhe ſayes that ſhe ſat downe under this ſhaddow, which ſignifieth her reſting and acquieſcing there, or her making abode under the ſame, as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 1. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going furder, or elſe where, and ſhewing hereby that the godly find in Chriſt and his death and ſatisfaction, ſuch a treaſure and ſufficiency of comfort in any trouble, or diſtreſſe outward or inward, that they ſeek no furder, to any creature in Heaven or Earth, more then <hi>Naaman</hi> did to any other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Jordan,</hi> to be clenſed of his leproſie; and therefore are not like fooliſh Idolaters, who will not reſt in Chriſts merits or Satisfaction, but will joyne their own or others; and not invocate him alone, but Saints and Angels, nor relye upon the purging vertue of his blood allaverly but will imagine to themſelves another fiery purgatory; and ſo as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. they multiply their own ſorrowes, and continue ſtinged with theſe ſcorpion's tailes mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 5. And having wearied themſelves in ſuch labyrinths can never find ſolid eaſe or comfort, till they come to this ſhaddow and ſit downe there and reſt under the ſame, as he invites all weary ſinners to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſhe ſayes, ſhe ſat downe with delight, and with a great delight, under this his ſhaddow, which delight of hers was not carnall or ſinnefull, ſuch as the delight is of the wicked or worldlings, but a holy and a ſpirituall delight, like the joy, whereof David ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 7. Or like his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that he had in Gods Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. and 119. 70. Alſo in doing his will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. and in the comforts of his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 19. and 119. 92. Which like a ſhaddow refreſh't his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>This delight is, 1. A ſure and well grounded delight not on a ſandy foundation, 2. This delight comes not from fleſh or blood, but from a higher ſource, 3. This delight is a great delight, becauſe of the greatneſs of the benefit which the ſoul receives, 4. This delight is durable, and as the abode is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114769:49"/>
under the ſhaddow of the Almighty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91. 1. So abides the delight; and, 5. This delight is the pledge and forerunner of that full and eternall delight which the ſoul ſhall have in Heaven, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken of her ſitting under his ſhaddow with great delight, followes to ſpeake of his fruit, and the quality or ſweetneſs thereof to her taſte. Of which fruit we have to conſider, 1. What the ſame is and the variety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 2. The aboundance or plenty; and, 3. The dureableneſs or perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>2. Next, we have to ſpeake of the ſweetneſs and quality of this fruit, and, 3. To whoſe taſte it is ſo Sweet, to wit, unto hers only, who is the ſpouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then by <hi>his fruit</hi> is underſtood no other thing but the ſweet comforts which we find in him, as the hony which <hi>Sampſon</hi> found in his dead Lyon, and which is only to be had in, and from this Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Which fruits are, 1. Of ſuch variety, as that the meditation of his nature, his offices, conception, birth, life, death, buriall, reſurrection, aſcenſion, ſitting at the right hand of his Father, and coming againe to Judgement, all afford unto us ſtore of ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; likewiſe his poverty, his meekneſs, his pitty, his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his readineſs to cure all that came unto him, his acceſſe, his affability, and all his holy vertues yield unto us not only fruit of example for imitation, but of ſweet comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
                  <p>2. The plenty of this fruit is ſo great, that he is like that tree ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 4. 12. whereof it is ſaid, that all fleſh fed thereof: therefore doth the <hi>Prophet</hi> invite all who have a ſpirituall appetite to be partakers of the good things of Chriſt, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 55. 1. And himſelfe ſayes, <hi>Come to me all yee that are weary and loaden, and I will refreſh you,</hi> There is then plenty of ſweet fruit in him to all the world to be found, and (as of the five loaves and two fiſhes) aboundance to leave over, ſo that the deficiency may be on our part, as it was in the widdowes veſſels for receiving more oyle, that we in like manner want the hand of faith and the veſſels of prepared hearts, but there is no deficiency on the part of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. The durableneſs and perpetuity of this fruit, is ſuch that, 1. This tree never ceaſes, as is ſhowne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. to bring forth the ſame, and to yeeld the ſame to us, as well in the winter ſeaſon of ſharp adverſity and in greateſt plenty, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114769:50"/>
in the ſummer ſeaſon of peace and proſperity. 2. As alſo, the perpetuity of this fruit is ſuch, that it endures unto life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; and therefore it may be ſaid of it, as our Saviour ſpeaks to the Samaritan woman, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. Whoſoever ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Next, this fruit of his is called <hi>ſweet,</hi> both becauſe it is ſo of it ſelf, like <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s and <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s honey, whereof each of them taſted. And 2. becauſe it ſweetens alſo unto us all bitter things, which would be ſo otherwiſe, like that Tree which was caſt into the waters of <hi>Marah;</hi> even all our beſt actions, to make them of a ſweet reliſh and ſavoury to God, which would be otherwiſe but counted ſoure grapes, and menſtruous clouts; and all croſſes and calamities, which are bitter to fleſh and blood, yea death it ſelf, and the grave; all which it ſweetens unto Gods children.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, to whom, or to whoſe taſte is this fruit ſweet? ſurely to none but to the godly; therefore ſhe ſaies, that <hi>his</hi> fruit was ſweet unto <hi>her</hi> taſte. It is therefore ſweet unto her for theſe reaſons: 1. Becauſe of the ſweetneſſe that it has in it ſelf, as hony, ſugar, and the like. 2. In reſpect of the great deſire, and ſpirituall appetite, that ſhe has towards the ſame, which makes even that which is very coorſe, and has ſome bitterneſſe, or no taſte at all, ſweet to one that is hungry; where on the contrary, to a cloyed ſtomack, even <hi>Manna</hi> it ſelfe was diſguſtfull. 3. In reſpect of the ſpirituall ſenſe of taſting how good the Lord is, which thoſe that are carnall and unregenerate have not, being dead in their ſins, and not endued with the new life of grace, and therefore has not the new ſenſes of the ſoul, which the godly have.</p>

for, of this Tree it is onely true, which is ſpoken of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. that <hi>it is good for food, and pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe.</hi> And therefore mad fools are they, who will not come to this Tree of life, to which the way is now made ſo patent, that they may eat thereof, and live for evermore.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The fruit of this Tree is not onely, 1. profitable for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food; as alſo, 2.

                  <p>Here is ſhewn a further favour by Chriſt to his Church, which is, a royall feaſting of her: whereby we ſee, how the Lord never wearies, to heap his favours, and increaſe her graces to his own, and as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 10. to keep
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114769:51"/>
for them the beſt laſt: O that we did not weary in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in his ſervice and thankfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the words we have 1. a banqueting-houſe mentioned; 2. that ſhe was brought in, into this banqueting-houſe; 3. that it was he that brought her in; and 4. what was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played over her, after her bringing in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, a banquetting-houſe is mentioned, which in the Originall is a houſe of wine, as <hi>Aſſuerus</hi>'s banquet was called a banquet of wine, ſhowing thereby, that the fruit which Chriſt beſtowes upon his Church, is not onely like that of the apple-tree, ſweet and delightfull to the taſte; but alſo it is yet more excellent, like the fruit of the vine, whereunto he is alſo compared, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1. which far exceeds that of the apple-tree; becauſe, beſides that it is 1. pleaſant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; it 2. quenches alſo; and 3. cheereth, or maketh joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6. as alſo, 4. it comforts the ſick, by cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and augmenting the vitall ſpirits, and ſo is cordiall and medicinall.</p>
                  <p>Next, for this houſe whereinto ſhe is brought, we muſt underſtand, that as in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, or <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Tabernacle, there were three rooms, ſo are there in God's great houſe: For, 1. His great Hall, or outer court, is the whole world, wherein are all men and creatures brought in. 2. His Parlour, or more inner room, is the viſible Church, profeſſing Chriſt's name in common. And 3. His Chamber of preſence, or moſt inmoſt room, is the ſociety of the Elect, where he banquets their ſouls with that hid Manna, and ſuch dainties as are mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61. 5. and in this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5; and in compariſon whereof, all that ever was moſt exquiſitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, either for, or by Princes, in their greateſt ſtate, or (as <hi>Heſter</hi> 1. 4.) to ſhow the riches of their glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and honour of their excellent Majeſties, is but traſh and droſſe; theſe dainties being heavenly altogether, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the ſoul unto a heavenly, bleſſed, and an eternall life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 51. Which banqueting-food hath theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby it excells all other: 1. It's quickning, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 57. 2. Though it be ſweet and delicious, yet it is no waies ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, but whereof the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke may be ſaid, <hi>qus plùs ſunt potae plùs ſitiuntur aquae.</hi> 3. It is durable in the vertue and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, unto eternall life, whereas that of the other food ſoon decaies, which makes us ſo oft renew our meales. 4. This not onely quickens and giveth life, but it likewiſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114769:51"/>
keeps and preſerves from death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 41. And 5. the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and delicacy of this, in compariſon of other things, that are ſweeteſt to worldlings, makes the ſoul to diſguſt and vilifie ſuch traſh, as husks fitter for ſwine, than true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſaid, that ſhe was brought in into this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting houſe, not being able of her ſelf otherwiſe to come in; and therefore ſaies our Saviour, <hi>Joh 6. No man commeth unto me, except the Father draw him;</hi> there is ſuch blindneſſe in our minds, ſuch averſneſſe in our wills, and ſuch perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our affections, that till we be reſtored, as it were, to our limbs, we are like that paralytick, that lay ſo long at the waters of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> or that creeple, who ſat at the porch of the Temple, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. altogether lame and impotent: And therefore ſaies <hi>David, I will run the way of thy commandements, when thou haſt enlarged my heart, Pſal.</hi> 119. 32. and the Spouſe likewiſe, <hi>Cant. 1. 2. Draw me, and then we will run after thee.</hi> And untill which time that he do ſo, and work in us both the will and the deed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. we can no more ſtir to enter into this banquetting houſe, or be joyned to his true Church as a lively member, more than <hi>Lazarus</hi> could come out of his grave, till he was raiſed by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, that it was <hi>He</hi> that brought her in, that is to ſay, the King, whom ſhe mentions <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 12. and of whom <hi>David</hi> ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es, <hi>Pſal. 73. 23. Thou holds me by my right hand,</hi> ſhewing thereby, the great honour that he beſtowes on his Church, and every true member thereof, letting them not in as a ſervant, but bringing them in by the hand as his ſpouſe and beloved, and, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Conducting them by his counſell, till he bring them to his glory, Pſal.</hi> 73. 24. which indeed is a far greater honour than <hi>Haman</hi> vaunted of, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 5. 12. or that <hi>David</hi> offered unto good <hi>Barzillai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe we are to conſider, the great odds between him, and his bringing in of her to his banqueting-houſe, and others, or the bringing in their gueſts to their banqueting-houſe. For 1. They whom others invite and bring in, may be yet unwilling to have been brought in; but he makes ſuch willing whom he brings in, <hi>operatur enim &amp; velle &amp; perficere.</hi> 2. He can alſo give them an appetite. 3. What he gives them is not onely meat, but medicinall, and ſuch dainties as are ſpoken of before. 4. He can make that which they get, digeſt and nouriſh them, that they may be ſtrengthened and grow thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:114769:52"/>
Fourthly, we have what was diſplayed over her: 1. a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and what this banner was, to wit, <hi>Love.</hi> In Scripture then we find a threefold banner, at three ſeverall times diſplayed, whereby the laſt onely is ſuitable to this banquetting-houſe; the firſt may be called, <hi>vexillum honoris,</hi> diſplayed in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, wherein was manifeſted God's power and wiſdome; the ſecond may be called, <hi>vexillum horroris,</hi> diſplayed on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in that terrible manner of giving of the Law, whereby was manifeſted God's power and juſtice; and the third may be called, (as here) <hi>vrxillum amoris,</hi> diſplayed by the preaching of the Goſpell, and whereby is manifeſted his wiſdome and mercy, or the work of that matchleſſe love, which he ſhewed to mankind; which love of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a banner,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of manifeſtation, that as a banner raiſed up in an Army on high, is viſible to all, ſo was his love, chiefly, when he was lift-up on the Croſſe, like that braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the wilderneſſe, and is ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of diſtinction, for what is it, but the love of Chriſt to the godly, that makes them differ from others, or ſeperates them from the world here in converſation, or ſhall hereafter in their condemnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of collection, or gathering to Chriſt, which is onely by the diſplaying of the banner of Chriſt's love, whereby his ſouldiers are as it were gathered together, and come to his Colours; and therefore ſaies the Lord by <hi>Eſay</hi> to his Church, <hi>Iſa. 49. 22. I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and my ſtandard to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſons in their arms, and thy daughters upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of protection and victory, for as a banner ſet up upon the walls, or diſplayed over a houſe or city, is a ſigne of defence and defiance to the enemy, or as an enſigne of victory; even ſo the Lord's love to his Church, is that wherein her protection ſtands, and defiance of her ſpirituall and other enemies, over whom he has been, and ſhall be ſtill victorious; and that his Church is his victorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, recovered from Satan's tyranny, like the Lamb out of the Lion's mouth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In reſpect of terrification, and therefore the Church is ſaid to be terrible, as an Army with banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 10.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114769:52"/>
and indeed, nothing is ſo terrible to Satan and Antichriſt, as the diſplaying of the banner of Chriſt's love, by the true preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In reſpect of union, which a banner makes, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of any company or reigment, whereunto they all come, who are of ſuch a ſociety, making up ſo a compact and well ordered body; and unto which union of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves in love, nothing is ſo forcible, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the banner of Chriſt's love ſpread over them.</p>
                  <p>This banner was diverſly diſplayed: 1. Before and under the Law, by obſcurer promiſes, typicall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> prefigurations, and propheticall predictions, more involvedly, and leſſe clearly. 1. Under the Goſpell, more clearly and fully, firſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell, by Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, and thereafter by all faithfull paſtours and preachers of the Word, and ſhall be ſo to the worlds end.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Seeing Chriſt not onely feeds, but with moſt heavenly dainties banquets his Church, and every true member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let us not be like thoſe ungratefull deſpiſers of ſo great a benefit, as is made mention of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. nor prefer ſuch baſe things thereto, but come with the banqueting garment of a holy diſpoſition, ſuitable for ſo high a calling; and as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. banquet him mutually with the fruits of his own heavenly graces, as the Church invites him to ſuch, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing we cannot come into this banquetting-houſe of our ſelves, except we be brought in by the guidſhip of the Spirit of God, and the powerfull work of his grace upon our ſouls, Let us earneſtly implore the ſame, and pray that he would, as <hi>David</hi> ſaies, hold us by the right hand, conducting us by his counſell, till he receive us to glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Church ſaies, <hi>He brought me in,</hi> and again, <hi>His banner over me was love,</hi> emphatically, ſo expreſſing what the Lord had done to Her, paſſing by the fallen Angells, upon whom he had not ſhowne ſuch mercy, nor deigned them with the like favour, which ſhould therefore move Man, whom he has ſo freely loved and honoured, the more to love him, and honour him again.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This introduction of his Church into his banquetting-houſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114769:53"/>
here, is a pledge and earneſt of his introduction of her into his banquetting-houſe in heaven hereafter, and manſion place of glory, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. and 73. 24. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us ſtrive to get this earneſt, and firſt-fruits; elſe, if we enter not in at the gate of grace on earth, let us never think to enter in at the gate, which may be called, as <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 2. the beautifull gate of glory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Chriſt's love diſplayed over us here in this life, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Banner, which is uſed onely in warfare, to ſhew, that the ſtate of his Church here on earth, is militant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is exhorted, and every true member thereof, to put on the whole armour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 11. that they may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devill, and <hi>verſe</hi> 18. praying and watching with all perſeverance, till they may ſay in the end, I have fought the good fight, and have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed my courſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. or, as the Prophet ſaies, My war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is accompliſhed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40. 2.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Seeing a banner is ſet up over any place, in token of the defence of that place, and defiance to the enemy, Chriſts love therefore being this banner over his own; let us then above all things ſeek it earneſtly with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. and then we may be ſure of defence, as he ſaies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and as is ſhown unto us, <hi>Prov. 3. 24.

                     <p n="7">7. Doth Chriſt diſplay his love both to us, and for ſo many comfortable ends and uſes over us? then let us be aſhamed not to love him again, <hi>ut totus nobis figatur in corde, qui totus pro nobis fixus fuit in cruce,</hi> and to diſplay our love towards him, that is, to manifeſt the ſame by our obedience, to his holy commandments.</p>

                  <p>Here is a wonderfull effect of theſe former things, whereof ſhe ſpake: ſhe compared Chriſt before to an apple-tree, whoſe fruit was ſweet to her taſte; and ſhewed, that he brought her in into his banquetting-houſe, or houſe of wine, and his banner over her was love; hereupon then ſhe ſhowes, that her heart is ſo raviſhed with love towards him again, that ſhe is love-ſick, and ready to ſwound therewith, and therefore cries out to be ſtayed with flaggons, and comforted with apples.

                  <p>Firſt then, ſhe ſeeks to be ſtayed with flaggons, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the houſe of wine, whereinto ſhe was lately brought. 2. To be comforted with apples, having relation to the apple-tree, whereto ſhe had before compared him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt conſider: 1. what is meant by theſe flaggons, and how ſhe is ſtayed therewith; and 2. what is meant by theſe apples, and how ſhe is comforted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, flaggons are mentioned, becauſe at banquets, wine was diſtributed and brought in, by ſuch, as we ſee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 2, 3. Alſo by flaggons is underſtood, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain figure of ſpeech, the wine contained in them, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20. the Cup is taken for the wine contained in the cup; and by this wine again in theſe flaggons, is meant the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall comforts contained in the Goſpell, or Word of God, and promiſes thereof, that are onely able to cheer up a ſick and dejected ſoul, or wounded conſcience, as <hi>David</hi> clearly confeſſeth, ſaying, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts have rejoyced my ſoul, Pſal.</hi> 94. 19. And again, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe thy law had been my delight, I had periſhed in mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> This is therefore that ſoveraigne balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> thoſe ſtill and cooling waters whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 2. and like that wine and oyle, poured in by the loving Samaritan, into the wounds of the wounded Iſraelite; or that cheering liquor and flaggons ſpoken of here, whereby
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114769:54"/>
the ſainting ſoul is ſtayed from falling into deſperation, and powerfully comforted, ſtrengthned, and eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe ſhe ſpeakes of <hi>flaggons,</hi> to ſhow wherein theſe comforts are to be found, to wit, not in that gilded cup of the Popes decretals and mens traditions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. wherein onely is the giddy wine of ſpirituall fornication, wherewith that Whoore of myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> made drunk the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers of the earth, but in the flaggons of the old and new Teſtament, or written word of God, which is that <hi>Pedum et virga</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 23. 4. The two witneſſes, the two Olives, and Candleſticks ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that ſtand before the God of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4. and that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> whereon the Church is built, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. beſide which if any, though an Angell from Heaven, ſhould preach any other Doctrine of faith and manners, Let him be accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe deſires to be comforted with Apples, by which apples is meant nothing, elſe, but that which we ſhewd already is meant, v. 3. by the fruit of the apple-tree which was ſweet unto my taſte, and here, with the fragrant ſmell whereof ſhe deſires to be comforted, and ſo the ſame being both for taſte and ſmell cordiall and comfortable, whereby is given us to underſtand the excellency of Gods word, and that it delights not only one of the ſpirituall ſenſes of the ſoul, but likewiſe all of them, being light to the eye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſick to the eare thereof, delightfull to the touch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſweet to the taſte, and comfortable to the ſmelling, 2. By theſe flaggons, or wine therein, and by theſe apples, the ſtaying of her by the one, and comforting of her by the other, is likewiſe repreſented unto us the diverſe operations of the word of God upon the godly ſoul, ſtrengthning the weake, confirming the ſtronger, enlightning the blind, quickning the dead, reclaiming the ſtrayer, guiding the ignorant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the doubtfull, making wiſe the ſimple and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operations, which we may ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. and 119. and here, ſtaying them that are ready to fall, comforting the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, and as, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 8. rejoycing the heart, ſweeter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo then hony and the Hony-comb.</p>
                  <p>2. Having ſpoken of that which ſhe ſeeks, we come next to conſider from whom ſhe ſeeks ſo to be ſtayed with flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and comforted by apples: where we find that the Church in this her ſoul-ſickneſs ſpeakes to her friends in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114769:54"/>
plurall number to whom are committed the myſteries of the Goſpell to manifeſt, and the banner of Chriſt love to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, and to whom in <hi>Peters</hi> perſon, he ſayes to all and every one, <hi>Paſce oves meas.</hi> Theſe then by office being the ſtewards of the Lords houſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. under whoſe hand to divide aright and diſtribute, are the childrens bread and theſe flaggons and fruits, therefore ſhe deſireth them that they with the comfortable doctrines and promiſes of the Goſpell applyed to her conſcience and preſent eſtate prudently, would uphold her now ready to ſwoon, and ſo languiſhing for love: for by theſe, as nurſes, the Lord will have his children nouriſhed with the ſincere milk of his word, that they may grow thereby, by them as ſtewards he wil have them fed in his family, by theſe as teachers he will have them to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>Diſciplinated</hi> in his ſchool, and by theſe as ſpirituall Phyſitians he will have them lanced, bound up that are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted, cared for, cured, and comforted with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls of his word.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, and laſt of all, we have the reaſon why ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be thus ſtayed with flaggons and comforted with apples, and this is, becauſe ſhe was ſick of love, that is, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing with deſire to injoy the comfortable preſence and comforts of her beloved, and as love is one of the ſtrongeſt affections, ſo is the ſickneſs that comes of it, the ſtrongeſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oreſt afflicter of any, as we may ſee, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 1. and therefore the Greek <hi>Septuagint,</hi> has, <hi>wounded of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed there are two ſorts of the ſoules ſickneſs, the one common to all, but the other proper to a few: the firſt is a ſickneſs of ſinne, whereof all are ſick naturally, but (alas) all are not ſenſible, and this came from Satan to us, and the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and this ſickneſſe is unto death<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Spirituall and Eternall: the ſecond is this love-ſickneſs, whereof too few are ſick, and the church is here ſenſible of; and this comes from God and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and this ſickneſs is unto life, arguing the ſpirituall life of grace to be in the ſoul here, and that the ſame ſhall live the life of glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This ſpirituall love-ſickneſs, (as other naturall love ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) has, 1. A preceeding ſight and knowledge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon loved, beholding in his word, and by the eye of faith ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten a ſight how amiable and lovely Chriſt is to the Soul, which ſo works on her affection (as we ſee, <hi>c.</hi> 5.) that ſhe cannot ſufficiently expreſſe his praiſe and commendation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:114769:55"/>
2. This love-ſickneſs has a continuall longing and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing till ſhe injoy him whom ſhe loves, as <hi>Amnon</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed till he injoyed <hi>Tamar,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> longed till he injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rachel:</hi> therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaid, that as the Hart panted after the water-brookes: ſo did his ſoul, till he ſhould come and appeare before the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he deſired to be diſſolved, that he might be with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. To the love-ſick party, till this injoying be, no other thing can give content or ſatisfaction; and even ſo, neither to the love-ſick ſoul, till ſhe injoy Chriſts preſence, againe after a ſpirituall deſertion, can any earthly thing afford her reſt or comfort; ſhe being therein like <hi>Rachel</hi> that could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, till ſhe find him againe whom her ſoul loves, as we ſee, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 2. 4. and 5, 6, 7, 8. and as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, till ſhe be reſtored againe to the joy of her ſalvation here, and at laſt be brought to that fulneſs of joy which is in his preſence, and pleaſures evermore.</p>
                  <p>4. One that is love ſick, thinks on the party continually, yea the ſame ſo takes up his thoughts, as talk with him of any other purpoſe or party, and it is, as with one abſent; even ſo is it, with the ſoul that is love-ſick of Chriſt; and 5. Such a one is reſtles, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was, till he got <hi>Naboths</hi> vinyard, till they get and enjoy whom they do love; and even ſo is the ſoul till it injoy Chriſt.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Whereas the church having received of Chriſt's fruit which was ſweet to her taſte, and of his wine in his banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houſe thereof, which did cheer or rejoyce her Heart, cannot content therewith, but does here deſire to be yet more ſtayed with flaggons, and comforted with apples; we ſee, that the godly can never enough be ſatiate with grace and the ſweetneſs that is in Chriſt, having once truly taſted thereof, and therefore we ought to try if this be our diſpoſition, and thereby if we have gotten true grace to be true members of Chriſt's church; which if we have, then aſſuredly this is a ſure token thereof, that we will have a further deſire to grow therein.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Whereas ſhe deſires to be ſtayed with flaggons, we ſee wherein ſolid comfort in all our ſoul-faintings or ſpirituall ſwoonings is only to be found, to wit, in Gods word, the old and new Teſtaments: which whoſoever leave, to ſeek comfort in any other doctrine or dotages of mans invention or fooliſh ſuperſtition, they leave the fountaine of living waters to dig unto themſelves broken ciſternes that can hold no water.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Seeing her ſpeech is directed to her friends, in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, and not to her beloved husband, in the ſingular, which friends are the paſtors of the Word, to whom is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ordinary diſpenſation of the word of comfort, as apples of Gold with pictures of ſilver, ſpoken in ſeaſon to a perplexed ſoul, therefore both their perſons ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, and loved for their works ſake, and much more the word which they preach, remembring that who heare them heares him that ſent them, and who deſpiſes them deſpiſes him that ſent them, as the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not raigne over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let Paſtors alſo for the performance of this Miniſtry of comfort, furniſh themſelves with theſe flaggons and variety of the word of comfort, that in all purdence and plenty they may come to love ſick-ſoules, with the bleſſing of the Goſpell of Chriſt, that, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, the care that hears, may bleſſe them, <hi>Job.</hi> 29. 11. 13. The bleſſing alſo of them that were ready to periſh may come upon them, and they may cauſe the wearied heart to rejoyce and ſing for joy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let alſo thoſe who are comforted and raiſed up by their word remember, that the comfort it ſelf, comes mainly from Chriſt who is the true vine able only to afford the cheering liquor thereof, and the apple-tree which produces the ſweet fruit thereof, and that theirs is only the externall miniſtry or exhibition, but his only is the inward efficacy and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo from him chieſly the ſame may be ſought, and to him for the ſame the praiſe may be given.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We ſee what prudence Paſtors ſhould have, and not ever to be ſonnes of thunder, or as upon <hi>

                     <p n="8">8. From the reaſon which ſhe gives of her deſire to be ſtayed with flaggons, and comforted with apples, becauſe ſhe was ſick of love, we obſerve that it is not uncouth to ſee the deareſt children of God to be ſubject to ſpirituall ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, faintings and deſertions, as we ſee, <hi>c.</hi> 3. 5. and here; and to be ſenſible, ſorrowfull and ſolicitous therefore. Yea I may ſay, happy are they who are ſo ſoul-ſick, and moſt erronious is the blind worlds judgment of ſuch, who think them the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Her ſickneſs is here called, love-ſickneſs, in reſpect of the vehemency thereof, where with ſhe was inflamed: where we ſee not only whereon, or on whom the love of every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul is ſet, but that their love of Chriſt is not a lukewarme love, but a fervent love kindled by the fire of Gods ſpirit, and joyned with a fervent zeale of his glory, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him to all things, and the love of his truth, yea to their very lives which is not deare to them, in compariſon of him, or it, when they are called to hazard the ſame for his name.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. It is ſhe only who is thus love-ſick, that calls for theſe flaggons, and apples that are mentioned, to ſhow unto us, that ſuch only hunger and thirſt after the word of God, and to theſe only the ſame is ſweeter then hony and the Hony comb, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſhews; and therefore it is no marvell to ſee a Soul wherein the love of Chriſt was never yet ſetled, to have ſmall or no appetite to the word of God, or delight therein.</p>

                  <p>Here is a charge given, but whether by the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, or by Chriſt concerning his Church, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters varie, and it is not ſo eaſily diſcuſſed by the Hebrew Text; where the word, <hi>My Love,</hi> is of either gender: Some therefore expound it, That the Lord Jeſus charges the falſ members of his Church, not to trouble her peace (compared to a ſleep or reſt, whereinto ſhe is fallen, in his arms, as it were, after her ſwooning) by their ſchiſm, hereſies, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Some others again expound it, That the Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found ſuch tender care and love ſhown unto her by Chriſt, charges her true members, (called, <hi>The davghters of Jeruſalem)</hi> that by any unchriſtian behaviour of theirs, or ſinning, they provoke not Chriſt, or grieve his Spirit, and thereby interrupt this ſweet fellowſhip, and cauſe him to depart, and withdraw his comfortable preſence (which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe found) from her. And to this ſenſe agrees our Engliſh Tranſlation, ſaying, <hi>I charge you, that ye stir not up, nor awake my Love, till he pleaſe;</hi> that is, not at all, as we ſee by the like ſpeech uſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 23. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
                  <p>In the words then we have, 1 A charge. 2 To whom it is given. 3 Whereby they are charged. And 4 What to do.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, in the words we have a charge given by the Church, to all her true members, which is of greater enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, than to exhort or require, which imports both authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thoſe who do charge, as we ſee, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. and the duty of obedience in them who are charged. The Church therefore having authority as a Mother, from Chriſt her Husband, ſhe charges her children, who owe obedience to her, to behave themſelves ſo, as He be not, nor his Spirit, grieved, by their bad behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this charge is given to the daughters of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:114769:58"/>
where we muſt note, that it was the manner of old, that the Bridegroom had young men to be his companions and friends, which are in this ſong Chriſt's faithfull Paſtors, as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> tearmeth himſelf one of his friends: As alſo the Bride had Virgins to be her companions and followers, with whom in this Song Chriſt's Spouſe is ſaid to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, and are here called, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem:</hi> Daughters of one father, and one mother, to whom they owe, as children to parents, love, honour, and obedience; and being ſuch daughters, they are ſiſters amongſt themſelves, as they are called, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 8. whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h imports love; and being daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that implies peace, the ground whereof is love; as <hi>Abraham</hi> argued, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. to ſhow what ſhould be ſeen amongſt true Chriſtians, even love and peace, as the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1. Therefore we ſhould try our ſelves hereby, if we be the true diſciples of Chriſt, and labour to have love in our hearts, and then eaſily we will incline to peace; otherwiſe there will be ſeen nothing but diſcord upon light occaſions; and if we bite and devour one another, we ſhall be conſumed one of another; and if notwithſtanding we ſay that we love God, we ſhall be found lyars, as Saint <hi>John</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are charged by the Roes and Hindes of the field, which beaſts are mentioned, when love is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended between man and wife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5 19. that as the males and females of theſe beaſts, do delight and dearly love one another, and where ſuch love is, there is a care not to ſtir up to wrath, and to move departure one from another; even ſo the Church adjures her true members by theſe, that they may ſo delight and dearly love Chriſt, who hath ſo loved them, that they ſtir not him up, in anger, to withdraw his comfortable preſence from her, the proof whereof ſhe had ſo lately found. Or they are charged by the Roes and Hinds of the field, not to ſtir up her Beloved, becauſe theſe beaſts are moſt tender, ſcarre, and ſooneſt afraid or ſtirred up, by any noiſe or tumult.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that which they are charged to do, is, that they ſtir not up, nor awake her Love, till he pleaſe, that is, by their ſinning againſt him, or by their unchriſtian carriage, they grieve not his Spirit, (as we are exhorted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30.) nor ſtir him up to wrath.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two ſorts of perſons, whom we ſhould be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114769:58"/>
loth to ſtir up to wrath: 1. Great perſons, in regard of the power of doing us evill; and herein the motive is Fear. 2. Good perſons and liberall, in regard of their bounty, and doing us good; and here the motive is Hope: But in this her Beloved, both are conjoyned, for he is of greateſt power both over ſoul and body, as alſo of greateſt bounty in gifts, both ſpirituall and corporall, temporall and eternall; who alſo in all our wayes, muſt be our guide and counſellour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24. in all our dangers and ſtraits, our guard and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; in all our croſſes, our chiefe and onely comforter; and in death it ſelf, and after, our onely conſtant, and beſt friend and rewarder. To ſtir him up then to wrath, whoſe wrath is ſo dreadfull. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31. and of whoſe favour we ſtand more in need, than the Tyrians did of Herod's, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 20. is great madneſſe; and to grieve him, who in all our griefs muſt be our comforter and eaſer, and ſaver from eternall grief and torment, is great ingratitude and folly.</p>
                  <p>Next, to know how he is ſtirred up or grieved, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; It is, in a word, by ſin, and 1. as Great, which ſort of perſons are ſtirred up and offended, when any indignity is done to them; and thus is God offended, when by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſinners, or Satan's temptations, (like our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) the treacherous counſell of his or our enemy, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his wholſome and good counſell. 2. As Good, our offending of him ariſes from that, which has an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy unto his Nature of holineſſe; and this is when we ſin, ſpecially in ſuch clear light, and againſt light, cuſtomably and preſumptuouſly, ſtubbornly and impenitently.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect that the Church here, chargeth ſo her true members, we ſee her authority, that ſhe ſhe has from God, and for God, for which therefore we ſhould reverence her, and obey her; which if any ſtubborn child of hers will not do, by our Saviours commandment, he is to be held as a heathen and a publican.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing her true members have their denomination from love and peace, therefore they ſhould bend all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to maintain theſe holy vertues among themſelves, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing the contrary; ſeeing God their Father is the God of peace, Chriſt their Redeemer is the Prince of peace, the work of the holy Ghoſt is grace and peace, the Church is <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Seeing this is her charge and chief care, in retribution, as it were, of all the love and kindneſſe that ſhe has found of him, not onely, not to ſtir up her beloved her ſelf, but alſo to exhort and charge others, not to do the ſame; this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us in like manner, in retribution of all his love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that he has beſtowed on us, either in <hi>re,</hi> or <hi>ſpe,</hi> what like care we ſhould have, not onely not to offend and ſtir him up to wrath, by our own ſinfull life and converſation, but likewiſe, as we are exhorted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11. to reprove ſin in others, and to exhort them ſeriouſly to forbear the practiſe thereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In that ſhe charges them not to ſtir up her Beloved, we ſee the proneſſe of the beſt by nature, to ſtir up the Lord to anger by ſin, and therefore we ſhould the more warily look to our waies, and watch and pray, that we enter not into temptation.</p>

                  <p>As between two betrothed Lovers, when the ſpring comes, the man calls and invites his future Spouſe, to come forth out of the houſe, wherein ſhe has remained in the winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they may walk together abroad, and take delight, and ſolace themſelves now with the flowers, and thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things which the ſpring doth afford: Even ſo the Church, in the reſt of this Chapter, is by her Beloved invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called upon, to ariſe from all carnall ſecurity, and forſake the love of this world, to follow him in the faith and love of the Goſpell, and to view and delight her ſelf with the variety of theſe heavenly comforts, and ſpirituall graces, which, like a pleaſant ſpring, the ſame doth afford.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, in theſe words we have, 1 Whereby he calls or invites her, to this participation of his graces, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delight thereof; to wit, by his voice, which ſhe diſcerneth to be his. 2 After what manner he comes unto her, to wit, readily and ſpeedily, overcomming all impediments, leaping over the mountains, and skipping over the hills.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the Lord Jeſus doth call his choſen by his Word externally, which is his Voice, as he ſales, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 3

                     <p n="1">1. From the manner of Chriſt's exhortation to his Church, to ariſe from ſecurity, and that earthly diſpoſition ſhe was in, by ſo loving a compellation of her, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, calling her his Love, and fair one, and not chiding her for her lazineſſe, and worldly mindedneſſe; we ſee the admirable indulgence of ſo meek a Saviour, who doth as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 9, 10. and as <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. As a father pittieth his children, who pittieth them that fear him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee, that the imperfections that remain in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, diminiſh not the love of Chriſt to them, nor makes them deformed, or loathſome in his eyes, for he calls them his love and fair one; which teaches us: 1 To imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our Maſter herein, that though we behold ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in thoſe, who profeſſe the truth with us, yet that we ſhould not deſpiſe, or uncharitably judge them; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look on the good that is in them, and for that eſteem and dearly love them. 2 This ſerves for our comfort, in time of Satan's tempting us, by reaſon of our ſins, and many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and to magnifie his love towards us, who howſoever we be ſo of our ſelves, yet he in mercy and love, (which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers many infirmities) eſteems otherwiſe of us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By this exhortation, to ariſe and come away, we ſee, That the beſt are regenerate onely in part, and that a lump of naturall corruption remains in them, which makes them cleave to the earth, and ſit down as it were in the world, and on the love thereof, not conſidering, that we are but pilgrims therein, whoſe time is both ſhort and uncertain; and though worldlings find no taſte in ought but the world, yet we ſhould not do ſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. It is not enough to ariſe from ſin or ſecurity, or to wean our affections from worldly things; but we muſt alſo come away, and cleave to holineſſe, and ſet our affections on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and ſuch as are above.</p>

                  <p>Here we have the Allegory, under which the Lord doth perſwade the Church to ariſe and come away, out of the eſtate of ſecurity, and from the love of earthly things, to the delight and deſire of heavenly, which is taken from the time of the year, and change thereof; from a cold winter, wherein all things lie as it were dead and barren, ſo that no pleaſure is to be had then in things that grow, unto a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſpring, wherein all ſuch things ſpring forth, and bud again: The deſcription of which ſpring-time, he makes from theſe five things: 1 That flowers appear. 2 That birds ſing. 3 That the voice of the Turtle is heard. 4 That the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs.

                  <p>By which two ſeaſons is repreſented unto us, both what is the eſtate of all the Elect, before their effectuall calling, and what the ſame is thereafter, when they are regenerate: Before their calling, their hearts are even like the earth in winter, under cold forſts, hard and indured, dead and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and liable to the ſtormes of God's wrath and anger; but after they are called, and that they begin to be regenerate, a ſtrange change is wrought in them, from worſe to better; for then, through the influence of grace, and that Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, their hearts are chawed, ſoftned, and warmed with his love; the dew of grace deſcends upon them, as dew came down on <hi>Gideon</hi>'s fleece, when the reſt of the earth was dry; the ſweet flowers of heavenly graces do alſo bud, and in their variety appear; there is joy then of the holy Ghoſt, and peace of conſcience, repreſented here by ſinging of birds, and voice of the Turtle; and fructifying in a holy life and converſation, expreſſed by the fruit of the fig-tree, and grape of the vine.</p>

                  <p>8. The dove is ſwift in fleeing, as we ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55. 6. and ſo is Chriſt church by faith and devotion, pearcing the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and as the dove carried the Olive branch, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Ark, when the raven abode without, even ſo the godly have peace and grace here, and are aſſumed to glory hereafter, when the wicked are left out.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe is called, <hi>his dove</hi> 1. By creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 11. 2. By purchaſe or redemption, 3. By the fathers donation, (whereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9) 4. By confaederation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23. and 5. By matrimoniall conjunction, whereby ſhe ſayes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 3. I am my welbeloved's, and he is mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the place where ſhe is ſaid to be, is, in the clifts of the rock and ſecret places of the ſtaires: by which rock is no other meant but Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, ſo called by <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 62. 2 &amp; 81. 21. and by <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 2. 45. Upon whom whoſoever builds, he is only wiſe, and againſt ſuch, the gates of Hell ſhall in no wiſe prevaile. And which rock is neither a dry rock but like that in the wilderneſs which guſhed forth abundantly with refreſhing water, for which cauſe the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſayes, that, <hi>that rock was Christ, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Neither is it a barren rock, but like that whereof <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Job.</hi> 29. 6. which poureth forth rivers of gladning oile unto us, and plenty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, <hi>Petra caelestis (caducum enim terrenum omne) quae et ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum fundamentum edificanti, et ſecurum m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Next by the clifts of this rock, Some do underſtand, the Lords eternall counſell and election of his owne; wherein as in a moſt ſure rock the ſalvation of the Church reſts, knowing that (as our Saviour ſayes) it is impoſſible that the elect ſhould periſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Others underſtand hereby that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Lord's, over his owne; whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32. 7. And our Saviour, ſaying of his ſheep, I give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand, My father alſo that gave them me is greater then all, neither ſhall any pluck them out of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114769:66"/>
my Father's hand. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 29. And, I and my Father are one. Others, and that moſt rightly, underſtand, with <hi>Bernard,</hi> by the clifts of this Rock, the wounds of Chriſt, and merits of his precious bloodſhed: which, like ſo many clefts, or hollow places, were opened upon the Croſſe, and whereunto every chriſtian ſoul, in the time of an accuſing conſcience, and Satan's purſuit by temptation, (who is like a greedy Kite or Hawk) by the flight of faith, may have her recourſe. <hi>In his enim</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>ſe columba tutatur, &amp; circumvolitantem intrepidè intuetur accipitrem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By the ſecret place of the ſtaires (as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 1.) is meant the Lord himſelf, who is the hiding and ſecret place of his own, as we have him ſo called there, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 7. and 84. 11. Unto whom the hunted and haunted ſoul, by Satan's tempations, looks up; and by faith, or a holy confidence, as by the degrees of ſtairs, aſcends, and abides under the ſhadow of the Almighty, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, He is my refuge and my fortreſſe, my God, in him will I truſt.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſpoken of the Church her ſtyle and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the place of her abode, followes to ſpeak of that, whereunto ſhe is exhorted, which is; 1. to ſhew him her face. 2. to let him hear her voice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, His deſire to ſhow her face imports, that ſhe had hid the ſame from him. Now perſons uſe to hide their face; 1 Out of ſhamefacedneſs, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> hid her face with a vail, when ſhe firſt ſaw <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was to be her husband. 2 Out of ſhame for faults committed, and humility, as the Publican, and Prodigal. 3 Out of fear, like <hi>Eliah</hi> and the Prophets, who hid themſelves in caves, for fear of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s perſecution.</p>
                  <p>The hiding then of her face here, is out of a holy and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like ſhamefaſtneſſe; as alſo out of the conſcience of her own guiltineſſe, (whereof the godlieſt have reaſon to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) and a fear alſo of her ſpirituall and perſecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which make her to have her recourſe to theſe clifts of the rock, there to hide and ſecure her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Next, he deſires to hear her voice. Now there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold voice which the Church uttereth; one to Man, which is, of preaching or inſtruction; another before Man, which is, a vowed confeſſion; and the third (which is ſpecially meant here) is her voice to God, which is prayer and ſupplication,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114769:66"/>
which delights the Lord, rejoyces the Angels, vanquiſhes Satan, eaſes the conſcience, benefits the ſoul, averts judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and procures bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Where we haye to remark, that the ſaies, <hi>Let me hear thy voice,</hi> ſhowing thereby, that it is to him onely that ſhe ſhould put up her prayers; for, as the Pſalmiſt witneſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 2. it is he onely who heareth prayer, and therefore to him ſhall all fleſh come; as he commandeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. And this honour, being a jealous God, he will not give unto any other.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, the reaſon is ſubjoyned, why he deſires her to ſhew him her face, and to let him hear her voice; for, (ſaith he) <hi>ſweet is thy voice, and thy face comely;</hi> thereby the more powerfully to induce her ſo to do, and to remove out of her mind any impediment, that might ariſe from the ſenſe of her own deformity, or unworthineſſe; to wit, that her face was not worthy to be ſeen by him, in whoſe ſight the very heavens are not pure, and before whom the very Angells ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not, but with their faces covered; hers being ſo ſpotted and unclean, as with the Leper under the Law, ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to cover her lips, and to cry, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, unclean:</hi> As alſo, that her voice was in like manner unworthy to be heard, being but mournfull and melancholious, and more fit for a ſolitary deſert, with the Turtle, than to be heard in his ear, who has planted the ear, and to whom in the higheſt, the Angelicall quires ſing <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all theſe he ſweetly and comfortably anſwers, That howſoever ſhe is in her ſelfe, or ſeems ſo to her ſelfe, yet in his ſight, who ſo has loved her, her voice is ſweet, and her face is comely. We have then to conſider, what makes her voice and her face ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then her voice is ſweet, in its riſe or fountain, to wit, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 26.) when it ariſes from the Spirit of God, and motion thereof on the ſoul. 2 From a ſight, ſenſe, and ſorrow for ſin, in a broken heart, and contrite ſpirit, whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3 When it is uttered in ſaith, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and humility. And 4 when the main end thereof is, God's glory, and the ſoul's ſalvation; and all is offered up to God in Chriſt, through his merit and onely mediation: Then are our prayers like incenſe, and the lifting up of our hands as an evening ſacrifice; and then is the Church's voice ſweet, or, as the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>like the offerings of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114769:67"/>
Judah and Jeruſalem, which were pleaſant to the Lord, Mat.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Her face is comely;</hi> whether the face of the body be meant, when it is like <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, when ſhe did waſh Chriſt's feet, all blurred with the tears of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which like pretious ſeed ſhe is ſowing, that ſhe may reap in joy; or when it is like <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 136. when he did not onely waſh his bed with his tears, but ſhed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of tears for the ſins of others. Or whether the face of the ſoul be meant, when it is ſtamped with his image, and made comely by his beauty of holineſſe, (as he ſpeaks by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) which he put upon it, <hi>Ezek</hi> 16. 14. Any, or all theſe wayes, the face of the Church, and every true member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſaid to be comely in the ſight of Chriſt.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Whereas the Church is called a dove, it teacheth all her true members, what ſhould be their diſpoſition; as hath been already ſhown, in the nature and properties of the Dove.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee, by her being in the clifts of the rock, her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her ſelf to withſtand her ravenous enemies, and that her onely ſtrength and ſafety conſiſts, in her recourſe to her Rock, Chriſt Jeſus, and in making him her hiding place and refuge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Her being in the clefts or narrow places of this Rock, ſhowes plainly, that thoſe who would have ſafety by Chriſt, and the merit of his bloodſhed, or tuition from him, they muſt not be big-ſwoln with the opinion of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or merit; for ſuch can never enter in at rifts, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row clifts of a rock, or at a narrow way, which onely leads to ſalvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 53. but the humble and poor in ſpirit, for to ſuch onely, as ſaies our Saviour, pertaines the kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Seeing the Lord ſaies to every true member of his Church, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, &amp;c.</hi> what incouragement is this to come to him by prayer, to obey and ſeek after ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Caller upon us, and not go with Romaniſts to Saints and Angells, as mediators for us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſee, when the Churches voice is ſweet and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and her face comely, even when ſhe is in the clefts of the rocks, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſmelled ſweetly in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſight, when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114769:67"/>
he came cloathed with his elder brother's garment: they onely then are acceptable to God, both their perſons, and their prayers, &amp;c. who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We ſee, what incouragement this is unto us, to pray and praiſe the Lord, ſeeing he tells us, that ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable is the voice of his Elect, when in theſe holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, they utter the ſame before him.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If our voice be ſweet unto him, O how ſweet ſhould his voice, in the miniſtry and exerciſes of his Word, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as <hi>David</hi> profeſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and 119.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If the face of his Choſen be ſo comely and beautifull in God's ſight here, O how comely and beautifull will it be, when it is free from any ſpot or leaſt wrinkle here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  </div>

                  <head>Verſ. 15. Take us the Foxes, the little foxes, that ſpoile the Vines; for our Vines have tender Grapes.</head>
                  <p>Here is a charge given, and the reaſon thereof rendred; in which charge we have, 1 who gives it; 2 to whom; and 3 what is the charge it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, it is Chriſt, the Maſter of the Vineyard, who gives the charge, as he calls Himſelf, the Maſter and owner thereof, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. and is declared to be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe to whom the charge is given, are Paſtors and Princes, or Miniſters and Magiſtrates; the one armed with the ſpirituall, the other with the civill Authority, both being from the Lord, and both here to be imployed for the Lord, againſt the enemies of his Church; the one to act his part, <hi>praedicando;</hi> the other his part, as <hi>Deut. 13. 5. puniendo;</hi> the Miniſter drawing his ſword, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. by convincing the hereſie; the Magiſtrate his ſword, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. by coercing the heretick, and as the Miniſter of God, taking vengeance on evill doers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the charge it ſelf, is, to <hi>take the foxes,</hi> even <hi>the little foxes;</hi> where we have to conſider; 1 who are theſe foxes, and why ſo called; 2 who are theſe little foxes; and 3 how they ſhould be taken.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, by theſe foxes, falſe Teachers are underſtood, the worſt ſort of enemies that the Church has, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114769:68"/>
onely here mentioned; this we may ſee to be clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 4. where the Lord ſpeaking of falſe Prophets, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their own ſpirit of errour, ſaies, <hi>O Iſrael, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deſerts:</hi> and who therefore are thus compared;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In compariſon of their ſubtlety and craft, by making a ſhew of truth and piety, as <hi>Herod</hi> did of worſhipping Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15. when they go about to advance the myſtery of errour and iniquity, and, as our Saviour ſaies, comming in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly being nothing but devouring woolvs; which ſubtlety they have from that great Fox, the Devill, who winded himſelf craftily in credit with our firſt parents, as their friend, when he proved their greateſt foe; and who can transform himſelf into an Angell of light: And therefore no marvell, that his miniſters imitate him, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 15. Amongſt which foxes, the great Romiſh Fox is the principal, and therefore figured out to us by that Beaſt in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that was horned like the Lamb, but ſpake like the Dragon; and whoſe emiſſaries likewiſe, the Locuſts of that bottomleſſe pit, have mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and womens hair, declaring thereby, their fair and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pretences; but they have Lions teeth, and Scorpions rails under theſe, deſtroying ſimple ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fox is not onely crafty, but cruell, and blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the blood of the flock; therefore <hi>Herod</hi> is called a fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 32. alſo <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 1. 10. And ſo is that Roman fox cruell, and ever has been, againſt the Saints of God; and therefore is called that ſcarlet whore, that is drunk with the blood of the Saints, and of the Martyrs of Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. And ſo likewiſe are all the foxes, his emiſſaries; witneſſe the many, partly performed, and partly intended maſſacres, of the profeſſors of the truth, their bloody Inquiſition, and league at the Councill of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fox goes never ſtraight forward, but <hi>tortuoſis incedit amfractibus;</hi> or by crooked windings, <hi>&amp; in cavernoſis latitat amfractibus;</hi> and he lurketh in ſuch places: Even ſo theſe forenamed foxes, walk not with a ſtreight foot in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, nor followes the ſtreight rule thereof; but in crooked windings, and by-waies of errour, and human traditions, not leading to God by Chriſt, but by Saints and Angells their mediation; nor to his merits onely and ſatisfaction, but to others, or their own in purgatory, &amp;c. and uſing all deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114769:68"/>
of error to compaſſe their ends, and advance their power and pride.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The time when they ſpecially invade, is the night, when all are aſleep, both ſhepherd and ſheep; even as in like manner we ſee that while the ſervants were aſleep the envyous man ſowed his tares amongſt the good ſeed: even ſo there do theſe foxes ſpecially invade Chriſts flock to catch them as their prey, and by their diveliſh doctrine to deſtroy their ſoules, when either they find a flock without a paſtor at all, or when they find a ſleepy idol, and ſlouthfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and an ignorant flock: but on the contrary, where a well inſtructed people are, who know Chriſts voice and can diſcerne it from a ſtranger, as we have it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. And where ſuch a paſtor is, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or thoſe to whom the Angel appeared and annunced Chriſt's birth, who were watching carefully their flocks in the night, there theſe foxes dare not come, nor cannot prevaile.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Fox, eſpecially in his hole, is a vile ſtinking beaſt, and ſo what has been the vile ſtink of theſe Romiſh foxes, from their great one to the leaſt, in their lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in their cloiſters, Nunneries, and other places, let their Popes lives and others of their owne Regiſters teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by theſe little Foxes, are underſtood falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who ſubtilly and by degrees bring in errors in the Church, and therefore even in their beginnings and firſt bud when they ſeeme to be but little hurtfull or dangerous, are to be adverted, and taken heed unto, as hurtfull enemies to the Lords vines. Theſe are they who privily (ſayes <hi>Peter)</hi> were to bring in damnable <hi>Hereſies, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 1. and who were doing ſo even in the very <hi>Apostles</hi> times, who were moſt watchfull: for even then the myſtery of iniquity was working as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7. ſetting downe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 18. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. The reaſon why ſuch little foxes ſhould be in their very beginnings curbed and taken, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives; ſaying, For they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe unto more ungodlyneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16, 17. and their word will eare as doth a canker, of whom is <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> little foxes even in <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes. The proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of likewiſe Chriſt's church too truly found, in the <hi>Method</hi> of introduction of <hi>Idololatreia,</hi> by bringing in, firſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thirdly, theſe foxes are to be taken, as the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> in like manner tells us, ſaying, But theſe as naturall brute beaſts are made to be taken and deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. But how and by whom? doubtleſſe, as has been already ſaid, both by faithfull Miniſters, and zealous Magiſtrates, the one by the ſword of the Word ſtrongly confuting their <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and by Excommunication caſting them forth of the Church: and the other if they yet continue obſtinate and infeſt the vines, by civill and corporall puniſhment catching and deſtroying them, leſt they deſtroy the vines that have but tender grapes, that is, ſeduce ſimple ſoules while they are as yet but only young and weake.</p>
                  <p>But why ſaith Chriſt, Take <hi>us</hi> the foxes, and not ſimply, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ake the foxes, or particularly take me the foxes, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, take us the foxes? I anſwer, 1. This is to ſhow, that the taking of theſe foxes redounds both to Gods glory and his Churches good, and therefore whoſoever is negligent in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his duty, Miniſter or Magiſtrate, he neither tenders Gods glory, nor his Churches good, 2. This is likewiſe to ſhow for the Churches great comfort, that Chriſt and ſhe have common friends and foes.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, the reaſon of the taking theſe foxes, is, their ſpoiling of the vines, by which are underſtand the members of Chriſt's church, againſt whom theſe foxes do ſet themſelves for hurt; compared here unto vines, <hi>Iſay. 5. Pſal.</hi> 80. as elſe where frequently in Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. &amp;c. For the reaſons following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The vine is called noble, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. So are the godly, and Gods Church beyond all other ſocieties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It has not outward beauty, but is full of inward ſap; ſo neither has the Church, like that whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. But is beautifull within, through the aboundant ſap of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is weake, and therefore needs under-propping: and ſo is the Church of her ſelf, but is under-propped by Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5.</p>

get that comfortable embracement ſpoken of, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, He whom ſhe ſeeks, is he whom her ſoul loves; which words ſhow unto us two things: I What was the main motive, that made her ſo to grieve at his abſence, and makes her ſo to long and ſeek for his preſence: It is love, and a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant affection from her very ſoul towards him, the want whereof, where it is in the ſoul of any, there will be no ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or true ſeeking after the Lord, as may be ſeen in the practice of the moſt. 2 This ſhowes, that although to her preſent feeling, ſhe ſeemed to be forſaken of the Lord; yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and truly ſhe was not ſo, becauſe her love towards him abode in her heart, which love of God in the heart of his Elect, is a fruit and effect of his love towards them; and ſo long as the one continues towards him, as ſurely doth his love and gracious preſence continue and abide with them, though not alike felt; but in the ſecret work of his ſaving grace, which makes them to ſeek him, and a more plentifull and perfect ſenſe of his comfortable preſence, than for the preſent they can find.</p>
                  <p>The way or manner how he is to be ſought, whom the Soul loveth, is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Timely, which <hi>Eſay</hi> calls, While he may be found, and is neer. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55. 6. Therefore alſo ſaies he, With my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 9. And ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaies the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. In their afflictions they will ſeek me early, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Truly, or ſincerely, which the Scripture calls, With all the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. and not feignedly drawing neer with their lips, when their heart is far from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 2. Of which ſort of ſeeking, the Lord complains by his Prophet, that his people continued in their ſins, and yet (ſaies he) they do ſeek me daily, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Uprightly, that is, for himſelf, and not like the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naits, of whom our Saviour ſaid, Ye ſeek me not, becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled, <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 26. or, as one ſaies very well, Like thoſe who ſeek not Gods face, but his fingers-ends; and like cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Paſtours, who ſeek not the good, but the goods of the flock, far from the Apoſtle's practiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fervently, and not with a faint deſire, but with the whole benſell of the ſoul, as <hi>David</hi> thirſted for the waters of the well of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> or, as he ſaies, As the Hart pants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114769:74"/>
the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God. And again, O God who art my God, early will I ſeek thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land where no water is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Humbly, as <hi>Daniel</hi> profeſſes, ſaying, and I ſet my face unto the Lord God to ſeek him by prayer and ſupplications, with faſting and ſackcloth and aſhes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 3. And as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſought the bleſſing from the angell, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 12. 4. by teares and ſupplication; and as <hi>

                  <p n="6">6. Diligently, as the whoriſh woman profeſſeth that ſhe came forth, diligently to ſeek his face whom ſhe loved, and had found him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 15. or as <hi>Herod</hi> deſired the wiſe men to ſearch diligently for the child, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 8. as <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> alſo ſought out <hi>Paul</hi> at Rome very diligently till he found him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. and the woman ſought her loſt peece of ſilver diligently till ſhe found it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 8. For it is only ſuch ſeekers to whom the promiſe of reward is made, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhowes, ſaying, that the Lord is a rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Carefully and ſorowing, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſought him with great care ſorrow and ſolicitude, till they found him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three dayes ſeeking, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 46. 48. in the Temple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Doctors, and as we ſee here with what care, and queſtioning the ſpouſe ſeeks her beloved, yea not onely with care, but as is ſaid, v. 48. ſorrowing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Prudently as well as painefully, where he is to be found, to wit, as ſhe is directed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the means of grace, or, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, in the Sanctuary and law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 2. and 119. 115. or Temple, where Chriſt was found by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and, as he tells himſelf, where he walkes in the midſt of the Golden candleſticks <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Conſtantly, not by a fit, but with the ſpouſe here till he be found, without looking back with <hi>Lots</hi> wife; and farre leſſe fainting and turning back, as many do, like the dog to the vomit or the ſow to the puddle; and as thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 66. who went back from Chriſt, and walked no more with him.</p>
                  <p>For the performance of all which former points in the right ſeeking of the Lord there muſt be a preparation of the heart, which was the praiſe of good king <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> that he had prepared his heart to ſeek God, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3. This being a task of no ſmall difficulty to do it aright, and of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114769:74"/>
which is life everlaſting, <hi>Amos.</hi> 5. 6. As alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may know if we have ſought God aright, 1. If (as <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9.) we ſeek after good and abhorre evill, 2. If we ſeek things above as, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. And 3. If we ſeek the good of Sion, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 9.</p>
                  <p>4. Fourthly, the time when ſhe ſeeks him, is the night, which is a dark, ſilent and Melancholious time, thereby to ſhow, 1. What a time it is to the Soul when ſhe is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſerted; ſurely, as <hi>Ioel</hi> ſpeakes, a time of darkneſs and of gloomineſs, a time of Clouds and of thick darkneſs, a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate night, <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. 2. wherein the ſoul is like <hi>Rachel</hi> for her children that would not be comforted; all other things, in like manner till ſhe find her beloved, being to her like <hi>Iob</hi> friends miſerable comforters, or like the white of an egg wherein there is no taſte at all.</p>
                  <p>2. This ſhowes the great love and deſire ſhe has of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Chriſts preſence, that although the night be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for reſt, yet ſhe cannot reſt, but with <hi>Iſay</hi> ſhe may ſay, O Lord I have waited for thee, <hi>Iſay</hi> 26. 8, 9. The deſire of my ſoul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee, with my ſoul I have deſired thee <hi>in the night,</hi> yea with my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me will I ſeek thee early. She cannot then tary till it be day, neither can ſhe have patience (as one might think) till he come to her, but her affection and deſire is ſo fervent and flaming towards him that worldlings do wonder at the ſame, and they think Gods children in the fit of this love-ſickneſs, as <hi>Festus</hi> thought <hi>Paul,</hi> that too much zeale and devotion hath made them mad, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 24. and therefore as, I <hi>Pet</hi> 4. 4. They ſpeak evill of them, and of the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thinking it rather ſtrange that they ſhould not runne with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot, as themſelves do.</p>
                  <p>5. Fifthly, the place where ſhe ſeeks him is her bed, a wrong place indeed, fitter for carnall eaſe and ſleep, and therefore he was not found there, till ſhe aroſe from that place, and rouſed up her ſelf from that carnall ſecurity wherein ſhe lay before, and whereby ſhe had loſt her welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and ſought him (as we ſee hereafter) more painfully and carefully elſe where. It was the error of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the other <hi>Mary,</hi> that they ſought the Lord Jeſus where he was not, as the Angell told them, He is not here, for they ſought him amongſt the dead, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 6. and ſo as it is the Churches error here to ſeek her welbeloved in her bed, ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114769:75"/>
it is the error of many to ſeek the Lord Jeſus in the midſt of carnall pleaſures, worldly eaſe; or to think that he can be found in a dead ſoul, and lulled aſleep in carnall ſecurity: to whom I may ſay, he is not there, but, as the Angell ſaid, He is riſen; ſo they who ſeek him rightly, muſt likewiſe riſe with him. As He did from the grave, ſo they from the bed of a ſlumbering ſecurity with the wiſe virgins, and from a ſluggiſh and tepid ſeeking of him, to a zealous, carefull, and painfull ſearch for him; for as his worth is who is ſought, ſo muſt the care and paines be accordingly to find and injoy him. As <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſayes of wiſedom, If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt for her as for hid treaſures, then thou ſhalt underſtand the feare of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. and <hi>find</hi> the knowledge of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44.</p>
                  <p>6. Laſt of all, the ſucceſſe is this, <hi>ſhe found him not,</hi> the reaſon whereof is, 1. As the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, Yee pray and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not, becauſe yee pray amiſſe; even ſo ſhe ſought and found not, becauſe ſhe ſought him as yet but laſily and amiſſe: and therefore if we would find Chriſt, we muſt not only ſeek him, but ſeek him aright; as in all the exerciſes of religious duties, the work wrought, or <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> muſt not be ſo much taken heed unto, as the manner of performance, or <hi>Modus Operandi,</hi> elſe as <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iſhed all night and catcht noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo may we ſeek Chriſt long enough, and yet in no wiſe find him. 2. The Lord will not at firſt be found of his owne, whoſe very ſoules love him, not for any want of love or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on his part towards them againe; but, 1. For the tryall of their Faith, Love, and Patience, 2. To make them more earneſtly ſeek after him, asking, ſeeking, and at laſt knocking, or like the Canaanite being importunate, and with <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaying, I will not let thee go except thou bleſſe me: and, 3. This is to make them have the greater account and more precious eſtimation of him, as alſo the greater care of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him when he is found, having had experience that it is not ſo eaſie a matter if we loſe his gracious and comfortable preſence, to find the ſame againe. And therefore if the Lord ſpeake peace to his Saints, let them beware not to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto folly.</p>

                  <p>Firſt then, by theſe watchmen, the Paſtors and Teachers of Chriſt's Church are meant, as we ſee them called, <hi>Eſa. 62. 6. Ezek.</hi> 3. 17. and 33. 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:114769:77"/>
1. To ſhew thereby the neceſſity of their vocation; that as a City, which has many enemies, inteſtine and open, has need of faithfull watchmen, ſo has the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their vigilancy in attention, that as watchmen ſhould be vigilant, and ſo not onely have clear eyes but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and not ſleeping; ſo ſhould Paſtors have the clear eye of knowledge, and the watchfull eye of ſuperinſpection and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, to know the eſtate of the flock.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their prudence and diſcretion, that as a watchman ſhould be able to diſcern between friends and foes, and as, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 36. between ſhaddowes and ſubſtances, ſo ſhould wiſe Paſtours between friends, to the truth, and diſguiſed woolves in ſheeps cloathing, and between fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and things of ſmall conſequence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fidelity in premonition, that as watchmen ſhould be faithfull in forewarning, ſo ſhould paſtors be, as we ſee, <hi>Ezek. 33. 3. Eſa. 58. 1. Act.</hi> 20. 26. and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the watchman ought to take greateſt heed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe the enemy ſtrives firſt to ſurpriſe ſuch, corrupt, or take them out of the way; even ſo ought paſtors, (as they are exhorted, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.) to take heed ſpecially to themſelves, that they be not ſurpriſed and corrupted by Satan, either with errour, or a ſcandalous life, which has ever been the bane of the Church, as we ſee in <hi>Iudas, Demas,</hi> and <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> with many arch-Hereticks, <hi>Arrius, Eutiches,</hi> and others in the Primitive Church; and that Roman Antichriſt now adaies, and as we have it foretold, <hi>Act. 20. 29, 30. 2 Theſs. 2. Revel.</hi> 9. 1. and 12. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſaid here, that the watchmen found her, but not that ſhe ſought them, which ſignifies their diligence and fidelity, and accords with their duty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 6. 16. to ſearch and find out ſuch as wander, or in a ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, need reſolution, binding up ſo what is broken, and ſtrengthning that which is ſick, and like a bruiſed reed, or ſmoaking flax.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, her queſtion to them, If they ſaw her well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe it was fitteſt that they ſhould know Chriſt, or ſee him, who were as the light of the world to give know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and ſhow, or (like the <hi>Baptiſt)</hi> point him forth to others; this being it which is ſaid by <hi>Malachi,</hi> That the Prieſt's lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. for he is the meſſenger of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114769:78"/>
the Lord of Hoſts. And therefore they are compared to that ſtar, that led the Wiſe-men to the place where Chriſt was. Wherefore ſuitably ſhe enquires at them, for Him whom her foul loves.</p>
                  <p>But unto this queſtion, we ſee not here any anſwer made mention of, which behoved to be; either becauſe they made none at all, which is not like to be the true cauſe; or elſe becauſe upon their anſwer, at that preſent ſhe found not the good thereof, which is, that comfortable reſolution and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, whom her ſoul loved, as ſhe found within ſhort ſpace thereafter: The ſeed of God's Word (like other ſeed) having its own time to brier and bring forth its fruit, which the husbandman is bidden to wait for in patience. And God's Spirit having his own time of efficacious working with the Word, and of the comfortable application to the ſoul of that which it hath been ruminating upon, that ſo all comfort may be known to come from him onely, who is the promiſed Comforter, in and by the means of the Word, and all glory may be given to him therefore.</p>

                  <head>Verſ. 4. It was but a little that I paſſed from them, but I found him whom my ſoul loved; I held him, and would not let him go, untill I brought him into my mothers houſe, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</head>
                  <p>The Church getting no reſolution that can ſatisfie her ſoul, ſhe yet continues ſeeking, and by conſtant ſeeking (as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> followed the Lord) when means fail, ſhe finds him to her comfort; for neither can the moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpeeches of brethren, who can tell, with <hi>David,</hi> what the Lord hath done for their ſouls; nor the reſolution of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, raiſe up a caſt-down ſoul, cure a wounded ſpirit, and comfort an afflicted conſcience, till Chriſt himſelf come, and ſhow himſelf to the ſoul; as there was no cure by the waters of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> till the Angell came down, and moved the ſame; nor no calm of the ſtorm, till Chriſt awaked, and ſpake to the ſea, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Next, when ſhe has found him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did the Angell that wreſtled with him, ſhe held him, and would not let him go; and ſo ſhe practiſes that Precept of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Take faſt hold of inſtruction, let her not go, but keep her ſure; for ſhe is thy life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 13. Which holding of him whom her ſoul loveth, is by the hand of Faith, gripping faſt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his Word, and to him in them. Neither is this rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (as it would ſeem) in her, that ſhe ſhould lay hold on ſo glorious a King, and not let him go: 1 In reſpect of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall &amp; matrimonial union between them: And 2 in reſpect, that ſuch ſort of dealing is moſt acceptable to Chriſt, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſuch a holy violence, whereby the godly take the heavens by force. And as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s example, which has ſuch power with God, and in the end never wants the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: Wherein the marvellous kindneſſe of the Lord is ſeen, that he yields himſelf (as it were) to be ſo held and detained by us; yea, who furniſhes' to us both the hand and ſtrength, whereby he is held, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. Neither thinks he it any rudeneſſe or unmannerlineſſe in us, ſo to do; although Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and enemies to the truth would ſuggeſt, that it is too much ſawcineſſe for ſinfull men, to come directly to Chriſt, and lay hold on him; and not rather in a more humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſeek unto ſome Saint or Angell, to intercede for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114769:79"/>
them. But his true Church here doth not ſo, but ſeeks onely to him, and by a holy confidence layeth hold on him alone, who crieth out to all, <hi>Come to me all ye that are weary and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will refreſh you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is ſhe content onely to lay hold on him, and not to let him go, but ſhe brought him to her Mother's houſe, and into the chamber of her that conceived her, that there He might abide and dwell with her; by which houſe or chamber, is meant the heart, as it is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. That Chriſt dwelleth in the heart by faith; and, as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. by his Spirit, which if a man have not dwelling in him, he is none of his. Which is called the houſe of her Mother, or chamber of her that conceived her; becauſe in the heart, the ſeed of the Word is received, as in the womb of the Mother; and faith thereby is begotten, as it were, and the new birth, or inner man, is conceived. The marks of which finding, and bringing home of Chriſt to the ſoul or heart, are theſe: 1 There is light or illumination, which muſt be, 1 a humbling light; 2 a warming light; 3 a changing or renewing light, making the heart a new heart, new words, new actions. 2 There is a life, known by the motions thereof, and care of its ſelf preſervation, &amp;c. and with it, a death of and to ſin. 3 There is peace joyned with righteouſneſſe, and care not to return again unto folly. 4 There is joy, ſuch as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. and 4. 6, or like that of <hi>Simeon</hi>'s. And 5 There is liberty from ſin's ſlavery, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bondage, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſhowes, That they may be trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord, and that they may be glorified, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1, 3.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. This example, that the Church found her well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at laſt, ſerveth both for comfort and encouragement to all thoſe, who with a hearty affection, diligently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeek after Chriſt; for howſoever he come not ſo ſoon as they would, yet let them not faint nor give over, but be aſſured, at laſt he ſhall come to their comfort, and to the joy of their hearts they ſhall aſſuredly find him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. She found him, when ſhe was paſt the Watchmen, and all means had failed her; which teaches us, When we have aſſayed all lawfull means, and yet find no comfort nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery by them, yet not to deſpair, but ſtill rely upon the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114769:79"/>
Lord, who in the mount or height of the ſoul's tryall or trouble, will be ſeen, as he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red Sea, in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as that viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. ſhowes, and to the King of <hi>Iſrael, 2 King.</hi> 7. to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Jonas,</hi> his Diſciples in the ſtorm, and others: Man's extremity, when all hopes are failed, as in <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s raiſing, being his opportunity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee here the power and praiſe of a true &amp; lively faith, that it not onely laies hold on Chriſt, but alſo keepeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth him faſt, and will not let him go; this being the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith) not onely whereby we overcome the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. but alſo whereby we overcome and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God, and by the very touch thereof can draw ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue out of him: Which excellency of faith, if men did throughly weigh and conſider, they would not be ſo cold in the means thereof, nor ſo careleſſe in ſeeking after the ſame; while as without wearineſſe they hunt after vanities, and vexation of ſpirit, and with <hi>Eſau</hi> do forego the bleſſing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This example of her<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holding him faſt, having at laſt found him whom ſhe miſled before, ſhowes what ſoul it is, who will be moſt carefull to keep Chriſt by all means, and advert narrowly to the grouth or decay of grace, working out its own ſalvation with fear and trembling; ſurely ſuch a ſoul onely, that has been ſpiritually exerciſed under the ſenſe of ſin, and ſtanding in need of Chriſt, and comforts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for which they have thirſted (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.) like parched ground; or as <hi>David</hi> did, for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the well of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſee, that ſhe is not contented onely to lay hold on him, and not let him go, but ſhe will lead him home to the inner chamber of her heart, that there he may dwell with her; knowing very well, that where he comes to dwell, as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> ſalvation comes to that houſe; and as <hi>Obededom</hi>'s houſe was bleſſed, becauſe of the Ark's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, ſo bleſſed is that ſoul wherein Chriſt is; for, as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid, That if Chriſt had been there, their brother <hi>Lazorus</hi> had not died, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 21. ſo where he is, there is no death nor danger, but life and liberty, with all manner of bleſſings. And indeed this is a great myſtery; for although many profeſſe the Name of Chriſt in word, yet few know what this means, to bring Chriſt home to their heart; Chriſt indeed is in their mouth, but their heart is far from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114769:80"/>
him, and he from it, and therein is only to be found, Pride, Malice, Covertouſneſs, Uncleanneſs, Envy, and Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea Satan dwells in their heart, and their ſpeeches and actions declare the ſame cleerly, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> witneſſes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 7. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If we have found Chriſt, and brought him home to the houſe of our heart, let us remember theſe duties, 1. To keep a clean houſe to this our Heavenly husband, who can abide no impurity, which is the leaſt thing a woman can do to her husband, 2. Let him be Maſter of his owne Houſe, and give him the chieſe place therein, 3. Entertain him as becomes upon his owne, eſpecially with a diſh of love: and, 4. Keep the marriage bed chaſt, for he is a jealous God; and admit not, nor have any familiarity with his known enemies.</p>

                  <p>Firſt then, The wilderneſs out of which ſhe aſcends is the world, the corruption wherein we are all by nature, the love, delight and deſires thereof; compared to a wilderneſs, 1. As in a wilderneſs there is nothing but waſtneſs and barrenneſs, ſo in the world and mans eſtate by nature there is nothing but waſtneſs and barrenneſſe of all grace and goodneſs, in all the faculties of the ſoul, members of the body, and whole courſe of life, 2. As in a wilderneſs there are many briars and thorns, and many ſavage beaſts; ſo in the world, and mans eſtate by nature, there are many vices, the curſed brood of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, and a Savage diſpoſition whereby many in mens ſhape are but very beaſts of divers kinds, as Tigers, Foxes, Dogs, and Swine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With which ſort the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells that he fought at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> 3. A wilderneſs is commonly dry, which is one cauſe of the barrenneſs thereof, for which cauſe the Pſalmiſt ſayes of the Lords goodneſs, that He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wilderneſs into a ſtanding water, and dry ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water-ſprings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 35. as he alſo gave water in the wilderneſs to his people out of the rock: even ſo in the world, and our eſtate by nature, there is nothing in the heart but dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and want of all moiſture of grace, which makes it to be ſo hard, and barren in all goodneſs, till the Lord break the hard heart, and moiſten with the water of grace the dry and barren ſoul, 4. In a wilderneſs there is no Tilling, Sowing, Planting or dreſſing at all, and therefore no good fruit, but either (as has been ſaid) barrenneſs or Briers; even ſo in the world, and mans heart by nature, there is no fitneſs of ground for the ſeed of Gods word, nor planting of the ſaving graces of the Holy Ghoſt, till we be made as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh the Lords husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and ſuch a change be wrought, as we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 35. 37. from barrenneſs to be fruitfull to the Lord, while as the whole world beſide, out of which we aſcend here with the Church, doth remaine as a waſt, barren, and until'd wilderneſs.</p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:114769:81"/>
Secondly, by her coming up out of the wilderneſs, is not meant any corporall or locall mutation; for thus, neither doth Chriſt come down to her, nor doth ſhe aſcend to him: but a ſpirituall aſcenſion in affection and holy devotion, by faith and Sanctification, not conforming her ſelf (as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſpeakes) to the world, but being transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of her mind, that ſhe may prove what is that good, acceptable and perfect will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. In reſpect of which going up out of the wilderneſs, (which is oppoſit to going down, as we have <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 18. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 2.) <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſayes that the way of life is <hi>above</hi> to the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, that he may depart from Hell beneath, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 24. and indeed this is no ſmall work, ſeeing that the whole benſell of our hearts naturally bend down-wards to this world and earthly things, and it is the mighty power of Chriſts grace when he comes, that makes this aſcenſion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhe is ſaid to come up out of the wilderneſs like pillars of ſmoak, to ſhow that her journey, and mounting up to Heaven (as has been ſaid) being moved by the fire of Gods ſpirit, is with a ſtraight foot or courſe of Sanctification, and with a ſteddy and conſtant reſolution, (like <hi>Davids)</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified here by pillars, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57. and thus as a ſpirituall ſacrifice the godly offer up themſelves, (as they are exhorted; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) and ſtraightly aſcend to God, like the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> on Chriſt Jeſus as the alter, by the fire of the ſpirit, and reſolving the earthly part of their naturall corruption piece by piece into aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſhe is ſaid to be perfumed with Myrrh and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, and other pouders of the Merchant, to ſhow that thus the Church is made a ſweet odour to God in Chriſt, whoſe death is like Myrrh, bitter in taſte, but ſweet in ſmell, and whoſe mediation is figured by frankincenſe, (whereof is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 34.) as we ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. ſo that thorow his death and mediation the Church becomes a ſweet odour to God, like <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Eſau's</hi> veſture. Alſo ſhe may be ſaid to be perfumed with Myrrh and Frankincenſe: Myrrh being a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of mortification of the fleſh, whereunto we are exhorted, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. It being uſed in the imbalming the dead: And Frankincenſe, a figure of the grace of prayer and holy devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 2. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. With other pouders of the Merchant, that is, with all other graces that Chriſt has beſtowed on her by the preaching of the Goſpell,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114769:81"/>
with all theſe ſhe is ſaid to be perfumed, and ſo made ſweet and fit to aſcend up before God in the heavens: for otherwiſe in and of our ſelves by nature we ſtink like hemlock, and are moſt loathſome &amp; abominable, fitter for that pit which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone then to aſcend up into ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly palaces, till he waſh us, and anoint, and cloth us as we ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. and, as <hi>Eſther</hi> was purified and perfumed with ſweet odours before ſhe came to the king, <hi>Eſther</hi> 2. 12 till we be purified by the blood of Chriſt, and perfumed with the merit of his ſufferings, and with the graces of his ſpirit need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſalvation, before we preſent our ſelves for acceptation to the King of kings.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe ſhe being in a barren wilderneſs where no ſuch ſweet and odoriferous ſpices does grow, and being of her ſelf alſo like the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> poore and wretched, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. We ſee that ſhe has not theſe things from her ſelf, but from her bleſſed bridegroom; whom when ſhe found, ſhe found alſo as in a full ſtorehouſe all theſe things in him, and got all theſe things from him, ſo that juſtly he might ſay to her, as he ſpeaks by his Prophet, I decked thee with ornaments, and thou waſt beautiful with my comelineſs which I had put upon thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 11. 14.</p>

But the Church never mounts upward like pillars of ſmoak in a ſteddy and conſtant courſe, till after ſeeking ſhe found her welbeloved, who firſt came down to her, before ſhe could aſcend up to him; which ſhowes us, that even ſo, before we can come out of the world and nature, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4. It is likewiſe ſaid, that ſhe not only aſcends like pillars of ſmoak having found Chriſt, but alſo that ſhe is perfumed with Myrrh and Frankincenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which ſhowes unto us that till we be indued with the ſaving graces of God, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe perfumes and powders of the Merchant, which makes us ſmell ſweetly in Gods ſight, we will never be fit to aſcend up, or preſent our ſelves before his heavenly Majeſty to expect acceptation, but will be as a ſtinking or corrupt carcaſe, and our beſt exerciſes of devotion but abomination before him, and therefore moſt earneſtly ſhould we ſeek the graces and gifts of Gods holy ſpirit, that ſo we may be as pillars of ſmoak perfumed aſcending like <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice, and finding acceptation.</p>

                  <p>From this verſe to the end of the Chapter, the church ſets forth the glory of Chriſt (whom after ſeeking at laſt ſhe had found) by the glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereof our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 29. By particularizing it in theſe three, <hi>Solomons</hi> bed, his Chariot, and his Crown; his bed ſtrongly guarded, his Chariot richly furniſhed, and his Crown gloriouſly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then our Saviour is compared here to <hi>Solomon;</hi> and next his glory in theſe three forenamed, unto the glory of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> Himſelf then is compared to <hi>Solomon</hi> for theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo was Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, and therefore ſo called in like manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Solomon</hi> (according to the ſignification of his name) was a peaceable Prince; and ſo is Chriſt that Prince of peace, (as <hi>Iſay</hi> calles him) who has made peace between God and us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 6. And is the author of all peace externall, internall and eternall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Solomon</hi> was greatly beloved of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24. and ſo was Chriſt proclaimed to be the welbeloved of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in whom he was well pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Solomon</hi> excelled, and exceeded all others in wiſdome; riches and glory; and ſo doth Chriſt, who is the wiſdome of the Father, the full treaſure of grace, and the king of glory, 1 <hi>King. 10. 23. Col.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

as a man is carried whither he will in his Chariot; even ſo is Chriſt's Name, by the preaching of the Goſpell; for which cauſe, our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould be a choſen veſſell unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>m, to carry his Name before the Gentiles. And for this cauſe alſo, the ſame is compared to that white Horſe in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> whereon our Saviour is ſaid to ride and be carried, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
                  <p>The word in the originall is <hi>apirion,</hi> from <hi>parah,</hi> to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to ſhow, that by the preaching of the Goſpell, is the Church her flouriſhing and enlargement; the Word being that ſpirituall ſeed, whereby many are begotten anew to Chriſt; and the Church's onely diadem or glory, as we ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. unlike to that of the Whore's, of externall pomp, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>This Chariot therefore is a triumphall Chariot, wherein he that rides, and has a Crown given him, as is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> goes forth conquering and to conquer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2. and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of his preaching the Goſpell; Now thanks be unto God, which alwaies cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge by us in every place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>They who draw this Chariot, are the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, who therefore fitly may be compared to theſe goodly and richly furniſhed Horſes in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chariots, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 9. or to that white Horſe, whereon Chriſt is ſaid to ride, and to go forth upon, conquering. He likewiſe who drives this Chariot, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhowes, is the Spirit of God, who makes the Wheeles thereof, and them whom he rules, to go in their courſe, <hi>Ezek</hi> 1. 20. and 12. 1 Straight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, with a ſtreight foot in the Goſpell. 2 As <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks, with alacrity, and doing God's work diligently, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60. 8. fleeing as clouds and doves to the windowes of the Temple.

                  <p>Secondly, He who made this Chariot, is ſaid to be King <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhewing hereby, who inſtitutes the holy Miniſtry or Teachers of his Church, to wit, King Jeſus, the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> and Wiſdome of the Father; and therefore, ſaies the Apoſtle, That it is he that gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for

the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. Even as it was he that called <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and ſitted them for the work of the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For whom made he this Chariot. The Text ſaies, <hi>ſibi,</hi> or to himſelf; that is, for his own glory, in the riches of his grace, which he has made manifeſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell to Mankind. So that this ſhould be the aim of all faithfull Paſtors, as our Saviour did, not to ſeek their own glory, but the glory of him who ſent them, in the procuring of the ſalvation of his people, and referring all the glory of their ſucceſſefull pains to him onely, who gives the increaſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Chariot is ſaid to be made of the wood of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> meaning thereby, the Cedars that grew there in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was a hill neer <hi>Hermon,</hi> and whereon ſuch ſort of Trees for the moſt part did grow: which Cedars, 1 were a ſort of tall Trees, ſignifying here thereby, that Miniſters of God's Word ſhould mount upwards, not onely in holy and heavenly meditation, but likewiſe in affection, ſeeking thoſe things that are above, and in a daily grouth of grace, (whereunto they exhort others) and of a holy life; who are therefore compared to Stars, that are in a heavenly ſtation, and not found on the earth. 2 Cedars were ſtrongly rooted, as we ſee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. and ſo ſhould Paſtors be ſpecially, both in firmneſſe of ſound doctrin, and holy confidence, as buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a Rock. 3 The Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> were ſuch, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a good ſmell, as we ſee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 6, 7. and ſo do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, both by ſound and comfortable doctrin, and by a holy life and example; and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, For we are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2. 15. 4 Cedar-wood was durable, and not ſubject (as other wood) to rottenneſſe and corruption; and ſo are faithfull Paſtors, and ſhould be, neither corrupt in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, nor in life and converſation.</p>
                  <p>Next, more particularly, it is ſaid, that the pillars thereof were of ſilver; by which pillars, the chief Paſtors in God's Church are underſtood, ſuch as were the Apoſtles, and others of eminent note, as we ſee <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. ſo called, both in reſpect of their own ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as alſo of their bearing up by the word of Truth, the Church and houſe of God wherein they are placed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:114769:86"/>
Theſe pillars alſo are ſaid to be of ſilver, which is a coſtly and precious ſhining mettall; ſhowing thereby, how precious faithfull Paſtors are in God's ſight; and as they are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like pillars, how precious alſo ſuch ſhould be, in the eyes of Gods people, before whom they ſhine both in life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and eſpecially, of what price and eſtimation the Word, which they preach, ſhould be unto them, as we ſee <hi>David</hi> profeſſes, and as his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> declares, ſaying, The tongue of the righteous is as choiſe ſilver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 72.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part, whereof he ſpeaks in particular, is the foundation or bottom, which he ſaies is of gold; and by which bottom, the foundation of the Apoſtles their doctrine is meant, as we ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 14. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. ſaid to be of gold, the moſt precious and durable metall of any, to ſhew the moſt precious worth of the Word of God, regiſtred in Scripture: and the perpetuall indurance of the ſame, againſt which, neither the ruſt of corruption, time, which weareth all things, nor the malice of the devill, and the gates of hell, ſhall ever prevail.</p>
                  <p>The covering of which Chariot is ſaid to be of purple, which is nothing elſe but Chriſt's bloodſhed, death, and paſſion, and the vertue and merit thereof preached, which covers and cleanſes our ſouls, and ſaves them from the wrath of God, and eternall deſtruction, as the blood of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lamb; an aſperſion thereof upon the Iſraelites door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeks, and lintells, ſaved them from the deſtroying Angell. And therefore this being the clefts of the Rock which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. whereunto, as a cover or ſhelter, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dove has her recourſe in ſtorm, or when ſhe is purſued by her cruell enemy.</p>
                  <p>The midſt of which golden foundation, wherewith the ſame is paved and overlaid, is <hi>Love,</hi> even the Love of the Elect to him, who has ſo loved them, manifeſted in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Word, whereon they rely, and build their faith and confidence.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, it is ſaid, That as this Chariot is made to him ſelf, or for his glory, ſo likewiſe it is for the daughters of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> or the good of his Church, and ſalvation of his Elect; his glory being firſt, as it ought to be the firſt and main end at which we ſhould aime; and his Church's good being next, and the ſalvation of ſoules, which we ought all to work out with fear and with trembling.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Seeing Chriſt comes to any perſon or place ordinarily, by the preaching of his Word, as in his triumphall Chariot; then happy is that people, where his Goſpell is purely and plentifully preached; as on the contrary, unhappy is their condition, when (as he threatneth <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2.) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves his golden candleſtick from them, and as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> he ſaies, Woe be to them, when he departs from them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3.

                  <head>Verſ. 11. Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold King Solomon, with the Crown wherewith his mother crowned him, in the day of his eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls, and in the day of the gladneſſe of his heart.</head>
                  <p>This is the ſpeech of the Church to all her daughters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe invites them to come forth, and behold Chriſt, the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his glory. In which ſpeech we have; 1 Whom ſhe invites. And 2 Whereunto ſhe invites them; 1 to go forth; 2 to behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with his Crown; 3 is ſet down who crowned him, to wit, his Mother; and 4 when, in the day of his eſpouſalls, and of the gladneſſe of his heart. And ſo in theſe words we have, the end wherefore the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was preached, and Chriſt carried in his Chariot to the ends of the earth; to wit, that all the faithfull every where, who are effectually called, may behold him as a crowned

                  <p>Firſt then, Thoſe whom the Church invites to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, are called the daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> who are the ſame, who before were called the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by whom are meant all faithfull believers, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, either perſons, or particular Churches; for this <hi>Sion</hi> was a mount in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as that was called the holy City, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52, 1. ſo <hi>Sion</hi> was called, the Lord's holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe of his Temple there, <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 17. and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the Chriſtian Church under the Goſpell, as we ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. or as the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh, The generall aſſembly, and Church of the firſt-born, which are written in heaven. Theſe, I ſay, are the perſons who are called forth, by the preaching of the Goſpell, to behold Chriſt, thus ſeated in the ſoul, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8. and carried as in a Chariot, by the miniſtry of his Word, to the outermoſt parts of the earth, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. as a Conquerour and a King, crowned with glory and honour in his Church.</p>
                  <p>2. That whereunto ſhe invites theſe, is, 1 To go forth; implying, that as long as they remained within dores, they could not behold the glory of this King, till they came forth; which going forth, is out of themſelves, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, not ſeeking Chriſt in their own reaſon, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall imaginations, or having their affections and deſires ſet on the world and earthly things; but renouncing and denying themſelves, and quitting whatſoever thing may be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment; they muſt ſtrive, with the Apoſtle, for a greater progreſſe and degree of perfection, in the true and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, unto their own ſalvation; by doing whereof, and with the eye of faith, in daily meditation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of Chriſt, eſpecially wherein he is now ſeated, and wherein his Church ſhall raigne with him; they ſhall eaſily deſpiſe all the glory and pleaſures of this world, as very droſſe and dung.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore left his father's houſe, <hi>Iſrael Egypt, Moſes</hi> the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Diſciples their Boats and Nets to follow Chriſt; ſo muſt all thoſe who would be ſaved, or ſee Chriſt ſavingly, leave their former converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whatſoever is dear unto them, (if it be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to Chriſt) though it were father or mother,

Go out of her my people, ſo they muſt go out of nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves, the wantons abandoning and forſaking their carnall pleaſures with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the covetous his worldly profit, as <hi>Matthew</hi> did his receipt of cuſtome, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner his unjuſt gaine with godly <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard his exceſſe, and the proud his ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And each one muſt go forth out of that which may hinder him from a ſaving and ſanctified ſight and ſenſe of Chriſt and his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous government in his Church, and in their owne hearts here, or of the comfortable ſight of him crowned in glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>2. That whereunto they are invited, and is the end of their going forth, is to behold Chriſt, the true <hi>Solomon</hi> (and greater then he) as a king crowned, in glory, power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ruling in his Church, and in the hearts of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. A ſight indeed needing a ſharp-ſighted eye to behold, and which is onely the eye of faith, whereby the wiſe men that came from the eaſt ſaw him a king, though a new born infant, ſwadled in clouts, and lying in a crib; and the theef on the croſſe in like manner, though crowned with thorns, and hanging on a tree: by this eye likewiſe, the patriarks ſaw him in the Promiſes before the law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore becauſe the blind naturaliſt or worldling ſees not theſe things, the daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the eye-ſalve of the ſpirit to diſcern ſpirituall things and are like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheels, full of eyes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 18. They are called upon only to behold this ſpirituall ſight, and to theſe only the promiſe is made, for, Bleſſed are the pure in heart (ſayes our ſaviour) for they ſhall ſee God.</p>
                  <p>3. The daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> are called forth to behold Chriſt; the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a king crowned with the Crown where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his mother crowned him: where we have firſt to conſider who is meant here by his Mother; and, 2. What is this crown, and how he is crowned ſo by her.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we muſt underſtand that Chriſt has a naturall Mother, to wit, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was his mother accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114769:88"/>
to the fleſh, as alſo he has a myſticall mother, which is his Church, who in a divers reſpect is his ſiſter, as he calles her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. His ſpouſe, and his Mother here, 1. In eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and affection, becauſe he ſo eſteems and loves his Church and thoſe who do the will of his Father, as his very Mother; as he ſhowes and calles ſuch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 50. And, 2. Becauſe by the Doctrine of faith the paſtors of his Church, as by an Immortall ſeed, they conceive and bring forth Chriſt in a manner in the hearts of his elect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. As the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> teſtifies ſaying, My little Children of whom I travell in birth againe, untill Chriſt be formed in you: for which cauſe alſo the Church who is deſcribed by that woman in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> who was great with child is ſaid, travelling in birth, to have brought forth a man child, who was to rule all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a Rod of iron, who was caught up to God and to his throne, which is competent onely to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This mother then is ſaid to ſet a crown on Chriſts head, which is a ſigne of dominion and victory, as we ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. When her true and faithfull members acknowledge his ſole and only Soveragnity over them, and ſubmitts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ruled and governed by him alone, and no other but their king and Lord Jeſus to lord over them, or have place in their hearts, whereas on the contrary, thoſe who give place to <hi>Satan,</hi> ſinne, or their own corruption, their ſervants and ſubjects they are whom they obey, theſe take the crown (as it were) from off Chriſts head, and ſay he ſhall not raigne over us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and puts it upon <hi>Satans</hi> head, and puts, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt's hand by way of deriſion (as it were) with the Roman ſouldiers, an empty reed for a ſcepter, and crown him with a crown of thorns, and while they ſay in word, Let thy kingdome come, they ſhow in deed that they deſire that it depart from them: and therefore they ſhall hear a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a dreadfull departure from him, when they who crown him here, as the true members and ſubjects of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, ſhalbe crowned hereafter with the crown of glory.</p>
                  <p>And indeed great reaſon is it that his Church, and all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoules ſhould thus crown Chriſt Jeſus as their king and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord here: for, 1. In our creation, as is ſhown, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6 He crowned man (whom he made little inferior to Angels) with glory and honour and ſet him over the works of his hands, 2. In the work of our Redemption, he crowned our

He put a beautifull crown upon her head, even that beauty of holineſs, whereof he ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. 5 For our uſe and comfort of this naturall life on earth, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, he crownes the yeer with his goodneſs, and his paths drop fatneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 11.

                  <p>4. The time when he is ſaid to be crowned, is the day of his eſpouſal's, and of the gladneſs of his heart, ſo that when a faithfull ſoul acknowledges Chriſts ſole and ſupreame ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity over the ſame, and wholly ſubmits it ſelf to his rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and government, then and thereby is it eſpouſed, as a chaſt Virgin unto Chriſt Jeſus, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſhewes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. And ſo at one time as it were it crownes Chriſt, and is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed to him: and as this is the joy of the Angels, ſo is it the joy and gladneſs of his heart, who is Lord both of men and Angels, proceeding from that love that he has to mans ſalvation, and whom nothing at any time did ſo contriſtate when he was on earth, as the ſtubborneſs of wicked ſinners who would not be reclaimed, as he ſhewd when he wept over Jeruſalem, and ſo grievouſly complained.</p>

                  <p>IN this whole Chapter for the moſt part is the ſpeach of the bridgroom ſet down commending his bride, 1. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, 2.

                  <p>Thirdly, he commends her from her teeth, the comlineſs and beauty whereof in the naturall body conſiſts in theſe two things, to wit, that they be eaven and white, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he compares them to a flock of ſheep, that are eaven ſhorne, and are white; being newly come up from the waſhing, by which are underſtood in the myſticall body of Chriſts church, her faithfull and godly paſtors, who 1 as the teeth cut and prepare the food for the nouriſhment of the body, ſo do they devide the word aright, and prepare food for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the ſoul, as alſo 2. as theſe are like an eaven ſhorn flock, ſo this ſignifieth how paſtors ſhould agree in one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of truth and unity, 3.

(and therefore he ſubjoynes, that her ſpeech is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.) And therefore her lips (here compared to a thread of ſcarlet) does ſignifie, 1 Her ſervent love to Chriſt, and that ſubmiſſion and obedience that flowes therefrom, ſpoken of, by kiſſing the Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. as alſo her holy and comely ſpeech, here mentioned, both in prayer and praiſing God, and edifying likewiſe her neighbours; ſhowing thereby, (as it is ſaid of the vertuous woman) that the law of Grace is in her lips, and that the ſame proceeds from a heart purged by faith, in Chriſt's blood, which makes it to be, as if it were of a red or ſcarlet die. 3 Her lips are the delivery of the wholſome doctrine of her teachers, precious like ſcarlet, and teaching Chriſt crucified, by whoſe blood we are ſaved, and drawn like a wel-ſpun thread out of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He commends her from her temples or cheeks, the ſeat of ſhamefaſtneſſe or bluſhing, which he compares to a piece of pomgranat, that is reddiſh, betokening thereby her chaſt modeſty, and bluſhing, if ſhe do any thing amiſſe, or be rebuked for the ſame; and therefore is not impudent (as many are) in ſinning, and of a whooriſh forehead, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſhamed; nor yet impatient or careleſſe for rebuke. And this her ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſty are theſe rowes of Jewells, wherewith her cheeks are made comely, as is ſaid before, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He commends her from her neck, which is ſtreight and comely, and is like the Towre of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an Armoury; ſignifying thereby, that being united to her head by faith, as the neck joynes the head with the reſt of the body, her carriage accordingly is upright and holy, not ſtooping, neither to ſin's ſlavery, againſt which ſhe is armed with the whole armour of God, ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. nor yet baſely bowing down to the love of earth and earthly things, but as ſhe is exhorted, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. being riſen with Chriſt, ſhe ſeeks thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He commends her from her two breaſts, being both full and white, and therefore compared to two young Roes, that are twins, and feed amongſt the Lillies; which breaſts in women, are 1 for ornament and delight, as we ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19. as alſo, 2 for uſe and nouriſhing of Inſants, as we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 9. Even ſo theſe two breaſts of the Church, (which are the ſound doctrin of the Old and New Teſtaments)

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as a garden is taken out of common and waſte ground, to be appropriate to a more particular uſe; ſo is the Church, out of the maſſe of Mankind, to be the Lord's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar; and it is he onely, who makes us ſo to differ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a garden, no rare or good thing comes up naturally of it ſelfe, but what is ſown or ſet; even ſo, nothing that is good, no, not to will, have we of our ſelves, but what is ſown or ſet by the hand of that heavenly Husbandman, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For ſuch ſowing or ſetting, the ground muſt be digged, purged, and prepared; and ſo muſt our hearts for the good ſeed of the Word, and the plants of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In a garden, nothing uſes to be ſown or ſet, but what
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114769:97"/>
is uſefull or delightſome, even ſo is all grace that is ſowne in the heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In a garden there is great variety of flowers, herbs and plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo there is great variety both of edifying gifts, and ſaving graces in the church of God, all for the good of the whole body and every particular member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. No garden wants its own weeds unto which nature is a kind mother, and therefore muſt be purged, dreſſed, and kept cleane; even ſo none wants their own infirmities, which our naturall corruption brings forth and nouriſheth, and therefore great need is there, of mortification, vigilance, and prayer, with all ſuch means whereby the heart may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and kept cleane.</p>

I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</p>
                  <p>3. In reſpect of priviledge or appropriation, <hi>Pſal. 80. 12. Job.</hi> 1. 10. Becauſe that none others are partakers with her of thoſe heavenly graces which ſhe receives from Chriſt, but her true members, and elect, how ſoever others may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the meanes, and make a great ſhow of verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as if they were the Church, 4. In reſpect of her chaſt carriage and reſervation, keeping her ſelf only to Chriſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. So that there is no entrance to any in her heart beſide him, ſhe loveth, obeyeth and worſhips him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not going a whoreing after any other, ſo that of her it may be ſaid, <hi>Paret et patet uni,</hi> nothing enters in it from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but what comes from the heaven above.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing whereto he compares her is, to a ſpring ſhut up and a fountaine ſealed, where we ſee theſe two joyned, a garden, full of pleaſant plants, and leſt any thing ſhould wither, or want moiſture therein, here we have a fountaine or ſpring ſealed up, that thereby as he ſpeaks in <hi>Iſay,</hi> he may water it every moment, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 27. 3. Therefore is the godly man compared in the firſt <hi>Pſalme</hi> to a tree planted by

the river ſide. And it is to be noted that he ſpeaks not of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but of a ſpring never deficient, or a fountaine that ſtill abounds, and yet though they abound ſo (as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14.) that who drinketh thereof they ſhalbe unto him a well of water ſpringing up unto eternall life; yet, they flow not forth of the garden, but are ſhut up and ſealed, ſo that none are watered by them but thoſe plants of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which our heavenly Father has planted.</p>
                  <p>The waters of this ſpring or fountaine whereby the plants of Gods garden are watered, as the four rivers that watered the earthly Paradiſe, are either thoſe of Gods holy word, by which faithfull paſtors water the Lords garden, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſaying, that he planted and <hi>Apollos</hi> watered, which in the externall ſound or Miniſtry they flow out unto all, yet in the inward power and efficacy they are ſealed, and extend only to Gods elect; or elſe theſe waters are thoſe living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or that water of life which Chriſt only gives himſelf, and none elſe is able to give, and thoſe are the refreſhing and comfortable graces of his holy Spirit, whereby the ſoul is moiſtned and the Chriſtian made fruitfull unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Now this fountaine is ſaid to be ſealed, ſignifying thereby unto us theſe two things, 1. The confirmation of grace to Gods elect, and that they ſhall never fully nor finally fall away therefrom, in which ſenſe the word ſealing is uſed, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32. 10. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It ſignifieth the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of grace and reſervation thereof to them only; as, that which is ſealed is not communicate with others, nor known to any but ſuch as the ſame concerns, in which ſenſe, the word ſealing is uſed, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 8. 16. 3 It ſignifieth the Lords preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and ſurety of his Church in common dangers and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as we ſee, <hi>Rev. 20. 3.

                     <p n="1">1. If we be as a garden or plot of ground ſevered from common uſe to the owners particular uſe and delight, then let us walk as ſuch, and not conforme our ſelves (as we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) to the preſent world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is a great comfort unto us that we are the Lords garden, for as a man has a care of his garden &amp; delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therein,

                  <p>In the former verſe, Chriſt called his Church, A fountain ſealed up, which doth water all her plants; and here ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes all the praiſe thereof unto him, affirming, that he is the <hi>fountain of the gardens, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Look whatſoever waters of life is in her, or in any particular Churches, without challenging any part of that to themſelves, they flow from him onely, as the prime and head fountain, and it is onely
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114769:100"/>
out of his fulneſſe, that they receive grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. For, as the Apoſtle ſaies, It hath pleaſed the Father, that for this end, in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell. As the catholick Church then is called a garden, ſo particular Churches are called here gardens, and Chriſt is that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the gardens, whoſe plenty and plenitude is ſuch, that it reacheth it ſelf to the watering of all theſe Churches, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed thorow the world, and all the true members thereof, which are his pleaſant plants. The waters of this fountain, being like the few loaves and fiſhes, which fed ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and there were twelve baskets full gathered up; or like thoſe waters in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that flowed out of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, ſo abounding, that they were waters to ſwim in, and could not be paſſed over, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 5.</p>
                  <p>Therefore alſo he is called, a well of living waters, and which ſends forth many ſtreams, as thoſe which come from <hi>Lebanon.</hi> Living waters being ſuch as alwais do flow, asſprings do, and never dry up, oppoſed to ſtanding waters. So that the meaning is, that the graces and waters of life, which do flow from Chriſt upon his Church, are ſuch, as can never be dryed up, they flow from ſo bottomleſſe and inexhauſtible a fountain; ſo that albeit he beſtow his graces and gifts from time to time, in never ſo great a meaſure, yet are they not diminiſhed, but like the widow's oyle, ſuperabounds after all veſſells are filled therewith. Which waters likewiſe have theſe notable properties: 1 They are cleanſing, as we ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 9. though the ſtain were never ſo deep, or the pollution never ſo great. 2 They are curing, as the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> cured the leproſie of <hi>Naaman,</hi> and as we ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 9. 3 They are quenching, though the aguiſh thirſt of the ſoul in temptation were never ſo great. 4 They are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, like thoſe waters in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which whereſoever they came, made things to live. And 5 They are fructifying, as we have in that ſame place of <hi>Ezekiel, verſ.</hi> 11, 12. and as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. and in the preceding verſes of this chapter, making the plants of the Lord's garden like an orchard of pomgranats, with pleaſant fruits.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee the diſpoſition of all the godly, that in a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thankfull manner, they ever acknowledge, what ever good or grace is in them, that they have it from the

                     <p n="2">2. Seeing Chriſt Jeſus is the full fountain, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of living waters, and that ſo graciouſly he invites all thoſe who thirſt, to come and drink thereof, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 1. Let all thoſe who would participate of theſe cooling, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, curing, and quickning waters, come to this bleſſed fountain, and ſeek comfort, refreſhment, and grace there onely, where it is to be found; and not to any Creature, Saint, or Angell, or other mean whatſoever, not of God's appointment; like thoſe, who leave the fountain of living waters, and dig up pits unto themſelves, that can hold no water at all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe waters are called living waters, as being not onely ever ſcaturient, but likewiſe becauſe where-ever they flow towards a ſoul, they quicken the ſame, and, as is ſaid, make the ſame to live; and where life is, it has a care of the conſervation of it ſelf, fleeing and abhorring what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive thereto: there is likewiſe a naturall appetite, after that which doth nouriſh and maintain the ſame, and it doth manifeſt it ſelf alſo, in the proper motions and actions thereof. So that where theſe things are not found ſpiritually in the ſoul, it is a token, that theſe waters, which are called living, never entred therein.</p>

                  <p>Having then ſpoken before, why the Church is compared to a garden, and in this place is called, <hi>His garden,</hi> both by right of creation, and acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion at a deer rate; We have to conſider, 1 Why the Spirit that blowes on this garden, is compared to winde; to wit, becauſe of alike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The wind has a purging power of the aire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called Nature's fan; and ſo has the Spirit, to purge and cleanſe the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It has a cooling quality, and ſo has the Spirit, both to abate burning concupiſcence, and to comfort the ſcorching of trouble and temptation, or Satan's fiery darts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It has a clearing property, diſperſing clouds, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſerenity; and ſo has the Spirit, to diſperſe the clouds of temptations, and make fair weather in a perplexed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It has a piercing force, being ſubtle, and ſearching through every narrow cranie; and ſo has the Spirit, as we ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It has a thawing quality; and ſo has the Spirit, to thaw our froſty and cold hearts, and diſſolve them, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flood of tears.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It has alſo a drying and ripening property; and ſo has the Spirit, to dry up the filthy iſſue of our ſinfull humours, and ripen us like wheat for the Lord's harveſt.</p>
                  <p>Next, there is two winds here ſpoken of, or a wind from two arcts, the North and South-wind, which though they ſeem contrary one to another, yet herein they agree, that both are neceſſary for the garden and Church of Chriſt. The North-wind then firſt, is cold, ſharp, and nipping; and the South-winde warm, comfortable, and cheriſhing: Even ſo the Spirit, ſometimes humbles, and makes one like a low valley, and ſometimes raiſes the ſoul with comfort, and makes it as a high mountain; or, as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 26. ſometimes they mount up to heaven, and again they go down to the very depths. And to this end is God's wiſdom
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114769:101"/>
ſuitable in the outward means, ſome being <hi>Boanerges's,</hi> to caſt down, and ſome the ſons of conſolation, to raiſe up; that by and in theſe ordinary means, the Spirit may blow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>The method alſo is to be conſidered, that is here uſed, ſpeaking firſt of the north-wind, and then of the ſouth, to ſhew unto us, that till firſt the Spirit of God humble us by the Law, and ſight of our miſery, we can never expect, that he will be as a ſouth-wind to us, to comfort us by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and give us a true ſenſe or aſſurance of the Lord's mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the operation of the Spirit, is called and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared here to <hi>blowing:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as the wind blowes freely, and where it liſts, ſo does the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The blowing thereof is not ſeen, but felt; and ſo is the working of the Spirit, by making a ſtrange change; ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It blowes not ever alike, but ſometimes more mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes more ſoftly, and ſometimes not ſenſible at all; even ſo does the Spirit, and therefore in this place is bidden <hi>awake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. While it blowes ſo mightily, it bears down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, whether turrets or trees, ſo that nothing can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; even ſo, ſometimes the Spirit works ſo powerfully, that it caſts down all ſtrongholds, and overcomes greateſt enemies, and moſt wicked ſinners, as we ſee in the converſion of <hi>Manaſses,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When it blowes ſoftly on a garden, it not onely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the grouth thereof, but conveys ſweet ſmells to the brain; even ſo does God's Spirit by his breathing, further the grouth of grace, and conveyes ſweet comfort to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The blowing alſo of the wind, by filling the ſailes of ſhips, carries them forward to their haven; and ſo does the working of God's Spirit on the ſoul, and filling the ſame by grace, carrie forward the ſame to the haven of eternall happineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Men obſerve the winde, and the blowing thereof; and ſo ſhould they the operation of the Spirit, and the efficacy of the ſame, with the acceſſe and receſſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the end of this blowing of theſe winds, on his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114769:102"/>
garden, is, That the ſpices thereof may flow out, whereby are underſtood God's graces, which, like ſpices, are precious, pleaſant, and odoriferous to the godly ſoul, and in it to God alſo, whoſe gifts they are; and for them, the ſoul alſo is odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous to him; and which graces oftimes, lie like fire under aſhes in us, till the Spirit blow, and then they are ſaid to flow out, which is not by minoration, or departing from us, but by emanation in their ſenſe to us, and fruits and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards others; as faith is ſeen by works, like that of <hi>Job</hi>'s patience, <hi>Noah</hi>'s conſtancy, <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s continency, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s fidelity, <hi>Phinebas</hi>'s zeal, and the like graces in holy men, by their holy examples, which for imitation, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1.) they did leave behind them. Which blowing of the Spirit likewiſe, for this end, is ordinarily by the blowing of another wind; to wit, the preaching of the Goſpell, as we ſee the ſame ſo compared, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. where when the Lord denounceth, that the courſe of the bleſſing of the Goſpell ſhould be ſtayed, <hi>John</hi> ſeeth in a viſion four Angells, holding the four winds that they ſhould not blow.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part of the verſe, followes, upon the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of his graces in her, for the end aforeſaid, the Church's invitation of her Beloved, to come to his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and eat his pleaſant fruits; by which comming is not to be underſtood, that he was abſent from her, but that ſhe deſires a more full and familiar preſence of him: For, where-ever true grace is begun and ſetled in the heart, there is ſtill a further and a greater deſire thereof, and of a neerer union thereby, more and more with Chriſt, till the ſoul be moſt neerly of all after this life united with him, as the Apoſtle wiſhed, ſaying, <hi>Cupio diſſolvi, &amp; eſſe cum Chriſto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons of which her earneſt deſire, that he would come unto her, are, 1 The great honour that the ſoul gets by his comming thereto, which may ſay more juſtly, than <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> ſaid of <hi>Marie</hi>'s comming, How comes it to paſſe, the Lord himſelf of heaven and earth ſhould come to me? we being, as the centurion confeſſed of himſelfe, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that he ſhould enter under our roof. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The great benefit that the ſoul gets, by his comming thereto; for he brings with him a treaſure of all grace and goodneſſe, and comes not empty, eſpecially (as he ſaid to <hi>Zaccheus)</hi> that day, ſalvation comes to the ſoul. 3 He makes the place
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114769:102"/>
where he is, a kind of heaven, and whatſoever condition of life a man is in, the ſame cannot be but comfortable.</p>
                  <p>The end of his comming is, To eat of his pleaſant fruits; that is, to be contented and delighted with her works of holy and humble obedience; which are called 1 <hi>Pleaſant;</hi> then, <hi>His</hi> fruits. Pleaſant, 1 In reſpect of acceptation, as ſuch. 2 Of proceſſion, becauſe they come from his own Spirit, and inſpiration thereof. 3 In reſpect of their perfection, and perfuming (as it were) to be a ſweet favour to God in Chriſt, which they have from his obedience, and which is a great comfort to us, when we look on our wants and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes. And 4 In reſpect of right intention, or end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are brought forth, or done; which is, to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10</p>
                  <p>Next, they are called, <hi>His</hi> fruits; <hi>à fonte &amp; fine:</hi> 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they flow onely from him, and his Spirit, without whom, we can do nothing. And 2 The glory whereof is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to him, and not to us, our free-will or merit, and to none beſide.</p>
                  <div type="observations">

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee by the order of theſe words, following on the former verſe, that a thankfull acknowledgment of gifts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, procures the enlargement of the Lord's boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull hand, to ſuperadd and beſtow more; as after water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his garden he does here, in breathing on the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we are moſt dejected, and ſpiritually afflicted, let us take that to be the work of the Lord's Spirit, in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and for the good of his garden, as the blowing of the ſharp North-wind thereon, as well as when we are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and blown upon by the ſoft and Sweet ſouth-wind, of the peace of conſcience, and our reſtoring, with <hi>David,</hi> to the joyes which we were wont to find in him.

by the inſpiration and work of Gods ſpirit in their ſweet ſmell and fruits of a holy life, and on the contrary what a ſoil and ſoul is <hi>Satan's</hi> garden, to wit which is full of ſtinking weeds of all corruption, flowing out by his ſuggeſtion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation in their noyſome ſtink like that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable fruits of a wicked life and converſation, which ſhowes how rare Gods gardens are, and how plentifull <hi>Satan's</hi> are in the land.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though the ſoul be already made the Lords garden, and though it be both planted and watered with his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graces, yet we ſee that the ſpirit of God muſt alſo blow thereon that her ſpices may flow out, which ſhowes that we need not only quickning grace to put life in us at firſt, and to have our hearts purged and planted with grace, but likewiſe exciteting grace, and ſo grace upon grace in a daily ſupply, to rouſe up, draw forth and actuate that grace which we got at firſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This blowing on the garden, is that her ſpices may flow out, which teaches us, that it is not enough to be good, or have goodneſs in our ſelves, but it muſt be Emánant and flow out, like the gaining with the talents, and ſhining of the wiſe virgins Lamps, and as our Saviour commands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. to the benefit of others.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Likewiſe as this ſhould teach all Chriſtians who would be good inſtruments in church or polity if, they would have their gifts like ſpices to flow out for the good of others, that then they ſhould firſt be carefull to be well ſtored within with ſuch themſelves, ſo ſpecially paſtors ſhould be ſo, who both in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpell by word, and in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that holy calling by an exemplary ſingularity of life ſhould make their ſpices, or holy gifts and graces flow out, that as lights on a candleſtick they may ſhine in both, to all who are vvithin the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Chriſt makes his ſpirit firſt breathe or blow on his garden, and then ſhe invites him to come and eate of the fruits which this breathing has produced. So that we ſee that firſt, Chriſt by communicating grace to the ſoul he beginnes, and then that his grace in the hearts of his Elect is not in vain, but efficacious and operative to the producing of good and holy fruits.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. We ſee that Chriſts garden is a fruitfull garden, which brings not forth only leaves of verball profeſſion, or fair-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114769:103"/>
bloſſomes of good hopes of fruit, but fruits themſelves, and as our Saviour ſhowes, <hi>much fruit, Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Theſe fruits are called <hi>(his</hi> fruits,) for the reaſon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſo that this is the humble diſpoſition of all the truly godly, that as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. that he and his people had given to the Lord for the preparation of his temple, only vvhich was his own, even ſo they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that any fruits of godlineſs which they are able to bring forth, is only from his meer grace, and in ſo farre, as they are good, they are his work only; ſo farre are they to aſcribe any thing to themſelves or to their own merit, free will, or the like.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Theſe fruits are called <hi>his</hi> pleaſant fruits, or fruits that are pleaſing to him: which ſhowes not only what is the care and ſhould be of all good Chriſtians in all their vvaies and works to pleaſe God, but alſo if the good fruits of a holy converſation be pleaſing to God, that on the contrary the evill fruits of a wicked life muſt be, and are, diſpleaſing to him, provoking his wrath, as we ſee, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 5. &amp;c. and his heavy judgments upon a Land.</p>

                  <head>Verſ. 1. I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, I have gathered my Myrrh with my ſpices, I have eaten my Hony-comb with my hony, I have drunk my wine with my milk: Eate my friends, drink, yea, drink aboundantly, O beloved.</head>
                  <p>IN this Chapter we have, 1. How readily Chriſt anſwers the former invitation of his Church, to come into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and eate his pleaſant fruits, 2. Is ſet down the Churches falling aſleep into the ſlumber of a dangerous ſecurity: out of which our Saviour takes pains to awake her, 1. By his voice knocking and calling upon her, to ariſe and open to him, to whom ſhe returnes a carnall and worthleſs excuſe, 2. By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114769:104"/>
in his hand by the lock of the dore, the ſucceſſe whereof is ſet downe, that her bowels were then moved for him: Whereupon enſued a further progreſſe in ſeeking him. 1. By riſing up. 2. By opening to him. But he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himſelfe. 3. By ſeeking him and calling upon him, the ſucceſſe whereof notwithſtanding was, that ſhe could not find him, nor gave he her any anſwer. 4. By going yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſeeking, him thorow the city, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 3. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whereof was worſe then the former, ſhe not only found him not, but ſhe was wounded by the watchmen, and the keepers of the walls took away her vaile from her. 5. By giving a charge to the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if they found her welbeloved, that they would tell him, that ſhe was ſick of love.</p>
                  <p>In the third part of the Chapter followes upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this her charge to them, and their asking of her, what her welbeloved was more then another's beloved, that ſhe ſo charged them, her deſcription of the excellency of her welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, his beauty and good parts.</p>
                  <p>In the words then of the firſt verſ, we have 1. His declaration how readily he obeyed his Churches invitation to come into his garden and eate his pleaſant fruits; and, 2. His invitation of his friends to eate likewiſe and to drink with him. In the declaration, we have, 1. The ſtyles that he gives her, of ſiſter and ſpouſe, as he did before. <hi>c. 4. v.</hi> 9. whereof we have ſpoken. Next by this variety whereof he ſpeaks, of Myrrh, ſpices, hony, wine and milk, is underſtood the variety of the graces of Gods ſpirit beſtowed upon his elect, to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their ſalvation, and the ſweet fruits and effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wherein he delights and has a complacency, as thoſe have who eate that which is ſweet and delicious, and drink wine, or ſuch pleaſant and comfortable liquors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he invites here his friends to eate and drink likewiſe, that is, the other godly, ſo called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14. whoſe delight and rejoyſing in the obedience of their fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is called here, eating and drinking, therefore ſayes our Saviour, let your light ſo ſhine before men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. That they ſeeing your good works may glorifie God your heavenly father. The godly then are called his friends, and he theirs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. 1.

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Out of this readineſs of Chriſt to yield to the deſire and invitation of his Church, we may gather a leſſon of great comfort, that, as he ſayes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 19. he will ever fulfill the deſire of them that feare him, and heare their cry, and will ſave them; and if he ſeem not ſo readily to anſwer, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly it is for their good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing the Lords delight is in the graces of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which he has planted in the hearts of his Elect, and in the fruits of a holy obedience that ariſes there-from, this ſhould move us to be carefull to have our hearts ſtored with theſe good graces, and our life adorned (like fruitfull trees) with ſuch ſweet fruits, as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 1. 2. That ſo he may have delight and pleaſure in us here, and we may have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with him and pleaſures for ever hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee that friends only are invited, and not enemies to banquet with Chriſt Jeſus, and rejoyce in the obedience of his Saints, here, as the angels rejoyce at a ſinners converſion. And therefore 1. hereby we may try our ſelves if we be friends to Chriſt, if we rejoyce ever at the grouth of godlineſs, and in the fruits of obedience, which we ſee in the godly, loving, and, with <hi>David,</hi> honouring them becauſe thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. And on the contrary, if we be grieved with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 136. and the mourners in <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. For the ſinnes of others, as well as our own, and at their diſobedience who break Gods law and commandements. And, 2. We may ſee who are admitted to the communion of ſpirituall rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Chriſt here, and ſhall be to the communion of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall rejoyſing with him hereafter, to wit, only thoſe who are his friends; the portion of his foes being, a debarring from both, and an adjudication to weeping and wailing for ever hereafter.</p>

                  <head>Verſ. 2. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh; it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, ſaying, Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Here is ſet downe, 1. The churches ingenuous acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a dangerous eſtate of carnall ſecurity wherein ſhe had fallen: and, 2. Is ſet downe Chriſts carriage and care how to awake her out of the ſame: firſt then her acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in theſe words, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh,</hi> whereby ſhe ſhowes that this ſleep of hers was not a dead ſleep, but rather ſuch a ſamber as was that of the wiſe virgins, both becauſe in this ſleep her heart was awake, as alſo ſhe heard the voice of her beloved, and what he ſpake unto her, which they uſe not to do, who are fallen into a dead ſleep, whom no words will awake. Of which ſleep, we have theſe things to conſider: 1 What ſort of ſleep this is, to wit, ſpirituall, or that of ſecurity. 2 Whence it proceeds. 3 What are the other reſemblances between it, and the bodily ſleep. And 4 What are the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the bodily or naturall ſleep is not here meant, ſeeing the Church is onely to be conſidered altogether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her ſpirituall eſtate and condition; and therefore her ſleep here is ſpirituall, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us not ſleep, as others do, but let us watch and be ſober, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 6. and again, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and riſe up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as bodily ſleep proceeds of the binding up of the bodily ſenſes, by the vapours that ariſe from the ſtomack; ſo this ſpirituall ſleep proceeds, of the obſtruction, or bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the ſpirituall ſenſes of the ſoul, from their proper operations, by the ſinfull vapours, ariſing from our naturall corruptions, or remnants of the old Man in the godly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. which when the ſame prevails, and through want of watchfulneſſe or coldneſſe in prayer, waxeth ſtrong, then there is a damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpirituall graces, and as it were a ſleep or ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that falls upon the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:114769:105"/>
Thirdly, the other reſemblances between ſleep and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sleep is naturall, and ſo is ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sleep comes oft of idleneſſe, and ſo does ſecurity, when the ſoul is not exerciſed diligently in watching, prayer, and other holy and neceſſary exerciſes, both of our generall and particular callings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sleep is ſweet and pleaſing to fleſh and blood, and ſo is ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such who are aſleep, deſire, that no man awake them, and they draw the curtains before them to ſhut out light; even ſo do thoſe who lie aſleep in ſecurity, they delight therein, and in darkneſſe, and therefore deſire not to be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, by having their faults told them, and their works of darkneſſe to be brought to the light.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In ſleep there is no exerciſe of the ſenſes, nor motion; even ſo, while men lie aſleep in ſecurity, there is no exerciſe of the ſpirituall ſenſes of the ſoul; in ſeeing, hearing, taſting, ſmelling, or feeling, as it ought; nor is that motion which ſhould be, in the diligent diſcharge of our duty, in religious exerciſes, of prayer and repentance, and other holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sleep is the image of death corporall, and ſecurity, I may ſay, is the fore-runner (if God awaken not the ſoul) of death eternall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The effects of ſleep are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In ſleep, Fancy rules, and therefore ſleep oftimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces dreams, that are deceitfull; and when men awake, makes them but ſad by diſapointment, and penſive in the end: Even ſo does ſecurity, making men dream to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and preſume of freedome from puniſhment, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to ſalvation, though they lie in ſecurity, and live ſtill in ſin; while in the mean time, judgments temporall ſeize upon them unawares, as they did on <hi>Sodom,</hi> or they be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away with the rich fool to eternall puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sleep laies a man open (as it were) unto many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as, of robbery, captivating, and killing, as we may ſee in the examples of <hi>Sampſon, Siſera,</hi> and <hi>Olofernes,</hi> &amp;c. And even ſo does ſecurity, to many ſpirituall and alike dangers; therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your adverſary the devill is a roaring Lion, walking about, ſeeking whom he may devour, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8. Matth.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:114769:106"/>
3. (As we ſee here) it cauſes a withdrawing of Chriſt from us, and makes the means of grace, which is the word or voice of our Beloved, the leſſe effectuall, our prayers more feeble, our zeal leſſe fervent, our love to be colder, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in holy exerciſes to decay, our faith leſſe vigorous, and our practiſe of obedience more ſlack and ſlender: and finally, breeds much pains to the ſoul, before (as <hi>David</hi> ſaies) it be reſtored to that joy, which ſometimes it was wont to find in the comfortable preſence of Chriſt, and vigour of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly graces, whoſe force the ſleep of ſecurity has ſo much abated.</p>
                  <p>But though ſhe ſleep, yet it is ſpecially to be remarked, that ſhe ſaies, Her heart was waking, which ſhowes, that her ſleep was not like a deadly lethargy, or that her heart or conſcience in that ſleep, was like <hi>Nabal's,</hi> which died within him altogether; but ſhe retained the life of grace ſtill in her ſoul, and that ſeed remained in her, whereof <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, becauſe ſhe is born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. the work of which new-birth can never be extinguiſhed, which is a ſingular comfort, and which we have confirmed unto us, both in the old, and in the New Teſtament, <hi>Jer. 32. 40. Rom. 11. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 5. Joh. 10. 29. Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and <hi>Phil. 2. 13. &amp;c.</hi> Which perſeverance in grace, and eſtate thereof, they have onely from God, and his Spirit, moving on their hearts, as he did in the Creation on the waters; and who keeps the ſeed of grace in them, and them by it, from full and finall falling away.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, they may be ſometimes ſore wounded and ſhaken, as <hi>Peter was,</hi> for their humiliation, but not quite deſtitute of ſaving grace, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t majorum etiam ruina, ſit minorum cautela.</hi> As alſo by ſin, the act of grace for a time may be reſtrained, as of repentance, and ſuch other holy duties, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 59. is mentioned, which we ſee to have been the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s ſecurity; but the habit of grace can never be loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not acquired, but infuſed by him, whoſe gifts are without repentance. As likewiſe ſome degrees of faith, love, zeal, repentance, and the like, may be loſt; but not all faith, all love, all zeal, &amp;c. for the ſeed ſtill remains, becauſe of the new birth.</p>
                  <p>Followes, next to the Churches acknowledgment of her ſecurity, wherein ſhe lay, Chriſt's carriage and care to awake her out of the ſame; which is, by his voice, which ſhe knowes,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114769:106"/>
and acknowledges to be the voice of her beloved, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof are theſe: 1 His compellation of her; 2 His petition; and 3 The reaſons thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, our Saviour uſeth his voice, to awake her out of this her ſecurity, not immediately uttered, but mediately, in the ordinary exerciſe of the holy Miniſtry, whom whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hears, they hear him, <hi>&amp; contra;</hi> and by this his voice in the mouths of his holy Prophets, Apoſtles, and faithfull Paſtors, has he called upon his Church, and awaked her from time to time, when (like the wiſe Virgins) ſhe has fallen aſleep; which is his ſingular kindneſſe towards her, when he ſo awakes her, that ſhe ſhould not be ſurpriſed by her ſpirituall enemies, or periſh with the wicked world.</p>
                  <p>This is likewiſe to be remarked, how the faithfull, even in this their ſleep, can diſcern and tell, that when his Word is truly preached, it is the voice of Chriſt which they hear, and that doth call upon them, according as he ſaies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 4. That his ſheep know his voice, and will not follow a ſtranger, but flee from him; for they know not the voice of ſtrangers. They have therefore a diſcerning judgment, which the Romaniſt's deny to God's people, and are not like many, who halt between truth and idolatry, and will tell, that they know not which is the true religion, or the voice of Chriſt, nor cannot judge thereof, when every ſect and profeſſion boldly affirms, that they have the truth on their ſide, and therefore cannot reſolve with themſelves to whom to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here: Surely ſuch do plainly profeſſe, that they are void of God's Spirit, who by the gift of diſcerning, and rule of God's Word, cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry the ſpirits, nor, like Chriſt's ſheep, know the voice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe attributes to the voice of her beloved, <hi>knocking,</hi> as we ſee in like manner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. which ſhowes, not onely the earneſt deſire that Chriſt has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our ſalvation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and knocking at the dores of our hearts, that we may open to him, and that ſalvation may come into our houſe; but alſo this ſhowes, the power of Gods Word, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the power of God unto ſalvation, to all them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. the preaching whereof, is (as it were) the very hand of God, knocking at the dores of his Elect, and making them to hear and open to him, the everlaſting gates of their ſouls, that the King of glory may enter in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is to be remarked, that ſhe ſaies, It is the voice
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114769:107"/>
of her beloved that knocks, who is indeed, <hi>dilectus deo ut fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, angelis ut dominus, hominibus ut ſalus;</hi> beloved alſo juſtly, 1 For excellency of beauty, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. being the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and fairer than the children of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. like the roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and lilly of the vallies, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 1. And 2 For liberality of bounty, who not onely gives us all good things, but has given himſelf to us, and for us to the death of the croſſe, and, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. who is the giver of grace here, and of glory hereafter. Therefore worthy is he, on whom we ſhould ſet our love, whereby we ſhall reap theſe benefits: 1 The aſſurance of his love to us, and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of us. 2 This, like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, will devour up all ſinfull love. 3 As <hi>Iacob</hi>'s to <hi>Rachel,</hi> it will facilitate our obedience, and hardeſt ſufferings. 4 It will moſt enforce us of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to love our neighbour as we ought. And 5 aſſure us of that eſtate, wherein faith and hope ceaſing, our love onely ſhall remain, and be perfected in heaven.</p>
                  <p>In the particulars of this voice of her beloved, we have, 1 His compellation of her, which is by divers titles, <hi>My ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled;</hi> of all which we have ſpoken before: Onely herein this is <note place="margin">cap. 4. 9 cap. 1. 9. cap. 2. 14. cap. 4. 7.</note> remarkable, that he gives her theſe titles, even in her infirmity, while ſhe is lying now in the ſleep and ſlumber of carnall ſecurity, and has the dore of her heart cloſed (as it were) upon him, which ſhowes what affection he bears to her, or to any ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a love to him remains, though having many infirmities; according to which, (as the Pſalmiſt ſaies) the Lord deales not with us, nor rewards us according to our iniquities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 10, 13: But as a father pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in this ſpeech of our Saviours, we have what he deſires of her, which is, to open unto him; as <hi>Naaman</hi>'s ſervants ſaid unto him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. no great matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, eſpecially to ſo great and good a Lord, who had come to her dore ſo kindly, had waited on her ſo patiently, and was to benefit her thereby ſo abundantly, (as he ſaid to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus)</hi> as to bring ſalvation to her houſe.</p>
                  <p>In which ſuit of opening, we have to conſider; 1 What this imports. 2 If we have power to perform this. 3 The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which ſhould induce us. And 4 The manner how to perform the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:114769:107"/>
Firſt then, this imports, that our hearts by nature, and in the eſtate of ſecurity, are cloſed againſt God, ready patent to admit and let in Satan's ſuggeſtions, and 10 harbour the thoughts of vanity, worldlineſſe, or wickedneſſe; but not ſo patent to let in Chriſt Jeſus, in the power of his Word, and operation of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we have no power or ability of our ſelves, to perform this duty, till he who has the keyes of <hi>David,</hi> who opens and no man cloſes, and who opened the heart of <hi>Lyd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, the motives which may induce us to open to him, are many; for 1 He opened the heavens, and came down to ſuffer the death for our ſake that he might open to us that heavenly paradiſe that was ſhut before againſt us. 2. he opened in his Miniſtry, as that incarnate word, the good will of God to us for our great comfort. 3. He opened not only his hands and ſtretched-out armes on the croſſe, calling on all weary and loaden to come unto him, but his very heart likewiſe; <hi>ut paterent viſcera per vulnera.</hi> 4. He opened the grave and roſe therefrom to give us comfort that it had loſt it victory. 5. He opened the heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and aſcended in our nature to ſit there at his Fathers right hand in glory, and there to prepare a place for us and be our mediator. 6. He opens the heavens to our prayers, and at death to our ſoules or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and daily he opens his hand and fills us with his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and every living creature which is appointed for our uſe or comfort. And therefore for theſe reaſons and many more, ſhould not we open to him when he comes and knocks at our dores?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the manner how we ought to open the dore of our heart to him, is, 1. Timely for we know not how long he will ſtand and knock, as we ſee in this place, and if we open not unto him readily and timely, how ſoon he will depart and it coſt us great pains before we find him againe, neither know we how long our eyes ſhalbe open, uncloſed by death, and the grave be opened for our bodies, and Hell for our ſoules, if we prove obſtinate. 2. We ſhould open joyfully; rejoyſing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114769:108"/>
that he who is ſalvation ſhould come to our houſe, as <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> rejoyced when the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came unto her, and <hi>Jacob</hi> was over-joyed when <hi>Joſeph</hi> came to meet him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 30. 3. We ſhould open unto him widely, enlarging our hearts with the full benſell of our deſires after him, and a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to obey him in all his commandements; therefore we are bidden, lift up thoſe everlaſting dores of ours, that the king of glory may come in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. or, caſt them wide open after the manner of receiving ſuch great perſonages. 4. We ſhould open to him wiſely, having purged and prepared the houſes of our hearts before, as we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 31. and the upper roome was for him wherein he did eate the paſſover, leſt otherwiſe when we have opened the dore, if he ſee but like a filthy and ſtinking dunghill, he diſdaine to come under ſo unworthy a roof.</p>
                  <p>Next to the action, the perſon to whom ſhe ſhould open, is, (to <hi>me,)</hi> ſayes her beloved, an empha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

So ſhould we by importunity of fervent prayer and earneſt deſire, preſſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our Saviour in like manner to enter and come within our hearts, and dwell therein here, that we may dwell with him for ever and ever hereafter: Which if we have done, we may know by theſe two marks and evidences, 1. As the graves at Chriſts death when they opened, they ſent forth their dead, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 52. Even ſo will a ſoul that opens to Chriſt, ſend forth all dead works of obedience to ſinne or <hi>Satan,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the ſame, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, he that confeſſes his ſinnes and forſakes them ſhall have mercy, 2. As the earth in the ſpring and in the month <hi>April,</hi> that hath it name from the earths opening it ſelf, brings forth pleaſant and ſweet flowers: even ſo, when the heart is opened to Chriſt it will bring forth the ſweet &amp; odoriferous flowers of prayer, praiſe, &amp; of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

practice, godly thoughts, godly words, and godly deeds.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why he is ſo earneſt with her by ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, as motives, to open unto him, is, 1. The great paines he has taken in coming to her in the very night time, which ordinarily is appointed for reſt, 2. The great patience and long ſuffering he has uſed, waiting on her, till his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</p>
                  <p>The ſimilitude is drawn from hence, as if a lover ſhould go farre in the night time, and indure great pains and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to viſit her whom he loves ſo dearly. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unſpeakable are the pains, ſorrowes and ſufferings that our Saviour has indured for us; and great alſo, yea wonderfull is his long ſuffering patience waiting for our repentance; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent likewiſe has his calling been upon us, and his knocking at the dore both of our hearts and eares, and yet, Who may ſay that all theſe have prevailed, or that he has opened his heart unto him? And therefore all the former ſerves the more to aggravate our guiltineſs and great unkindneſs unto him.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, does not Chriſt alwais dwell in the hearts of the regenerate, how is it then that he calles and knocks to let him in? Whereunto I anſwer, that there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the meaſure of grace, whereby Chriſt dwells in his Elect, as was in the blind mans recovery of his ſight whom Chriſt cured and ſavv men at firſt only like trees. So that Chriſt dwells in thoſe who have but the leaſt ſpark of a true and lively faith, but he knocks to have them to open the dores of their hearts wider, and to receive him after a fuller man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee here how changeable the eſtate of a Chriſtian is in this world: before, the Church vvas rejoyſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a fervent zeale and love of Chriſt, inviting him to come to his garden and eate his pleaſant fruits, all which now ſeems to be ſmothered, and vvhen he comes to her, and calls and knocks, yet ſhe opens not unto him, but maketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes.

2. The ingenuity of the godly may here likewiſe be ſeen, like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> butler, not bluſhing to confeſſe their faults and infirmity, that God may get glory, though vvith confuſion of their own faces; and therefore the Church here confeſſeth that ſhe had fallen aſleep into carnall ſecurity, as <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes his perſecution of Chriſts Church, and of all ſinners that he was the chief.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Here we perceive the difference between the godly and the unregenerate, and between the ſecurity vvherein the one falls, and the ſecurity of the other. In the godly there are two principles, fleſh and ſpirit, vvhereas in the unregenerate there is but one, for they are all fleſh, and therefore the godly though they ſleep, yet their heart vvaketh, and ſo their ſleep is like an unſound ſlumber, but the unregenerate their ſleep is like a dead lethargy, out of vvhich they cannot be awaked: as alſo the godly, only ſometimes fall into this ſleep, but the unregenerate continually do lye therein.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ſee here, by her confeſſion, that a true Chriſtian has a diſcerning Judgment of his ovvn ſpirituall eſtate, and is ſenſible of his ſoules ſickneſs or health, and what is the work of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit in him, as vve ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19, 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he ſhould thankfully and to his comfort acknowledge the good, as well as humbly, the evill that is in him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hence alſo we may conſider vvhat is the beſt eſtate of the heart, to wit, a waking heart or ſoul; which the more it be waking or watchfull, the leſſe it is in danger of its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies, and more ready and fit for receiving grace, and intertaining its bleſſed bridegroom Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whereas he comes firſt in this her ſlumbering ſecurity to her, and calls and knocks to awake her out of the ſame, we ſee the Lords gracious goodneſs, vvho deales not with us as vve do deſerve, and vvho like that loving ſhepherd that ſought the loſt ſheep, ſeeks us in like manner firſt, as the Lord did <hi>Adam,</hi> elſe vve ſhould never be able to avvake and ſeek after him.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By her acknovvledging that it vvas the voice of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved that knocked, we ſee that the godly, like Chriſts ſheep can diſcerne their ſhepherds voice, and put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen it and a ſtranger's, betvveen the green, vvholſome paſture and ſtill vvaters whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. and betvveen that vvhich is hurtfull and unvvholſome, or thoſe

                     <p n="8">8. The word of God preached is here called Chriſt's voice, and acknowledged ſo by his Spouſe, whereby we ſee, what reverence the godly carry to the Word, how it ought to be haunted unto, heard, and obeyed; and the cauſe of the contrary to be this, that men miſtake, with young <hi>Samuel,</hi> that to be man's word, which truly is Chriſt's own voice.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

2. The difference between the hearts of the regenerate and unregenerate, is this, The unregenerate, their hearts are altogether cloſed againſt Chriſt, for in them, all is fleſh, and no ſpirit; but the regenerate, their hearts have ſtill ſome entrance patent, as it were a lock-hole for Chriſt, to put in his hand, and which the Apoſtle calls, The ſeed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in them, and in their worſt eſtate; albeit they have much fleſh, yet they have ſome ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5. Whereas ſhe ſaies, that her bowells was moved, we may perceive, that true repentance begins at the inwards of the heart and ſoul, and makes a change firſt and a commotion there: therefore ſales <hi>David,</hi> Behold thou deſireſt truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part thou ſhalt make me to know wiſdome.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee, that true repentance is a riſing from ſin and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to holineſſe and a godly watchfulneſſe; therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, exhorting thereto, Awake thou who ſleeps, and riſe from the dead and Chriſt ſhall give thee light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. And as he who riſes, changes the poſture of his body, and quits the place and condition wherein he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lye aſleep; even ſo he who truly repents, changes the poſture of his ſoul, from an earthly and ſinfull diſpoſition, to a heavenly; and quits his former manner of converſation and company, and that delight which he had to lie in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecurity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſee, that true grace and the gift of converſion, is ever progreſſive and practicall; and therefore, from the moving of her bowells within her, ſhe comes to riſing, and to open the dore to her beloved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An evidence of Chriſt's comming to any ſoul in mercy, or any ſaving and comfortable touch of his, ſuch as the Leper found, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 3. is, that he leaves ever a ſenſible ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114769:112"/>
of ſvveet and ſavory grace behind him, which not only like oile or ointment ſupples more and more the former ſtiffe heart and vvill, and removes all impediments of his debarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more, but likevviſe inables to action, and makes all the actions of our Chriſtian obedience and indeavours to be acceptable to God like ſvveet ſmelling Myrrh or incenſe, and where this ſvveet ſmelling grace is not left; and that the plenty thereof in the ſoul kyths not in the hands, or practiſe of the life, it is a token that to ſuch an empty ſoul thereof, Chriſt as yet never came in mercy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe ſhovves to our comfort, that Chriſt never totally deſerts an elect ſoul, but howſoever he vvithdraw himſelf, yet he leaves that behind him, vvhich if we find, deſpaire not (if vve ſeek him) of his returne, or our finding him: for the Myrrh of his grace vvhich he left behind him, and that holy deſire of ſeeking after him, and of opening to him, (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſought after Chriſt vvhen on the vvay they miſſed him) is a pledge of, after finding him vvhom our ſoul loveth.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe is ſet down the evidence of a furder degree of grace yet in the ſpouſe of Chriſt but a dolorous diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Under which ſenſe of his withdrawing, ſhe ſayeth, My ſoul failed when he ſpake, to wit, when ſo lovingly he invited her to open unto him, ſo that the vvord then preſently ſpoken took not preſent effect, (as it uſually does not in many hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) but novv after ſhe had fallen in this temptation of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it doth, and thereby her conſcience is checked, as <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi> warning of his brethren concerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> did in the time of their feare and agony, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. and vvhich is one of the fruits to a godly ſoul of ſpirituall deſertion, or rather an end vvhy the Lord layes on them ſuch diſtreſſe of mind that they may call to remembrance under the ſame their former ſinnes vvhereof as yet they have not truly repented or been humbled for, and the vvarnings and threats of Gods word againſt the ſame, vvhich they then neglected.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe declares, that although upon her opening to him, he had vvithdrawn himſelf and was gone, yet ſhe faints not in weldoing nor gives over, but ſeeks him; and although ſhe found him not, yet ſtill ſhe inſiſts like the Cananitiſh vvoman or importunate vvidow, and calles upon him, but he anſwered not, vvhich action of ſeeking of Chriſt what it is, and hovv to be performed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have already ſhown, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 1.

And ſo we ſee, that either they dealt imprudently with her, being as <hi>Job</hi>'s friends, miſerable comforters, by miſtake, or miſapplication: or elſe they dealt impiouſly with her, by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious doctrine, afflicting more her ſoul thereby, than ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quieting or comforting the ſame: As we ſee in the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts their practice, who in place of Chriſt's ſole ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and merit of his ſuffering, obtrudes likewiſe man's own ſatisfaction, by Pennance, and ſuffering in purgatory; by doing whereof (ſo far as in them lies) they take away her vail from her, wherewith onely ſhe is clad and covered, (as we ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1.) and wherein onely, by a holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe doth inwrap her ſelf, which is, the ſole righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rging and pacifying vertue of his blood alone.</p>
                  <p>But what are the cauſes, why the ſoul is ſo reſtleſſe, that till ſhe find her beloved, ſhe cannot, but with the enduring of all pains and hazards, perſiſt and go on? I anſwer, There are two main cauſes thereof; the firſt is, the condition of the Subject, the ſecond of the Object. Firſt then, the Subject is the Soul, which is 1 tender; 2 ſpirituall. Firſt then, the ſoul in a believer, who is in a living eſtate, is moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being very ſenſible of any evill, eſpecially of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; wherefore when the ſoul hath once ſeen God in mercy, and taſted how good he is, and how comfortable has been his preſence, the loſſe of him to the ſoul cannot be but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; and this grief of the ſoul, is the very ſoul of grief,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114769:114"/>
as we ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. and like the tearing of the fleſh; whereas other griefs that are onely corporall, is like the tearing of the garment. Secondly, the ſoul is ſpirituall, therefore muſt meet with that which is ſpirituall, as fit for it; for as the body is not ſatisfied with things ſpirituall, ſo neither the ſoul with things corporall: Wherefore when the ſoul is in diſtreſſe, all the world to it is but like a great cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, which amounts to nothing, and can never be content, till it enjoy his ſpirituall preſence and fruition, who is the God of ſpirits; the more of whom it had before, the more bitter to it is the loſſe of him.</p>
                  <p>Next, the Object of the ſoul is God, who is ſuch, that the ſoul cannot be at reſt, till ſhe enjoy him, if we conſider, 1 either the quality of the object; or 2 the relation between the ſoul and the ſame; or 3 his operation. Firſt then, there are three qualities in God, which makes the ſoul ſo to long after him. 1 His goodneſſe and mercy, apprehending which, the ſoul thus reaſons with it ſelf: O unhappy wretch, that there ſhould be ſo ſweet a fountain, and that the ſtreams thereof ſhould flow forth to thouſands, and none unto me; as the prodigall ſaid, that there was ſo much bread in his fathers houſe, and he died for hunger. 2 His greatneſſe or power, whereof is mention made, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. 11. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 12. which power is two-fold: 1 Of Authority over all, as judge, having life and death, body and ſoul, in his hand: Now what a ſhaking of the ſoul is it, to apprehend by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, ſuch an one to be againſt it. 2 Of Ability, to work what he wills; and if once he pronounce ſentence, there is no way to eſchew it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 4. 3 Eternity, for God abides for ever, which makes his favour or anger the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the apprehenſion thereof ſo grievous, that it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes up the ſoul, and till his favour be regained, to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether reſtleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this threefold quality of the object, the relation wherein the Lord ſtands to a believer is moſt near and dear, for he is a friend, a father, and a husband; the moſt active friend, the kindeſt father, and the moſt loving husband; the loſſe of one of which is great, but of all three moſt grievous: And therefore is the ſoul reſtleſſe, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.</p>

                  <p>THE 3 parts of this Chapter are theſe: 1 Is ſet down the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were ſo ſtraitly charged in the former Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. their queſtion to the Spouſe of Chriſt, and her anſwer, to the fourth verſe. 2 Chriſt's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed praiſe of her, whereby he ſhews the graces of his Church, to the tenth verſe. And 3. The manifeſtation of his tender love towards her, by divers expreſſions, from the tenth verſe to the end.</p>
                  <p>In the former Chapter, the Spouſe had at large commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her Beloved, and that which the ſame now does produce, is, The daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> their enquirie for him, that joyntly with her they may likewiſe ſeek after him: ſo powerful is the manifeſtation of the excellency of Chriſt, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and of the benefits that the Church has by him, that it kindles a deſire in the hearts of all elect hearers, to ſeek after him, that they may lay hold on him by the hand of faith; and, as old <hi>Simeon</hi> got him in his arms, they may apply him to their ſouls, to their eternall ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; an example whereof we may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.

                  <p>But here one thing chiefly is remarkable, how they ſay, not ſimply, <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone, that we may ſeek him:</hi> but, <hi>that we may ſeek him with thee,</hi> this being the onely right way, to ſeek Chriſt and find him, when we ſeek him with his Church, and as himſelf directs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. ſaying, <hi>Go forth by the ſteps of the flock, and feed thy kids by the ſhepheard's tents;</hi> and when we do not, as perverſe hereticks, and giddy ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and brain-ſick ſeparatiſts do, who pretend, that they ſeek Chriſt, but will after a ſingular and ſelf-conceited way of their own do ſo, but not with his Church, in the

                  <p>Likewiſe he is ſaid to go down, not onely to his garden in the ſingular number, meaning thereby, the Catholick Church in generall, which is His (as has been ſhown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by a manifold right; but alſo to his <hi>gardens,</hi> in the plurall, there to feed, denotating every particular Church, and every ſoul in them, over whom he has a ſpeciall and particular inſpection, and to whom he has promiſed his comfortable preſence, and conſtant abode with them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
                  <p>The end of which his preſence, by the power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with his Church, and externall miniſtry thereof, is, <hi>To gather lillies;</hi> that is, to gather together all his Elect, that before his ſecond comming, they may be all one flock, in one ſheep-fold, under one ſhepheard; which Elect of his, why they are called Lillies, we have ſhown before, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

                  <p>Here beginnes the ſecond part of this Chapter, wherein the beloved renewes the praiſe of his ſpouſe, after the ſame

manner, and almoſt in the ſame words as he had done before in the fourth Chapter, and yet without any tautology, as might be thought, or ſuperfluous repetition, but moſt fitly and requiſitly, he ſpeakes in ſo kind a manner to his ſpouſe, after his former ſilence, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 6. Now to her comfort, to teſtifie his preſence again, and that notwithſtanding of her former faultineſs, which had made him to withdraw himſelf from her and ſuffer her to indure ſuch diſtreſſe, yet he would not fully nor finally deſert her, as alſo in reſpect that ſhe had bewailed her offence and had riſen and ſought him ſorrowing leſt by her ſinne and ſecurity, it might ſeem ſhe had loſt his love and her former comelineſs in his ſight, therefore for her comfort he renewes the commendation of her beauty (as ſhe had renewed her carriage) and addes thereto, that thereby he might witneſſe to her the conſtancy of his liking.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe then ſhe is commended, 1. From her beauty, 2. From her comelineſs; and, 3. From her terrour to her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: firſt then ſhe is ſaid to be beautifull as <hi>Tirzah</hi> which was a city in <hi>Canaan</hi> not farre from <hi>Samaria,</hi> wherein, for pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Situation, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> built his royall place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after the kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> kept their court, as we reade, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 17.

Laſtly, ſhe is compared in reſpect of her eſtate Militant on earth to an army terrible with banners. 1. The Generall of which army is he whom <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaw <hi>(Joſhua</hi> 5. 14.) The captaine of the Lords hoſte, victorious ever and triumphant over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 12. &amp;c. on whoſe head are many crownes, whoſe eyes are as flames of fire, and whoſe name is King of kings and Lord of lords bleſſed for ever, 2. His ſouldiers, are all ſonnes to the moſt high, and coheires with their Generall of a heavenly kingdome, of undanted courage in greateſt extremities, as Martyrs have proved, and of invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible valour, more then that of <hi>David,</hi> or his worthies, and ſo there was never ſo noble and valiant army as this, 3.

They are all one compact body in a holy unity of faith and love, though they be diſperſed thorow the whole earth, marching all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in their ſeverall ſtations wherein they are ſet by their great generall; and 6.

                  <p>Likewiſe, how he calls her his Dove, we have ſpoken in like manner: Therefore, 1 She is not her own, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. ult.</hi> becauſe bought with a price. 2 Neither is ſhe the world's, for ſo it would love her; whereas on the contrary it hates her, as it did her Head before her.</p>
                  <p>The firſt property then, from whence ſhe is deſcribed, is her chaſtity, implied in this, that ſhe is called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled;</hi> not that ſhe is free from all ſinning, ſo long as ſhe is in this life; but ſhe is ſo perfectly by juſtification, and reputed ſo in Chriſt by gracious acceptation, and inchoatively made holy by ſanctification, and made perfect by the perfection of parts, which is evangelicall, though not of degrees, as the Law requires, and is not competent to her eſtate militant.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſhe is called <hi>One,</hi> all perfection riſing from unity, and returning thither; ſo that every thing, the neerer it comes to perfection, gathers it ſelf up the more towards unity: Therefore God is one, there is one Heaven, one Earth, one Church in the earth, one King of his Church, one Law, one Faith, one Baptiſm, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as there is perfection in unity, ſo there is ſtrength; as on the contrary, a City or Kingdome divided againſt themſelves, cannot ſtand; therefore it is ſaid, That

for the diviſions of <hi>Reuben,</hi> were great thoughts of heart.</p>
                  <p>The Church then is called one, 1 as not being divided; 2 as not being multiplied.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the former; Whether we conſider the Church as an aggregation, of the outward viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, of Chriſtian profeſſors in common; or as the inviſible and univerſall Church of the Elect onely, it is ſtill one, profeſſing one Lord, and ſo being one in the Head; one Faith, and ſo being one in the heart; and one Baptiſm, and ſo being one in the outward face thereof: No naturall body being more one, than this myſticall is, which one head rules, one ſpirit quickens, one blood waſhes, one food nouriſhes, and one roab covers, &amp;c. And ſo it is one in it ſelfe, and one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is one with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22.

                  <p>And as the Church of Chriſt is one, not being divided, ſo is ſhe one, not being multiplied: For as the Lord gave but one <hi>Eva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. In reſpect of ſpirituall chaſtity, and pure worſhip of God only, according to the rule of his Word, that ſhe iscalled <hi>undefiled:</hi> Then we ſee, that what Church ſoever, pretend what ſhe will, defiles her ſelf with idolatry, which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall whoordom, and departing from the ſincerity of the Word of God, goes a whooring after the traditions of men, ſuperſtition, and will-worſhip, adoring the creature, whereas onely they ſhould worſhip the Creator.

                  <p>Others take this to be Chriſt's ſpeech to his Spouſe, now after her converſion, when he has manifeſted himſelf unto her, who in the time of his deſertion of her before, had gon abroad, and painfully ſought him, vvhere-ever ſhe might find him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. and therefore now he bids her return (as ſhe had done before when ſhe found him) to her own home, promiſing his comfortable preſence with her hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that he would look upon her, lifting up upon her (as <hi>David</hi> deſired) the light of his countenance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. And therefore the ſtyle that he gives her, ſuitable to this work of his mercy, is <hi>Shulamit,</hi> from <hi>Shalem,</hi> (from whence <hi>Jeruſhalem)</hi> which ſignifies Peace, becauſe he was to ſpeak peace now, to her formerly diſtreſſed conſcience, and to ſay
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114769:128"/>
to her ſoul, that he was her ſalvation. Wherefore alſo is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, that which is to be ſeen in this <hi>Shulamite,</hi> and in the whole progreſſe of the Lord's dealing with her; to wit, as it were the company of two Armies, his manifold mercies victorious over her many miſeries.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

Therefore none ſhould aſcribe perfection to themſelves, as the Phariſees did, and Papiſts do, of whom it may be ſaid, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 12. but ſhould do as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. and acknowledge, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.</p>

                  <p>THe parts of this Chapter are two. In the firſt to the Tenth <hi>verſe,</hi> is ſet down a further deſcription yet of the Churches graces, by a commendation of her, from her very feet upwards to her head, and all the parts of her body farre different from her naturall condition, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. And in the ſecond is ſet down the mutuall delight and deſire each one to another which is between Chriſt and his ſpouſe.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt verſe then beginnes her deſcription wherein, 1. We have how ſhe is ſtyled, O Prince's daughter, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thereby from her noble race, as ſhe is likewiſe called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. This not being by her firſt birth or nature, whereof is mention made, <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 16. 3. but by her regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and grace, whereof we have the deſcription, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. and 1. 13. God who is the King of kings being her father, Chriſt Jeſus being her elder brother, the glorious Angells her ſervants, and heaven being her inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p>Next to her ſtyle which he gives her, he beginnes her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from the beauty of her feet with ſhoos, whereby is ſignified her holy walking (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) in the paths of righteouſneſs and wayes of Gods commandements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23 and 119. for then only are her feet beautifull in Gods ſight with that beauty of holineſs ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. and 29. 2. Whereas when men depart and go aſtray from the Lords precepts, becauſe of the pollution of ſinne and their walking in the crooked wayes thereof, their feet are moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and void of all beauty, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 59. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Next, her feet are ſaid to be beautifull with ſhoos, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10. and which are expounded by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 15. to be the preparation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of peace; in the true knowledge, holy profeſſion and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obedience whereof while, ſhe walks conſtantly, her feet
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:114769:129"/>
are truly ſaid to be beautifull with ſhoos, as theirs alſo are ſaid to be on the mountaines who bring the glad tydings of peace, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 52. 7. Now, there may be a threefold or fourfold reaſon why her feet behoved to be ſhod with ſhoos, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being of ſo noble a birth, and ſpouſe alſo to ſo great a King it were not ſuteable to her birth nor place, to go baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or barefooted, but to have her feet ſhod, yea beautifull with ſhoos, as all the reſt of her body is ſaid to be richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned. 2. Becauſe of the way wherein ſhe walks, being not only narrow, but likewiſe rough and rugged through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſharp and thorny croſſes and other difficulties which <hi>Satan</hi> caſts in, to diſcourage her, into the way of godlineſs, againſt all which ſhe is armed and prepared being thus ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace, and ſhrinks not but treads them all down, being in all theſe (as ſayes the Apoſtle) more then a conquerour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. 3 Her feet are ſhod with ſhoos, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were injoyned to be, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. To ſhow that ſhe muſt make for a journey, which the life of all the godly is here, yea, as the Angell ſaid to <hi>Eliah, 1 King.</hi> 19. 7. Which is a great journey to go, to wit, from earth to heaven, or the <hi>Egypt</hi> and wilderneſs of this world to the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> and, 4. Her feet are ſhod with ſhoos, <hi>Ne terrae adhaereant, Col.</hi> 3. that her feet or affections cleave not to the earth, as their's do, who (like the kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly, the joynts of her thighes, which make her motion in walking, are ſaid to be like Jewels, the work of the hand of a cunning workman, ſignifying thereby how precious in Gods ſight like a Jewell well ſet in Gold, are her ſtraight ſteps and orderly walking in the paths of righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Goſpell wherewith ſhe is ſhod: and ſo as ſhe is glorious within by ſaving grace in her heart, ſo is ſhe likewiſe without, in the actions of her life, ſhining like Jewels by her good works (as our Saviour exhorts,) <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Or like the wiſe virgins Lamps, which were burning and ſhined, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>

And not onely does ſhe profeſſe that ſhe would go forth and attend his coming but alſo when ſhe had found him without, ſhe would kiſſe him (which was the ancient manner, and is yet, of ſalutation and welcoming,) which kiſſes are either like that of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, when ſhe kiſſed his feet, of humble affection; or thoſe, whereby the Pſalmiſt willes all men to kiſſe the Sonne, leſt he be angry and they periſh in his wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. which are of homage and humble ſubmiſſion. And yet by doing ſo (ſhe ſayes) ſhe ſhould not give any juſt cauſe to be either aſhamed, as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 54. 4. or deſpiſed as <hi>David</hi> was by <hi>Michal,</hi> for doing that which was not comely or decent for a modeſt and chaſt virgin to do, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 16.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

Though it be the cuſtome of prophane <hi>Iſmaels</hi> to mock the religious, for religious duties, or like <hi>Michal</hi> to deſpiſe them, yet the ſpouſe of Chriſt and her true members are no whit ſcarred thereby, nor moved more than <hi>David</hi> was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt therefrom, but rather to inſiſt therein with courage and conſtancy, becauſe they labour onely to approve themſelves to the Lord therein, their own conſcience, and the truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and therefore, as the woman in the <hi>Revelation</hi> has the Moon under her feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.

                     <p n="1">1. We ſee what ſhould be the very upſhot of all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to wit, to be in Gods favour above all things, (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did chooſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6.) and to be neerly united to Chriſt, precious in his ſight, and had by him in perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and, in a word, to be as a ſeal on his heart and a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net on his arme.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we would have our ſelves to be ſo to Chriſt, then we muſt labour that he be ſo to us, to wit, as a ſeal upon
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:114769:140"/>
our heart, in tender love to him, neer conjunction with him, mindfulneſs ever of him, and having the ſtamp of his Image imprinted on our ſoules, that thereby we may be known, (like <hi>Ceſars</hi> coine) that we belong to him: neither let us ſet him onely as a ſeal on our heart by inward piety, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on our arme by outward practice thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee that, That which makes her to deſire to be ſet as a ſeale on his heart and arme, is, ſtrong love towards him, ſo that although our faith and other graces be feeble and faint in us, yet if our hearts tell us that our love to Chriſt is ſtrong, and that with <hi>Peter</hi> we may ſay, Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee, the ſame may be a great comfort unto us, <hi>John</hi> 21. 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is out of this ſtrong love of hers towards him that makes her ſo earneſtly deſire this ſpirituall union with him to be as a ſeale on his heart and arme, ſo that we may know our love to Chriſt by this our deſire, and degree thereof, for where our love is ſmall or feeble, ſtrong or fervent, ſo will our deſire be of this ſpirituall union.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The love ſhe carries to him is compared to coales of fire, which indeed (like that which came down from Heaven, to kindle and conſume the ſacrifices) is of a heavenly deſcent, and is compared to fire (as the baptiſt ſpeaks of our inward baptiſm) 1. Becauſe as fire has light with it, ſo the love of Chriſt has the knowledge of him whom we love, <hi>Ignoti enim nulla cupido.</hi> 2. Fire has heat and warmneſs with it, and ſo has the love of God, whereby it heats our cold and frozen hearts, and warmes them with mutuall love to God and zeal of his glory. 3. Fire purges the droſſe of mettalls; and ſo does Chriſt's love, our hearts from corruption. 4. Fire melts the good mettall and makes it plyable to the hand of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith; and ſo does the love of Chriſt, and makes it plyable to the operation of the ſpirit, 5. Fire in the flame thereof bends continually upward; and ſo does the love of Chriſt ſeeking his glory and thoſe things that are above: therefore let us trie by theſe works and operations, if we have in us the true love of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By theſe things whereunto this ſpirituall love is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared which are in themſelves invincible and overcome all other, eſpecially ſuch a flaming fire which no waters nor the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:114769:141"/>
floods thereof can any way quench, and whereby (as is ſaid) are underſtood the ſharpeſt afflictions or moſt cruell perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, we may ſee what is the moſt ſoveraigne preſervative and fortification of the ſoul againſt the time of trouble that we may ſtand as the well built houſe againſt all ſtormy tempeſts, whatſoever, to wit, the love of Chriſt and of his ſacred truth, which ſhall make us (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks and Martyrs practiſed) to triumph, ſaying, In all theſe we are more then conquerours.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This clauſe which ſayes, If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love it would utterly be contemned, ſhowes, that although worldling's hearts may be wonne by <hi>Satans</hi> temptation from the love of Chriſt and his truth, as we ſee in <hi>Demas, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. yet in them that are truly godly there is no ſuch force in any worldly treaſures, who count all things but dung and loſſe in compariſon of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus their Lord.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. We ſee the two maine temptations whereby <hi>Satan</hi> ſeeks to alienate or draw away our hearts from the love of Chriſt and his truth, and make us quit the ſame, to wit, the waters and floods of trouble and perſecution on the one hand; and if that cannot ſerve the turne, then the allurement of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches which overcame <hi>Judas,</hi> and wherewith he tempted Chriſts himſelf, ſhowing him all the kingdomes of the world and the glory thereof.</p>

                  <p>Here this holy and heavenly Song drawes to an end. In the concluſion whereof we have theſe points, 1.

There is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon made between <hi>Solomons</hi> frultfull vineyard, and Chriſt's Church on earth, 3.

ſame, and that he would haſten his ſecond coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ſhe might no longer walk by faith but by ſight, and injoy his preſence for ever in the heavens hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, we know before our Saviours ſuffering and aſcending to the heavens that the Church was then onely within the pale of the Jewiſh nation, who were at that time Gods onely peculiar people to whom his oracles were committed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. all others being counted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Gentiles, and aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till the partition-wall was removed, and that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed which was promiſed to the Sonne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I have made thee a light to the Gentiles, and the ſalvation to the ends of the earth: which by a viſion was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to <hi>Peter,</hi> whereby he ſaw, that God had put no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as he ſayes himſelf) between Jewes and Gentiles, after that by faith he had purified their hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 13. and 9. Of this converſion then of the Gentiles &amp; enlargement of the Church the ſpouſe here ſpeaks, ſaying, We have a little ſiſter and ſhe bath no breaſts: where we have to conſider, 1. How ſhe calles her, 2. How ſhe ſayes, <hi>We</hi> in the plurall, 3. How ſhe ſayes in the preſent, we <hi>have</hi> a little ſiſter, 4. How ſhe is ſaid to have no breaſts, and. 5. The care that ſhe has of her, ſaying, What ſhall we do for our ſiſter in the day that ſhe ſhal be ſpoken for?</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech then it ſelf we ſee is Metaphoricall taken from the manner of Elder ſiſters that are eſpouſed, their ſpeaking of their younger that is not yet for marriage, being but little in ſtature and having no breaſts, or paps formed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt then, this being according to the manner of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> (as has been noted before) that the whole is called the Mother, and the parts of the Catholick Church are called ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, In this ſpeech then, the Jewiſh Church calles the Church of the Gentiles to be collected of all nations, a ſiſter, 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt, who is our elder brother, and who calleth his Church whether of Jewes or Gentiles, his ſiſter, as we ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. Next, in relation to her ſelf, for unity of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with her, one faith, one father, one Spirit, one Baptiſm, and one in affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:114769:142"/>
Next, this ſiſter is called a little ſiſter, though this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might ariſe, why ſhe ſhould call her ſo, ſeeing the Church of the Gentiles in greatneſs and number was farre to exceed the Church of the Jewes; whereunto I anſwer, that ſhe is ſo called, 1. Not in reſpect of her number which was to be, but becauſe of her number then, which were but a few proſelyts; or elſe, 2. In reſpect of time, becauſe the time was not yet come that the Gentiles ſhould be called, and by faith eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Chriſt, in reſpect whereof being of nonage ſhe was as yet little, or as a young damſell not ripe to be betrothed; 3. In reſpect of her condition at her firſt converſion, at that time, not being yet ſo numerous; and, 4. She might be called little, not onely in reſpect of number then (as is ſaid,) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſtrength, ſtature, and knowledge; in all which after her firſt converſion being conformed, ſhe was daily onely to grow.</p>
                  <p>2. It is ſaid in the plurall, <hi>we have</hi> a little ſiſter, though at that time there was no other Church but that one of the Jewes, therefore including Chriſt in this ſpeech with her ſelf, ſhe ſayes in the plurall, We have a little ſiſter, thereby to ſhow, that the Church of the Gentiles is not onely a ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Church of the Jewes, but alſo to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. He being the firſt begotten amongſt many brethren, who are all (as the Apoſtle ſayes,) fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. As alſo to ſhow that he loves her as dearly, will care for her and protect her, as ever he did the Church of the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>3. She ſayes in the preſent time <hi>we have</hi> a little ſiſter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church of the Gentiles many hundreth years thereafter was not to be called, 1. In reſpect of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Gods eternall decree, unto whom all future things are as preſent in his ſight, 2 In reſpect of prediction, and promiſes made thereanent, which in all times are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. 3 For the certainty of accompliſhment in reſpect whereof to the eye of faith, which gives a ſort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to things that are not yet, things to come are preſent, as alſo for the ſame reſpect the Scripture uſually ſpeaks (as here) of things to come as if they were preſent, or praeterit, as we <hi>ſee, Iſay.</hi> 53. 3, 4, 5. and elſe where. For all theſe reſpects,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:114769:142"/>
ſhe ſayes in the preſent, <hi>we have</hi> a little ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>4. This little ſiſter is ſaid to have no breaſts, that is, a ſetled Miniſtry affording the ſincere milk of ſound doctrine out of the old and new Teſtament; becauſe as yet ſhe was like <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was called out of <hi>

Yea which eſtate of the Church of the Gentiles her not having a ſetled Miniſtry after the Goſpell was preached, and after Chriſt's aſcenſion, we may ſee in many place, as, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 21, 22. and <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>5. Touching the care that ſhe has for this her little ſiſter, it is in theſe words, What ſhall we do for our ſiſter in the day that ſhe ſhalbe ſpoken for? that is, what furtherance ſhall we yield to her for her converſion, increaſe and eſtabliſhment in the truth, when ſhe becomes as a woo'd bride to Chriſt by the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was to <hi>Iſaac</hi> by the ſteward of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe. In the which work of converſion, increaſe and eſtabliſhment, ſhe acknowledges two agents, one chief or principall, and another Miniſteriall or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and therfore ſhe ſpeaks in the plurall number, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What ſhall we do? the principall and fountaine-agent of all grace, enlightning and eſtabliſhment being Chriſt, who is the Author of all bleſſings upon his Church, and the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church of the Jewes being the inſtrumentall agent when by the Miniſtry of the holy Apoſtles and Evangeliſts who were of the Jewiſh nation the Goſpell was preached, and as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> they were made choſen veſſells to carry his name before the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
                  <p>This therefore they did for their little ſiſter in the day that ſhe was ſpoken for, and thereby, 1. Did let her ſee her baſe condition by nature, before, like poor captive <hi>Eſther,</hi> the King of kings ſet his love upon her, 2. The glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate whereunto ſhe was called, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. as we ſee the ſame typified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. And yet a farre more glorious eſtate whereunto ſhe ſhould be advanced in the kingdome of Glory,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:114769:143"/>
deſcribed unto us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And 3. they did deal between her wooer and her, with him by prayer, and vvith her by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Rebecca</hi> to get her conſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 57. 4 As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſervant gave unto <hi>Rebecca</hi> jewells of ſilver, and Jewells of Gold and raiment, <hi>v.</hi> 53. to adorne and prepare her for his Maſter, even ſo as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the grace of Gods ſpirit by their Miniſtry, they did prepare and adorne her likevviſe as a bride to preſent her to Chriſt. And, 5. As the Apoſtle did the <hi>Galatians</hi> and others, they vvatched over her and vvarned her that ſhe ſhould not be tempted by other baſe and allureing wooers, and dore in her affection, or like <hi>Dinah</hi> gad by inconſtancy and go a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after any ſuch, but keep her ſelf as a chaſte virgin to her heavenly bridegroom, till the day of the ſolemnization of the marriage with her in the higheſt Heavens, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, Even ſo I take her before my Father, and before his Angells.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="5">5.

And therefore, 1. When ever we heare Gods word we ſhould conſider what is intended therein, and accordingly attend thereto, and count it our greateſt happineſs if it produce this effect upon us, as to woe and winne us to Chriſt.

                  <p>Not but that our Saviour lets alſo forth his vineyard to keepers and dreſſers thereof; as we ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 33. and theſe receive likewiſe their hire or reward, as we ſee in the parable of thoſe who were called to labour in his vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.

Next the keepers of Chriſts vineyard they ſhall indeed receive a reward for their labours, yea, a very great one, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhowes and the Apoſtle declares, but this cometh from the Maſter of the vineyard himſelfe, who promiſed it, but not from ſhareing in the fruits of the vineyard, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 9.

                     <p n="1">1. Out of this ſtyle which ſhe gives him, ſaying, O thou that dwells in the garden, we learne this leſſon of comfort, that Chriſt is not onely preſent with his Church, but as husbands are bidden to dwell with their wives, ſo he, is a dweller with her, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. as he has promiſed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 23.
