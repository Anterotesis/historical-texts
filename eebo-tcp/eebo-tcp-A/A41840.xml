            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neither shall we use many words to this purpose; Only, we find some help is offered unto thee, in three most weighty and concerning points of Christian Religion. <hi>1.</hi> How by the
<pb facs="tcp:107523:3"/>
lively exercise of faith; thou may apply the great and precious Promises. <hi>2.</hi> How by faith thou may advance the work of Sanctification. And <hi>3.</hi> How thy faith may grow up unto Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Of all which we may truly say, that nothing can more seasonably take up the thoughts nor bring more advantage to the souls of the Lords people in these times.</p>
            <p>O how necessary is it in such troublesome days, to learn, how <hi>through Faith and Patience, we may inherit the Promises</hi>: and now when our strong corruption (hath in a manner necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the wise Physician to mix unto us so bitter a cup, and give so strong a potion, in what a fainting and swouning condition must we be, if <hi>by the two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie,</hi> we reoeive not also <hi>the strong consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when profanity and ungodlinesse hath so abounded in these Nations, that <hi>from the top of the head to the sole of the foot, there is no soundnesse, but wounds and bruises, and putrifying sores</hi>: And when the corruptions of the Time like the <hi>sons of Zerviah,</hi> are grown too strong, even for the <hi>Davids</hi> who are amongst us; What should we study with more earnestnesse, then to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our hearts by faith,</hi> and by <hi>having these promises, to cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holinesse in the fear of the Lord? 3.</hi> When the Lord hath removed us so far from peace, that the souls of many have even <hi>forget prosperity,</hi> and the multiplied changes and

            <p>As to the manner of handling it: It is true, much accuracy and neatnesse, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in any work of this nature, being only the hasty gleanings of a Church Writer; And as to livelinesse and power, though it he as easie to draw a picture with the heat and motion of a living man, as to Write or Print, these lively motions of the spirit which do often accompany the Lords Messengers in Preaching, and in an eminent measure were also let out upon this blessed Author, yet we suppose thou will find, the matter most seriously and feelingly spoken unto, as from a heart <hi>which believed, and therefore spake:</hi> Yea, both conceptions and expressions savouring much of an exercised Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not only much taken up in communion with God within it self, but even thirsting also, and panting for the salvation of others; nay (in some measure) <hi>travelling in birth, till Christ might be formed in them.</hi> Oh, that more of this holy zeal and fervency, might accompany this great measure of light and knowledge in the mysteries of the Gospel that the Lord hath graciously bestowed both on Pastors and People in this generation, that once again we might see, (as in the dayes of <hi>John Baptist) the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven suffering violence, and the

            <p>MAy we not truly say, that if ever the Christians who live in those dayes shall be advanced to stand within the holy place, and shall inherit everlasting life, all these are now before his Throne may lay aside their harps and give us leave to sing? Will it not be a mysterie, suppose ye, unto heavenly <hi>Enoch</hi> that spent so much of his time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship with God, when he shall behold such Christians within that everlasting rest, that have spent so little of their time in corresponding with God? Will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107523:5"/>
it not be a mystery unto believeing <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he shall behold such misbelievers, such disputers of the promises of God, advanced to reign with Christ? Will it not be a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery unto wrestling <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he shall behold these Christians once crowned with immortal glory, that did so little know what it was as Princes to wrestle with God, till they did prevail: Will it not be a wonder to patient <hi>Iob,</hi> when he shall behold such impatient Christians as we have been, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that blessed place of repose? Will it not be a mystery unto holy <hi>David,</hi> when he shall behold such unmortified Christians entering within that City, into which no unclean thing doth enter? Will it not be a mystery unto tender <hi>Iosiah,</hi> to behold such Christians as we are, that have our hearts dying as a stone within us, entering into Heaven? Will it not be a mysterie unto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> to behold such hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Christians as the most part of us are, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering within the holy place, and to see those that have been cloathed with hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and guile, now cloathed with the robes of immortal Glory? And will it not be a mysterie unto self denied <hi>Paul,</hi> when he shall behold so proud and selfish Christians enter into Heaven? Give me leave to say this, go where we will, we shall be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and singular; for if we shall go into eternity of pain, we shall be the greatest debtors unto the infinit justice of God, in regard of mercies we have received: and if we shall enter into eternity of joy, we shall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107523:5"/>
be the greatest debtors unto the spotlesse grace of Christ, in regard of mercy we have abused. There shall be none in heaven like to us, and if we shall go to hell, there shall be few there that may be compared unto us. And let me but adde thus further before I come to the words, go where we will, we shall be out of doubt with our condition: Within a short time a real Christian shall be exalted above the reach of his misbelieving, a hypocrite shall be depressed below the reach of his faith, and one that is grosly in nature, he shall be abased beyond the reach of his presumption: A Christian ere long shall m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sbelieve no more; a hypocrite ere long shall believe no more; and one that is grosly in nature shall ere long presume no more: there is no misbelief in heaven, and there is no faith nor presumption of well being in hell. But to come to that which we intend to speak to, we told you when first we began our discourse upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and exalting grace of Faith under a twofold notion and consideration. first, As it is justifying: And, secondly, as it is sanctifying. For the first, we resolved to speak to it in a twofold consideration. First, As it closeth with Christ simply as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon which it resteth, and of this we have spoken from that place, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3.23. Secondly, As it closeth with Christ, as held forth in the Promises. And now being to speak of it in this consideration, we have made choise of this place, in which those things concerning the promises, shortly.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107523:6"/>1. Ye have that fountain and spring from whence the promises do flow, holden forth in the first words of the verse, <hi>Whereby,</hi> or (as the words may be more fitly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) <hi>By whom</hi> relating unto Jesus Christ who is the original and spring of all the Promises.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The properties of the Promises, and these are, 1. The freedom of the promises held forth in that word, <hi>Given,</hi> whereby <hi>are given,</hi> which speaketh this, that the promises are free gifts flowing only from good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, 2. Their unchangeablenesse, and that is holden forth also in the word, <hi>Given,</hi> the gifts and calling of God, being without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 3. That they are <hi>exceeding great,</hi> and the Promises are called great, either in respect of that price that was laid down to purchase the Promises, or they are called great in respect of the great things that are contained in them. 4. That they are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>; Now the Promises are called preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; either in respect of their originall, that they come from precious Christ; or else in respect of this, that they are the object (I mean the object, <hi>quo,</hi> or by which) of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Faith, as it is called in the first verse of this Chapter; or else they are precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are things that a Christian ought to put a high account upon; for the word that is rendered <hi>precious</hi> may likewise be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>honourable,</hi> whereby are given unto us exceeding great and honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have holden forth in the words the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107523:6"/>
great advantage of the Promises, <hi>By them we are made partakers of the divine nature</hi>: Now this is not to be understood of any es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall conversion of our substance into the substance of God, but of a Christians having the divine vertues of Jesus Christ impressed upon his soul, and expressed in his life and conversation.</p>
            <p>And there is this lastly, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the words, even the time when the promises are eminen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly accomplished; It is, <hi>when we have escaped</hi>; or as the word is, <hi>When we have fled from the corruptions that are in the world through lust</hi>: That is the time when a Christian meeteth with the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Promises.</p>
            <p>Now before we can speak to any of these, we must speak a little unto some things as necessary to be known, in order to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understanding of all. 1. We shall not dwell long in pointing out unto you what is a promise: We conceive it is a glorious discovery of the good will of God towards sinners, and withall, a purpose and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and (if we may say) an engagement to bestow some spiritual or temporal good upon them, or to withhold some spiritual or temporal evil from them: And certain it is, that in this description of the promise, there is a divine harmony betwixt Mercy and Truth, betwixt Righteousnesse and Peace, they kisse one another: Neither shall we stand long to point out the distinction of the promises: 1. There are some promises that are conditional, and there are some promises
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107523:7"/>
that are absolute, absolute promises are these that have no condition annexed unto the performance of them; such a promise is that, that God will destroy the world no more by water, that is an absolute promise; such a promise was that of God sending his Son into the World, that was an absolute promise; and such is that promise of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in giving the heart of flesh, it is an absolute promise: As for the conditionall promises, they are these that do require some condition to be performed by the Christian, before the accomplishment of the promise, such as that promise of Salvation, it requireth believing as going before it, <hi>He that believeth shall be saved</hi>; And pardon, it is promised unto a Christian upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and yet we confesse, that there is not a conditional promise that is in all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but it may be reduced unto an absolute promise, in regard that the thing promised (in the conditional promise) is one absolute free gift, and the condition of the promise is another. 2. There are some promises that are temporal, and some that are spiritual; temporal promises are these, that promise some temporal thing unto a Christian, and spiritual promises are these, that promise the bestowing of something that is of everlasting concernment. 3. There are some promises that are not accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life, such as this, <hi>That wee shall see him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he is, and shall be made like unto him:</hi> But for the promises of Faith and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustification, these are accomplished in this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107523:7"/>
life. 4. There are some promises that are extraordinary, and there are some promises that are common: extraordinary promises are these, that are given to some particular Believer as a singular priviledge: such was that promise that was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in his seed should all families of the earth be blessed,</hi> and that promise that was given to <hi>Rebekah, That the elder should serve the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>: As for common promises, they are these, that every believer in Christ hath a right to make use of.</p>
            <p>Neither shall we stand long to point out that it is the duty of a Christian to be much in the exercise of Faith, upon the promises; it is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Trust in him at all times ye people</hi>: and it is clear from the practice of that precious cloud of witnesses, recorded of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that spent their dayes in imbracing of the Promises. But, 7. We would have you consider, that it is more easie for a Christian to believe spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Promises, then to believe temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; it is easier to trust Christ for eternal Salvation, then to trust him for our daily food when we are redacted unto straits; and the grounds upon which we assert this, may be these; 1. Because it is hard for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to believe that Christs death reacheth for the purchasing of temporall promises, which more easily he taketh up in spiritual promises; for a Christian can hardly believe that such a thing was in Christs intention, as to die for his daily food, which yet is most certain, if we consider it as a special mercy.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107523:8"/>
2. In a Christians believing of spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, there is often some sense and reason that helpeth him to the exercise of Faith, at least, they presse not the contrary; but to believe a temporal promise, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is redacted unto a strait, and that he can see no outgate present, sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son stands upon the top of his Faith, and presseth him to dispair: As for instance, when a Christian is living upon the top of a mountain, and knoweth not where to sup at night, to believe that there is a promise upon which he may rest, that he shall not want his food; but if that the Lord had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for him he will provide: Here, he hath not only reason to dispute against, but the strong pinching sense of hunger, both crying out, <hi>How can bread be given in the wildernesse</hi>? 3. The tentations that assault a Christian to misbelieve upon temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, they are more subtile and more con-natural to a Christian, then his temptations that assault him in resting upon spiritual promises: When a Christian is in straits in the world, the temptations that hinder his exercise of Faith, they are more consonant to flesh and blood; we are ready to yeeld to misbelief then, because we think it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and speaketh the truth. 4. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is often so affrighted by his daily fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or some particular more grosse out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings in his life, that howbeit he may (through grace) be helped to believe that the Lord shall make out these promises which concern his eternal salvation, and so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107523:8"/>
do him good in the latter end: yet may he be sadly perplexed and distrustfull in making use of any particular temporary promise, for drawing forth any comfort or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefrom, as to his present exigent: because he knoweth, that although the Lord doth forgive his peoples iniquities, <hi>yet may he take vengeance on their inventions,</hi> Psal. 99.8. and therefore may punish his present failing with the like calamities as he hath done others. 5. There is also much of a natural and carnal self love to a present life, remaining in the best, that we are many times worse to satisfie in our securities for the things of this life, then of that which is to come, and can more easily trust the Lord for our souls, then for our bodies; so that though his naked word will sometimes satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us for the one, yet it will not for the other: And the last ground of it may be a Christians unacquaintednesse with that lot of exercising Faith upon temporal promises, there being many who think not that there is use for Faith, except for Salvation and the things above, which maketh his Faith upon these more difficult then upon promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that are spiritual: And this may appear most clearly, in that we find men more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear their spirituall wants (even a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that is most exercised) then they bear their temporal want; and more corruption and impatience doth arise from temporal want, then from spiritual want.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider, That all a Christians duties are turned over into promises: there is not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107523:9"/>
a duty that is required of a Christian, but it is converted into a Promise. Is not Faith a duty, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment that ye should believe?</hi> And is not that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over in a promise, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3 19. <hi>Thou shalt call me thy Father?</hi> The word importeth not only an act of necessity, but of violence, thou shalt do it: And in the thirteenth of <hi>Zechary,</hi> at the close, <hi>Thou shalt call me thy Father,</hi> and so in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. Is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification a Christians duty, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie therefore your members</hi>; and it is turned over in a promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.28. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 29. where he promiseth, that he will purge away all their uncleannesses: and it is clear from <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>I will subdue</hi> (said he) <hi>all thine iniquities,</hi> it is not said, <hi>thou must subdue them,</hi> but, <hi>I will do it,</hi> Is not also the knowledge of God a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded duty? and yet it is turned over in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in the Covenant of Grace; <hi>They shall know me from the highest to the lowest, neither shall there be need any more that one should say, know the Lord, for they shall be all taught of me.</hi> Is not the commandement of fear your duty, as is clear from <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.13. and yet that is likewise turned over in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; <hi>I will put my fear in their inward parts, they they shall not depart away from me:</hi> So tendernesse is a Christians duty, and yet that is turned over in a promise, <hi>I will take away their heart of stone, and give them a heart of flesh.</hi> And that I may say no more of this, look but to these four places, and there ye will see almost all duties turned over in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107523:9"/>
there is <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. <hi>Ier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 32. <hi>Ezek</hi> 11. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. ye will see all the duties of the Covenant converted into Promises. But may not some say, what advantage is there of this? much certainly, every way: That the duties are turned over into promises; it may give a Christian hope, that he shall once perform these duties: Will ye not once be tender? Yes certainly, because your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse lieth within a promise; Will ye not once be much in the exercise of fear? No doubt ye will, and the ground of it is this, because your fear lieth within a promise, and so of the rest. And 2. There is this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, that all the duties required of a Christian are turned over in promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this means, a Christian may go to God when he cannot perform such a duty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to fulfill his word, and accomplish his promise; and so may make use not only of the Omnipotency of God, but of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God also.</p>
            <p>There is this third Consideration that we would propose, that there are some things of a Christian within a promise, that he doth not believe to be within it, especially these three: First, the challenges of a Christian are within a promise, when ye are convinced, that is the accomplishment of a promise, this is clear from <hi>Isai.</hi> 30 21. where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and challenges are turned over in a promise; <hi>When thou art turning unto the right hand or to the left, thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, crying, this is the way, walk in it:</hi> And it may be clear, that our convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107523:10"/>
are the accomplishment of promises, because it is a work of the Comforter, as well to convince, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.9. as it is for him to make one rejoyce: and if a Christian could believe that his challenges were the accomplishment of a promise, he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his challenges, he might see the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of God in his challenges, and he might see much love in his challenges. 2. A Christians crosse is within a promise, so that when a Christian meets with such affliction, he may sit down and cry out, this is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of a promise, and this is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 89 31, 32. wherein in the midst of the promises of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Covenant of Grace, that promise of visiting their iniquities with rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is put in the bosome of them: and from <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.77. <hi>In faithfulnesse hast thou afflicted me</hi>; Why doth <hi>David</hi> say in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse? It was this, because his crosse was the accomplishment of a promise: and it may be clear also from that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Forget not the exhortation,</hi> (speaking of the crosse) the word is, <hi>Forget not the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that speaketh unto you,</hi> As if the holy Ghost did say, crosses do yeeld much conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as in vers. 11. <hi>They yeeld the peaceable fruits of righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse</hi>: And if this were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that our crosses were the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promises, it would help a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian unto much humble submission, and there would not be murmuring under them, if once we did believe that they were the accomplishment of a promise: Yea, there is this advantage further, that if we did believe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107523:10"/>
that our crosses were the accomplishment of a promise, we would be much in advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holinesse under our crosse. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that obstructeth the sweet fruits of righteousnesse under a crosse so much as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency: and I would say this to commend the crosse, a Christian never moveth so swiftly to heaven, as when he is under a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified crosse; a crosse when it is sanctified, will prove a Christians motion to Heaven, more then ten enjoyments, for our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ordinarily do retard our way as much as further it. And there is this, Thirdly, that is within the promises, even your daily food, and the hairs of your head, the hairs of a Christians head are numbered, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant. So that ye may see what a high respect Christ hath put upon Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that is clear from that word, <hi>Psal</hi> 111.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>He hath given meat unto them that fear Him, He will ever be mindfull of His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our fourth consideration shall be, to point out a little these grounds upon which Christ doth delay his accomplishment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; It is certain that a Christian is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put to this, <hi>Doth his promise fail for evermore?</hi> and cryeth out, <hi>Why art thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail</hi>; and the grounds of this delay are these: 1. Christ knoweth that a Christian can often better improve the delay of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promise, then he can improve the accomplishment it self: we might find this in our experience (it being for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107523:11"/>
most part) easier for a Christian to bear his crosses, then to bear his enjoyments. I think <hi>David</hi> never had so sweet a time as then, when he was pursued as a Partridge by his son <hi>Absolon</hi>; then grace did breath forth most sweetly in his actions: but let <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> be under prosperity, and then we see he falleth in the sin of Adultery. And therefore never repine when ye are under a crosse; for certainly, if we had spirituall understanding, we would not judge it so great a hazard to be under a crosse, as under prosperitie, since we have greater strength to bear the one, then to endure the other. 2. The slothfulnesse of a Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o whom the promises are made, this makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to be delayed in their performance, as was clear in the people of <hi>Israel</hi>; they are fourty years in a wildernesse, before that promise of entering into <hi>Canaan</hi> is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished; It was a promise that could have been accomplished in a few dayes, and yet because of their sin, it was not accomplished for fourty years, as ye may see from that word in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.33, 34. 3. The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the promises is delayed, that Faith may be more put in exercise; this is clear from that remarkable word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.19. <hi>Vntill the time that his word came</hi>; that is, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill the word of the Lord was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished; <hi>The word of the Lord tried him,</hi> that is, it was the matter of his exercise, an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise espe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ially unto Faith; for indeed it is much for a Christian to believe upon a word, when it is delayed in its accomplishment.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107523:11"/>
The fourth ground of delay is, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of prayer may be more; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the best improvement of delayes is, to be much in prayer; the promises they do occasion prayer, as is clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. last, <hi>They believed, and bowed down their heads and worshipped,</hi> and from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. where the great promises being made to <hi>David,</hi> he cryeth out, <hi>Therefore have I found in my heart to pray this prayer unto God,</hi> and it is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Perform the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</hi> It is a bad improvement of delayes when we turn impatient; and it is a bad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of delayes, when we quite our confidence. Know that promises are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished after delayes, and they have a luster upon them that may compence all the delay. 5. There is this other ground of the delayes of accomplishment of the promises, even that the thing that is promised may be more sweet to a Christian when it cometh: this is clear from that word of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 13 12. <hi>Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, but when the desire doth come, it is as a tree of life</hi>; O but a mercy that cometh to a Christian through a promise, it is sweet; yea, a drink of cold water taken up as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of a promise, is more sweet then <hi>a feast of fat things full of marrow, and wine on the lees well refined</hi>; to take up your bread and your dink as the accomplishment of your promises, it would make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshfull to you. 6. The Lord delayes his promises, that a Christian may be more in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107523:12"/>
the exercise of dependency, and may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keeped about the throne. A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an goeth to God from a threefold principle, he goeth to God from a principle of Faith, from a principle of necessity, and from a principle of love: but would you know that which putteth the Christian oftenest to God? it is a principle of necessity: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that if necessity did not drive a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian unto the foot of the Throne, we would seldom go from a principle of love, or from a principle of faith. And there is this last ground of the delay of the accomplishment of the promises, that the glory of the wisdom of God may appear, and the glory of his power in the accomplishment of the promise. When the promise is long beneath ground, then the wisdome and power of God doth more appear in the accomplishment of that promise. And from this I would only say to Christians that are under that exercise, complaining of the want of the performance of the promises, these few things: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the promise shall once be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, that <hi>though the vision tarry, yet at last it shall speak.</hi> 2. Believe, that every hours delay of the accomplishment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise hath a sweet design of love: there is not one moment of delay, but it is for the advantage of a Christian, as is clear from that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And, 3. that promise that cometh after long delays, it hath these three sweet and soul-refreshing attendants. 1. It is performed most seasonbly, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian if he will observe, he will see infinite
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107523:12"/>
wisdome shining in timeing the accompani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the promise to such a particular day: a Christian will be constrained to cry out, if the promise had been fulfilled before there had been no such Art of wisedome ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pearing in the performance of it. 2. That the promise when it is accomplished, will engage a Christian more in the exercise of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove, than four promises accomplished at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hort and smaller time: there is nothing that will so inflame the soul with love, as to have a promise accomplished after delayes. And, 3. the promises accomplished after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now we shall shut up our discourse at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime, and shall only speak to these six defects of a Christians faith in believing the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>es. 1. That our faith is impatient, wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>peaketh this, That it is impossible for a Christian to believe as he ought, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the exercise of patience.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107523:13"/>
with the Promises, it is most unconstant: A Christian when first a promise is born in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his spirit, he will then believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and joyn with it; but after six or seven dayes go about, he will change his Faith: this is remarkably clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.31. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. When first the promise cometh to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they shal go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it is said of them in the fourth Chapter at the close, <hi>They believed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and worshipped:</hi> But look to them in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. and there ye will see them not believing, because of <hi>bitterness and anxiety of heart:</hi> And I will tell you the grounds why our Faith is unconstant. 1. Sometimes the reading of a promise to a Christian will be as his savory meat; sometimes when a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will read one time in the Covenant, it will be perfumed with love, and his soul will bee transported with joy after it, and at another time when he shall read that promise again it will be <hi>tastelesse as the white of an egge,</hi> and <hi>as his sorrowfull meat</hi> 2.

There is this third defect of our Faith, That we are not diligent, a diligent faith we call this, that after a Christian hath believed, he would be much in the exercise of prayer, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the promise, he would be much in the exercise of meditation, to make that promise sweet and lively to him. And a fourth defect is this, We build our faith

more upon Dispensations then upon the Word: when dispensations say that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ect our confidence and hope. I will tell you two great mysteries of believing, it is hard for a Christian to believe when the Commentary seemeth to destroy the Text, that is, when the Commentary seemeth to declare, that the promise shall never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is this, It is hard to believe when dispensations will say, the Word of the Lord will faill, and when promises bids you believe. 2. It is hard for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, O precious Christ reconcile these two together, that impossibilities do not destroy the promise, but that the promise may be accomplished notwithstanding of this. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. We have this defect of faith amongst us, That we build our faith more upon sense, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen upon the word of promise; when a Christian is in a good frame, he will believe, but when Christ hideth his face, he will then give over his hope. And lastly, there is this, That our faith upon the promises is general, we believe the truth of the promises, but we study not to make a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. I shall not stand long to make any use of what we have spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Only I would have the Christians of this age, and those that are here, to go home with this conviction, the damnable neglect of believing

of the promises. A Christian neglecteth these three duties of Religion most, he neglecteth the duty of self examining, the duty of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promises, and that noble soul exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty of meditation: these three duties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall I tell you what is the practise of the most part of us, we study perhaps to apply one promise, but for the rest of the promises we lay them aside, and do totally neglect them: we study to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promises of salvation, and of having redemption through Christ, but for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Sanctification, for the promises to help us to perform duties, for the promises to support us under the crosse, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to comfort us in our way to heaven, for promises in reference to all ordinary things, we are not much in application of these. O but if a Christian were believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, he might sit down even while he is here, and sing one of the songs of Zion, though <hi>yet but in a strange land.</hi>

ye do not expect sensible comforts immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after ye have believed the promise, a Christian may apply the promises, and yet want the joy and sweetnesse that is in them: This is clear, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.25. <hi>My soul cleaveth unto the dust.</hi> There he is under much anxiety and much sorrow; and yet he is a believer of the promises in the mean time, as the words following doth clear, <hi>Quicken me according to thy word,</hi> he layeth claim to the promise, and this is clear in the 81. vers. of that Psalm, <hi>My soul doth faint within me</hi>; There is much exercise of sorrow, and yet he is a believer in the promise, <hi>But I hope in thy word</hi>: A Christian after he hath believed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107523:22"/>The fourth rule that we would prescribe unto you in the application of the promises, is, That ye would close absolutely with the promises, I mean, without limiting the only One. There is a limitted closing with the promise, which is the frequent exercise of our hearts; we will close with the promise, but with this restraint laid upon Christ, That whensoever we begin to believe the promises, all things might go as we desire: and this is the great occasion that we do so frequently reject our confidence, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse our hope when God doth not answer our peremptory expectations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We give you this rule, that ye would eye Christ much in the application of the promises. There is a threefold sight of Christ that a Christian should have when he applyeth the promises, a Christian should have a sight of the boundlesse and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending love of Christ, that so he may be constrained to hope, and may be constrained to love. 2. A Christian should eye the faithfulnesse and unchangeableness of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107523:24"/>
but they do silence you; I will tell you what ye should do with them, misken these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and lay them by. This was the practice of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.9. <hi>He considered not his own body being weak, and the deadnesse of Sarahs womb.</hi> The weaknesse of his own body, and the deadnesse of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb were so strong objections in the way of the accomplishment of the promises, that he could not answer them; and the way he taketh to refute them was, <hi>He did not consider them</hi>; as it were, he forgot those objections and went about his duty.</p>
            <p>The third thing that we shall speak to, in relation to the application of the promises, shall be somewhat for helping a Christian that is standing at too great a distance, to get the promises applied.</p>
            <p>First, A Christian would be much in the study of these experiences of the faithfulnesse of God, and what others have met with. When ye begin to apply a promise, ye may be helped in the Faith of applying promises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by beholding these great records of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of God that are extant.

that necessity, the one would provoke fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and the other Faith. Are there not some here that knoweth not what it is to pray upon a promise, and that maketh you pray to so little purpose. O Christian, what is the reason of your so much sorrow, and of your little spiritual comfort? It is, that ye believe not the promises: It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that your names be called <hi>Marah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye exercise not faith upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises of God. I think without wronging you or any that are here; I doubt much if ever Christians had such hearts as the most part of us have; O what a heart is that, that can neither pray nor praise? both are alike mysteries unto them: What a heart is that, O Christian, that can neither believe promises, believe threatnings, nor obey commands? What a heart is that, that can neither sorrow for sin, nor rejoyce in God? and what a heart is that, that can neither love Christ when he is present, nor can they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing in them, which was the rise and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the promises, holden forth in that word, <hi>Whereby,</hi> or <hi>by whom.</hi> The second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing in the words, was the properties of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he promises; and wee told you that there were these four holden forth in the words.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107523:29"/>
The first property of the promises is, that they <hi>are free,</hi> which is imported in that word, <hi>are given</hi>; all the promises of the everlasting Covenant being the precious and free gifts of God. Hence you will see that oft times the tenor of the Covenant of Grace runs upon that strain, <hi>I will give you,</hi> as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> clear, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give you one heart,</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will give you a new heart,</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will give you</hi>; It is the strain of the language of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>to give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in speaking upon this first property of the promises, to wit, <hi>their freedom,</hi> I shall speak a little unto these two, the first thing shall be to point out unto you the way how a Christian may win to the distinct up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the freedom of the promises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then I shall from thence presse some duties.</p>
            <p>And in short, as to the first, we conceive that a Christian may win unto the distinct uptaking of the freedom of the promises, by these Considerations. 1. Let a Christian cast his eye upon the sweet rise, and spring, or fountain of the promises, and there ye will see their freedom shining most clear: for what is the fountain of the promises? Is it not the boundlesse and everlasting love of Christ: this is clear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. where God giving a reason of all the great things that he had performed for them, he setteth down the rise of it, <hi>Because I loved you,</hi> saith he: and again the ground of this is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have loved you,</hi> there being no reason of love, but love: and it is clear, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107523:29"/>
where <hi>David</hi> having received many precious promises, hee setteth down the rise of all these in that verse, <hi>For the words sake,</hi> saith he, <hi>and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these things to make them known to thy servant.</hi> And it is clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.8. where God calleth the time of entering into Covenant with them, <hi>a time of love</hi>; that love it was eminently shining in that day when God did condescend to Covenant with them: And hence yee see in Scripture, that the promises they are called by the name of <hi>mercy,</hi> Micah 7.20. <hi>To perform the mercy to Abraham,</hi> which is <hi>the Promises,</hi> and they are so called, because mercy and boundlesse love is the sole fountain and spring of all these promises. Secondly, Consider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who have right to make use of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises? Must not the promises be free when the proclamation is upon these tearms, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whosover will, let him come,</hi> there is nothing to give you a right to the promises, but only a willingnesse to embrace them, if yee will, yee may take them. And, thirdly, yee may read the freedom of the promises in this, that any condition which is annexed to the promise: Christ giveth to the Believer strength to perform that condition: It is known that Faith is the condition of the promises, and it is certain Christ giveth a Believer that condition as well as hee giveth him the promise, <hi>Philip</hi> 1 29. <hi>To you it is given to believe,</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It is the gift of God</hi>: It is impossible for a Christian to perform the condition, except Christ who
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107523:30"/>
is surety for him did perform it. Fourthly, Ye may read the freedom of the promises, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ye consider the time when the promises are accomplished, it is often at such a time, when the Christian hath been, and is under no very spirituall frame. Hence yee will see in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61. that when the promises are accomplished, then God requireth <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and blushing of face,</hi> because of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes: and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are accomplished, then that is the time when the Lord calleth them to <hi>remember their own evil wayes, and their doings that were not good</hi>; yea, hee will have them and all the world to know, <hi>it is not for their sakes that he doth this</hi>; therefore he commandeth them to <hi>bee ashamed and confounded for their own wayes,</hi> or the posture they were in when he accomplished his promise: And if there were no other thing to speak the freedome of the promises, but the trysting of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them with such a frame, it were more then suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cient: But besides this, see <hi>Davids</hi> practice, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8. hee readeth the freedome of the promises from his own imperfections, <hi>What am I</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and what is my fathers house, that thou shouldest have brought mee hitherto?</hi> And even in the same Text, there is an Emphasis in that word, <hi>to us, Whereby are given to us,</hi> as if the Apostle did say, to prove that the promises are gifts: I can bring no other argument so strong as this, <hi>They are given to us.</hi> Fifthly, Yee may read the freedom of the Promises, if yee will consider and take up the infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107523:30"/>
and all-sufficiency of the <hi>Promiser,</hi> that there is nothing without himself that can perswade him to give such promises. Hence yee will see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. when hee is making the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee putteth it still in the Frontispiece of the Covenant, I <hi>am God all-sufficient,</hi> as it were, to put off all thoughts of merit that <hi>Abraham</hi> might have, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> might bee perswaded of this, that there was not any imaginable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in himself, that could be the ground and rise of such promises. And there is that, lastly, from which yee may read the freedom of the promises, if yee consider the greatnesse of these promises: if they were of a lower nature; then were it lesse to bee wondered, if merit should come in to plead for it self: But when a Christian shall compare himself, and the greatnesse of the promises together, hee cannot but then sing that blessed song, <hi>These are the gifts and donations of God, and what am I, and what is my fathers house that thou hast brought me hitherto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the second thing that wee purposed to speak to, is, to presse some duties upon you from this, that the promises are free, and wee shall lay before you these three. The first, That since the promises of God, are free, then as you would not destroy your own souls, bee much in making use and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Promises: Are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises your life? Did not all the Saints that went to heaven before us go to heaven, living upon the promises? There was not a step of <hi>Abrahams</hi> life, but hee walked with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107523:31"/>
a promise in it; there was not an affliction that <hi>Abraham</hi> met with, but hee took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to himself from the promises; and I shall remove these two mistakes that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Christians in the application of the promises, even from this ground, that they are free.</p>
            <p>The first is this, There are some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that will not apply the promises, because they are under the convictions of their own infirmities, and of their own basenesse: so that when wee presse you to believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, yee reject this counsell, because yee consult with your own infirmities. This was the practice of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 22.4. <hi>Our fathers trusted in thee, they trusted and were delivered</hi>: but hee durst not trust in the 6. verse, <hi>But I am a worm, and not a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am a reproach among the people.</hi> And it is that same divinity that is in these dayes, when we presse you to believe the promises, because of the great cloud of witnesses that have gone before you, that believed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. O say yee, if I were like <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> I would believe the promises; but truely <hi>David</hi> said that same, that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, if I were like my fathers, I would believe the promises, but I am not like my fathers. And therefore I would say to you these two words. 1. Are yee inferiour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> short unto <hi>David</hi> in holinesse, or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Wee do not question but all of you will answer, wee are not inferiour to <hi>David</hi> in necessities, but in holinesse; Then say wee, if ye be not inferiour to <hi>David</hi> in neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107523:31"/>
then make use of the promises: for as we cleared the last day, necessity giveth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> right in making use of the promises. 2. I would say, I am certainly perswaded, that sensible necessity would cut short many of our formal debates, in closing with the promises, necessities (as ye use to speak) hath no Law, and necessity hath no manners. Let mee say that to you who will not close with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that if yee were under sensible necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Christ should forbid you to close with such a promise, ye would close with it though hee forbid you, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, there is nothing but sensible necessity will overcome it: necessity never disputes its right, for it goeth over the belly of such a dispute, it presently maketh use of that that its need calleth for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is that other mistake amongst Christians in believing the promises, that they want the qualifications annexed to the promises, and therefore they dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promise, especially that promise of closing with Christ, they think they are not under such a deep measure of humiliation, of sorrow for sin, nor under such lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the excellency of Christ. And I shall say but these six things unto these that will not close with Christ, because they want qualifications, or at least, have not these qualifications after such a way. First, Let mee tell thee (O Christian that thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,) go between the first steps of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians way to heaven and the last, and see if yee can behold a grave upon which this is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107523:32"/>
written, Behold here lieth a man or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came to Christ to imbrace him, and hee would not receive them; Did yee ever behold such a grave as this? And why then do ye so much dispute? Will ye take a trial of Christ whether hee will refuse you if yee come, and if hee shall refuse you, sure I am, he will do that which he never did to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. The second thing I would say to such, that the want of such degrees of such things, ought not to be a ground of your not closing with Christ; for if yee had these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications that yee require, yee would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that same dispute that yee do now; for when we desire you to close with Christ, ye answer, that your sorrow is not come to such a height as it ought, nor is your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation come to such a height, as ye pitch for your self to come to. O Christian, if yee come to ten times more, and yet ten times more, yee would have that same dispute then which ye have now: and the ground of it is this, the more that a Christian have real sorrow, he will oftentimes be the more in the apprehension that hee hath not sorrow. Thirdly, If yee want the qualifications that are required in these that should close with Christ in the Covenant of promise, then come to Christ to get these qualifications. I would only ask at you, think yee to spin sorrow for sin out of your own hearts; Think ye to spin humiliation for sin out of these wretched breasts of yours, yee must come to Christ for sorrow, as well as ye come to Christ for life. Fourthly, All the qualifications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107523:32"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re annexed unto that promise of closing with Christ, and coming to him, they point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut rather the qualification of them that will come, then the qualification of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat ought to come: Yee read such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as that, <hi>Come unto mee all ye that are wearied and heavy loaden.</hi> O say yee, I am not weary, and I am not under the burden of sinne, therefore I cannot come. I will tell you what is the meaning of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Christ inviteth these who have the greatest unwillingnesse, to come and get willingnesse: But withall, it sheweth this, none will come to get rest from Christ, but these that are first weary; and that this is the Lords method of working, first, to make weary, and then to ease; but no such matter in his Word, That first, wee must have a wearinesse of our own making, or else hee will not receive us: now but when yee come, yee will be weary, and hee will receive you. Fifthly, let mee say to you who thus disputes, make your want of qualifications the very ground of your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Christ. I shall but in three places let you see this strange arguing of Faith in closing with the promises: There is that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.11, 12. <hi>Let thy truth continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve mee,</hi> that is, let thy promises be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished and made lively unto mee, which are my preservation: and would yee know the ground and reason that hee anexeth unto this; For saith he, <hi>Innumerable evils encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed me about, they have taken such hold of me, that I am not able to look up.</hi> He maketh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107523:33"/>
his very want of qualifications, the grounds of his closing with the promise, and seeking the accomplishment of it. And there is that second expression which is most wonderfull, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25 11. <hi>David</hi> prayeth for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that promise, <hi>Pardon my sinne</hi> upon that same very account, <hi>Because it is great.</hi> And I shall give you a third place in which the arguing of Faith is most mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.9. In the first place, God denieth the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that promise, <hi>of going up amongst that people</hi>: And the ground hee giveth of it, is, <hi>Because,</hi> saith hee, <hi>yee are a stiff necked people.</hi> And chap. 34. verse 9. when <hi>Moses</hi> is praying for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that promise, <hi>That God would go amongst them</hi>; he taketh that same very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument out of the mouth of God; Go up amongst us; <hi>For,</hi> saith hee, <hi>wee are a stiff-necked people</hi>: God said he would not go up because they were a stiff necked people, and <hi>Moses</hi> desireth him to go up because of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there is this, lastly, that wee would say to you, that so much dispute; If yee would have these qualifications that yee want, yee would study to close with Christ by Faith; Would ye have sorrow for sin? then believe; Would ye have high thoughts of Christ? then believe: Would ye have humiliation? then believe; for believing is a mother grace unto all these.</p>
            <p>The second duty that we would press upon you from this consideration that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are free, is, That when the promises
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107523:33"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ise of the giving or accomplishment of the promises. There is nothing that a Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

you from this consideration, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are free, is this; Ye would be study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to close with Jesus Christ that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and freely holden out to you in the Gospel; O sinner of eighty years old, O sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sixty years old, O atheists of fourty years old, and O sinner of twenty years ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Ambassadour of Jesus Christ, to imbrace Christ freely offered in the promise; yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> do invite you by all the vertues of that noble <hi>Plant of renown</hi>; by that everlasting love that dwelt in his precious heart, by all the sufferings and wounds that he received, by his eternal glory, and by all the blessings and joyes of heaven, and by that love that ye owe unto your precious and immortal souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye would come and imbrace him freely offered to you in the Gospel. And for the further pressing of this, and for clearing of the way of your closing with him, I shall first propose some Gospel mysteries, and sweetly agreeing contradictions, (if so we may speak) held forth in Scripture. 1. <hi>Come and buy Christ, and yet buy him without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>; that is, come and receive Christ, and ye shall have as unquestionable a right to him as if ye had bought him, that is to <hi>buy without money</hi>; ye have nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to Christ but necessities, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities bideth you go, and Christ biddeth you come, why then will ye sit this call. 2. What a Gospel mysterie is that, <hi>Yee ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to buy Christ, and Christ is above price,</hi> there is nothing that we can give to buy that <hi>pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:107523:34"/>
of greatest price,</hi> and yet we must buy him: then the meaning is, come, and buy Christ by faith, and by forsaking of your idols, this is all the price that he doth require for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and so he requireth nothing of you but what he himself doth give, or what is both your duty and advantage to forsake, and which is no gain for him to receive: Christ is not enriched by your hearts, and by giving of your consent to him. 3. This is a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel mysterie, that <hi>we are to buy without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and without price,</hi> and <hi>yet to buy with a price,</hi> according to that word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. there is a price put in the hands of fools, to buy wisdom, and what is the meaning of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to buy with price, and buy without price</hi>? It is in short this, though Christ be offered to you in the Gospel freely, ye must not sit down, but be active in closing with him; What is the price that Christ requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of you? even this, that ye would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake your soul destroying idols, and that ye would forsake your former evil wayes, and take hold of the present opportunity for imbracing him. And O! cursed shall the heart be that will not imbrace Christ; O but to have him one hour in our arms, it were well worth ten thousand E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ernities of the enjoyment of all things that are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ye would never open your arms again to another lover, if once ye had him <hi>between your breasts.</hi> O but a sight of him that now is the eternal ravishment of all that are above, would transport your hearts with joy, with delight, and admiration,

above all expression. Fourthly, There is this Gospel mystery by which we would presse you to imbrace Christ; <hi>A Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth concerning the promises. 1. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and fountain of the promises, in that word, <hi>Whereby,</hi> or <hi>by whom</hi>: 2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the promises which we told you, were these four. The first was, that the promises were free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holden forth in that word, they are <hi>Given</hi>; all the promises of the everlasting Covenant being the noble gifts of God. The second (of which we are to speak at this time) is this, that the promises of the Covenant they are <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> which is imported also in that word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>they are given,</hi> the gifts of God being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without repentance; And as to this: 1. Wee shall prove the truth of the point: and for this end, consider that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. which was a part of <hi>Balaams</hi> song, <hi>Hath hee not spoken it, and will hee not also d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hath hee said it, and shall it not also come to passe?</hi> and Psal. 89.34. <hi>I will not break my Covenant, nor alter the word that hath gone out of my mouth</hi>: and the point is clear also, from the name that the promises getteth in Scripture, are they no called <hi>the sure mercies of David,</hi> Isa. 55.3. and are they not sometimes in Scripture called <hi>Truth,</hi> as wee may see from <hi>Micah</hi> 7.20. Thirdly, The nature of the Covenant prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; in that it is called <hi>an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and sometimes <hi>a Covenant of Salt,</hi> because that Covenant is above the reach of alteration or putrifaction: And fourthly, It may be likewise shown from the constant experience that the Saints have had of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107523:41"/>
unchangeablenesse of the promises. This <hi>Ioshua</hi> taketh notice of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.24. where when he was a dying, <hi>There hath not failed</hi> (saith he) <hi>one thing of all these good things that God hath spoken</hi>; and hee is so confident of this, that he is forced to repeat that word over again in that verse: and hee taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 21.45. where hee hath tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from this point.</p>
            <p>O Christians and Expectants of Heaven, who have Christ in you, the hope of Glory, rejoyce and be exceeding glad that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are unchangeable. 1. This is a duty that is pressed from that ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That by two immutable things we might have strong consolation</hi>: There is exceeding much joy that may come to a Christian from this, that the promises shall be accomplished i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:107523:43"/>
their own time. We conceive that the word <hi>unchangeable,</hi> it is engraven upon the head of many a Christians mercies. Is not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> written above the head of our promises? Is not <hi>unchangeable</hi> written upon the head of our blessednesse? Is not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> written above the head of our enjoyment of God? That day is coming when we shall have <hi>unchangeable</hi> love, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> enjoyment of God, and all things <hi>unchangeable:</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d we conceive, that if these two were believed, the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and the unchangeablenesse of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, a Christian might walk through this valey of tears with joy, and comfort himself in hope.</p>
            <p>The second duty we would presse, is this, that ye would sursease and give over your disputings and carnal reasonings about the accomplishment of the promises, since the promises of God are unchangeable, ought not we with this to silence misbelief, and all that blind humane reason can say: This is pressed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. <hi>An oath for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is an end of all strife.</hi> Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of his Covenant by an oath, it ought to cut short the disputings of misbelief; And here give me leave to point out a little these grounds upon which it is that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doth so much dispute the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of promises: and to let you see how all these grounds may be answered from these six pillars that were given of their unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse.</p>
            <p>The first is, When dispensations seemeth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107523:44"/>
to contradict the truth of the Promises, the promise it speaketh one thing, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations seem to speak another: and this is the occasion that oftentimes Christians cry out, <hi>Doth his promise fail for evermore.</hi> This is clear from the practice of <hi>David,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. when dispensations were upon the top of the accompl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shment, and truth of the promises, then misbelief it ariseth as a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion mighty to war, and cryeth out, <hi>I shall one day fall by the hand of Saul</hi>: And wee conceive, that dispensations contradicting the truth of the promises, was the occasion of his speaking that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I said in my haste, all men are liars.</hi> And I would only say to you that dispute the truth of the promises upon this account, that dispensations contradicteth them: Do but consider this: God in his way is not like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Would ye know the time when the promises are nearest their accomplishment, it is then when we can least see that they are to be accomplished, the promises are never nearer their performance, then when wee think that they are furthest off from it: And therefore let the faith of the omnipotency of God, uphold your spirit under such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, then let dispensations speak what they will, yee may answer all with this, <hi>There is nothing too hard for him,</hi> there is nothing too hard for the Lord. I grant this may try the strength of the strongest faith, yea, we finde it hath made the best to stagger when they had no probabilities to tell them that the promise shall be accomplished: this was the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107523:44"/>
ground of <hi>Sarahs</hi> misbelief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. that when she heard she should bear a son in her old age, shee laughed within her self, and did, as it were, mock at such a promise: and this was the ground of <hi>Moses</hi> his misbelief, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22. hee did not see a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that such a multitude should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with flesh, and therefore hee did call in question the truth of that promise: this was the ground of the misbelief of that Lord that is made mention, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. and this was the ground of <hi>Zecharies</hi> misbelief, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.20. But I would only say to you that do so much consult with probability in the exercise of your faith, these two things. 1. There is nothing too hard for God, this was the very argument that God took to convince <hi>Sarah</hi> in the 14. vers. of that 18 Chapter, <hi>Is there any thing too hard for God</hi>? And, 2. Faith is never in its native and spirituall exercise, till once probabilities contradict the truth of the promise, then faith it is put upon the stage, and then faith doth act; but as long as faith and probabilities think one thing, then the day of the trial of the strength of faith is not yet come.</p>
            <p>The second ground upon which Christians dispute the accomplishment of the promises, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s their much disputing of their interest in God? Sometimes a Christian will believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> promise, and before the accomplishment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he promise come, their hope will be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their interest in Christ will be obscured, and then they do quite their faith in adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the truth of that promise. These
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107523:45"/>
two are joyned together, want of the faith of our interest, and want of faith of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the promise, as it is clear from that word, <hi>Psal</hi> 77.8. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone.</hi> There is disputing of his interest, and presently this is subjoyned, <hi>Doth his promise fail for evermore.</hi> Except a Christian can read his name in the ancient records of heaven, and can seal this conclusion, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved he is mine,</hi> it will be a hard, and a difficult task for him, if not impossible to believe the promises.</p>
            <p>The fourth ground of a Christians disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the promises, is, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking the way how the promises are to be accomplished, There are some that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that when ever they close with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by faith, there is no more but to enter to the possession of such a promise; but do not mistake it, between your believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and the accomplishment of it, there may bee sad and dark dayes interveening, according to that word in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. where Christ passing great promises to his Disciples, He, as it were doth adde, do not mistake me that ye shall have these promises without trouble and affliction, <hi>Ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> (saith he) <hi>an hundred fold in this life with persecutions.</hi> A Christian when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the promises, he must resolve to have a winter before the spring time come, wherein the promise shall bud and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
            <p>The fifth ground of a Christians disputing the truth of the promises, is, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107523:45"/>
are long in their accomplishing. A Christian when first hee meeteth with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, he will cry forth, <hi>O I believe,</hi> but when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime is taken for the accomplishment of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt, when they believe a promise, they fix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> day for the accomplishment of it, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f God do not keep, but go over; then they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mmediately cry forth, <hi>What is my strength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat I should wait, and what is my confidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat I should prolong my dayes.</hi> This is clear in the practice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of having a numerous seed being given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.12. the long time before that promise was accomplished in part to him, was the occasion of his misbelief, that hee vented, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.3. <hi>O Lord, what wilt thou give me, since I go childelesse:</hi> But yee must know, that before <hi>the vision shall speak,</hi> there is an appointed time that ye must wait, according to, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>After yee have suffered a while,</hi> then the promises shall bee accomplished, and yee shall bee made perfect.</p>
            <p>The sixth ground upon which Christians call in question the accomplishment of the promises, is, The consideration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the thing that is promised, when they compare it with their own worth and deserving, then they begin to dispute, <hi>O shall such a thing be,</hi> shall unworthy I, shall sinfull I, shall self-destroying I, shall I that <hi>am lesse then the least of his mercies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

               <hi>Abrahams</hi> misbelief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18. when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The last ground upon which Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dispute the accomplishment of the promises is, When in the time between their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the accomplishment of the promise they fall into some grosse iniquity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> helpeth a Christian to pray with much fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vency; when was it that <hi>David</hi> cryed to God? Was it not when he was believing the promise that past to him of old, we would not plead with God with such remissnesse i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we did believe the promises that are withi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Covenant.</p>
            <p>The third advantage is, That the faith o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the promises doth somtimes uphold a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107523:55"/>
under his spiritual disertions and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Is it not certain, that sometimes he hath been ready to draw that conclusion, I am cast out of his sight, and shall no more behold him in the land of the living? when a promise hath been born in upon his spirit, hath supported him and made him to change his song, and to invert his conclusion. This is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.18. when I said, <hi>my foot slippeth,</hi> there is the conclusion of misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and dispair, yet thy mercy, O Lord, <hi>did hold me up,</hi> there is the gate at which faith doth bring in consolation, not from bygone experiences onely; but certainly from that which he found in some precious promises that was born in upon his spirit: Many excellent cords of love hath Christ let down unto a soul, when they have been going down into the depths, and the weeds have been wrapt about their heads: It is clear likewise from <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My soul faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thy salvation:</hi> as if <hi>David</hi> had said, I am in hazard to give over my hope, and to break my confidence: And would ye know what was it that supported me under such an estate, <hi>I hoped in thy word:</hi> Hath not this oftentimes been the song of a Christian in their darkest night, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts do delight my soul</hi>: Faith will see a morning approaching in the time of the greatest trouble; and no doubt that promise that upholdeth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in their doubting and most misbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, the lively impressions of that promise will remain a long time with him;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107523:56"/>
and when first it is born in upon their spirits, they will see no small love shining forth in carving out such a promise to suit with such a providence as they are (it may be) meeting with for the time.</p>
            <p>The fourth advantage in believing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that thereby we have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent help to patience and divine submission under our saddest outward afflictions: this is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I had believed to see the goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the living</hi>; and from <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.49, 50. where <hi>David</hi> telling his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in the 49. <hi>I hope,</hi> saith he, <hi>in thy word,</hi> Immediately he subjoyneth, <hi>This is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in mine affliction,</hi> as if he had said, if <hi>I</hi> had not had the promises to be my comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I had sit alone and kept silence, and should have remained without comfort in the day of my adversity, and vers. 92. <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thy law had been my delight, I should have perished in my afflictions</hi>; and we conceive in short, the influence which faith upon the promises hath upon the patient bearing of the crosse, may be shown unto you in these two particulars; First, Faith it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prophet, that alwayes prophesieth unto us good things. Would ye enquire at Faith at your midnight of affliction, what is its opinion of God and of your own estate; Faith would sweetly resolve you thus, <hi>Wait on God for I shall yet praise him for the health of his countenance.</hi> Faith knoweth not what it is to have a wrong construction of God; and therefore it is the noble interpreter of a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107523:56"/>
Christians crosse: If sense, reason, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief interpret your crosse, they will make you cry out unto God, <hi>Why art thou become unto as an enemie,</hi> or <hi>as a liar, and waters that sail?</hi> but if faith that noble Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter do interpret your crosses, it will make you cry out, <hi>I know the thoughts of his heart, that they are thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give me an expected end.</hi> Faith letteth a Christian see a blessed ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gate and issue of all the sad dispensations that he meeteth with. Faith, that is its divinity, I sow in tears, but I shall reap in joy, <hi>weeping may be at evening,</hi> saith Faith, <hi>but joy shall come in the morning.</hi> Secondly, It affordeth unto a Christian such soul refreshing consolation in the midst of their afflictions, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they forget their sorrows, <hi>as waters that passe away</hi>; this <hi>David</hi> doth divinely assert in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>This is my comfort in mine affliction:</hi> The faith of the promises are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that tree which if they be cast into our waters of <hi>Marah, they will make them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately become sweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth advantage is, that the faith of the promises doth help a Christian to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distance with the world, and to live as a pilgrime, as is clear from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. where these two are sweetly linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their imbracing of the promises by Faith, and confessing <hi>that they were strangers and pilgrims here on earth.</hi> And we shall show the influence that faith hath upon this, in these three. 1. It maketh a Christian see the end of all perfection here, and that there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107523:57"/>
is nothing within this Glob of the World that <hi>is not vanity and vexation of spirit,</hi> Faith is that prospect through which a Christian hath most clear discoveries of the vanity of all things, and this doth exceedingly help him to live as a pilgrime. 2. It letteth a Christian see the endlesse perfections of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bringeth it within sight of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense and everlasting hope, and this maketh him to live as a pilgrime, and to declare plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>he seeketh a Countrey.</hi> And, 3. It doth exeedingly help him forward in that blessed work of weaning of affections from all things that are here; Would you know where a Believers heart is? It is in Heaven; would you know where <hi>his thoughts</hi> are? They are in Heaven; Would ye know where <hi>his conversation</hi> is? It is in Heaven; Would ye know where <hi>his hope</hi> is? It is in Heaven, his <hi>treasure</hi> is in heaven, and therefore his heart and his conversation is there, <hi>And Christ in him is the hope of glory</hi>: and indeed, more faith of the promises would constrain us all to subscribe that <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> that is in <hi>Heb</hi> 11.13.</p>
            <p>The sixth advantage that attendeth the believing of the promises, is. That it is the mother of much spiritual joy and divine consolation, and maketh a Christian to be much in the exercise of praise: this is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.14. <hi>But I will hope continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally,</hi> and then immediately is subjoyned, <hi>And will yet praise him more and more</hi>; As likewise from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. and from 1 <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1.8. If a man would have his way to heaven
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107523:57"/>
made pleasant, and while they are sitting by the rivers of <hi>Babel,</hi> would bee admitted to <hi>sing one of the songs of Zion,</hi> then ought they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o believe the promises, and to <hi>choose them as their heritage for ever:</hi> and then hee may sing in hope, and praise in expectation, though he have but little in hand for the present: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when he looketh to his possession, there will not be so much matter of rejoycing, but when hee looketh upon his hopes and his expectations, hee may be constrained to cry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth, <hi>Awake up O my glory, I my self will awake early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seventh advantage is, That the faith of the promises is a notable mean to attain unto spiritual life: This is clear from <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.16. <hi>By these things,</hi> saith <hi>Hezekiah, do men live,</hi> (speaking of the promises) <hi>and in all these things is the life of my spirit.</hi> As likewise from <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.50. <hi>Thy word,</hi> saith <hi>David, hath quickned mee.</hi> O what spirituall and divine life doth attend that Christian that is much in the exercise of Faith upon the promises: And what is the great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that <hi>our hearts</hi> are oftentimes <hi>dying within us like a stone,</hi> and wee are like unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose that <hi>are free among the dead?</hi> Is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot because wee do not make use of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, there is that advantage, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith of the promises, it maketh a Christian have an esteem of the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: What is the reason that wee write <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>And ninthly, The faith of the promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is the door at which the accomplishment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ground that ye do not study to conform your selves unto that blessed image of God. And I would only ask you this one question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it possible that such a delusion as this can overtake you, <hi>as to think,</hi> that ye who never studied holinesse on earth, shall yet enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heavens gates. I know there are some that say in their hearts, <hi>I shall have peace though I walk in the imaginations of my own heart:</hi> and many more, that suppose that they might fight and overcome, that they may quite the estate of nature, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the estate of grace all in one day. But why will ye deceive your selves, <hi>Can a nation be born in one day</hi>; Or is there but one step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hell and heaven? O remember, though nothing be impossible with God, yet there was but one thief saved upon the crosse.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Faith hath influence upon the attaining of holinesse in this respect, That it believeth the exceeding great advantages that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised unto the person that studieth holiness: Faith believeth that word, Matth. 5.8. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the poor in spirit, for they shall see God</hi>: Faith it layeth hold upon the truth of the excellent sayings, and maketh the Christian endeavour to attain unto a likenesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with him, that so he may be admitted to behold his face for all eternity, and to be made like unto him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Faith discovereth unto Christians the sinfulnesse of sin, that is never done till once
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107523:68"/>
they be in the lively exercise of the grace of Faith. And I will give you these three grounds why faith compleaty discovereth the sinfulnesse of sin. 1. Faith letteth us see the person against whom we commit this sin, and that doth exceedingly aggrege sin; for when the Christian is admitted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God; and to see that matchlesse excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that is in him; then (saith he) what a beast was I to offend such a glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty as He? What a fool was I to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pricks; or to enter in the lists with such an infinite God? 2. Faith letteth a Christian see these excellent obligations of love that Christ hath imposed upon us; Faith letteth us see the ancient and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting love of Christ; Faith is that grace that letteth us see his sufferings; Faith let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us see all that he hath done for us, and this maketh the Christian to cry out, <hi>Do I thus requite the Lord, O foolish one and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>: And no doubt, if a Christian were more taken up in the study of this duty, he would be lesse in contracting debt, and were you but seriously taken up in the study of these two great Registers. 1. The Register in which all the infinit acts of love are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. And, 2. That Register in which all your acts of offending precious Christ are written, ye would be astonished and ashamed to see so much forgiven you; and durst not sin any more; there ye would see infinite mercy desiring <hi>to rejoyce over Iudgement,</hi> and there ye would see the spotlesse riches of that transcendent grace that is in Christ.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107523:69"/>
3. Faith letteth a Christian see the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of sin, and what woful effects doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, and this doth exceedingly hold forth the sinfulnesse of sin.</p>
            <p>The second thing that we shall speak to concerning Faiths influence in the attaining Sanctification, shall be to enquire a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these things that hinder even Believers from attaining this blessed effect of their Faith; for some Christians there are that in some respects are taken up in the exercise of Faith, making use of Christ for Sanctification, and yet their making use of Christ by Faith, doth not weaken the strength of their idols (at least) to their apprehensions, neither yet raise them up to a conformity with God; so that they are constrained somtimes to cry out, <hi>I shall once fall by the hand of one of mine iniquities,</hi> and when they fight and doth not overcome, they are at last constrained to say, <hi>There is no hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first ground of such a dispensation is, That a Christian is not constant in his acting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Faith, he will be strong in faith to day, and when the morrow cometh, he will faint in that exercise, and this doth exceedingly interrupt the noble victory of Faith: For when faith hath gotten its advantages, they lose them through security and negligence: that is a command that should be continually obeyed, <hi>Trust in the Lord at all times:</hi> and no doubt, if a Christian were more taken up in the constant actings of Faith, he should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sing that song, <hi>I trusted in God, and I was helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:107523:69"/>Secondly, The most part of Christians, they are not strong and vigorous in actings of their Faith, their Faith is exceedingly weak, and so they cannot bring forth these noble fruits and effects of Faith. If we were trusting in God with all our hearts, then that promse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.5. should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished to us, <hi>Trust in the Lord, and hee shall bring it to passe.</hi> Thridly, There is a strong heart conjunction and soul union between us and our idols: wee are joyned to our idols, and therefore we cannot be easily divorced; yea, when we are in the heat of the war against them, there is a procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour within that cryeth, <hi>O spare this little one,</hi> or this <hi>profitable</hi> or <hi>pleasant</hi> one, and this is ordinarily our practice, to spare the choisest of our lusts; so that our <hi>Agags</hi> may cry forth, <hi>The bitternesse of death is past.</hi> But I confesse, if that union were once dissolved, wee should then bee heard with greatest ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse to cry forth, <hi>O blessed bee the Lord that teacheth my hands to fight.</hi> Fourthly, Sometimes a Christian layeth too much weight upon the actings of Faith, and doth not imploy Faith, but as an instrument to which Christ must bestow strength to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Sometimes we think that faith hath the vertue of overcoming in its own hand, but remember, Faith is but an empty thing without Christ: as ye may see, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. where the <hi>purifying their hearts by faith</hi> is ascribed to the holy Ghost, so that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of faith is from him, and not in it self. Fifthly, A Christian doth not hate sin with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107523:70"/>
a perfect hatred, even in the time of his warfare with his lusts, and with these strong idols that are within him, but there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret heart inclination to that very idol which he doth oppose: So that oftenimes there is that twofold contradiction in a Christian; Sometimes his light will cry, mortifie such an idol, and yet his heart will cry, O spare such an idol; yea more, sometimes his hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will cry, mortifie such an idol, and yet hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heart will cry, O spare such an idol: That is to say, there will be one part of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection crying one thing, and another part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it will cry another thing. O! but there is a remarkable command for the perfect hatred of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Abhor that which is evil.</hi> The word is in the Original, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e evil, as ye would do hell, that is: have perfect hatred to sin, O to hate iniquity as much as hell a and joyn that word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Reprove the unfruitfull works of darknesse</hi>; or as the word may be rendered, <hi>Make out by unanswerable arguments</hi> to your tentations, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imbrace the unfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>convince</hi> your tentations that ye cannot do it: As we suppose, it was a noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he was tempted, <hi>How shall I do this?</hi> he put the tentation (as it were) to it: O tentation give me ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ground why I should commit such an iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And certainly, if we were thus reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our tentations, they should flee before us: But the truth is, we imbace the desire of our tentation upon implicite faith. It is a sad regrate; and yet I may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107523:70"/>
it, O if men would but deal with God as they do by Satan, we never dispute the promise of Satan, and never examine these allurements he setteh forth, and yet we constantly dispute with God upon every thing. Sixthly, A Christian promoveth not in the growth of Sanctification, though in some measure exercising faith, because he hath not such a heart to holinesse. If we did discover more that excellent beauty, that is, in being cloathed with that glorious robe of the righteousnesse of Christ, and in having the sweet draughts of the Image of Christ engraven upon our hearts, we would have more victory over our lusts: There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>for a perfect love</hi> to that which is good, and holinesse in that same place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. and <hi>cleave</hi> (saith he) <hi>to that which is good</hi>; or, as the word may be rendered, <hi>Be married and glewed</hi> to that which is good, let there be an unspeakable and undissolvable knot of union between you and that which is good: And certainly, if once we believed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which is given of holinesse, we would endeavour more to be cloathed with it: but that is the great ground why we advance not in holinesse, we know not the advantage nor diguity, to be made <hi>like God.</hi> O will ye think on it, What a thing is it for you who are the dust of his feet, to be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him? Seventhly, A Christian is not much in the exercise of other duties that should go along with faith, suspect that faith for presumption, that can act, and be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without <hi>Prayer,</hi> certainly prayer it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107523:71"/>
keepeth in the life of Faith: Prayer, it is that grace that must act mutually with faith, in accomplishing that blessed work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and if we prayed more, and believed more, then we should have more to speak concerning the victory over our lusts. When was it, O Christian and expectant of heaven, that yee was constrained to put up an <hi>Eben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> and cry forth, <hi>Hitherto hath the Lord helped mee</hi>? When was it, O Christian and expectant of heaven, that ye was put to cry forth, <hi>God hath arisen,</hi> and <hi>mine enemies are scattered before my face</hi>? I will tell you what is your practice, ye make such a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with your idols, as <hi>Nahash</hi> did with the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2, 3. your lusts desire to make you pluck out your right eyes, and there is nothing your lusts will command you, but almost ye will obey; but would you send out prayers as a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to tell the King of such a tyrannie, yee should know better what it is to bee victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. There is such a Covenant between the graces of the Spirit, especially between faith and Prayer (if so wee may allude) as was made between <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abishai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11. one grace, as it were, saith to another, If I be weak, <hi>Come over and help me,</hi> and if ye be weak, <hi>I will come and help you.</hi> When once grace is like to fall in battel, then another grace cometh and helpeth it; when faith is like to die, then <hi>prayer and experience</hi> cometh in and sweetly helpeth faith; when <hi>love</hi> is beginning to die, and waxe cold in the fight, then <hi>faith</hi> cometh in and putteth life in <hi>love</hi>;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107523:71"/>
and when patience is like to fall and be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then <hi>faith</hi> comes in and speaks that word to <hi>patience, Wait on God, for I shall yet praise him for the health of his countenance.</hi> Oftentimes our patience and our sense they joyn together, for when sense speaketh good things, patience is in life, but when once sense preacheth hard things, it is like to die, and Faith must then maintain and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it.</p>
            <p>The third thing that we shall speak as to faiths influence upon Sanctification, shall be to draw these four conclusions from the point.</p>
            <p>The first is, That ye may know from this, the rise and original of your little successe over corruption: There are many that are troubled with this question; O! what is the ground that I get not victory over my lusts, and they propose that question to Christ that once the Disciples proposed to him, <hi>Why was it that I could not cast out such a devil?</hi> And I can give no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer nor Christ gave to them, it is, because ye have not faith; <hi>For if yee had faith as a grain of mustard seed,</hi> yee might say unto your idols, depart from us, and they should obey you, and there should not be a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the way between you and heaven, but if ye had faith, it should be rolled away and become a plain. And the ground why many are groaning under the captivity of their idols, is, That they are not much in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of faith; sometimes yee enter in the lists with your lusts in your own strength,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107523:72"/>
then ye are carried captives, and if ye do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the lists having some faith, yet ye main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not the war, il faith get but one stroke.</p>
            <p>I will tell you six things which if faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, it keepeth the fields, and maketh the Christian sing a song of triumph, even before a compleat victory.</p>
            <p>First, Faith helpeth a Christian to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that idol of <hi>impatience</hi> and discontent, some never met with a discouragement, but they cry out, <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why should I wait any longer,</hi> they are soon put to the end of their patience: Now faith can overcome such an idol, and I will tell you three excellent things that faith performeth to the soul under impatience, or when it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in hazard of it. 1. Faith telleth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>there is an end,</hi> and their <hi>expectation shall not be cut off</hi>; Faith telleth that there is a morning as well as night, and this keepeth the soul from being overcome with disco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, when they are brought to the midnight of trouble; Faith can tell what hour of the night it is, and how near the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of the morning, when day shall break and all their clouds flee away. 2. Faith helpeth the Christian to see there is much in Christ to make up any losse or disadvantage that they have; if ye losse your son, or your choisest contentment in the world, Faith will say such a word as <hi>Elkana</hi> said to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8. Is not <hi>Christ better to thee then ten sons?</hi> The choisest contentments ye can lose, (that is faiths divinity) Christ is worth an hundred of them: and so this maketh the

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107523:73"/>
that idol of self-indulgence forbiddeth us. I will tell you its counsel and great advice it giveth you, <hi>O person, pity thy self,</hi> that same counsel <hi>Peter</hi> gave his Master, it biddeth you <hi>pity your self</hi>: But if wee could rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret that language, it would be this, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your self,</hi> for <hi>self indulgence,</hi> and <hi>self-love</hi> is that which will ruine you. O what bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed attainments of God; what blessed frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Jesus Christ, what advancement in mortification, what conformity to God hath that idol of self indulgence obstructed, and <hi>not only</hi> utterly ruined, even in the best?

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107523:74"/>
upon the bringing low of such an idol; for faith discovereth to a so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our second conclusion is this, That as Faith helpeth Sanctification, so Sanctification helpeth Faith. I will tell yow three great advantages Faith hath by the growth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Sanctification. 1. It is a noble evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of faith, and maketh a Christian to bee perswaded that hee is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tled upon the Rock, and that his interest in God is made sure. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is that which will help a Christian dayly to read his interest in God: This is clear from <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.18. <hi>I will shew thee my faith by my workes,</hi> where this is clearly hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth, That a Christian much in the work of Sanctification, hee can upon all times give an extract of his Faith, and, as it were, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it and shew it to the world. 2. Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication maketh faith perfect, according to that remarkable word, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.22. <hi>And by workes was faith made perfect.</hi> There is a noble perfection that redoundeth to faith through the exercise of the work of Sanctification; for not only is it thereby made manifest, and receiveth such a shining luster and splendor, as that sometimes the eyes of carnal men are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en dazled to behold a Believer, but it also receiveth strength and power: Faith is not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107523:74"/>
of the nature of these things that spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in bringing forth, but on the contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f faith bring forth a hundred children (I mean works of holinesse) in one day, it groweth stronger: and this is further clear, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>For if these things be in you, and abound, ye shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, Wee may draw this conclusion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

15. give you these eight properties of a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites faith and hope, which may make you try and examine your self. 1. Their hope and their faith is but an act of folly, yea, there is not such an act of foolishnesse under heaven, as a hypocrites hope; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is but a castle in the aire, and as writing to himself a charter on the sand: so that word yee have rendered, whose <hi>hope shall be cut off</hi>; is in the Original, whose <hi>folly shall be cut off</hi>; shewing this, that they build without a foundation, and so their faith must bee most unsure and uncertain, 2. The thing they hope for shall at last loath them: O hypocrites, yee hope for enjoyment of Christ, but be perswaded of it, Christ shall eternally loath you, and yee shall eternally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ath Christ: that is clear in that same wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Whose hope shall be cut off,</hi> or as the word may be read, <hi>Whose hope shall loath them,</hi> the thing he hoped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or shall loath him, and Christ shall say, <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi> 3. And though yee have now much delight and pleasure in the actings of your presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous hope, yet at the last, ye shall loath that hope: The word will carry that, not only the thing ye hoped for shall loath you, but ye likewise shall loath your hope. The day is coming, that yee shall cry forth, cursed be the day that ever I believed that I should get heaven. 3. It shall at last be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his vexation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from that word, whose hope <hi>shall be cut off</hi>; or as the word may be rendered, whose <hi>hope shall vex him.</hi> O whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the hypocrites shall meet with that anxious,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107523:75"/>
that dreadull disappointment one day, they shall then put their hand on their head, being ashamed because of their confidence. 4. He studieth by all means to keep his hope, though it be but false, therefore have ye that word in the 15 verse, <hi>hee holdeth it fast,</hi> or is the word is, hee <hi>keepeth it with hand and arm, with all his strength</hi> hee keepeth his hope: so that if Christ would come from heaven and say, <hi>man,</hi> thou art a hypocrite, and thy <hi>hope shall be cut off,</hi> they would say, I will keep my hope <hi>Sir,</hi> and maintain it, and that is an evidence your hope is not built upon the foundation; I love never a faith that in this side of time is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and never knoweth what it is to have ups nor downs. 5. It is built alwayes upon a wrong foundation, which is imported in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> word, <hi>He shall lean upon his house,</hi> which we suppose may interpret thus, hee shall lean upon his, <hi>worldly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>njoyments,</hi> or upon these spiritual like enjoyments hee met with. The hope of a hypocrite is never built upon Christ, and so unquestionably that hope shall be cut off and evanish. 6. Let hypocrites hold fast their hope with both their arms, I will say these three words to them: First, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all the Ministers should preach to you, and desire you to quite your hope, and yee will not, yet doth your hope and you shall bee separate: as it is in that word. <hi>Your hope shall depart from you,</hi> and yee shall quite it. Secondly, Your hope will bring you <hi>to death,</hi> and no further: according to that word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.14. <hi>Whose hope shall bring

not.</hi> I would presse these three things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. First, O yee that are strangers to Christ, and that know not what it is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the offers of the everlasting Gospel, obey that excellent counsel, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Give Christ your hand</hi>; for that word which ye have rendered, <hi>Yeeld your self to the Lord,</hi> it is in the Original, <hi>Give your hand to God</hi>; which is in short, <hi>Marry him,</hi> and be content to <hi>contract</hi> your s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf to him; for believe it, the day is coming, that either that contract between you and Christ, shall bee eternally confirmed, or that contract between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and you, shall be eternally ratified. And, I suppose, there is so much spoken to the commendation of that noble Plant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, that yee may take Christ (if so wee may speak) blindly, ye may close your eyes and take him, for hee shall never disappoint your hope; for let you think of him to Eternity, hee shall alwayes be above your thoughts. Secondly, I would earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you once to search and try, what was the first rise of your faith in Jesus Christ: I am perswaded of it, there are many that take up their faith at their foot, they never travelled in pain, and yet faith is brought forth. Is not this a mystery? shall it be said, <hi>before they travelled, they brought forth</hi>? I do not question but there may be lesse and greater pangs of the new birth, but this is most certain, there is alwayes some either lesser troubles or greater, till that childe be brought forth: and yet I may condemn these that <hi>stay too long in the place of the breaking

               </gap> have not been so many years and dayes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Law: Thirdly, Let me desire you to go and ask, is there a grave between you and heaven, in all that way through which the Saints have travelled, upon which this is written, here lyeth a man that sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought life from Christ, and he denyed him. I think without encroaching too much upon the searching forth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Saints in heaven, I think we may suppose, there may be in heaven some <hi>Queries</hi> and Interrogations: Christ shall ask<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O beloved, Did ye want any thing here below when ye was sent forth to travel in the world? and yee shall be constrained to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>swer, <hi>No</hi>: Christ shall ask that question a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you. Did I not all things well? and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> shall be constrained to answer, <hi>Yes</hi>: Christ shall propose that question, Are ye not well rewarded for all your pains? and you shall be constrained to answer, <hi>Yes</hi>: O but to take him, He is the blessed and most excellent One in heaven and in earth, it is the best bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ever ye made: O ye Merchants that have made many excellent bargains to your own apprehension, will ye come and make one excellent bargain yet, that will make you eternally up? And what is that? Come and <hi>buy Christ</hi> and take him for nothing, this is not your ordinary bargaining: there is few comes to you, and biddeth you buy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things <hi>without money</hi>; but come in the Gospel, and ye shall get Christ <hi>without
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107523:77"/>
money:</hi> O niggards that are loath to spend your money in the world, will yee come to Christ and believe on him, take him freely: O say ye, if I could get three things of Christ, I would come. 1. I would have much gold and silver; I say, come to Christ, and ye shall get much gold and silver: Is that true? it is abundantly true: See <hi>Iob</hi> 22.25, 26. where pressing that exhortation, <hi>Acquaint thy self with God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and using many arguments, he saith. <hi>Thou shall lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</hi> Is not that gold enough? yea, ye shall have silver like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Thou shalt have plenty of silver.</hi> In the 26. verse, ye shall not only have gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but shall have <hi>plenty of it,</hi> and shall have the most excellent and refined gold. But O say ye, will that promise be literally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished to me if I come to Christ. I would only say these three things to thee: 1. Come to Christ, and if gold and silver be for thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, thou shall have it literally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. 2. I say, ye shall have as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in Jesus Christ, as if yee had this house full of gold. 3. I will say this to thee, Christ shall be thy gold and thy silver: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that word in the 26. verse, which is most remarkable; yea, <hi>the Almighty shall be thy defence</hi>; or as it is in the Original, shall be thy <hi>gold,</hi> speaking of the promise of gold before. Secondly, Ye say, I would have this that what I purpose might be accomplished: I say, come to Christ and yee shall have that likewise, <hi>Iob.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou shalt decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee</hi>; which I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107523:78"/>
conceive, doth not only take in these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual decrees; but likewise these that relate to temporal enjoyments. But there is a third thing I would have (say yee) and I would come to Christ, and it is, that I might have all the desires of my heart: I say, O man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and O woman, come to Christ, and thou shall have what thou desirest: This is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Delight thy self in God, and hee shall give thee the desires of thy heart</hi>: What can ye have man but it is there? Would yee have any thing of Christ? Hee putteth a blank in your hand, and saith that word which he said to <hi>Solomon, Ask</hi>; What would yee have, and I shall give you, Christ, as it were, putteth his name to the foot of a clean sheet of paper, and hee desireth you to ask what ye would have, And is not this an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bargan? O niggard, what would yee have which ye will not get in Christ? And bee perswaded, that ye that refuse and will not take him, the eternal curse of all that is in heaven will return upon thy head, the eternall curse of all the expectants of heaven and heirs of life will return upon the head of that person that will not take Christ. And cursed, cursed shall that person be who will not take Christ, and one day <hi>all the Congregation</hi> in heaven and earth shall say, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>ASsurance is a precious gift which many that live in these dayes do undervalue, and trode under foot; do not the Christians of these times go halting between two opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither positive that they are received <hi>into the adoption of children,</hi> not positive that they are yet in a state of alienation, and <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in their minds by wicked works</hi>; yea, and (that which is worse) there are many among us that walk with much contentment under their uncertainty. I think it is a fault to be condemned in many, they pursue more to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their sense for the present, nor to have a solide well grounded assurance for time to come: I could wish that all the debates and questions of these dayes, that take up so much of our time, and so much of our spirits from better things, were happily drowned in these four excellent questions, which without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie are of greatest concernment for all to have resolved. 1.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sweet to be asking seriously, <hi>Saw yee him whom my soul loveth</hi>: There is much of our time spent in asking news from Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from abroad, concerning the revolutions of States and Kingdomes: But I suppose, it were better to ask, What news from heaven concerning thy self, and what news from within, and news of thy Bridegrooms come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? for these are great Courts, I mean the Court of heaven, and the Court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the affairs of which, a Christian should endeavour much to know. 5. It is a soul-concerning question, that a Christian should be much in proposing to himself, <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits.</hi> It is certain, we must say, that our faith and assurance, and all our other mercies are from him, and yet alas, we are negligent in praises, we may with <hi>Tamar</hi> rent our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>of divers colours,</hi> even the <hi>garments of the Kings daughters,</hi> because of spiritual whoredome against God, and our ingratitude to him.</p>
            <p>Now having spoken unto you at so great a length of that precious and fundamentall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107523:79"/>
grace of Faith, wee have thought fit to shut up all in speaking a little upon these wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds we now have read, concerning the evidence and assurance of Faith. The Apostle in this Chapter is vindicating his Ministery and Apostleship, from the contempt that was cast upon it, he proveth he was a Minister of the New Testament, called and sent of God, by the blessing and successe he had among them, in that hee had not plowed nor threshed in vain; and they being so much in censuring his way, and seeking an account of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery: In these words, he doth (as it were) draw them off by a holy diversion unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther businesse, as if hee had said to them, O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I will divert you from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of judging me, and will lead you into an exercise that is more divine and profitable; be much in judging and examining your selves: and indeed, it is a truth worth our observation, that if we were more in judging of our selves, wee would be lesse in judging others: but alas, there are some of us, wee are so much abroad, that we cannot be much at home.</p>
            <p>In the words, there is these six things considerable. First, That there is such a thing attainable by a Christian while hee is here, as a distinct perswasion and assurance that he is in the Faith, and hath an interest in Christ: <hi>by being in the faith</hi>; here is not to be understood, a being in the <hi>doctrine of Faith</hi> only, but it is to be understood of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, being indeed and really united to Christ by Faith. Secondly, That the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107523:80"/>
after assurance, is a necessary commanded duty, for ye see here the words very impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Examine your selves, prove your selves.</hi> Thirdly, That there are many mistakes and delusions among people, concerning that noble and excellent thing, <hi>Assurance,</hi> there being many that keep fast a hope which Christ shall once discountenance and sweep away, like <hi>a spiders web,</hi> and this is imported in these words, <hi>Examine your selves,</hi> or as the word may bee rendered, <hi>Take an acurate and an experimental search</hi> of your selves, <hi>try your selves, or prove your selves:</hi> it is a word that is borrowed from the Gold-smiths fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying Gold. And so his putting of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to so acurate a search of themselves, saith this clearly to us, there are many mistakes concerning this thing, many do passe a decreet in their own favours before Christ hath passed his approbation of them. Fourthly, Take notice of this from the word, that there is much and exceeding much advantage, by trying and searching whether we bee in the faith or no; this is imported in his doubling the exhortation. Fifthly, That one most excellent and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way of attaining assurance, whether we be in the faith or no, is self examination, and putting our self to the trial, as if he had said, would ye have a distinct perswasion that yee are in Christ, then bee much in the exercise of self-examination. For the rest of the words of the verse, wee intend not to handle.</p>
            <p>As to the first, <hi>That there is such a thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107523:80"/>
attainable:</hi> I shall only propose these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unto you to make it evident. 1. It is known in Scripture, that the Saints of old have in ordinary way attained to distinct perswasion of their interest in Christ, <hi>Song.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perswaded</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that neither death nor life, &amp;c. shall bee able to separate mee from the love of God in Christ.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>For we know, if this our earthly tabernacle were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, wee have a house with God not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> 2. It is the great scope of many Scriptures, to shew how Christians may attain to assurance, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13. <hi>These things I write unto you, that yee may know that yee have eternal life.</hi> The great end and design of <hi>Iohn,</hi> writing in these Epistles, is, to make a soul acquaint with Christ, and to make them to accept of him, and to give them a distinct assurance that Christ hath accepted them. 3. There are many commands in Scripture for Christians to be serious in searching after assurance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Wherefore brethren, give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi> It is the blessed end of Gods oath in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, that a Christian might get assurance. What was the ground and great end that God confirmed his Covenant with an oath, was it not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That by two immutable things, wherein it was impossible for God to lie, ye might have strong consolation.</hi> 5. If assurance of our interest in Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st were not attainable, then these precious graces of joy
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107523:81"/>
and love could not be well exercised: if a Christian were evermore in the dark concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his interest in Christ, hee could not give obedience to that exhortation, <hi>Rejoyce ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, again, I say, rejoyce,</hi> 6. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath set down these means by which a Christian may win to assurance: as is clear, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18, 19. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5. compared with <hi>vers</hi> 10. where the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> pressing the Doctrine of making our calling and election sure, hee fetteth down these excellent means by which they may win to in, and doubtlesse the marks and evidences that are registrate in the Scripture of a gracious state, do assure us, that assurance is attainable. 7. What are the ends of the Sacraments, but that our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may bee confirmed, and that our faith may be strengthned, the two Sacraments are the two great Seals of heaven that are put to the Charter of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now as to the applitation, and the more full improvement of this first point, I shall only offer these considerations. 1. I would have it taken notice of, that though grace and assurance be two lovers, yet there is no such band of union between them, that the one cannot consist without the other: A Christian may have the real grace of God, and yet walk in darknesse and have no light: a Christian may be going to heaven, and yet that word oftentimes in his mouth, <hi>I am cut off from thy sight</hi>; yea, are there not even some who have had assurance, and sometime a day have been admitted to draw that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <hi>I am my beloveds, and his desire is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107523:81"/>
towards me,</hi> who are now under darknesse concerning their interest, and in much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of spirit, doe sometimes cry out, <hi>My hope and my strength is perished from the Lord.</hi> But therefore let me say this one word, both to weak ones who never had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, and deserted ones who have lost it; when ye misse assurance, beware of drawing such negative conclusions concerning your graces, but when ye fit in darknesse and see no light, <hi>Trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay your selves upon your God</hi>; that is when ye cannot reach the faith of assurance, be much in maintaining of adherence, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Iobs</hi> divinity, <hi>Though thou should kill me, yet will I trust in thee,</hi> and consider that sweet word, <hi>He will keep them in perfect peace, whose hearts are stayed on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My second consideration is, That since as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance is attainable, ye would study to finde out and remove these things that doth hinder you from attaining unto it. And that we may help you in this, we conceive, that the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a Christians assurance, are especially in these two. 1. Our mistaking of the Lords dealing towards us. And, 2. Our untender and unsuitable dealing towards him.</p>
            <p>Of the first sort we shall lay before you these five. The first is, want of favourable termes of prayer; this often maketh a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to debate his interest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and call in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his evidences, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3 8. compared with verse 18. <hi>I cry and shout, but he shutteth out my prayers</hi>: And this is the conclusion of that dispensation, verse 18. <hi>My hope and my
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107523:82"/>
strength is perished from the Lord</hi>; and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> especially occasioned when the Christian i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> most serious and fervent in prayer, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he meeteth not with a return, this maketh them exceedingly debate their interest. And I confesse, it is a sad dispensation to meet with a silent Christ in prayer; but yet that needeth not make a Believer question all, and debate the reality of his interest in God, since the dearest of all the children of the Kingdom have been so dealt with, even a <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 22. <hi>Cryed night and day without silence,</hi> and is not heard, but cryeth out, <hi>Why art thou so far from helping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the words of my roaring</hi>; yea, that passage may relate to him who was <hi>the root and off spring of David</hi>; for even he was so dealt with, and had not presently a sensible return, when he had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice, <hi>that the cup might passe from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The want of sensible enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and liberty in prayer, that hee never got to his knees, but his heart beginneth to die like a stone within him, then hee cryeth forth that word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> and sure if I had the Spirit of the Lord, I would have liberty in the exercise of prayer, and that this is a rise of the disputing of our interest, is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.4. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 7.9. saith <hi>David, I am sore troubled that I cannot speak,</hi> I have no liberty in prayer, I never go to God in prayer, but (as it were) my tongue sticketh to the roof of my mouth: he from hence draweth that conclusion, <hi>Hath God forgotten to bee gracious, and hath hee in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107523:82"/>
wrath shut up his tender mercies for ever</hi>: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, this also is a sad dispensation to meet with an absent and vailed Christ in prayer: so that we can never go to seek God in secret, but we may write this upon our prayers, <hi>He is gone, he is gone,</hi> especially when we have lost that liberty that formerly we have had: and therfore is <hi>Davids</hi> perplexity much heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. from his <hi>remembring his song in the night, and his calling to mind the years of ancient times</hi>; yet wee may remember how soon <hi>David</hi> wrote his retractions, as to that sad conclusion, I <hi>said, this is my infirmity,</hi> ver. 10. and so should we do when upon every straiting in prayer, wee begin to question all the Lords kindnesse towards us.</p>
            <p>A third obstruction of assurance, is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians wrestling with his corruptions pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and seriously, and yet not meeting with any sensible victory over them, but upon the contrary, their corruptions seem to bee stronger, and they themselves seem to bee weaker, and then it is, they strengthen their misbelief, but that word, 1 Joh. 3 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self even as he is pure</hi>: And indeed, this is a knot that is not easily loosed, but when hee seeth his idols and corruptions prevailing over him, hee will cry out, <hi>I am gone,</hi> and <hi>there is no help in Israel concerning this thing,</hi> and yet this also is a word in haste, <hi>Paul</hi> hath registrate himself a standing witnesse, even after hee was a chosen vessel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. How strangely a childe of God may bee born down with a <hi>body of death</hi> even under most
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107523:83"/>
serious wrestlings against it: And there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore if thou seriously maintain that combate though thou do not sensibly prevail, thou ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no reason upon that ground to weaken th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> assurance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When a Christian is put to mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then ordinary outward affliction, when Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> doth dispence sadly unto them in outwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things, they then begin to cal in question thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interest, and dispute their assurance, this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> clear, by comparing <hi>Lament</hi> 3. vers. 18. wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the preceeding words, where speaking of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sad dispensations they meet with, he draweth that conclusion in verse 18. <hi>My hope and my strength is perished from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Ion.</hi> 2.2. where he draweth that conclusion from such a promise. <hi>I am now cast out of thy sight,</hi> the devil he taketh <hi>Eliphaz</hi> divinity and presents it to a Christian; <hi>Call now if there be any to answer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou go:</hi> As if he had said, did thou ever know a Christian afflicted so as thou art afflicted, and so he would have <hi>Iob</hi> to quite his integrity; But yet we know all these blessed ones for all their afflictions, were dear unto the Lord, and had their interest secure in him, yea, <hi>as many as he loveth, he doth rebuke and chasten,</hi> and it is bastards and not sons on whom he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a rod, and therefore we ought not to quarrel our interest because of afflictions.</p>
            <p>And lastly, The rise of a Christians dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and that which hindereth their assurance, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when their former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the manifestations of God doth not relish to them, and when the promises upon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107523:83"/>
which they have built become tastlesse unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem <hi>as the white of an egge,</hi> and when they meet not with God in Ordinances, but these become lifelesse, when these three rise toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her upon them, their case becomes very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lexed oftentimes: and this also seemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave been <hi>Davids</hi> case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. When <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered his song in the night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the dayes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld,</hi> and yet had no sweetnesse in them, then he breaketh forth into these bitter complaints which are there expressed: but yet as we said before, this was his infirmity, and there is no reason for a Christian to question his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest upon such an account; because the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are not at all times alike lively even to the best, and the Lord is not alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but though sometimes the <hi>candle of the Lord doth shine upon his head,</hi> yet at other times hee is necessitate to cry out, <hi>O that it were with me as in months past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second sort of obstructions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians assurance, I mean such as flow from our untender dealing towards God are,</p>
            <p>First, A guilty conscience; that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 9. <hi>Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience</hi>; It telleth us, that this excellent grace of Faith cannot bide but in a cleanly lodging, even in a <hi>pure conscience,</hi> and when a Christian setteth about to believe hee will know how a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will flee in his face, and cry out, <hi>O adventure not to believe, dare thou believe</hi>; the guiltinesse of a Christians conscience maketh him oft to cry out, <hi>Touch not the mountain</hi> lest <hi>thou be thrust thorow</hi>: And I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107523:84"/>
tell you three disadvantages of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. 1. It obstructeth a Christians bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in making applications to Christ; his heart saith <hi>close,</hi> and his necessity saith <hi>close</hi>; but his guilty conscience cryeth out, <hi>O stand aback</hi> and do not <hi>close.</hi> 2. A guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence oftentimes it hindereth the discoveries of Christ to the soul, and doth so affright and terrifie, yea, it will so sting and bite us, that when he revealeth himself, we cannot take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, when he would lay on a plaster, our souls will tear it off, <hi>and refuse to be comforted.</hi> 3. It doth exceedingly obstruct our going about duty. O but our soul moves slowly in the paths of God when wee are under the power of a guilty conscience.</p>
            <p>The second obstruction is, That wee are not much in the exercise of tendernesse. O but if a Christian were tender, and if in every step of his life hee desired <hi>to set Christ before his eyes,</hi> he wold easily win to much assurance, according to that word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64 5. <hi>Thou meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est him that rejoycest and worketh righteousnesse, and these that remember thee in thy wayes</hi>: Would yee know the assured Christian, it is the tender Christian; the Christian that doth not crucifie convictions, the Christian that brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth not resolutions, the Christian that doth not sit <hi>calls</hi> and opportunities to prayer, the Christian that saith not of any sin <hi>it is a little one</hi>; or the Christian that searcheth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, watcheth alwayes, examineth alwayes, and is alwayes casting out sin, that is the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured Christian.</p>
            <p>The third obstruction is, The want of the

            <p>The fourth time is, when hee is to be put to some hard and difficult duty: Before <hi>Abraham</hi> be put to forsake his native land, and become a stranger and a wanderer, hee meeteth with sweet intimation of his interest, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. <hi>I will make of thee a great nation,</hi> and vers. 7. <hi>The Lord appeared unto Abraham,</hi> and before <hi>Ieremiah</hi> be sent a Preacher to a rebellious people, <hi>he will</hi> have that <hi>word</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto him, <hi>I know thee before thou wast brought forth.</hi>

            <p>The seventh time is, when a Christian is under sad persecution and affliction, then will the Lord give a word from heaven to comfort him and assure him of his fatherly love and mercy: When was it that Christ left that noble Legacy to his Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. ver. 27. <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give you,</hi> was it not when he himself was to leave them to troublesome and sorrowful dayes, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting world.</p>
            <p>The eighth time is at some solemn Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and approaches to God, the dayes of a Communion to a tender Christian have been sweet dayes, when Christ hath come to the soul, and said, <hi>Behold me, behold me.</hi> I think the eleven Apostles met with much assurance of their interest in Christ at the Communion they were at with him: O what sweet intimations were these, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you,</hi> and <hi>this cup is the New Testament in my blood shed</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> and a little after, <hi>you are they which have continued with me in my tentation, and I appoint unto you a kingdom.</hi>

upon the other: But the thing I say, is, that the Christians <hi>seeking</hi> after assurance, and his real (endeavouring to attain unto it, is a necessary command of God which hee hath bound upon the consciences of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren amongst other Gospel duties; And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, we need go no further for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this then the Text it self; what meaneth these peremptory injunctions, <hi>Examine your selves whether ye be in the faith or not: Prove your own selves; Know yee not, &amp;c.</hi> but if you will, you may add that word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. vers. 5. and 10. compared, what can be more expresly commanded, and more strongly pressed, then that Christians should bend their utmost endeavours for attaining unto this blessed condition of assurance: <hi>Give diligence,</hi> yea, <hi>give all diligence,</hi> yea, <hi>the rather give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this, we shall only lay before you these Considerations. 1. If the seeking after assurance be a necessary duety, then these three things are most lamentable. First, That there are so many in this Generation <hi>who are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their iniquity</hi>; they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a rotten assurance, that hath no other foundation but their own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they never knew since the first day they were Baptized and did begin to professe Christ, what it was to mortifie one lust, nor seriously to wrestle against one temptation, and yet they want not a strong perswasion of their interest in Christ: But ah, will yee

            <p n="2">2. How sad may we be upon this account; that howbeit assurance be an attainable thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a great many dare not say they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; yet so little diligence is used in pursuing after it: Is it not very lamentable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many of you to whom I am speaking, since first ye gave up your names to Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>A second consideration from this point is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if the seeking after assurance be so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary a duty, then let me beseech you to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your selves what means are fit for you to use that ye may attain it, and if ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what these means are, I shall onely lay before you some few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ye would be much in the exercise of Faith, I mean the direct acts of Faith, whereby the sinner from his sense and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wants, layeth hold on Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> closing with him, and leaning upon him for a full supply out of his fulnesse: for indeed there are two great faults amongst the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107523:90"/>
whether they be real or not, then they are in strengthening their evidences, so that most of their time is spent in question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O! is this a real evidence of assurance; whereas more actual believing in Christ and gripping to the promises, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sse disputing, were the shorter and surer way, that word is most clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>After ye believed, yee were sealed with the Spirit of promise,</hi> that is, ye got assurance, but not before ye believed: and ye know it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9 2. <hi>And when Iesus saw their Faith, he said, Son, be of good comfort, thy sinnes are forgiven thee</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so then it is clear, that to be much in believing, is the nearest way to assurance.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the words, there are three great and most soul-concerning errour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> amongst the Christians of these dayes, that we desire ye may consider. 1. There are many that are more desirous to know what they are, then what they should do; there are some are more taken up to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be justified and sanctified, then to be indeed justified and sanctified; and they are more desirous to know if they be in Christ, then indeed to be in him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we finde many who do spend a great deal more time disputing that question, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I in Christ or not,</hi> then they do i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> using of these means by which real union and communion with him may be attained: But oh, will ye once study more to be in him, and that shall be the shortest way to attain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107523:92"/>
to the knowledge of your being in him. The second great errour is, that some are more desirous to know what they should do, then they are desirous to do what they know; Are there not many of us that have this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,</hi> and yet we do not know his Commandment is with us; and that wee <hi>should do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.</hi> A third errour is, that we are more in talking of Christ, than in believing in him, or closing with him: Some of us think to win to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by discourses, if we can talk of Christ, wee think all is without debate or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie; but alas, there are many who were sweet talkers of Christ, that are cursing him this day in Hell. And I would only say this by the way, if there be any of you that have win to any soul perswasion of your interest in Christ, I intreat you if you can put the conclusion upon record, that in such a day of such a Month, and such a Year of God, you did then win to cry out, <hi>I am my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds and he is mine:</hi> It seemeth to have been <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my soul thou hast said unto the Lord, thou art my Lord</hi>; and it was <hi>Ierimiahs</hi> practice, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul,</hi> I say, yee should even mark that conclusion as they did, that when tentations come, and begin to assault you, ye may look to your record that yee have set down, and bee ashamed to misbelieve. It is true, that for a little while our assurance at best will be but ebbing and flowing, but I hope ere long, we shall bee
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107523:93"/>
above the reach of misbelief, and above the reach of fears, I hope ere long, we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no more, we shall be jealous no more, and we shall question our interest no more, when all our disputings and questionings shal be sweetly drowned in that infinit ocean of eternal delight and fruition of God. O <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants of heaven, expectants of heaven,</hi> are ye not looking after this day, are ye not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it: I know not what we do here, if we be not walking forward every day: he is upon his way; O to see him, we will even stand and wonder at him: I hope the day is coming when we shall never lose our grips of Christ any more, he is coming, he is coming; and I think if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ would give a Passe, we would long to go hence: O what streets are these that are there, is there any here who is groaning for heaven, be of good comfort, I hope ere long he shall come, he shall come and wash all tears from our eyes.</p>
            <p>Now at the last occasion, when we spake upon these words, we told you that there was five or six things which we intended to consider in them. The first was, that such a thing as a distinct and well grounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of our interest in Christ was attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and of this we have already spoken. The second thing is, That concerning this noble and excellent thing assurance, there are many mistakes among the people of God, and to make this evident, is is clear first in this Text, from that serious and acurate search in this matter, which the Apostle putteth these people unto, as we cleared
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107523:93"/>
unto you from the force of the words, and his doubling of these exhortations, <hi>Try your own selves, prove your own selves.</hi> 2. From the many commands which the Lord hath left upon record that we should not be mistaken concerning our assurance, 1 Cor. 3.18. <hi>Let no man deceive himself,</hi> Gal. 6.3. <hi>If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself,</hi> and therefore doth the Apostle adde, <hi>Let every one prove his own work,</hi> and verse 7. <hi>Be not deceived.</hi> 3. The point is clear from this, that we find in Scripture many who have been mistaken most dreadfully in the matter of their assurance, <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. <hi>Israel cryeth out, my God we know thee,</hi> and yet <hi>Israel</hi> was in a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, for in the words following, verse 3. <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had cut off the thing that was good,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. <hi>verse</hi> 12. we finde there, <hi>A genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their iniquities.</hi> 4. It is clear from this, that it is a great design of Satan the great deceiver, that we might be mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that noble and weighty point of our <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> of being in Christ: Is there not a power given unto him from Christ to deceive the Nations; I may say, that in no point doth he more prevail to deceive us then in this: If profanity kill its <hi>thousands,</hi> delusion kills <hi>ten thousands,</hi> &amp; this delusion its <hi>twenty thousands.</hi> Lastly, Doth not this prove how much a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may be mistaken in the matter of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, even that came which is given to our hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. vers. 9. <hi>It is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, and who
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107523:94"/>
can know it</hi>; no doubt this may show us (though there were no more) how ready our hearts are to deceive us, making us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a delusion in stead of truth, and imbrace a shadow in stead of substance.</p>
            <p>The next thing that wee have to speak to you upon this point, is to show you where these mistakes do lye, and what are these false grounds by which so many do deceive their own souls in this matter; and here there are two sorts of persons whom we must inform. 1. There be some who upon most unwarrantable grounds do conclude that their interest in Christ is sure, when indeed it is not. 2. There be some (upon the other hand) who from sad mistakes of themselves, and the Lords dealing towards them, deny that they have an interest, when indeed they have. The first sort are the worst, and in the most dangerous condition, and they build u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon these six false foundations, which wee beseech them to consider.</p>
            <p>The first is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their supposed sensible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, some Christians in these times espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially do meet with some flashes of light and joy which they have not been (it may bee) acquainted with before, or at least, not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> such a measure, or in such a sensible manner, and upon this they presently cry forth, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> I shall not dispute with such about the reality of these enjoyments, or how they came to know that these are such as proceed from a saving work of the Spirit of Grace, but waving that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, give me leave to say this much of all

Some build their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon the number and bulk of their duties, without considering the frame of their spirit, and the principle from which they flow, they use prayer, and reading, and conference, they wait upon Ordinances, and are alwayes there where the means is thought to bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most powerfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon this they take up themselves in their own arms, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves as that poor man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>I fast twise a week, I pay tithes of all that I possesse</hi>: But alas, they do not consider that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do but build their house upon the sand, which the first blast of a temptation will overturn, because not only all our duties when weighed in the ballance, may be found light, but when put to the tryal may be found empty, dead, and lifelesse things, wherein the LORDS soul can have no pleasure. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some are mistaken in the matter of their assurance, by judging themselves by the law, not knowing or not regarding the spiritual meaning thereof: <hi>Paul</hi> was a gallant man (in his own apprehension) when hee was

O how many are there amongst us in <hi>Pauls</hi> first condition, <hi>alive without the Law:</hi> O how many destroy themselves with this, they think there is not a sin forbidden in all the Law of God but onely <hi>Ten,</hi> but alas, thou fool thou <hi>errest in this, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; should thou not judge thy self by that spiritual extent of the meaning of the Law, and that divine commentary which the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> hath set forth upon it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee sheweth thee, <hi>That if thou bee guilty of the breach of one point, thou art guilty of all</hi>; and by that infallible exposition which Christ himself the blessed Law giver hath set down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. whereby hee discovereth adultery in the heart and in the eye. O atheist, thou must take up the Ten Commands, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>guilty</hi> to them all: And let mee tell

you this, if yee will subscribe the Law to Christ, He will subscribe the Gospel to you; if thou wilt sincerely say, <hi>I am guilty,</hi> Hee will as sincerely say, I have pardoned; <hi>Son or daughter, be of good courage, thy sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some build their assurance upon the apprehension of their hatred of some particular sin, that albeit it was sometimes as their right hand, or their eye, yet now they can pluck it out, or cut it off: But O! will thou but consider, some sin may be made weak, and the soul (though not upon a right principle) brought to hate it, and to cry unto it, <hi>get you hence,</hi> and yet the interest of Satan may be strong in the heart.</p>
            <p>The fifth mistake is of many who judge themselves, because they go a greater length then the former, and are kept free from all grosse outbreaking sin; how many are there who go sleeping down to hell with this? I am no drunkard, no adulterer, no murderer, no thief nor whore; this long have I lived in the town, and they were never born that can say, I wronged them: and so they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their soul upon this, they never committed any grosse sin. But I beseech you bee not deceived, remember how that wretched man did speed, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>I am no extortioner, nor adulterer, nor even as this publican, &amp;c.</hi> poor creature that hee was, Christ giveth not a testimonial to every one who take it for themselves; and I must tell some of you, that there may bee desperate atheists without God, and without Christ in

the world, and yet be free of grosse outbreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins: I do not think, but many of these who crucified the Lord of Glory, were keeped from other grosse sins, What know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou O man that there is more favour shewed to thee, in that thou art keeped from some grosse sinnes, when yet thou hast a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked heart, then is shewed to the devil, when some links of his chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there may be a cord put upon thy jaws, when thou art far from having the power of conquering grace.

If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan would come but with a kindled match, there wanteth no more to set tongue and hands and all on fire of hell, O wretched soul, do but ask thy self how often thou hast tempted Satan, when he would not tempt

thee, and how often thou hast followed a tentation when it fled from thee; yea, when the Lord hath hedged up thy wayes that thou could not overtake thy lovers, how many a long look hast thou sent after them, and what lustings of thy spirit within; and do ye think that heart sins are nothing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou had no out-breakings what were the matter of that; if thou had not a tongue thou would break the third command, and <hi>curse God in thy heart,</hi> if thou had not an eye, thou could commit adultery <hi>in thy heart</hi>; if thou had not a hand, thou might commit murder <hi>in thy heart.</hi> O therefore build not thy assurance upon this, that thou hast made clean the outside of the platter, when yet all filthinesse it within.</p>
            <p>The sixth false foundation upon which I am sure too many build thir assurance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is their gifts and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, and especially upon these two, the gift of prayer, and the gift of knowledge; but believe it, it is not much to be a Christian in tongue, but it is much to be a Christian in heart; know ye not that this will cast out many, <hi>We have prophesied in thy Name, and in thy name cast out devils.</hi> No doubt, these had been excellent flourishers, and if the tongue would have done it, they had been highly advanced; but yet yee see these men meet with a <hi>depart from mee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

beseech you, when you cast up your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of assurance, consider how well yee have done, and not how well yee have spoken.</p>
            <p>The seventh false ground whereby many do misjudge themselves, is, their supposed peace of conscience: O saith one, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doth not charge mee with any thing, I thank God I have a quiet mind, and nothing trouble me; but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The eighth false ground, is, the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Christians, so that if they have the approbation of some such exercised Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or if they have the approbation of such a Minister, that is the way to silence all their disputings. O cursed bee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that putteth his trust in men who are liars; O man or woman, let me assure you this, if yee had a testimoniall to present to Christ, subscribed with all the hands of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian that ever yee we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107523:97"/>The ninth false ground, is, their diligent observing all the Ordinances, their going to Preachings, and their going to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>and running to and fro,</hi> pretending this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The tenth false foundation, which is the strong delusion of Atheists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which no doubt there are many here to day: is the building of their eternall happinesse upon this, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p n="2">2. Christians judge their estate by dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, they think every change of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, speaketh a change of estate, and if Christ do not smile alwayes, we know not what it is to keep up the faith of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and indeed this is a great fault among Christians, that when they cannot read love in the beautifull face of Christ, they think it is not in his heart. What though he change his dispensation, doth that speak forth a change of thy estate. Christ cannot change his voice to us, but we think he changeth his heart, Christ he cannot speak to us in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107523:98"/>
whirle-wind; but we cry out, Why art thou become unto me as an enemy? Oh, shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Christ be thus mistaken.</p>
            <p>The third ground of mistake about our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ, is, that we judge of our estate by what we are in our selves, and not by what wee are in Christ. When a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beginneth to judge and search himself, he can finde nothing in himself; but what is the matter of doubting, and therefore thinks it high presumption to think himself a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: But O fool, can thou not look to Christ, and cry out, though in my self I be nothing, yet in him I am all: O if Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans knew to judge of themselves be what they are in Christ, and not be what they are in themselves, that with one eye they might look to themselves, and cry out, <hi>I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> and with another look to Christ, and cry out, <hi>There is hope in Israel concerning me,</hi> that with one eye they might look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and <hi>blush,</hi> and with another eye they might look unto Christ, and <hi>hope,</hi> that with one eye they might look to themselves, and <hi>weep,</hi> and with another eye they might look to Christ and <hi>rejoyce.</hi> O Christian will thou judge alway of thy self, be what thou art in Christ, and not be what thou art in thy self; yea, I would say this to thee by the way, when thou mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est with tentations that put thee to dispute thy interest, do but send them to Christ to get an answer, and say, O precious Christ, answer this tentation, for this is Christs way with the soul, the Law
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107523:99"/>
must bring us back to Christ, and Christ must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us back to the Law, and deliver us over to it, not to the condemning power of it as before, but the directing and guiding power of it as a rule of holinesse; so that a Christians whole life must be a sweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant travelling between Christ and the Law: when thou hast broke the Law, flie unto Christ to take away thy guilt, and when thou hast closed with Christ, come running out again in his strength to perform the Law.</p>
            <p>The fourth mistake is, that Christians judge of their estate by the measure of their graces, more nor by the sincerity of them; some Christians, if they finde not love in such a degree, and if they finde not repentance in such a degree, immediately they begin and raze the foundations, and do call their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments delusions, and their faith presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their mortification hypocrisie; but I must say this to thee, we should not onely weigh our graces in the ballance, but try them also by the touch-stone, for the smallest piece of gold is gold, and the least degree of faith, <hi>is alike precious faith,</hi> with that the Apostles themselves had.</p>
            <p>The fifth ground of mistakes among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is this, That they compare themselves more unto the Saints, then they judge of themselves by the Word. O saith one, if I were like <hi>David,</hi> I would believe, but I am not like <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Iob,</hi> nor <hi>Hezekiah</hi>: and therefore there is none of the Saints to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107523:99"/>
which I should go, and if I should call, there is none to answer, and why then should I believe: I would onely say to thee whose objection that is, it is even <hi>Davids</hi> objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.5, 6. <hi>Our fathers trusted in thee</hi>; O they were excellent men; But what a man am I? A <hi>worme, and not a man,</hi> and yet, he was put from that objection: and I would say this, Are yee below him: In what? I hope yee are not below <hi>David</hi> in necessity: Now though ye be below him in grace, if ye be not below him in necessity, yee have so much the more right to believe; for as wee said before, necessity giveth you a right, and the more necessity, the greater right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>The sixth ground is, That Christians judge of their estate by Christs part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and not by their own, rather examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves by what Christ hath promised to do for them, then by what is left to them to do, which thing if it were headed, would put a close to many of our mistakes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings.</p>
            <p>Having now laid out some mistakes upon either hand, the next wee would do, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to propose some considerations to presse you to guard against these mistakes, especially the first.</p>
            <p>And the first consideration is, That mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes about one interest in Christ, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is a most universal and popular evil; it is not one of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hee saith, <hi>many in that day shall say unto mee, Lord, Lord, and have wee not prophesied, and yet hee shall say unto them, I know you not</hi>: Since it is so universal a mistake, I intreat you be much in the search of your selves, search your own selves: Certainly I think, if there were but within this Church one that were under this mistake, it should put us all to this, <hi>Master is it I, Master is it I</hi>; but how much mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> since there is a generation of mistakers, should it not be our exercise every day to cry out, is it I.</p>
            <p>The second consideration is, That as it is a most universal, so also it is a most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable mistake; if ye mistake about this your being in Christ, there is no making up of that mistake; if once yee passe the borders of Time with this lie in your right hand, I am in Christ, there is no hope of recovery, eternity will cut off accesse to make up that mistake: I intreat you go not down to your grave with this, I am in Christ, when yet Christ may say, I know you not: I believe it, if ye could have a testimonial subscribed by the hands of all the most eminent and tender Christians that ye have known, that yee are indeed a Saint, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d if all the Ministers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107523:100"/>
that ever you spoke to should praise you in the gate, and declare you to be a son and daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi>; yet when you shall bring up your testimoniall to Hevean, and the Father shall read it, and shall ask you where is my Sons Name, if that be not there, it will certainly be rejected, and cast over the bar.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a soul destroying delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, this mistake about ones interest in Christ, is the very ruine of their immortal soul, according to that word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>A deceived heart hath led them aside,</hi> and what is the fruits of it, <hi>so that he cannot deliver his soul,</hi> and by consequence it may be said, that they destroy their soul; I believe it, there are many that go to hell in a chariot of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion; we know some Christ guideth to Heaven by the gates of hell, and letteth them not see life till they be in sight of hell; but it is true also; there are others whom the devil guideth to hell, by the very borders of Heaven, he maketh them believe they are dwelling in the gate of Heaven all their dayes, and yet at last they are thrust down to these habitations that are prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If once a person be mistaken about their interest in Christ, they will have these three notable disadvantages attending upon them. 1. As long as he is under this mistake, he is without all reach of profiting by the Ordinances, for when he heareth preaching, he will apply promises, when he should apply threatnings, and upon the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107523:101"/>
other hand, apply threatnings when he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> should apply promises, and so that which should be his medicine, becometh poison to him. 2. As long as he is under this mistake, it maketh him that he cannot pity nor have compassion upon himself, that though he be the most suitable object of compassion, yet he knows not what it is to weep over his own ruine. 3. Readily all his graces are but delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, all his good motions are but flashes, and all his mortification counterfeit, and all his tendernesse is but the mother of stupidity, and therefore guard against mistakes about your interest in Christ I intreat you.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Consider, that mistakes about ones interest, is a most abiding and constant mistake, believe it, if once we mistake in this, it is one to a hundred if ever wee come right again: this is clear, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They hold fast deceit, they keep it with both their hands</hi>: And, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>Their is a lie in their right hand,</hi> that is, they hold the lie and they keep it with all their power; I say, if once one be mistaken concerning their interest in Christ, it is hard to put them from it, yea, delusion it is such an abiding thing, that we find Christ speaketh of it, as if it would wait upon one before the judgement seat of Christ, and as if some would never quite their hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, till Christ pronounce that word, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not,</hi> delusion may carry us over the borders of Time, and lead us in to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, There is much counterfeit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107523:101"/>
that is in those dayes, their is a painted faith, there is a painted love, there is a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mortification, and there is a painted ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse; some they love shaddows and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and yet they do not love the very shaddow of Christ, and are there not many who think they are imbracing Christ, and yet are imbracing a delusion and a fancy.</p>
            <p>That which thirdly wee would speak to from this poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is, to give you some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences by which yee may know if the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ye have of your being in Christ, be right or no: Believe it, there are many that draw that conclusion, <hi>I am in Christ,</hi> which the devil and their own deceitfull heart hath drawn, and Christ never gave consent to it: And I shall propose these seven or eighth evidences of real assurance, by which ye may discern.</p>
            <p>First, A real assurance is a purifying and sanctifying assurance: this is clear, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him,</hi> that is, perswaded of this that he shall come to heaven, <hi>He will purifie himself, as he is pure</hi>: And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of the flesh, and of the spirit.</hi> O! When a Christian getteth Christ in his arms, hee cannot but cry forth, <hi>What have I to do any more with idols</hi>: When he hath once gotten Christ in his arms, he will answer every tentation that he meeteth with this, <hi>I am not mine own, I am bought with a price,</hi> I cannot now dispose of my
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107523:102"/>
self: and if your assurance of going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be not a purifying assurance; be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, it is but the devils <hi>pillow sowed under your arm holes:</hi> is it possible a person can be assured of heaven, and not study holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, can such a delusion at this overtake you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A real assurance putteth the Christian to a pressing and earnest pursuit after communion and fellowship with God: is it possible for one to be assured, and not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e saying, <hi>he is sick of love</hi>: this is clear <hi>Song</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his</hi>; and immediately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> followeth, <hi>Turn thee, O my beloved, and be like a roe, or a young har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the mountains of Bether</hi>: And it is clear, <hi>Song</hi> 7.10, 11. <hi>I am my beloveds, and his desire is towards me</hi>: and what followeth upon that, <hi>She</hi> cometh and inviteth Christ, <hi>O come down with me to the fields, let us lodge in the villages.</hi> O when gave ye Christ such an invitation as this, O precious Christ, let us <hi>lodge in the villages, and go down to the secret places of the field:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>My God,</hi> there is his assurance; and immediately followeth upon that, <hi>Early will I seek thee, my soul thirsteth after thee as in a dry parched land where no water is.</hi> There is a pressing desire after communion. But I would ask you, Are there not many here who have the hope of heaven (to their apprehension) and yet the desire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ was never with them: I desire to say to thee, (be who thou will)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107523:102"/>
               <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, that which thou sowest, thou shall also reap.</hi> I think there are some of us, we would let Christ live in Heaven many dayes without giving him one visit, if He would let us alone: But O if we were within sight of our interest in Christ, how often would this be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint when he were absent, <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him</hi>; or my idol hath carried me away from Him, and I know not where to find Him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Assurance of our being in Christ, will put us to the exercise of praise; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I think this is one of the most search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences of assurance: There are some Christians they will be convinced for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the duty of prayer, but for the neglect of the duty of praise, they never have one conviction; and I tell you the reason of it, prayer is a selfish grace, (so to speak) but praise it is a denying grace, prayer seeketh, but praise giveth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>He is my God, I will prepare him an habitation, and he is my fathers God, I will exalt him,</hi> Psal. 118.28. <hi>He is my God, I will praise him, he is my God, I will exalt him</hi>: What needeth <hi>David</hi> these repetitions, might not one serve? No saith he, I would even spend my dayes in this, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> there is much of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that word, <hi>My God,</hi> and love commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many sweet <hi>batoligies</hi>: Now I say to thee, was thou ever put to the heart exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of praise, by this assurance that thou
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107523:103"/>
hast, this is an evidence indeed, but alas, many of us cannot say it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A person that liveth within sight of his interest, Christ is match<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esse unto him, as is clear, <hi>Song.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I sat down under his shaddow,</hi> there is faith and assurance of it, and what accompanieth that, <hi>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved among the sons</hi>: Christ hath not a match, saith the Spouse, in his sweetnesse, his power, his beauty; and his usefulnesse is above all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Real assurance is a humbling thing, the assurance of a Christian maketh him to sit low in the dust: Was not <hi>Iacob</hi> low in his own eyes, when he cryed out, <hi>I am lesse then the least of all thy mercies</hi>; What? was not <hi>David</hi> low in his own eyes, when he spake that word, <hi>What am I, and what is my fathers house, that thou hast brought me hitherto</hi>; and was not <hi>Paul</hi> a low man in his own eyes, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.8.16. <hi>I am lesse then the least of all thy Saints,</hi> and when he cryed out, <hi>I am the cheif of sinners</hi>: The assurance that is real, it will make a Christian to sit down in the dust, and cry out, <hi>Wo is me, I'am a man of polluted lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Real assurance will put him to take much pleasure and delight in the going about of duties: that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>My God,</hi> saith he, that is his assurance, and presently he subjoyneth, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O Lord,</hi> this he speaketh of himself, as himself, and likewise as a type of Christ,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107523:103"/>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.115. <hi>Depart from me evil doers, for I will keep the commandements of my God</hi>; I believe it, the love of Christ when it is much in exercise, it will constrain us to our duty: and therefore this proud transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assurance in these dayes, that setteth men above all duties and Ordinances, and maketh them count the Gospel as well as the Law, <hi>but beggerly rudiments</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cry out to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Stand aback, for I am holier then thou,</hi> must needs be a delusion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, There are these three properties of a real assurance, it is a begotten assurance, it is a living assurance, and it is a constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assurance. The first two properties of it are set down in that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>He hath begotten us to a lively hope</hi>; Who begat that assurance in thee? I suppose some have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and it was begotten without travel; but if Christ be not the father of thy assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it will evanish and passe away. And, secondly, it must be a living assurance, some hearts are dead as a stone, and yet they say they have the hope of heaven. And thirdly, it must be a constraining assurance, it will put the Christian to do what he commands, yea, if it were the most pleasant <hi>Isaac</hi> that we have, if he commandeth us to sacrifice it, we would put a knife to the throat of it, and be willing to offer it up.</p>
            <p>Now after all these evidences, <hi>I</hi> desire to have a report from you concerning your estate; What think ye of your selves, are ye in Christ, or no; I suppose, if Christ should
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107523:104"/>
come here to day, and put us all to the door but these that are in Christ, wee would have a thin assembly: I confesse, I wonder, that that word doth not make us to walk with sadnesse, <hi>Many are called, but few are chosen</hi>: Now I ask this question at you all, as in the sight of God, and as ye will one day answer unto him that will be your Judge; What think ye of your selves? Is there none here that can give a present positive answer to this, <hi>Are ye in Christ</hi>: I suppose this, if I were to go round them that are here, and ask, are ye in Christ, <hi>are ye,</hi> and <hi>ye in</hi> Christ, O! I doubt much if there should be many negative answers within the doors, we have so strong a faith some of us, that since we were born, we never doubted of it; But I think (without commending doubting) I may say, the faith that thou never doubted of, is too like a delusion, and the faith that thou never took pains to keep, and yet it keeped it self, that is too like a delusion, the faith that never knew what it was to put thee to real seeking of Christ, is too like a delusion. But let me close with this, be your estate what it will, search and come away; I think that is one of the most Gospel invitations that is in all the Scripture, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Let us search and try our wayes, and turn again unto the Lord</hi>: When thou hast searched, come away, for I tell thee this, there will be nothing that will commend thee to Christ so much as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and I hope there is none of you, but ye have enough of this, and know it, if ye will

            <p>I Think ere long, there are many that passeth under the notion of Professors, that the veriest atheist when he behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their walk, may cry out, <hi>Are thou also become like unto one of us</hi>: Are there not many here that are in a golden dream, and in a fools paradise, that <hi>dream they eat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, when they awake, they shall be hungry</hi>; therefore I think it is incumbent upon us, to search and examine our state, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; profanity hath slain its thousands, but delusion and presumption hath slain their ten thousands. It was an ancient complaint of Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.57. <hi>And why even of your selves judge ye not what is right</hi>; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of this, there are many decreets of peace past upon earth, that are never rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in heaven, there are many that cry out, <hi>The bitternesse of death is past,</hi> whom yet God by the sword of his Justicee, shall hew in pieces before our eyes. We told you at the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107523:105"/>
last occasion, that we spake upon these word; there were six things we intended to speak from them, of the first three we have spoken.</p>
            <p>That which we <hi>intended to speak to</hi> at this time, is, that there is much soul advantage and spiritual gain, that doth redound to the Christian, by the distinct perswasion of his interest in Christ; this we gathered from <hi>Paul's</hi> doubling the command of searching and trying themselves, as if he had said, it is a businesse that will be so much for your advantage, that it is incumbent for you to search and try diligently: And for further clearing of the point, I shall only give these three places, <hi>Rev</hi> 2.17. <hi>I will give unto them a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, that no man knoweth, but he that hath received it: By the new name,</hi> and <hi>the white stone,</hi> is <hi>understood</hi> assurance, and the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the soul: This indeed is such a mercy, that I defy any to make language of it, no man knoweth it, much lesse can he expresse it, but he that is the professor of it, and that place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.2, 3. <hi>I will give unto them a new name, which the mouth of the Lord will name</hi>: O what a name must that be which the mouth of the Lord will name: I think, what he giveth, must be one of the noblest names that ever was given, all the stiles and titles under heaven cannot equal it. And, thirdly, we see <hi>David</hi> in the 18. <hi>Psal.</hi> found much sweetnesse and advantage in this, when nine times he hath that word,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107523:106"/>
               <hi>my: My strength, my rock, my fortresse and my deliverer, my strength and my buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower,</hi> O <hi>David,</hi> what needeth all these <hi>Mys, David</hi> would answer us; O! he is so sweet in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but O! much sweeter to me, when I put to that possessive note, My.</p>
            <p>Now to speak more particularly to these advantages of assurance, The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st is, That a person that is assured of his interest in Christ, he is much in desiring communion with Christ: <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,</hi> (there is his assurance) <hi>where thou feedest, and where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon,</hi> there is desire of communion, and <hi>Song</hi> 7.10, 11. <hi>My beloved is mine, and his desire is towards me,</hi> there is her assurance, and immediately followeth, <hi>Come my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let us go forth into the fields, let us lodge in the villages,</hi> there her desire of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>Song</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> and what followeth upon that, <hi>He feedeth among the lillies, untill the day break, and the shadows flie away, Turn my beloved, and be as a roe, or a wilde hart upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Bether,</hi> that is in short, let me have sweet correspondency and fellowship with thee, till the day of Eternity shall come: I think the desires of an assured Christian, they are like the grave, the cry continually, <hi>Give, give,</hi> and they never say, <hi>it is enough:</hi> What is the reason, ye seek so little after fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ, it is even this, ye are not perswaded of your interest in him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107523:106"/>
it, if once ye had attained to this blest length, as to cry out, <hi>Christ is mine,</hi> it would be a hell upon earth for you to live at such a distance with him as ye do for the most part: O but assurance maketh absence from Christ an unsupportable burden, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God,</hi> there is assurance, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followeth his complaint, <hi>Why hidest thou thy self from me,</hi> Song 3.1, 2, 3. that word, <hi>Him whom my soul loveth,</hi> made her to weep so much under absence from Christ, and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.13. when the Angels ask the question at <hi>Mary, Women why weepest thou?</hi> I think she thought it a needlesse question, and she tells the cause of it, <hi>They have taken away my Lord</hi>: I think her heart was at her mouth when shee pronounced these two words, <hi>My Lord,</hi> she spake them with a great deal of emphasis and force, could ye resent absence with Christ so little, if ye were assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he were yours. I confesse, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when persons losse that which is not their own, that they weep not much for the losse of it; but O! to losse that which is our own, it maketh it a crosse and a burden to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It maketh the soul to have a high and matchless esteem of precious Christ, Song 5.10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand</hi>: O saith the Spouse, I never saw his like, and I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see his like again; there is much in that <hi>My</hi>; interest maketh her look upon Christ with another eye nor she would have done,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107523:107"/>
strangers look upon him but as a <hi>tree planted on the sand,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>To you that believe Christ is precious,</hi> not to every one: And <hi>Song</hi> 2.2. <hi>I sate down under his shaddow with great delight,</hi> the reason is, interest in the words going before, <hi>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons</hi>; yea, assurance will make every thing in Christ exceeding pleasant to the soul: as is clear, <hi>Song</hi> 5.16. <hi>My beloved is altogether lovely,</hi> or, <hi>hee is all desires.</hi> I tell you what assurance will do, it will make Christs person pleasant and precious to the soul, it will make Christs Natures pleasant to the soul, it will make Christs Offices plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the soul, it will make Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises pleasant to the soul, it will make Threatnings pleasant to the soul, it will make the smell of Christs Garments pleasant to the soul, and it will make the kisses of His Mouth pleasant to the soul: O saith the assured Christian, there is nothing of Christ but it is most pleasant, and is all desires; His Threatnings are pleasant, they are the wounds of a friend, and His kisses are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, they are better then wine, His Name it is pleasant, it is as precious ointment powred, forth, His smellings are most delightsome, <hi>whose countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars</hi>: O to imbrace a married Christ, how pleasant is it to the soul; What make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to have so low thoughts of Christ? even this, the want of assurance that Hee is your H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:107523:107"/>Thirdly, Assurance will make the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an patiently to submit to every crosse and sad dispensation he meeteth wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h: this is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They took with joy the spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their goods,</hi> and what made them do so, <hi>They hoped for a better inheritance, and a more induring substance</hi>: I tell you, assurance, it will answer all crosses with this, <hi>Christ is mine</hi>; when they are afflicted, assurance will lift up its face, and cry out, <hi>Christ is mine,</hi> and when they are reproached, they will comfort themselves with this, <hi>Christ is mine, I can put on the Lord Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Assurance will keep you from apostacy and defection from Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Make your calling and election sure, and if ye do this</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye shall never fall,</hi> Heb. 3.11.12. It is there set down as a fruit of the evil heart <hi>of misbelief,</hi> it maketh us <hi>depart from the living God,</hi> but on the contrary, assurance knitteth the soul to Christ by a threefold cord, which is not easily broken. Believe it, the assured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can cry out with much confidence of faith, <hi>My mountain standeth strong, I shall never be moved</hi>; the assured Christian can cry out with much chearfulnesse: <hi>In God will I praise his word, in God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid what flesh can do unto me</hi>; yea, he can sweetly sing in the very mouth of danger, <hi>The Lord is my light and my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid,</hi> Psal. 27.1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:107523:108"/>Fifthly, Assurance keepeth all the graces of the spirit green and flourishing, it is as a refreshing dew upon our branches, which maketh every grace sweetly to blossome in its season. 1. It stirreth up the exercise of love: O how vigorous are the actings of love, when a Christian can cry out, <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Song 1.13. <hi>My beloved,</hi> there is her assurance, <hi>He is a bundle of myrrhe, and shall lye all night between my breasts,</hi> that is, as long as time shall last, I shall never have Christ out of my my heart, there is love, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We loved him, because he loved us first</hi>; our hearts are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally cold, but love kindleth love, the sense of his love to us, putteth our hearts into a heavenly flame towards him again. 2. Assurance keepeth up the exercise of prayer, it is the assured Christian that can p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay best, and to best advantage, and in these three things especially, is prayer helped by assurance. First, It helpeth in the point of <hi>boldnesse:</hi> O but the assured Christian can go boldly to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Crying Abba father, and my Lord and my God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It helpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h our <hi>diligence</hi> in prayer, Psal. 63 1. O <hi>my God,</hi> there is assurance, <hi>early will I seek thee,</hi> there is his diligence as the fruit thereof. Thirdly, It helpeth the <hi>fervency</hi> of prayer, as in that same place, <hi>my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee,</hi> there is his fervency as another fruit of his assurance. 3. Assurance keeepeth in exercise and life, the grace of mortification:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107523:108"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is clear by comparing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. vers. last, with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We look not after the things that are seen:</hi> O <hi>Paul,</hi> what aileth you, may ye not take a look of the world, O saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and would ye know the ground of it, <hi>Wee know if this house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternally in the heavens</hi>: my house and my treasure is in heaven, I must have my heart there, and my eyes also: Would yee know what would stay your pursuit after the world, study to have the assurance of your interest in Christ continually with you. And 4. It keepeth in exercise the grace of humility; there is nothing will keep a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian so humble as assurance, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in mee, Eph.</hi> 3.8. there hee is all in <hi>exalting grace, and debasing himself</hi>: It is the misbeliever and discouraged person that dwelleth near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pride; Believe it, misbelief is big with childe of pride and apostacy, these are the two children which that fruitfull mother will bring forth. And, 5. It will help the grace of <hi>Repentance:</hi> Would yee know what would make the Christian to repent, it is even this, to take Christ in our arms and call him ours, Zech. 12.10. <hi>They shall look unto him,</hi> that is, their faith, and <hi>and they shall mourn as one mourneth for his only Son</hi>: I think it is known by experience, the soul never weeps more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly under the conviction of sin, then whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he hath Christ in his arms, and can see, <hi>Hee
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107523:109"/>
is mine</hi>: O how sweetly doth they then complain, there is not a sight of Christ as their own, when they have offended, but it breaketh all their heart in pieces, and it is as a sword piercing into the bones, when they cry out, O what a fool was I to offend such a precious One, in whom I had so much interest; Was it not sense of interest that made <hi>Mary</hi> wash the feet of Christ with her tears. Lastly, It will keep in exercise the grace of Joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. It is faith which maketh one to <hi>rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</hi> Would yee know why your graces are withered? would ye know why all the pleasant plants of God within your soul are decayed? It is this, ye live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sight of your interest in Christ, believe it, (if so I may speak) assurance will be a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to your graces every morning, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh them every hour, it being as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hannel through which divine influence is conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the increase of grace, and especially of joy.</p>
            <p>The sixth advantage that cometh in to the Christian by assurance of his interest in Christ, is, That it maketh death exceeding pleasant and comfortable to the soul; what maketh death <hi>the king of terrours,</hi> and what maketh it so unto us? Is it not this, wee go to heaven under a cloud: the assured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can take death in his arms, and cry out, welcome, <hi>O friend</hi>: the assured Christian, when he seeth the chariots his father sends for him, doth with old <hi>Iacob</hi> rejoyce, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107523:109"/>
               <hi>Psal</hi> 23. <hi>When I walk through the valley of the shaddow of death, I will fear no evil:</hi> What brought you that length, <hi>David?</hi> I tell you why, saith he, for <hi>God is with me,</hi> ver. 4. I think I need not feas any thing, when I have God in my company: It is the assured Christian that can cry out, <hi>Why should I fear death,</hi> should I not laugh at destruction: I think indeed, the assured Christian needeth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fear death, because death to him is the death of all his lusts, the funerall of all his sorrows: and is not the day of death his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation day, his marriage day, the day of his triumph, and of his entering into rest, and why then should he fear it.</p>
            <p>The seventh advantage is, That a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an being in the state of assurance, can put the highest account upon the smallest mercy that hee meets with from God: the assured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian looketh upon every mercy as a wonder; it is the assured Christian that cryeth out, <hi>I am lesse then the least of all thy mercies</hi>: there is not a mercy he meets with, were it but a drop of cold water, but if hee can read this on it, that it came from my Husband, and from my Father, it will be better to him then the sweetest wine.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Assurance doth exceedingly help us to chearfulnesse in obedience: O that is a remarkable connexion that <hi>Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.23. <hi>The Lord whose I am, and whom I serve</hi>: That passage also, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry observable, <hi>The love of Christ constrained us, &amp;c.</hi> Why art thou so painfull a Minister
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107523:110"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi>? Why? <hi>Knowest thou no man after the flesh,</hi> are not led by carnal interests, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, art so busie and diligent as all the world counteth thee mad? Why? (saith hee) love will not let me rest if I would be lazie or carnal, or fold my hands to sleep: the love of Christ doth alwayes sound that in my ears, that I was dead, and he hath died for me, that henceforth I should not live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my self, but to Him who died for me: Now <hi>to him who is the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive for evermore,</hi> Wee give praise.</p>
