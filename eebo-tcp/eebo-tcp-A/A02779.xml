            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not onely forraine hiſtories, both old and new, in all languages, as well learned, as vulgar: but alſo our owne Britiſh and Engliſh Chronicles (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip beſt remembreth;) beſide a number of other famous books, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old ſmokie paperbookes, are very copious, and ouer plentiful in affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding examples of this couenous, and impoſturall kinde.

But of all the reſidue, what comparable to the terrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended propheſie, euen now notoriouſly in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> concerning the imagined mightie, and woonderfull caſualties and hurliburlies of the preſent yeere 1588? In which reſpect of ſo vniuerſall fame, I was earneſtly mooued, and importuned by certaine worſhipfull Gentlemen, and diuers other my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends, to vndertake ſome little trauell in examining the naturall cauſes, and artificiall reaſons of the ſaid ſuppoſed propheſie, ſo far as any my reading, or vnderſtanding might extend, to furniſh any ſuch ſcholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſight, or inquitie thereinto. Whereupon at laſt I was rather ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, than perſuaded, to yeeld vnto that motion; partly acknowledging

mine owne inſufficiencie, partly conſidering, that I could not any way (to mine owne contentment) diſcuſſe that one particular, without ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conference of many other ſemblable particulars, and euen ſome generall Tract vpon the whole Argument of ſuch putatiue, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Propheſies.

Which albeit my ſelfe am not any way to acknowledge, otherwiſe than in affectionate deſire to worke what poſſible good I may, euen with the meaner and baſer ſort: yet in caſe your Right Honorable wiſedome ſhall likewiſe either in whole, or in part admit thereof: I am in all dutie and reuerence, humbly to ſubmit, and wholy to commit the ſame vnto your onely allowance, or diſallowance, to be either publiſhed, or ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at your Honorable pleaſure. A matter in it ſelfe nothing woorthie ſo noble, and graue conſideration: but as per accident it may happen to ſtay the wiſdoms of ſome buſie, and troubleſome perſons, not ſo well diſpoſed, or ſo diſcreetly aduiſed, as might in common reſpects be wiſhed.

May not the author commonly, and for the greater part be iuſtly regiſtred, and enrolled in the famous Epiſtles <hi>Obſcurorum virorum?</hi> I haue read many propheſies, and heard more, yet how few authors therof named? Scarcely thrée, of thréeſcore: and thoſe thrée ſcarcely to be recounted in the catalog, either of the learneder, or of the wiſer, or of the godlier ſort. Set downe their names, peruſe their writings, ſuruiew their doings, and examine their qualities; and what indifferent man will ſay, or can thinke otherwiſe than I haue ſaid?

Are they, or were they either good artiſts, or good philoſophers, or good aſtronomers, or good phyſitions, or good diuines, or good prophets, or any good thing elſe, vpon whom ſuch ſtuffe is fathered? Was it ordinarie learning, or extraordinarie inſpiration, whereby they attained their maruellous and terrible knowledge?

Did the holy Ghoſt deſcend miraculouſly vpon them in the likenes of fire, or other viſible ſhape? Is not the date of ſuch diuine myſteries, and heauenly miracles expired ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yéeres ago? Were extraordinarie, and irregular operations euer durable? Are we ſtill to make account of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, or ſeraphicall illuminations, and rauiſhments of ſpirit? Will either ſound <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> or diſcreete <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> beare any ſuch doctrine, either at theſe dates, or by the time of our anceſtors?

Are not the préeſts of <hi>Vrim</hi> long ago dead? Or were not the prophetical informations by the ſecrét and diuine vertues of the twelue pretious ſtones therein comprized, altogither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated, and extinct, at leaſt 200. yéeres before <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> as himſelfe auoweth in his <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Antiquities?

both phyſically, and otherwiſe. But peraduenture for art they might be incomparable: for what art? Sacred, or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: philoſophicall, mathematicall, or other: theoricall or practicall: lawfull or vnlawfull: white or blacke? There ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted many profeſſors, and vaunters of many arts; but how few perfect, or ſufficient artiſts, actually and infallibly approoued by their excellent artificiall works? And amongſt thoſe pettyprophets, what one in maner of any ſingular, or eſpeciall reckoning in any déepe and profound feate of art? The greater part, God knoweth, full ſilly and ſorrie artiſts in any kinde, eſpecially in the ſound <hi>Theorie,</hi> and effectuall practiſe of the woorthieſt, and nobleſt ſciences, mathematical, philoſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phicall, and other of like auailable effect. Lift vp your eies, and looke into the <hi>Diuinitie</hi> Schooles: were Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> or any notable Diuine, either ancient or moderne, coiners or foſterers of propheſies? Deſcend to the <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Schooles, heare you any ſuch matter from the mouthes of <hi>Ptolomie, Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, Rheniholdus, Iofrancus, Offuſius,</hi> or any ſingular Mathematician? Procéede to the <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> chaire: and will <hi>Ariſtotle, Plinie, Cardane, Scalliger, Ramus,</hi> or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent philoſopher, buſie your brains with any ſuch rauing, and ſenſeleſſe conceits? You may well paſſe by the <hi>Phyſique</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> lectures: where I warrant you is ſome thing elſe to do, than to miſpend their golden time, or waſte their vitall breath, about idle and vaine fantaſies, credulouſly termed propheſies. I could neuer yet learne that <hi>Galen,</hi> or <hi>Iuſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or any good <hi>Galeniſt,</hi> or <hi>Iuſtinianiſt</hi> did greatly lend his eare, or bend his mind vnto any ſuch trifles. And as for the famous profeſſors of other liberall ſciences and faculties, how far are they from muſing, or buzzing vpon thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie imaginations? Euen ſuch, as otherwiſe haue béen déeplieſt plunged, and almoſt drowned in the profoundeſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croamatiques,</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſiques,</hi> yea and <hi>Magiques,</hi> and <hi>Negromantiques</hi> to, yet haue little, or nothing regarded theſe phantaſtiques.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4086:8"/>
as otherwiſe by other credible writings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that few, or none of the learned were euer addicted to the maintaining, foſtering, or fauouring of any ſuch paultry; as matters commonly repugnant and oppoſite to all good learning, and to the very grounds of Arte? The ſmaller ſkil, the greater credulitie: the leſſer knowledge, the more paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Ignorance in many caſes the moother of Deuction: Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie is ſoone perſwaded, and beguiled: nothing more eaſie, than to blind the rude multitude: moſt coſenage, where leaſt ſuſpition: light men, light of beléefe: want of vnderſtanding, cauſeth want of iudgement: alas, blinde men are faine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to ſwallow downe flies; and poore ſoules make as much of homely porrage, as other do of finer, and daintier fare.

that ment ſtill, and ſtill to play their furious parts on the ſtage, and like <hi>Demiapolloes,</hi> or rather like <hi>Elphes</hi> and <hi>Goblins</hi> to affright, and diſtraught ſimple creatures. Do I miſtake the matter or maner of their procéedings? I ſpeake but vnder correction of my betters, and am content to ſubmit my ſlender opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery ſounder iudgement: neither dare I peremptorily, or affirmatiuely auow euery part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, but onely aſſay <hi>problematically,</hi> and as our ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tearme it, <hi>diſputatiuely,</hi> what may therin appéere moſt probable. My intention is not to teach, but to learne: neither do I affect the credite of a déepe Artiſt, but am content to be reputed a reaſonable Queſtioniſt. I would be loath to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe any perſon, or diſguiſe any matter in tearmes: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not preſume any farther, but to put the caſe, and like a tractable <hi>Peripatecian,</hi> or rather <hi>Academique,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, and arguing, to procéede tentatiuely, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely, as the foreſaid ſchoolemen vſe to call it. If percaſe your <hi>Pro</hi> weigh downe my <hi>Contra,</hi> I am ſoone anſwered; and will not greatly trauell to trouble, or entangle you with intricate replies, or reioinders: but am ready ynough to yéeld without the leaſt obſtinacie, and to confeſſe in all philoſophical, &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian humilitie, <hi>Errare poſſum, haereticus eſſe nolo.</hi> In the meane time, giue me leaue to doubt of the ſkilfull vnderſtanding, and ſincere dealing of ſuch authors, and fautors, as haue vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from time to time ſcattered abroade ſuch idle, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet wares: which neuertheles I am not to account either idle, or counterfet, in caſe they euer happen to be prooued otherwiſe. Untill which time, may I not alſo partly gather the authority by the author, the teſtimony by the witnes, the propheſie by the prophet? Are the beſt of them aboue excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either for perfect ſcience, or for vpright conſcience? alas, what are the woorſt? Meaſure, and eſtéeme them, on gods name, according to the rate and proportion of their woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gifts: do them iuſtice, but do vs no iniury: regarde them according to their beſt deſerts, and demerits; but make not too childiſhly much of their painted ſheathes. I cannot nowe ſtande vpon diſcuſſing euery particular, or in ſifting euerie circumſtance: and I was long ſithence taught by <hi>Rodulph
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4086:9"/>
Agricola</hi> in his notable bookes, <hi>de Inuentione Dialecticae,</hi> to diſpute rather <hi>ad Rem,</hi> than <hi>ad Hominem:</hi> howſoeuer <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in his <hi>Topiques</hi> hath trained Sophiſters to ſuch <hi>Cryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> ſhifts, and ſleights other whiles.

I take it néedles, and booteles to make ouer déepe, or ſcrupulous enquiry into euery moſt auncient, and obſolete antiquitie: I preſuppoſe it ſufficient to peruſe, and examine the moſt famous, and moſt autentique ſuppoſed propheſies, that haue curranteſt paſſage, and repaſſage in moſt mouthes, and bookes: conſidering how eaſily euerie indifferent man may proportionably make eſtimation of the woorſe, by the better, and ratably value the one by the other.</p>
               <p>Is therefore any more renowned, or more credible than that great famous propheſie touching the <hi>Tripartite</hi> diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ages, a whole continuance, or endurance of the world, Cabaliſtically giuen out by tradition, from one <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Elias,</hi> an odde obſcure Iew in compariſon, howbeit lately coequalled in a maner with the very prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> himſelfe? yet how renowned, or wherefore credible? was that, or the like euer enrolled in holie Byble, or otherwiſe Canonically recorded? Is it conſonant to any ſound text in diuinitie? or warrantable by any cléere allegation, or profounde collection either out of the old, or new Teſtament? Nay is it not rather flatly repugnant, and cleane contradictory therunto, whileſt ouer ſcrupulouſly, and preſumptuouſly it inquireth into the déepeſt ſecretes of the diuine prouidence, and ſtriueth to reueale the higheſt and moſt inſcrutable myſteries of God himſelfe, the onely wiſe, and incomprehenſible Iehouah?

               <p>Which being plainly tranſlated into latin, importeth thus much in effect: <hi>Dixerunt ſilij ſeu diſcipuli Heliae: 6000. Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mundus: 2000. Annis inane: 2000. Lex: 2000. dies Meſſiae: &amp; propter peccata nostra quae multa ſunt, praeterierunt de eis quae praeterierunt.</hi> It may ſimply be engliſhed after this maner: <hi>Thus ſaide the ſonnes, or diſciples of Elias, The world conſiſteth of 6000. yeeres: 2000. yeeres voide: 2000. the lawe: 2000. the Meſſias, or Chriſt: but for our ſinnes which are many, thoſe yeeres of that number are ouerpaſſed, which are ouerpaſſed.</hi> Thus much the Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſtes themſelues: neither haue we to this day any more autenticall proofe, or certaine aſſurance of any other former forme or tenor of that propheſie, than theſe <hi>Rabynes</hi> affoord vs: from whom onely, and not otherwiſe (that euer I coulde hitherto vnderſtande) we haue receiued the whole miſterie, and knowledge thereof. Which in truth mooued me at firſt to miſdoubt, and ſtill perſwadeth me to ſuſpect, or rather to beléeue, that the true <hi>Canonicall Eliah</hi> is but the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or ſuborned, or pretended author of the premiſſes: and conſequently that there is no ſuch aſſured credence, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to be neceſſarily, or probably aſſigned therunto, as ſome (for the names ſake onely as ſhould appéere) haue ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and vainely ſurmiſed. Beſides, the very letter of the text it ſelfe expreſly declareth, that euen the <hi>Rabynes</hi> and <hi>Thalmudiſtes</hi> themſelues deriued the matter, or ſubiect of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4086:10"/>
this prediction, rather from the tradition of the famuliſtes, or domeſticall ſchollers of that <hi>Elias,</hi> whatſoeuer he was; than from any other autentique, or ancient monument of proofe, or from the very preſcript worde of any ſuch prophet. But leauing this a while, let vs reaſonably, and hiſtorically exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſeuerall, and particular branches of the prediction it ſelfe, and with equall indifferency conſider, whither other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of it ſelfe it deſerueth any ſuch credence, or admiration, as is yéelded thereunto by ſundrie fauourers thereof: for what ſkilleth it to purpoſe, who made the medicine, ſo the receit be actually good, and the patient effectually recured thereby: or what matter who were the deuiſer, ſo the worke be aduiſed. If the finall euent fall out correſpondent to the ſenſe of the prediction, ſhall a reall truth be deſpiſed, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the authors, or fautors ſake? Doth not knowledge and <hi>Prudence</hi> hirſelfe eftſoones lurke vnder a threadbare coate, or ſordid cloke? May not we happily, as <hi>Virgil</hi> did out of old <hi>Ennius, Colligere aurum ex ſtercore Thalmudistarum?</hi> Or may not <hi>Olitor loqui opportuna,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> writeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not ordinarily or vſually, yet incidently, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times? Wherefore it remaineth that we in ſort releaſe the <hi>efficient,</hi> &amp; conuent the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> or the <hi>effect</hi> it ſelf thereof conſiſting, before the iudiciall ſeate, or tribunall of reaſon and truth: and ſo procéeding <hi>ab efficiente ad effectum,</hi> or <hi>ab artifice adopus ipſum,</hi> meaſure the name, and value of the author or agent, by the woorthines and aſſurance of his ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engs, or actions. Is therefore the very chronology, or compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this propheſie vndoubtedly true in euery part, and conſequently in the whole? Was the world iuſt 2000. yéeres voide, or vaine, or in the firſt infancie, and primitiue ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, or vacuitie, or without law giuen from God to man, as the Hebrue interpreters, and Chaldée paraphraſtes expound it? Is the matter touched euen to the quicke? Or is all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addition or ſubſtraction vtterly néedleſſe touching this point? May we builde vpon it, as vpon a moſt infallible theoreme, or neceſſary axiome? Haue not the great <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſtes,</hi> or <hi>Cabaliſtes,</hi> or both deceiued vs, and themſelues, with a flieng tale of their owne ſurmounting and ouerrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

conceite? Is there no fallence of any artificiall, or inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall argument, no ſophiſtication of time, or <hi>Elenchus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncti,</hi> no dregs of error, no reliques of ſuperſtition, no ſpice of vanity, no froth of forgery, or ſent of guile in their mouths or pens?</p>
               <p>The beginning of the law muſt neceſſarily be deriued ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of <hi>Moyſes;</hi> ſuppoſe it were from <hi>Abraham</hi> (which ſome holde to be the trner doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, conſidering that the conenant of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the very roote and ground-worke of the old law, was made ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally vnto him:) are they not then ſufficiently confuted by their owne beſt approoued chronologies, which from <hi>Adam</hi> to the <hi>Deluge,</hi> reckon but 1556. yéeres, and from the ſlud to <hi>Abraham</hi> 292. yéeres: by which account there are 152. yéeres deficient of their 2000. <hi>Tohu,</hi> or <hi>Vacuum?</hi> Or if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe we draw the beginning of the law from <hi>Moyſes,</hi> as in truth we ought according to the more iuſtifiable opinion, doth not then the infallible proofe of ſoundeſt computation, beſides their owne accounts, condemne them on the other ſide, which from the creation of the worlde to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or promulgation of the law by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> truely ſummeth or recounteth 2453. yéeres, that is, 453. yéeres more than their 2000. <hi>Tohu</hi> can amount vnto? So that whether they reckon the primitiue age of the law from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or from <hi>Moyſes,</hi> their reckoning prooueth but a miſreckoning in the ſum: and their <hi>Chronicall arithmetique</hi> groſſely faileth them. Well then, is not there likewiſe almoſt 500. yéeres difference betwéene 2000. yéeres, and the ſpace of time from the enacting, or promulgation of the <hi>Moſaycall</hi> law vnto the natiuitie of Chriſt? Or doth the time of the vocation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> vntill the time of the incarnation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> iumpe with the terme of their 2000. <hi>Lex?</hi> But neither ſhall we here alſo néede to vrge any other <hi>Chronologicall compute</hi> againſt them than their owne; for in ſearching their chronicles, and ranſacking their antiquities, we ſhall finde that themſelues reckon but 3508. yéers from <hi>Adam</hi> vnto <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and are not then their 2000. <hi>Anni Tohu,</hi> &amp; 2000. <hi>Lex</hi> ſodainly abridged &amp; curtailed of 492. yéeres? Now as for their laſt 2000. yéeres

                  <hi>(vz.</hi> the diſtance of time from Chriſts firſt comming in the fleſh, or in the humilitie of his humanitie; vnto his ſeconde comming in fire, or in the maieſtie of his diuinitie:) which they in their Hebrew phraſe terme <hi>Dies Meſſiae,</hi> how can we problably ſurmiſe that they ſhoulde ſo ſkilfully foreknow the one, which ſo wilfully refuſed to acknowledge the other? Is it likely, that the Lord of the vineyard will ſo fauourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine thoſe wicked huſbandmen of his priuieſt counſell, which ſo cruelly killed his owne déere ſon, and onely heire? Or is it credible that God the ſonne will ſo manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale that vnto his perſecutors, which he ſo couertly concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his elect? Nay is it not moſt incredible, that the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> peruerſe crew, which is leſt of all nations in Gods fauor, by deſert; ſhould be made acquainted with that ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable myſterie, by I knowe not what inſtinct, which is hidden &amp; locked vp euen from his néereſt miniſters, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſpirits, the bleſſed Angels, and Archangels of heauen?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that as well that foreſaid <hi>Iewiſh</hi> reckoning of 3508. yéeres, as likewiſe that part of <hi>Elias</hi> oracle 2000. <hi>Annis dies Meſſiae</hi> were ſound and autenticall: ſhould not then alſo the world haue béen at an end aboue 80. yéeres ago, when the whole number of 2000. yéeres was fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed from the ſaid 3508. which yéere <hi>ab orbe condito</hi> our Sauiour was borne according to the chronologies of the Iewes?</p>
               <p>Wherfore I conceiue ſmal ſenſe or reaſon, why we ſhould attribute, or aſſigne any greater credit vnto this glozing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, than vnto any other portion of their <hi>Thalmudical,</hi> or <hi>Cabaliſticall</hi> doctrine being primarily, &amp; principally groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (ſo far as I could euer gather by reading) vpon that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent dogmaticall decrée, and reſolute ſuppoſition of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braicall</hi> diſcipline, which affirmed that by the ſixe daies of <hi>Creation,</hi> mentioned in the firſt chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 6000. yéeres of the world were myſtically, and allegorically ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, to be interpreted, or deciphered in ſuch ſort, that the firſt daies worke ſhould import, or prefigure a certaine reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or aſſured type of ſuch future matters, and euents, as were performed in the firſt thouſand yéeres of the world; the

ſecond daies worke, of ſuch as ſhould conſequently happen in the ſecond thouſand yéeres; and ſo foorth of the reſidue, euen to the accompliſhment of 6000. yéeres, at which period the eternall <hi>Requies,</hi> or <hi>Sabaoth</hi> of the Lord ſhould finally enſue, and gloriouſly appeere; euen as after ſixe daies worke he ſtaied, or reſted at the firſt, and as ſithence our <hi>Sabaoth</hi> (which is a reuerend figure of that great euerlaſting <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth)</hi> after euery ſixe daies, ſucceſſiuely approcheth.

If they eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it but as a probable collection, I would peraduenture not greatly reſiſt; or if they regarded it onely as a ſenſible, or reaſonable likelihood, I could haply in ſort yéeld vnto them: but whiles they recount it aboue exception, and value it as moſt precious and infallible, where is their <hi>Canonical</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantize, or inuincible <hi>Demonſtration?</hi> This me ſéemeth I may auerre, that the final concordance, harmonie, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſent, which ſome will néedes inforce betwéene it and holy writ (as if for ſooth it were firſt gleaned out of that ſacred field, or deriued from that pure fountaine, or at leaſt iuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by that ſure warrant) is not onely not equall and ſound, but erronious, and ſomwhat too ſuperſtitious: for touching the laſt part, or clauſe of this propheſie, which ſome haue thus engliſhed, <hi>But for our ſinnes which are many, and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſome yeeres which are wanting ſhall not be expired:</hi> and ſo comparatiuely alluded vnto thoſe words of Chriſt in the 24. <hi>chapt.</hi> of <hi>Mathew, And except thoſe daies were ſhortened all fleſh ſhould periſh, but for the Elects ſake they ſhall be cut off:</hi> (which words in their opinion is a ſufficient eſtabliſhment of that doctrine, as in maner it were if the preſumed tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Lo then the authoritie and credit as well of the thing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as of the publiſhers, or rather Publicans themſelues.

Howbeit in truth we cannot accuſe their Doctors of méere falſhood, whileſt they alledge for their reaſon and excuſe, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> came not bicauſe of their manifold offences and ſinnes, for neither came he indéed vnto them which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him not, neither ſhall he be a profeſſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or Sauiour vnto thoſe, which confeſſed him not.

Indéed it were a ſufficient argument of diuine authoritie, if they could ſubſtantially prooue that the very <hi>Canonicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> had ſpoken or written it: but in the meane while peruſe ſome of their owne writings, reſearch their antiquities, compare their chronologies, examine their records and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: and ſhall you not find according to the hiſtorical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4086:14"/>
euen of ſundry theſe fauorites, that there are alreadie paſſed aboue 6000. yéeres, yea and according to other ſome of their adherents, aboue 7000. yéeres, ſithence the worlds creation to theſe daies wherein we liue? How ſuch recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſummings hang togither, let them conſider which aſcribe ſo much vnto antique names, and make ſo high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the outward ſuperficiall barke of forged words; but what néedeth any further inuectiue, or refutation? Is not the ſentence of their owne mouth a ſufficient proofe againſt them? If the propheſie of <hi>Elias</hi> be vndoubtedly true, theſe reckonings muſt doubtleſſe be falſe: but if theſe reckonings be certainly falſe, ſhall therefore the propheſie of <hi>Elias</hi> be certainly true? That followeth not by any diuine, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane rule of reaſonable conſequence: but therefore they are both falſe, bicauſe they as well ſwarue from the right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of approoued allowance in humanitie: as alſo bicauſe they cannot indure the infallible touch ſtone of diuinitie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely phantaſtically builded vpon the ſandy foundation of mans conceite, whoſe eſſential ſubſtance is ignorance, and whoſe inſeparable accident is error: <hi>Quis enim non fallitur?</hi> For who is not miſaduiſed, or deceiued otherwhiles? Or who aſſuredly knoweth what ſhall befall him vnder the Sunne?</p>
               <p>Then as concerning the anſwere of the angell <hi>Vriell</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that profound queſtion, and myſtical <hi>Probleme</hi> of <hi>Eſdras; Whether there were more quantitie of time to come than was past, or more quantitie of time past than was to come,</hi> (which text is imagined to be a perfect proofe, and inuincible confirmation of the aſſertion, or poſition of <hi>Eliah)</hi> whereby ſhuld appéer that the time future after <hi>Eſdras,</hi> was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be comparable vnto that which had paſſed before him. As I may probably, and lawfully doubt with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> &amp; other notable diuines, whether the doctrine it ſelfe be <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,</hi> and aboue all exception wholy irreprehenſible: ſo I no leſſe reaſonably perſwade my ſelfe that it cannot be ſo warrantably alleadged in maintenance of <hi>Elias</hi> tradition, as ſome to that purpoſe haue quoted it: for although it may likewiſe appéere thereby that the world is now in the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4086:14"/>
or decrepit yéeres, and euen almoſt at the laſt caſt (as they ſay) (which by the founder doctrine of the <hi>Euangeliſtes,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelues is alſo ratified:) yet forſomuch as there is here a generall verdict giuen out, and that onely by way of queſtion, and indefinite compariſon; not any farther ſpeciall ſentence pronounced by way of deciſion, or definitiue iudgement; how ſhall this interrogatiue affirmation, and irreſolute reſolution be auerred to confirme, or determine that certaine number, and expreſſe continuance of 6000. yéeres? Nay if we preciſely reſpect the iuſt degrée of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and right proportion of the <hi>Analogy,</hi> which argueth as much difference, or diſtance betwéene the time paſt, and the time to come, as is betwéene a great water, and a little; or betwéene a great fire, and a little; ſhall we not by chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall ſubduction infer a farre more diſcrepant concluſion, and in truth a farre greater confuſion, than is yet menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned?</p>
               <p>But there is alſo another <hi>Apocriphal reuelation</hi> touching the worlds durabilitie, which God himſelfe is reported to haue declared and intimated vnto the ſaide <hi>Eſdras</hi> out of a buſh in this form, or tenor of words: <hi>The world hath loſt his youth: and the times, or ages are waxen old: for the world is diuided into twelue parts, and ten parts are gone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of already, and halfe of the tenth part alſo: and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth onely that which is after the halfe of the tenth part; therefore ſet thy houſe in order,</hi> and ſo foorth. Go to now: is there any greater concordance, or <hi>Synchroniſme,</hi> betwéene the propheſie of <hi>Elias</hi> and this text, than is argued betwéene the ſame, and the former? Or rather ſhall we not finde a greater diſcrepance, &amp; incongruence, if we ſearch the matter to the quicke? Let the diuiſion of thoſe twelue partes be made according to the number of the yéeres of <hi>Elias,</hi> (as it néeds muſt, in caſe that be the certaine number of the worlds age) and ſhall not euery part containe iuſt 500. yeeres? Of which if we take away ten parts, that is ten times 500. and halfe the tenth part, that is halfe 500. which is 200. &amp; 50 ſhuld there not remaine from the time of that reuelation to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> vnto the perfect conſummation of this world, aboue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4086:15"/>
700. and 50. yéeres? Which being added to 3500. yéers, about which time <hi>Ab orbe condito,</hi> Eſdras floriſhed, do they produce any more in the totall ſum than 4250. yéeres? At which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riode, the extréeme and final conflagration ſhould haue kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had this propheſie of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and that of <hi>Elias</hi> béene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeably conſonant, and vniforme? Wherefore the groſſe, and notorious difference of 1030. yéeres, which is alreadie paſſed betwéene them, muſt of neceſſitie condemne the one, but vnto which the more credite is to be yéelded, let other iudge: one of the two muſt néedeſly be granted, either that the <hi>Iewiſh Elias</hi> was no true prophet; or that he, who inſtructed <hi>Eſdras</hi> was no true God. The reſolution I leaue as well to the priuate conſideration of euery chriſtian conceite, as to the publike determination of the church.</p>
               <p>Other circumſtances, and appendences might be probably interlaced touching this pretended oracle: in effect nothing differing from the like imagination of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Plato,</hi> and why not to be valued, as that heathen <hi>Poeticall Sonet?</hi> But ynough in reaſon, may ſéeme ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in proofe; and in dutifull modeſtie, I am to preſume the leſſe, bicauſe it is a point which hath not béene hitherto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly confuted, or ſpecially diſcuſſed by the pen of any man, that euer yet came to my view: albeit otherwiſe it hath a long time paſſed, and repaſſed in the world, as being either generally liked of all, and plauſibly imbraced of the moſt, for a certaine truth; or at leaſt ſuſpected of few, and reiected of none, as an vncertaine counterfet. In which conſideration, notwithſtanding all the premiſſes, with other incident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, I am reſpectiuely to conclude with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that if any man of the learneder ſort, can alleadge more ſufficient reaſons, and more forcible arguments in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſame, than I haue addreſſed in confutation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: I will willingly giue ouer my former poſition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue wholy on their later information, as grounded on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſurer iudgement.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we now conceiue, or eſtéeme of other ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble predictions? Do they, or any of them inforce any greater credence or aſſurance? Or is there any ſpeciall inſtigation

of reaſon to mooue, or excite vs to intertaine any thoſe other imaginations, and forlorne conceites, touching the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and finall deſtinies of the world? Is not the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and phantaſticall tradition of <hi>Leo Haebreus</hi> like vnto the former? Or rather more vnlike the ſacred truth? He iumpeth in ſort with <hi>Rabbi Elias</hi> in the foreſaide number of 6000. yéeres, but otherwiſe what is his ſingular opinion? Forſooth, that in the circuite of euery ſuch ſeueral period <hi>(vz.</hi> 6000. yéeres) there ſhould onely happen a viciſſitudinall conuerſion, or temporall tranſformation of the <hi>elementarie</hi> or terreſtriall globe of this world: but not any finall diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole frame, and maſſe thereof: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there ſhould euery 7000. yéere, inſue a certaine ſubalternall time of peaceable calmenes, and tranſitory reſt, onely after a temporanie faſhion, or intercourſe, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, vntill the whole ſum of 49000. yéeres fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after this maner, the 50000. yéere of the worlde, bring on the fatall ouerthrow, and vtter ſubuerſion as well of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall orbs, as terreſtriall bodies, and ſo finally accompliſh the great and mightie <hi>Iubilee</hi> of eternall reſt.

(Howſoeuer we now run altogither vpon 8. and 8. and what but 88?) The 7. day God reſted, and hallowed the ſame: alſo the 7. moneth he ordeined the celebration, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenmization of thrée principall feaſts, <hi>vz.</hi> the feaſt of <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> the feaſt of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> and the feaſt of <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> Alſo euery 7. yéere he inioined the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to obſerue as a <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> or yéere of repoſe, or reſt, in the lande allotted vnto them: <hi>Noah</hi> was commanded to take into the Arke of euery cleane beaſt, by ſeauens: ſo <hi>Eliſha</hi> willed <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to waſh himſelfe 7. times in the riuer <hi>Iordaine,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he was cured of his leproſie: &amp; the apoſtles appointed the office of <hi>Deaconſhip</hi> vnto 7. choſen men of ſpeciall méet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for that function. Item the 7. golden candleſtickes; the 7. ſpirits which are before the throne: the 7. ſeales of the booke: the 7. hornes and the 7. eies of the lambe: the 7. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with their 7. trumpets: the 7. thunders, with their 7. voices: the 7. angels hauing the 7. laſt plagues: the 7. gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vyals full of the wrath of God, with other like notable ſeauens, do they not ſéeme to imply ſome extraordinary, or appropriate qualitie of that number? And what incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible myſteries appéered vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> when the ſaid 7. ſeale was opened? When the ſeuenth angell blew his trumpet? when the ſeuenth angell powred out the ſeuenth viall into the aire? And ſo foorth. Which texts, with ſundry like verſes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4086:16"/>
of holy ſcripture namely expreſſing that number, do they not figuratiuely containe great miracles, and déepe myſteries? But of what nature or propertie, or how they are preciſely to be interpreted without further ſcruple, as I may modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt, whether it reſteth in the certaine intelligence, or definite ſkill of man to determine; ſo it euidently appéereth, that the aboueſaid famous authors haue rather mentioned that number, with plauſible terms of admiration; than mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it with any ſenſible or intelligible rule of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Wherfore to returne againe vnto the great <hi>Iubileal</hi> yéere 50000. (wherein the foreſaid <hi>Leo Haebreus</hi> includeth the fatall deſtinie of the world) may it not be déemed, that euen himſelfe neuer plunged into the depth of his owne conceit, or otherwiſe, that he was a falſe heretique, or <hi>Apoſtata?</hi> For if his prediction be fundamentally drawen from the recited myſterie of the number 7. and withall that poſition be preſuppoſed true, that euery 7000. yéere ſhould bring foorth a temporall <hi>Requiem,</hi> vntill 6. times 6000. yéeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerpaſſed, the finall 7000. ſhould bring out the eternall <hi>Requiem:</hi> then muſt the 49000. yéere it ſelfe (which is alſo the great <hi>Climactericall, Hebdomaticall, Scalary, Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriall</hi> yéere) conſiſting of 7. times 7. and amounting of the od 1000. to ſuccéed euery 6000. yéers, be eſtéemed the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty graund <hi>Iubileall</hi> yéere, and not the 50000. yéere, which indéede remaineth in account the firſt 1000. of a new rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, or other 6000. yéeres. But be it granted that in the ſaid number of 50000. yéeres he had relation vnto the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quagenarie,</hi> or 50. yéere, which with the ceremonies and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities thereof is deſcribed, <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 25. and termed the yéere of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> which in the Hebrew letter ſignifieth as much as <hi>Buccina</hi> in Latin, <hi>quod ſz. ille Annus buccina ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candus erat, at que gloriosè celebrandus,</hi> (the firſt yéere of which compute was the yéere of <hi>Ingreſſion</hi> into the land of <hi>Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the 5. yéere of <hi>Ioſue,</hi> and the 2493. yéere of the world:) doth not as well the firſt voice of the crier in the wildernes, as the later preachings of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> yea doth not the whole <hi>Euangelicall</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> doctrine confute, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4086:17"/>
confound them both, to wit; as well the 49000. as 50000. yéeres? Is any thing more aſſuredly certaine in the whole ſacred volume of the Bible, than that Chriſt was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the fleſh not in the firſt, or middle ages, but in the laſt times of the world? That his kingdome was at hand euen in thoſe daies, or that it, cannot now be deferred, or prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any great ſpace, although no man exactly, or preciſely knoweth the very certaine period? But how may it be ſaid, either that he came in the latter age of the world, or that his kingdome draweth nigh (according to all true <hi>Canonicall</hi> Texts, and <hi>Orthodoxall</hi> Conſtructions) if the ſame world ſhould hold out more than 10. times ſo long after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as it did before? So that we are finally to eſtéeme the 49000. or rather the 50000. yéers of <hi>Leo Hebreus,</hi> no truer in concluſion than the imaginarie conceit of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his <hi>Alcaron,</hi> who there circumſcribeth the extream period of the latter day or great day of iudgement within the compaſſe, or Terminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame ſpace, <hi>vz.</hi> the ſpace of 50000. yéeres.</p>
               <p>Therefore may we not iuſtly affirme, that vaine, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous, and erronious, and wicked, and in effect damnable, and diueliſh are the figments and comments of mortal wits, and rauing ſpirits, touching this high and incomprehenſible myſterie of the worlds durabilitie?

Or what ſuch diſguiſed prophets do we heare to haue imbraced the zealous, and diſcréete diſpoſition of any ſuch godly paſtors? Compare their doings, and ſaiengs togither; oppoſe them after any reaſonable maner of probation: and ſhall you not finde them far remooued from any vnderſtanding in right diuinitie, farder from true propheſie, and fardeſt from that vpright conſcience, which procéedeth both from the one, and the other diuine ſcience. The cauſes, effects, ſignes, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whereof, are vniuerſally, and catholiquely approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: vniforme, coherent, and well according togither: recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and celebrated in the whole congregation, with one frée conſent, and ſtable perſeuerance; ratified with myracles, and woonders: confirmed with all kinde of godly deuotion, ſinceritie of doctrine, and diſcipline, holines of conuerſation, contempt of the worlde, chriſtian magnanimitie, neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting life, nor dreading death, martyrdome, and all true vertues: finally inſealed, and iuſtified with the moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and inuincible teſtimony of the moſt precious, and ineſtimable déere blood moſt graciouſly, and compaſſionately ſhed for vs. Now alas, where is any ſuch fruit, or apparance of any chriſtian inclination, agréement, vniformitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, or any other vertuous qualitie, in the runnagate baſe rablemont of theſe coſening, and ſhifting teltales; or foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of fortunes, and future contingentes: Which preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and at all auentures breath out ſuch vnlikely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauorie,

and vaine phantaſies, as are not onely repugnant vnto the former or later predictions of ſome other impudent practiſers in like ſort, but alſo diſagréeable amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and in themſelues, and oftentimes as contradictorie ech one, to ech other, as is poſſible? Which the excellent gréeke writer, and wiſe hiſtorian <hi>Thucydides</hi> very notably obſerued in the ſuppoſed prophets, and oraclers of his time, perceiuing euery one of that marke, to vtter, or blow abroad ſuch blaſtes onely at auenture, as the preſent quality of the humor abounding, or ſodaine affection of the rauing paſſion ſuggeſted, without farther internall conſideration, or other externall inſtruction any certaine way. Which might alſo reaſonably mooue the ſententious Greeke poet to ſay, as he ſaith, <hi>That directly, or certainly to foretell future haps, or contingent caſualties, is the propertie of a God, not the qualitie of a man.</hi> Hap hazarde, is no ſure rule in arte, or reaſon: and they that ſhoote, as the blinde man that ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the crow, either by ſhort-ſhooting, or ouer-ſhooting, or ſhooting awry, may full eaſily, and do moſt commonly miſſe the marke, and looſe their game. The ſpirit of propheſie, is not like the ſpirit of the buttery: it is a diuine, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit of heauenly eſſence, and of ſupernaturall nature, not imployed, or ſet on worke by any, but onely his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Creator;</hi> nor vſed vpon any occaſion, but very great, and principally appertaining the glorie of his péereleſſe, and ielous Deitie, when the time ſpecially ſerued to worke by that extraordinarie, and miraculous meane, as the moſt forcible and effectuall traine to win men vnto God, and to reconcile the worlde vnto heauen, in compariſon, the onely true worlde. All times, and places are not alike: neither ſerue all giftes, for all ſeaſons: but certaine <hi>Excellencies</hi> haue in reſpect, béene appropriate to certaine ages: God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is completely, and abſolutely wiſe; and he alone beſt knoweth when, and where, and vpon whome, and how to diſtribute, or diſpence his heauenly graces, and bountifull bleſſings, either temporally, or perpetually, as is conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for his eternall glory, and méeteſt for our tranſitory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Euery age is not an age of euery perfection: nor our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4086:23"/>
time, a time of woonderments: the limited and néedefull terme of myracles, and myraculous operations, either by propheſie, or otherwiſe, many hundred yéeres ago determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as alreadie is mentioned, and may inuincibly be approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. It auaileth not, to enterprize impoſſibilities in nature, or to attempt abſurdities in reaſon, or to builde mountaines of hope, or feare, vpon irregularities in arte, or to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vanities, and fooleries in practiſe. Euery od occurrence of priuate, or publique importance, or euery ordinarie euent of doubtfull contingence, is not euery extraordinarie way to be reſolued, or decided: we muſt be content, neither to do, or know more, than we can: our beſt poſſible ſtay, or repoſe in caſes of exigence, diſtreſſe, or other accidentall caſualty, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or mortalitie, is the gracious mercy of God, and our owne diſcréete gouernment, according to chriſtian wiſdome, and lawfull pollicie: we muſt not in raging, or aſpiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection preſume to mount aboue the cloudes in the higheſt region of the aire, or to pierce the vnknowen déepes of the earthly Center. It is a ſcrupulous, and vaine curioſitie to buſie our ſelues, or importune other about any ſuch inquiry, as neither is lawfull in practiſe, nor aſſured in vſe, but both impious in the one, and vncertaine in the other. As many other things, and namely <hi>Lawes,</hi> or <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> eftſoones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, and repealed, ſo propheſie had a time of infallible effect: which being antiquated, or rather expired in the right, and lawfull, and honorable, and heauenly, and diuine kinde, or vſe: alas, what auaileth apiſh, or ſpiritiſh imitation? What néedeth, or booteth ſo much adoo, and ſo little helpe; in the falſe, vnlawfull, abhominable, helliſh, and diuelliſh kind, or abuſe? As good neuer a whit, as neuer the better: I, much better neuer a whit, then much the woorſe: as who is, or hath béen any whit the better, or not much the woorſe, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling, or diſguiſing himſelfe with ſuch foule, and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vanities, good for nothing, but to acquaint them with the diuell, and hell, before the time, and to begin the lamentable <hi>Tragoedie</hi> of thoſe dreadfull, and horrible torments ſo much the ſooner. I muſt not ſtande to aggranate matters, or to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie by way of <hi>Oratorlike</hi> perſuaſion: neither is that my

facultie elſewhere, nor my purpoſe here. The holy prophets, in reſpect of the apprehenſiue, and piercing operation, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of their cléere, and pure vnderſtanding, were properly called <hi>Vidents,</hi> or <hi>Seers,</hi> pillers of diuine religion, and men of God: are any our counterfet crankes ſo qualified, or ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate? Nay, are they not generally, as blinde, as moules, or bats, the very caterpillers of hereſie, and the bonſlaues or vaſſals of <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> We reade the ſight or viſion of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the viſion of <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> the viſion of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> the viſion of <hi>Daniel,</hi> with other like celeſtiall viſions, and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of powerable effect. Is it apparant or credible, that any theſe forgers, or coyners of adulterate propheſies, had euer any ſuch diuine extraordinary viſions, heauenly ſpectacles, apparitions, reuelations, and other ſemblable illuminations from aboue? I cannot ſufficiently ynough aſke this queſtion, which hath ſo often béene demaunded, and not yet once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Themſelues in the higheſt altitude of their aſpiring pride, dare not arrogate, or claime any ſuch appropriate, or ſingular bleſſing of diuine knowledge, as infuſed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: and as for other ſpeciall <hi>humane</hi> learning, or <hi>artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> cunning, gotten by ordinary meanes, of ſtudie, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell from beneath, therein can they much leſſe challenge any peculiar intereſt, or prerogatiue, without ſhamefull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable impudencie; conſidering how few, or in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon none of them, as is aboue touched, were euer knowen or reported to haue greatly excelled in any the notableſt Arts or Sciences. What pretence therefore, or what colour can they alledge, why reaſonable men, without reaſonable cauſe of approbation or allowance, ſhould yéeld credit or beléefe to ſuch blind vnreaſonable whimwhams, otherwhiles bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vp in <hi>Balductum</hi> méeter, otherwhiles bungled togither in paultry proſe; commonly void of all good rime or reaſon?

               <p>I thought not to haue mentioned any <hi>Sybilline</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, partly for their greater antiquitie, far before my prefixed terme, partly bicauſe amongſt falſe prophets or prophetiſſes, I recount them trueſt, as ſome way relying on <hi>Lactantius</hi> authoritie in that reſpect.

Firſt ſome imagined that it was moſt likely to be vnderſtood of that <hi>Euangelicall</hi> ſtar which extraordinarily appéered to the thrée wiſemen: but how can that ſéeme probable, when it is expreſly ſaide, that it ſhould ariſe in <hi>Europa,</hi> and <hi>ſoupra Iberos?</hi> Afterwards the great philoſophers of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome other courtly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites would néedes perſuade the world that the emperor <hi>Carolus Quintus</hi> was the royall, and mightie perſonage prefigured thereby, but did not finally the reall euent as wel falſifie their expoſition, as fruſtrate their expectation?

preſly named in the notorious propheſie of that <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier, as it is reported by <hi>Lucas Loſſius, Melancthon,</hi> and other, euen <hi>verbatim</hi> thus:
<q>
                     <p>Dominabitur Turca in tota Italia, &amp; Germania, Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, 1600.</p>

               <p>May not alſo the holy inſpirations of our late <hi>Caſſandrae, Brygit, Hyldegardis,</hi> and I know not what french <hi>Bardiſts</hi> animate his faint hart, and incenſe his cold courage? Which with one accord flatly auow, that the <hi>Imperiall</hi> ſeate of the Turkiſh <hi>Monarchy</hi> ſhall one day be tranſlated to <hi>Coleyn</hi> in <hi>Germany?</hi> Mary ſir, this were merie tidings indéed, and a gallant triumph for <hi>Amurathes</hi> iij. or any his ſucceſſor, if he, or they might fortune to pierce ſo déepe into the bowels of Chriſtiandome? As what noble prince, or man of armes would not hazard a ioint, when ſuch Diuinitie fauoureth him, and warranteth his luckie procéedings? Well, if this be the ſtaffe, or ſcepter wherevpon he leaneth, is he not like in fine, (notwithſtanding a thouſand ſuch gewgawes, vaine rumors, and fruſtratorie incouragements) to finde it litle ſtronger, or ſurer, than a weake réede, or rotten poſte: and conſequently to purchaſe himſelfe the ſame déere rewarde, which befell <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who fondly preſuming of <hi>Apolloes</hi> oracle, peruerted the maine force of his owne treaſure, euen then when he looked to haue ſubuerted the puiſſant might of his enimies? Yet might not <hi>Croeſus</hi> more warrantably relie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> than this Turk, or any of that <hi>Mahometicall</hi> generation, vpon <hi>Frier Hilten, Brigit,</hi> or any like pettyprophet, or demiprophetiſſe? Or was not that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God of golden memorie, more ſacred at thoſe daies, or at leaſt as ſolemnly conſecrated after their ceremonious guiſe, as any woodden Saint of the ſiluer Legend, amongſt whom theſe holy ones are recounted? The Lord put a falſe, or lying ſpirit into the mouth of all the prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and they forſooth propheſied vnto him goodly tydings, that he ſhould conquer <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> where afterward he was ſlaine, notwithſtanding the contrarie warrantie of that preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous propheſie, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. And is there not certaine hope, that the great Turke repoſing like truſt, or confidence in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4086:27"/>
like prophets, ſhall inioy the like ſucceſſe that king <hi>Ahab</hi> had? There continue euen to this day, as is credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and written, certaine furious creatures, or mad rauing wizardes amongſt the <hi>Mahometicians,</hi> which breath out very ſtrange blaſtes, and monſtrouſly diſguiſed in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious humor, run, or ſtand pratling vpon ſuch things, as neither their Art, nor nature are able to comprehend: which diſtraught wights, and helliſh impes, are there notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding eſtéemed for <hi>Demigods,</hi> and reuerenced as true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly prophets? But alas, are they any better then ſuch as God by <hi>Ezechiell (cap.</hi> 14. 9.) threatned to ſende for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and peruerſitie of the people, <hi>To ſeduce or beguyle them that delight in the diuels lies, rather than in his truth,</hi> and ſo to puniſh ſin by ſin, after the dreadfull rule of his iuſtice? And doth it not alſo there follow, that he which ſent, or excited them, will finally deſtroy aſwel thoſe vngratious prophets, themſelues; as that credulous, and prophane people that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeueth, or truſteth them? There was a ſecret reuealed vnto <hi>Daniell,</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> conceiued the matter, and had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the viſion: <hi>(Daniel</hi> 1. 1.) But whileſt ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous madbrains, and bedlames as theſe, raue out themſelues wot not what, can other ſober men deſcrie their outcries, or make pure diuinitie of ſo vnpure, and groſſe humanity? <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſaid, that if there were any diuination, it was <hi>Animi inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gri,</hi> and not, <hi>vitioſi corporis diuinatio:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſaid, that the ſpirits of the prophets were in the power of the prophets: (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.)

                     <p>Yee ſhall know, or diſcerne them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes of thornes? Or figs of thistles?</p>
                     <p>So euery good tree bringeth foorth good fruit: and a corrupt tree
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4086:28"/>

                     <p>A good tree cannot bring foorth euill fruit; neither can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bring foorth good fruite.</p>
                     <p>Euery tree that bringeth not foorth good fruit is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.</p>
                     <p>Therefore by their fruits yee ſhall diſcerne them.</p>
                     <p>Not euery one that ſaith vnto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that performeth the will of my father, which is in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Many will ſay vnto me, in that day: haue we not, in, or by thy name propheſied? and by thy name cast out diuels? And by thy name done many great works?</p>
                     <p>And then will I profeſſe vnto them: I neuer knew you, depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie. &amp;c. (Mathew 7.)</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhould we then, as is alſo premiſed, looke ſtill, and ſtill for more propheſies? Haue we not already <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and the prophets? Nay, haue we not the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelfe, and his apoſtles, more woorth than all the prophets of all ages, of all languages, of all countries, of all religions, or of whatſoeuer ordinary, or extraordinary qualitie in the world? Wherfore not <hi>Lazarus</hi> ariſing againe from death could mooue vs, if theſe cannot mooue vs. The eies of our harts, are, or ſhould be opened by the cléere bright Goſpell of Chriſt; and ſhall the eies of the body <hi>expect</hi> any farther ſight of miracles? Muſt we euermore be fed like yoong children? Or continually trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp like Infidels, or Ethniques? If there be any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a wonderfull maſteries wrought now adaies, are they not performed either by incantations, ſuch as the ſorcerers of <hi>Pharao</hi> vſed (which, howſoeuer they ſéeme glorious in the view of the world, are odious in the ſight of God, &amp; nothing leſſe than wonders indéede, but the onely ſubtill illuſions of the Diuell?) or elſe contriued by the deceitfull legierde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and craftie conueiance of ſhifting iuglers, and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging impoſtors, ſuch as amongſt infinite other of that ſame foiſting crue, namely <hi>Scotto</hi> and <hi>Feates</hi> vſed, ſéeming like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in apparance to haue done, and vndone that, which in very truth they coulde neuer doo, or vndoo, but made ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance thereof by the diuels ſophiſtry, and their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet

For touching <hi>naturall Magicians,</hi> and their cunning practiſes, ſuch as <hi>Archita Tarentinus,</hi> and our <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bacon</hi> vſed, are they any better than philoſophicall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, or mathematicall concluſions, and therefore no woonders, or myracles: ſéeing euery right woonder, ſuch as <hi>Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Eliſaeus</hi> vſed, were neither fained apparances, or deceptions of ſight, nor any naturall, or mathematicall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, but altogither ſupernaturall, ſupermathematicall, and true myracles? <hi>Pharaos</hi> ſorcerers, might incantatiuely turne their rods into ſerpents, as <hi>Aaron</hi> miraculouſly did, but of ſo like effects, were not the cauſes very vnlike, and did not finally <hi>Aarons</hi> rod deuour their rods? <hi>(Exod.</hi> 7. 12.) Or was not <hi>Pharao</hi> with his whole <hi>Aegyptian</hi> hoſte, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters themſelues, drowned in the midſt of the ſea, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſafely walked thorough vpon dry ground? <hi>(Exod.</hi> 14.) But to ouerpaſſe this point, with diuers like matters, (wherein the worſhipfull gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, maſter <hi>Reginald Scot,</hi> hath lately deſerued good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, for his learned diſcouery of ſuch palpable collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:) and to returne againe vnto our former argument; what better account are we to make of thoſe odde conceited predictions blowen abroad in the name of our famous <hi>Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marden</hi> prophet <hi>Ambroſe Merlin;</hi> are they not likewiſe as guilfull, and fraudulent as the reſidue, and euen like to our <hi>Karmarden</hi> frizes now adayes?

Iwis that meſſenger, or <hi>Nuntio,</hi> or (if haply it pleaſeth you ſo to terme him, for honors ſake) that prophet, or wizard, ſhall not greatly néede to hire him poſt horſes, for ſpéedier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie, and diſpatch of ſuch happie newes, but may well ynough come and go ſoone ynough, or rather ouerſoone on foote, that ſhall carrie ſuch bleſſed tidings in his mouth, or in letters miſſiue, certifieng any like ioyfull occurrents. But I beſéech you, what may be either the great mightie cauſes, in effecting; or the violent inforcements, in conſtraining; or the pithie reaſons, in proouing; or the cunning inſinuations, in perſuading the neceſſarie ſequele, or credible contingence of ſo great woonderfull caſualties, and dreadfull terrors?</p>
                  <p>Forſooth, <hi>Heliſaeus Reſlyn,</hi> a mathematician and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of good fame in our age, propounding the foreſaid <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manical</hi> tranſlation of <hi>Staephlerine</hi> in his <hi>Theorianouacaele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium Meteoran,</hi> auoweth, that himſelfe knoweth not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, cauſe, or ground of that famous Prognoſticate, than onely this, that ſome recounting the <hi>Synagog</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> (touching the ſpace of time, from the egreſſe of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> vnto the abolition and deuaſtation of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made vnder the raigne of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> by the rage of his ſonne <hi>Titus)</hi> to haue continued iuſt ſo many yéeres, as are now paſſed ſithence Chriſt; and withall affirming that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall Synagog</hi> to be a true type or figure of his Church; will néedes from hence, as they imagine, probably conclude, that ſome great alteration, or notorious mightie Accident is now likewiſe imminent, whileſt the ſame number of yéeres is againe accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Which computation, or <hi>Chronologie,</hi> how incongruous and erronious it is, as the learned nothing doubt, ſo I think few of the vnlearned to be ſo blinded in our daies, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaude to this Iewiſh <hi>Cabaliſticall</hi> reaſon, or myſticall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof; had the account it ſelfe béene found neuer ſo exactly, or preciſely true.</p>
                  <p>But as it falleth out, if you either take the true continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Synagog</hi> of the old Teſtament, (which is but 1580. yéeres by ſome former computes) and begin to reckon at the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſion, or comming of the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4086:48"/>
when the beginning of the primitiue Chriſtian Church was founded; ſhall the ſaid number be expired in the new <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> before the yéere 1614. or 1613. at the ſooneſt, which is almoſt 30. yéeres hence? Or if you follow the neweſt compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the learned Coſmographer, and Chronologer, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus Mercator,</hi> was not the ſame date, or terme of yéeres of the <hi>Iewiſh Synagog</hi> finiſhed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1520. that is 67. yéeres agoe?</p>
                  <p>And yet this, euen this ſilly deuiſe, ſéemeth to be the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and forcibleſt argument, that a cunning Aſtronomer, and erpert <hi>Meteorologician</hi> could alledge in defence and maintenance of that notorious prediction.</p>
                  <p>Whereby (to begin with <hi>Reſlins</hi> cenſure) it may partly appéere at the very firſt entrance, that there are no ſuch great ordinarie or extraordinarie cauſes of any ſuch vniuerſal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or generall calamities imminent, as is ouercredulouſly ſuppoſed, and ouertimorouſly miſdoubted: when ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent an Artiſt, in this very kinde of <hi>Prognoſticall</hi> knowledge, hath no more varietie of proofes, or no greater proofe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie to inforce, or inſinuate ſo weightie and peremptorie a reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to procéede with the opinions of other: Some preferring the ſhadowed and imagined fantaſies of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Plato, Ariſtotle, Porphyrie,</hi> and our later <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> touching the excellencie and preeminence of <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> and <hi>Geometricall</hi> proportion in numbers; will néedes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a déepe myſtery, &amp; high ſecret in the very number 5550. it ſelfe; (the preſent yéere of the world, and the 88. of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> and thereby euen from the onely number of yéeres, go about to inforce I know not what, and what dangerous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable confuſion about that period. But is it credible that the extreame diſmall fate of the world, or any vtter caſualtie of ſo mightie conſequence ſhould in very déede depend vpon the fickle ſtate of numbers and figures? Or may the <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable</hi> quantitie of 5. to 50. of 50. to 500. of 500. to 5000. or any ſuch fiuefold, or tenfold, or <hi>Geometricall,</hi> or <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall</hi> concord and equalitie, by the vertue of I know not what myſticall <hi>Analogie,</hi> ſquare out any ſuch dreadfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4086:49"/>
and inequalities, as are now beyond all number, weight and meaſure expected? I cannot reach ſo high, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other: but in my ſimple knowledge there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of proofe, or <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> I am not ignorant, that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſummitie of their <hi>Ethicall, Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall, Politique,</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> Idees, haue diſplaied ſome ſuch philoſophicall quiddities, and in a maner panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically extolled like <hi>Harmonicall</hi> reſemblances; but diſcuſſe the ſubiect it ſelfe, and conſider their figuratiue maner of handling, and ſhall you finde any more ſufficient matter in them for auailable direction to anie ſuch <hi>Superplatonicall</hi> Intelligence, or <hi>Superariſtotelicall</hi> intendiment, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> lot, or any like <hi>Cabaliſticall</hi> tradition? Howbeit neither will I, nor can I in truth denie, but that there lurketh (as it were) a kind of <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and hidden or myſticall vnderſtanding in ſundrie <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall</hi> and <hi>Geometricall Analogies:</hi> but as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceiue how, or why the finall deſtinie of this whole <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſalitie,</hi> or any other moſt notable change, or chance by woonderfull innouation or confuſion, ſhould be comprized therein, or comprehended thereby; (howſoeuer the heretical Arithmeticians, <hi>Marcus Magus,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus</hi> haue blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly babled to like purpoſe) ſo particularly for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent yéere 5550. I am well aſſured there is no ſuch exquiſite <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> or exact <hi>Geometricall</hi> proportion in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and numbers thereof, as ſhall be in the yéere 5555. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching 5. yéeres after; which by ſoundeſt proportion, and <hi>Harmonical</hi> equalitie of numbers (if they preuaile any whit to the effecting of ſuch terrible and lamentable alterations) ſhould expreſſe more déepe and peremptory impreſſions than this, in regard of any ſuch <hi>Pythagoricall,</hi> or <hi>Arithmanticall Theorie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore by the reaſon and <hi>Analogie</hi> of this reckoning, (the ſounder of the two) it is the 93. not the 88. yéere of the <hi>Chriſtian Epocha,</hi> that muſt prooue the diſmall period, and fatall yéere of lamentations.</p>
                  <p>But to ouerpaſſe ſo ſlight an argument without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay, let ſuch finally as builde ſo much vpon the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4086:49"/>
of 5550. remember by the way, that howſoeuer we eſtéeme the 88. yéere of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for that yéere of the world: there are by the <hi>Chronological</hi> reckonings of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aboue 5000. and 600. yéeres: by the reckonings of <hi>Paulus Oroſius, Beda, Euſebius, Tritemius,</hi> and their ſectaries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 6000. and 700. yéeres: by the reckonings of the firſt fathers, and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church, aboue 7000. yéeres: and by the compute of the moſt noble Mathematician, king <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus,</hi> aboue 8000. and 500. yéeres alreadie paſſed, and fully complete ſithence the time of the originall creation thereof. Is it therefore impoſſible, or vnlike that any of thoſe ſhould ſée as far into <hi>Decretoriall</hi> numbers, or future ieoperdies, and publique caſualties, as any of late memorie? Nay, were not they generally more déepely grounded, and better exerciſed in ſuch myſteries, and priuities both of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> than we are now a daies? Yet can we not finde that any of them euer aſſigned any ſuch efficacie, or vertue to the preſent equalitie of numbers; or if percaſe they did, is not their date long ago expired without any ſuch euents? Why then ſhould we miſdoubt but that euen this ſurmiſed <hi>Mirabilis Annus</hi> will alſo paſſe as other yéeres haue done heretofore, and like as theſe famous authors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their chronologies, ſuppoſed this ſame to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed, without any mention of any ſuch terrible ſturs and garboils.</p>
                  <p>There are otherſome which ſuſpect this yéere the rather, bicauſe forſooth, as they alledge, it is <hi>A Climacterical, Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or <hi>Decretoriall</hi> yéere of the world, &amp; therefore the liker to bring on ſome great manifeſt alteration with it, as they conſequently conclude. And what now if I ſhuld fréely grant it to be ſuch a <hi>Climactericall</hi> yéere indéed, (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they haue onely ſaid, &amp; cannot of likelihood prooue:) is not euery 7. yéere of the world ſuch an one? And haue not many hundered ſuch yéeres already determined without any ſuch monſtrous iſſues, or terrible calamities, as are now threatned? Or what though ſome of the woorthieſt, and moſt famous men that euer liued, died in ſome ſuch yéere of their age, muſt therefore the ſame yéeres of neceſſitie be fatall to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4086:50"/>
the vniuerſall frame of the world, which in regard of a few obſeruations, are reputed diſmall to particular men? Yet haue there no doubt as many, and more, and as notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons euery way departed in other yéeres of their ages, as euer did in <hi>Climacterical, Enneatical,</hi> or great <hi>Climacteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Enneaticall</hi> yéeres, howſoeuer in reſpect of ſome <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall</hi> conſiderations, and <hi>Phyſicall</hi> circumſtances, we may otherwiſe attribute ſundry extraordinarie contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therunto. Or if haply al the premiſſes were vndoubtedly certaine, why ſhould this, in any ſuch contemplation, be more dreaded than any other of the ſame note, already paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or future hereafter, as is before touched? It ſéemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that in the apparance of that reaſon, the yéer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 87. or of the world 49. laſt paſt, ſhould rather haue prooued ſo terrible a yéere, than this preſent, forſomuch as that was not onely a <hi>Climactericall</hi> yéere, according to their owne reputation, and computation; but alſo a <hi>Climacterical Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domaticall,</hi> or great <hi>Criticall</hi> yéere, ariſing of 7. times 7. as is elſewhere <hi>Obiter</hi> declared, whereunto this kinde of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators in their <hi>Empiricall</hi> obſeruances, aſſigneth much more credit, and authoritie, than vnto any other ſimple yéere of that ſort.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore by this reaſon, and this reckoning, the laſt yéer 87. (&amp; that euen according to their own <hi>Empirical</hi> maximes &amp; grounds) ſhould haue prooued the great maine yéere wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they talke ſo much, and not 88. as is blowen abroad.</p>
                  <p>What then? Shall we yéelde any greater credite vnto theſe buſie deuiſers, than vnto the tales of ſome old ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſome yoonger apiſh creatures, who eſtéeming eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Biſſextile,</hi> or leape yéere more vnluckie, and infortunate than the vſuall common yéeres, imagine that this yéere may, and is like, in the reach of their ſkill, to be diſmall, and omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the rather euen for that cauſe?

is the 20. yéere, <hi>ab Anno</hi> 69?

Beſides the very ſame <hi>Haly</hi> too in another place <hi>(Cap. 4. part.</hi> 8.) affirmeth, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> coupled with <hi>Saturne</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth his malice, and confoundeth his rancorous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which although ſome will percaſe alledge to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoken, yet is it not euery way as particular, direct, and artificiall as the other oppoſed verdict?</p>
                  <p>But forſooth <hi>Haly Heben Rodoan, Trapezuntius,</hi> and <hi>Pontane</hi> in their Commentaries vpon <hi>Ptolomeis Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquium,</hi> in their expoſition, or declaration of the foreſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme</hi> haue propounded another rule, and maner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding, according all in this point, that the ſuperioritie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried in that 63. ſentence, ſhould in this caſe be aſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the planet, which at that moment ſhall be higheſt eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his <hi>Epycicle,</hi> or in the néereſt proximitie to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeon,</hi> or ſummitie thereof: And how then may we déeme, or iudge of this congres? That is a new queſtion indéed, and by that interpretation we muſt yéeld the preeminence vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> for was not he néerer the degrée of his <hi>Aux</hi> than <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter?</hi> And conſequently <hi>Secundum Augem</hi> extolled aboue him. I cannot tell, but in my ſimple ſkill, forſomuch as they likewiſe affirme, that a planet the nearer he approcheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, the déeper are his impreſſions, and rages more forcible, or powerable on earth: I ſée little reaſon why that planet in this concourſe ſhould preuaile moſt in operation, who is fartheſt remooued from the ſtate of ſtrongeſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and effectuall operation euen this way too, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the forementioned maner. Beſides, is not the corporall preſence it ſelfe of <hi>Iupiter</hi> one of the chéefe helps, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes which <hi>Saturne</hi> hath, and ſhall not he which augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or increaſeth anothers might, be ſtill the mightier, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4086:56"/>
to the common Axiome, <hi>Quod efficit tale?</hi> Howbeit there remaineth yet a third kind of <hi>Eleuation,</hi> or ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie noted of <hi>Guido Bonatus,</hi> and many other Aſtrologians, yea of all moſt commonly obſerued, and moſt vſually reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is by them referred vnto the preſent <hi>Latitudes</hi> of the planets ſo conioined, after this maner; that if it fortune their <hi>Latitudes</hi> to be both <hi>Septentrionall,</hi> he whoſe <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is greateſt, to be the chéefeſt, or moſt ſoueraigne: but if their <hi>Latitudes</hi> be both <hi>Meridionall,</hi> then he to be preferred whoſe <hi>Latitude</hi> is leaſt of the twaine, &amp;c. Which ſort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, <hi>Ioannes Ganiuetus</hi> ſéemeth onely, or at leaſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to haue reſpected, in his booke intituled <hi>Amicus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum, Cap. 1. different.</hi> 3. where making mention of the great <hi>Coniunction</hi> of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the 13. grade of <hi>Scorpio, Anno</hi> 1425. <hi>Ganiuetus</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Saturne</hi> was then eleuated aboue <hi>Iupiter:</hi> why? Bicauſe as he there alledgeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maior fuit illius latitudo verſus Septentrionem; His latitude was greater towards the North:</hi> And ſhall not <hi>Iupiter</hi> now by the ſelfe ſame reaſon be exalted aboue <hi>Saturne,</hi> bicauſe his <hi>Latitude</hi> is leſſer <hi>Verſus Meridiem,</hi> or towards the South? Wherefore as <hi>Ganiuetus</hi> concluded, that much vnwoonted trouble, and vnaccuſtomed miſchéefe ſhould follow to the cleargie by that preeminence, may not we as well, and as truly by this prerogatiue pronounce on the other ſide, ſome extraordinarie proſperitie and happie ſucceſſe, or gladſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the ſaid <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> eſtate, or ſpirituall vocation? I might ſtill alledge two or thrée other kinds of planetarie <hi>Eleuation,</hi> vſed amongſt all Aſtrologers: but ynough in proofe, may ſéeme ſufficient in art; and I nothing doubt, but that I may at length in regard of the premiſſes boldly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the prefixed copulation was far more preualent or predominant than <hi>Saturne,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the conſequents thereof are principally to be deriued from him; whoſe nature as it is generally right bountifull, and very good, and his influence fortunate and luckie, ſo they are at this time ſpecially to be ſo reputed and eſtéemed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that himſelfe is ſo ſtrongly configured, and ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4086:57"/>
diſpoſed, as now all reſpects and circumſtances truly waied, he appéereth to be. What then followeth? <hi>vz.</hi> that this <hi>Coniunction</hi> of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> is ſo far from working or inforcing any ſuch horrors, as this 88. propheſie preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that of all likelihood it ſhould ſéeme rather (in caſe it hath any notable ſignifications at all) to preſignifie much fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good, and great ioy, or happines in concluſion: howſoeuer <hi>Saturne</hi> in the meane while may now, and then according to his ſmall power, and <hi>pro ſuo debili poſſe,</hi> begin or attempt pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie treaſons, vnderminings, trecheries, practiſes, and other ſpitefull villanies, ſomedeale agréeable to his peſtilent, and rancorous nature.</p>
                  <p>Which iudiciall may otherwiſe alſo be verefied, and in part confirmed: for touching the other moderators of that <hi>Coniunction,</hi> had not good louing <hi>Venus</hi> as much to do therein as bad cholerique <hi>Mars?</hi> Who is as well lady of the great <hi>Orbe,</hi> as the other is <hi>Deuiſor</hi> of the yéere? Or hath not ſhe as many, or rather more eſſential prerogatiues in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place of <hi>Coniunction</hi> than he hath? Wherefore, neither in this reſpect, can there any great euils be feared, or expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when likewiſe the other fortune if not ouermatcheth, at leaſt equally matcheth, and counteruaileth the other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in ſtrength, power, and value.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to ouerſlip this point: and to returne vnto the former cenſures of <hi>Leouitius, Reſlyn, Poſtell,</hi> and their adherents: I cannot ſufficiently maruell what mooued ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous learned men in this facultie, to aſcribe, or attribute ſo excéeding much vnto that ſilly <hi>Coniunction?</hi> As if there muſt neceſſarily inſue either a finall diſſolution of the world, or at leaſt I cannot tell what ſtrange innouation of lawes, or tranſlation of kingdomes, as occaſioned, or inforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? But marke wel the argument of <hi>Leouitius,</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was alſo the principall reaſon that perſuaded the other: If (ſaith he) there were yet another <hi>Coniunction</hi> like this to be expected, then the propheſie of <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould be falſified, which vndoubtedly is moſt true, and infallible: <hi>Ergo</hi> the world muſt néeds either be vtterly diſſolued, or woonderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſordered, vnder the preſent <hi>Coniunction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:4086:57"/>
Which argument how artificiall it is, being barely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, or how neceſſarily true, being founded vpon a falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſandie ground, it may ſufficiently appéere by the former ſection, where the ſaid pretended propheſie of the ſuborned <hi>Elias,</hi> is both euidently, as I take it, detected, and as well ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as plentifully confuted. Howbeit here by the way how apparant it is, what notable errors, vanities, forgeries, and coſenages that one authoriſed tradition of <hi>Elias</hi> hath wrought, and how many, yea of the learneder ſort haue béen ouertaken and beguiled therewith in reſpect of the reuerend name, and honorable antiquitie: which hath a long time béen a continuall ſtumbling blocke to al <hi>Aſtronomicall,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall</hi> coniectures: for ſhould he not haue ſéemed to caſt beyond the moone, that would once haue vndertaken to ſpeake, or write any thing of a farther period than his puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <hi>Oracle</hi> preſcribeth?</p>
                  <p>But to returne againe, from whence I haue a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed: touching the decay, and ruine of the <hi>Romane</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, or <hi>Occidentall</hi> empire, whereof <hi>Leouitius</hi> dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how can he make <hi>Idem cauſam generationis &amp; corruptionis eiuſdem?</hi> And is there not likewiſe another phiſicall Axiome, that <hi>Quicquid corrumpitur, à contrario patitur?</hi> As alſo that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile â ſimili conſeruatur, &amp; alitur?</hi> And as for the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſupernaturall natiuitie of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which he conteining himſelfe within the compaſſe of his profeſſion, ſéemeth to make an effect of the like naturall <hi>Coniunction</hi> happening in the end of the watrie, &amp; beginning of the fierie <hi>Trigon,</hi> about 6. yéeres before his ſaid incarnation: as I eſtéeme this for a plaine ſuperſtitious aſſertion, and altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irreligious: ſo I ſée as ſlender warrantie of reaſon, or authority, why his church ſhould be tranſlated from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> vnto the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or his <hi>Goſpell</hi> otherwiſe tranſplanted, or his ſecond comming determined, in reſpect of any ſuch aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call coniecture, when the ſcience it ſelfe being <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>Natural,</hi> hath not any aſcertained intelligence, or experience of ſuch diuine, and ſupernaturall vnſearchable myſteries, which being onely inrolled in the great volume of Gods owne ſecrets, cannot poſſiblie by any ſecundary cauſes, or</p>

paſſe, remitting the ſtudious reader in this kinde vnto his foreſaid Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>Finally, ſuch violent mutations, or mortall warres, and ſlaughters as <hi>Leouitius</hi> and other haue inferred, are they not the proper acts and effects of <hi>Mars</hi> rather than of <hi>Saturne,</hi> as <hi>Meſſahalah</hi> ſaith? Or is there at all any Aſtrologicall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or aſſured prediction of ſuch <hi>Martial</hi> ſturs and garboils, which euen <hi>Cardane</hi> himſelfe (a great protector otherwiſe of this prognoſticall art) durſt neuer auow? <hi>(Segment. 7. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi> 120.) Why then néede we feare any ſuch ſudden hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burlies or confuſions, from this <hi>Coniunction</hi> of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where <hi>Mars</hi> hath little to do in reſpect, who muſt play ſuch bloodie and deadly feats? Or if he had neuer ſo much to do, why ſhould we be diſmaied or diſcomforted thereby, when this art cannot any way determine of ſuch militarie and Martiall euents, being in this behalfe no leſſe vncertaine, <hi>Quàm ipſi incerti bellorum exitus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then? May it be ſtill imagined that the <hi>Coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> was originally, or may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be reputed the true foundation of this propheſie? Or that it is the liker to be true or credible, bicauſe that concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth therewith in effect? Neither is that, in any my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, expreſſed either by <hi>Leouitius,</hi> or any other fauourer of that threatening ſaid ſawe; ſo that if there were indéed any ſuch terrible coincidents to be aſcribed or imputed vnto that congreſſe, we haue yet no vndoubted or aſſured proofe, that they ſhould take place rather in 88. the yéere of this oracle; than in 87. or in 89. or in any former or later yéere. <hi>Cardane</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> vpon <hi>Ptolomeys</hi> ſecond <hi>Apoteleſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> booke, <hi>Cap. 9. Text.</hi> 54. writeth, that the effects of ſuch a <hi>Coniunction</hi> take place, and hold out vntill another <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction,</hi> or at leaſt vntill ſuch time as the ſaid planets ſhall be in <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> but he maketh no certaine difference, or diſtinction of yéeres; and <hi>Leopoldus Auſtriacus</hi> affirmeth, that the yéere it ſelfe ſhall be the woorſe wherein the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction</hi> appéereth: but <hi>Albumazar</hi> (2. <hi>diff. tract.</hi> 1.) auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the ſignifications of this <hi>Coniunction</hi> happening in the watrie <hi>Trigon,</hi> are procraſtinated or prolonged vntill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4086:58"/>
ſixe <hi>Coniunctions</hi> immediately inſuing. How then by any of theſe obſeruations, or other like determinations, ſhall the conſequents of the <hi>Coniunction</hi> 83. be appropriately and ſingularly reduced, or particularized to the yéere 88?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the preſent propheſie threateneth either an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall conſummation, &amp; finall diſſolution of the world, or at leaſt a generall ſubuerſion and alteration of principalities, kingdoms, monarchies, &amp; empires; wheras not the greateſt <hi>Coniunction</hi> of ſuperior, or inferior planets that euer did, or ſhall happen, can by any artificiall argument, or intelligible conceit, extend the force, or preuaile any farther than ſuch places onely, and ſuch territories as are vnder the ſubiection of the ſigne of the Copulation, or at the vttermoſt vnder the partition of that <hi>Quadrangle,</hi> wherof the ſigne of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction</hi> is preſently recounted. Wherfore neither that way can 88. be ſo terrible a yéere bicauſe of the <hi>Coniunction,</hi> as the propheſie ſpecifieth; nor the <hi>Coniunction</hi> at any time ſo terrible in works, as the propheſie in words appéereth to be. Which either in reſpect of the Annuall <hi>Progreſſion</hi> thereof, or the conſent it hath with the <hi>Reuolutions</hi> of this yéere, or with Eclypſes héerafter mentioned (which kind of naturall Accidents <hi>(Eclipſes</hi> I meane) are by the ſounder doctrine of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> the principall effecters, or abrogaters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of ſuch <hi>Coniunctions)</hi> or any like preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or coincident conſideration; as it is vnlike extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, or exceſſiuely to afflict this yéere, vnleſſe peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now and then with ſome vnaccuſtomed cold, and decay in the fruit of the earth; ſo néedeth it not (in my ſimple opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) to be finally regarded, or commonly feared as any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or powerable author of the pretended <hi>Martiall</hi> calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</p>
                  <p>How then? Are there yet remaining any other farther cauſes, or artificiall likelihoods of ſuch imminent calamities? Be there any forcible or notable <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> or fierie <hi>Comets</hi> to be ſéene, or the ſights therof being already paſſed, are there any ſuch to take déepe roote, or mightie effect this yéere?

the ſoundeſt Mathematicians aſcribe moſt certaine, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſignifications? Indéede there was an Eclipſe of the Moone the laſt yéere 87. the ſixt day of <hi>September</hi> being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> about 38. Minutes after 8. a clocke at night: but what? Can that worke any ſuch conſequents, being but a <hi>Partile</hi> not a <hi>Totall</hi> Eclipſe? Or are not the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alreadie in a maner conſummated? Beſides, who is chéefe gouernor, or diſpoſer thereof? Was it not <hi>Iupiter?</hi> And what, I pray you, are his ſignifications, when he ſo ruleth? Peruſe the 8. chap. of <hi>Ptolomeys 2. Apoteleſmaticall</hi> booke, and ſhall you not there find that <hi>Iupiter deliquij aſſequutus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium generaliter rerum omnium incrementa contribuit: ſed peculiariter hominibus largitur gloriam, corporis ſalubritatem, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimorum tranquillitatem, gaudia, pacem, bonorum copioſa ſubſidia;</hi> with ſuch like wiſhed proſperities and bleſſings? And what may be déemed more ioifull, fortunate, or happie, than theſe <hi>Iouiall</hi> contributions and bounties? Howbeit ſome will ſtil obiect, that the vnluckie <hi>Mars</hi> was partaker with him in this gouernment, in reſpect that he was lord of the <hi>Terme</hi> and <hi>Decane,</hi> wherein the Eclipſe happened: but what if he were principall gouernor too, ſo he hurt, or annoy vs not? And how can he hurt, or annoy vs this way, when the date of the force or operation of the <hi>Eclipſe</hi> it ſelfe is already worne out? Or alas, how ſilly ſhould the effects of any ſuch <hi>Defect</hi> haue béene in compariſon of the gréeuous and huge terrors of this propheſie; albeit <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Saturne</hi> himſelf had béene ſole diſpoſer thereof, and his moſt malitious, deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and rancorous actions continued moſt part of the whole yéere?

                  <p>Well, but is there not yet a more perlous doubt behind? For is not frowning and froward <hi>Saturne</hi> lord of the yéere,

and (which maketh all the woorſe) is he not ſeated in a <hi>Fixed</hi> ſigne of the earthly <hi>Triplicitie,</hi> &amp; <hi>direct</hi> in an <hi>Angle?</hi> Which by the opinion of the woorthy <hi>Meſſahalah (lib. de Reuolutione Annorum mundi, Cap.</hi> 48.) preſignifieth great contention and wars, with a murrian and rot amongſt cattell?

What though I confes al this to be true? Is <hi>Saturn Genius localis,</hi> or <hi>Daemon Topicus omnibus gentibus?</hi> Or is he lord of the yéere vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer, or in, or throughout al countries? Or doth he work in all places alike euen where his dominion extendeth? Which dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or power, as it followeth in the forementioned book, and chapt. of <hi>Meſſahalah</hi> is onely, <hi>In ea terra, in cuius ſigno pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè fuerit:</hi> Wherefore as all his, or any other miſchéeuous ſignifications, prefigured by the preſent celeſtiall poſition, are wholy to be effected in ſuch nations, territories, and cities, as are vnder the gouernment of <hi>Taurus</hi> &amp; <hi>Aries;</hi> ſo euen there alſo ſhall they chéefly preuaile ouer ſuch creatures, as are of the more popular and baſer ſort, amongſt whom not onely penurie and dearth, but alſo the plague, &amp; ſundry other grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous infirmities may fortune to raigne; and peraduenture ſome péeuiſh, or ruſticall murmurings, treaſons, rebellions, and trecheries be ſet abroach, which notwithſtanding ſhall be as like to procure any graund innouation, by diſordering kingdoms, and turning principalities topſie turuie; as ſuch meane obſcure perſons, and ſilly creatures are like to prooue kings, princes, lords, or honorable counſellers of roiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. I am not ignorant, that ſome aſcribe the preeminence of the celeſtiall figure, and gouernment of this yéere vnto bloodie <hi>Mars;</hi> ſuppoſe it ſo indéede, at leaſt by putting caſe, (albeit I ſée no Aſtrologicall reaſon or authoritie of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution) yet if his preſent ſtate be duly conſidered, and his whole abilitie truly examined according to the grounds of their Iudiciall procéedings; ſhall you not find his violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be brideled and qualified in ſuch ſort, that he is greatly vnlike to infect, terrifie, or aſtoniſh the world with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſanguinarie, or horrible garboiles, as other whiles he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4086:62"/>
portendeth? Where thorough his vnluckie configuration he may cruelly play his bloodie part? I appeale to themſelues, that haue at all aduentures appointed him lord of the yéere, if his woonted fiercenes and rage be not (euen according to their owne learning) ſo aſſwaged, and abated, that he cannot execute the furie of his cruell nature, or inforce his <hi>Potentiam in actum.</hi>

But I take it not greatly woorth the labor either of meditation, or of writing, to wade any déeper or farther, in ſo néedleſſe and bootleſſe a fanſie. For doth it not alreadie ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appéere, what priuate or publique credit is in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſſigned vnto the ſaide notorious <hi>Epigram,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poeticall <hi>Satyre,</hi> and hypocriticall <hi>Libell,</hi> in reſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny naturall cauſes, or preternaturall ſpeculations, or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all arguments, or inartificiall authorities, or whatſoeuer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence of diuine or humane allowance?

I ſhal not néed to repeat or recapitulate any proofes, or teſtimonies prealledged in the former part.

It belongeth vnto me in good modeſtie and dutie, to commit the due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whole conſequence of ſuch politique <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> to profeſſed Politicians, wiſe Magiſtrates, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Councellers, accordingly qualified, and furniſhed for the méete and ſufficient diſcharge of ſo honorable emploiment: but chéefly vnto God himſelfe, the high and mightie prince of princes, and gouernor of gouernors: by and through whom kings rule, and kingdoms floriſh, as contrariwiſe without whoſe gracious aide and aſſiſtance they ſoone periſh, and come to extreame ruine. Howbeit in the meane time, and by the way, I nothing doubt but princes (of all other) and ſuch politique perſonages, as they haue néereſt about them, are as thoroughly prouided, and ſtrongly furniſhed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the publique weale of their natiue countries, and to vphold their owne honors; as withall they are beſt able to anſwere for themſelues, and to defend their owne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both in words and déedes.
