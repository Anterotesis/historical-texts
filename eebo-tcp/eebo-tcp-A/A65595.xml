            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SPECIMEN of some Errors and defects in the late History of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT ought not to be esteemed any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect to the Author of the <hi>late History of the Reformation of the Church of</hi> England, now advanced to an eminent station therein, nor any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offered to the Work it self; if the Errors and Defects of it be discovered and published by others. To examine the Truth of things proposed, is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege common to all men: Nor can this <hi>Great Historian</hi> justly take it ill, if the title of <hi>Infallible,</hi> which he with so great strength of reason opposeth in others, be denied to himself, especially since him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath laid down this excellent Rule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hist. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> p. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>264.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>ingenuous persons ought not to
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:62181:3"/>
take things on trust easily, no not from the greatest Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At least it will be allowed, that when a Forreigner (however eminent and learned) undertaketh to write the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any Nation, or part of it; the Natives have more than ordinary right to examine the truth, and discover the mistakes of it; lest otherwise the honour of their Countrey should suffer any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by a false Relation of its Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions. This examination will be so much the more necessary and serviceable, by how much the History hath obtained the greater reputation in the World: since where any History acquireth (as this hath most deservedly) such an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal reception, as to be read, and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all at home, to be translated into other Languages abroad, to be accounted by all most perfect in its kind; that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal reputation will the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contribute to the propagation of the Errors contained in it: and further since
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:62181:3"/>
(as the Author himself not vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) <hi>it is a Work that may live some time in the World</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Par. 2. in Praf.</hi> p. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> those Errors, which tend to the prejudice of truth and dishonour of the Nation, will be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, unless this remedy, of a publick detection of them, be allowed.</p>
            <p>I do not hereby pretend to detract from the honour due to this History; nor do I presume so much as to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, what the Historian himself is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to own,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Par. 1. in Pref.</hi> p. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>his unfitness for such a work, by reason of his unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness with the Laws and Customs of this Nation, not being born in it</hi>; however the desire and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great Persons did herein over-rule his Modesty. I am not so vain as to imagin, that I can in the least blast a reputation so firmly and so deservedly established; nor is that any part of my design. On the contrary, I should give to this History those praises, which are due to it; could I induce my self to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:62181:4"/>
that my suffrage could add any thing to that great opinion, which the World hath already entertained of it. The only reasons which have drawn me to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, are the love of truth, and concern for the honour of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church; which will receive at least some small advancement by the discovery of any errors committed and believed in the History of it.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Varillas, Le Grand,</hi> and others have been successfully triumphed over, and baffled by the Historian, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready published Reflections, Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Corrections of this History, being mere strangers to our Nation, and the History of it; and designing not in the least the discovery of truth, or restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of History, but only to gratify their private passions, and to vilify the honour and justice of our Reformation: if their attempts have succeeded so ill, that will not discourage me, who do not altogether labour under the same disadvantages with
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:62181:4"/>
them, and am not conscious to my self of any sinister design. Or if they have given to the Historian just occasion to treat them with some scorn and contempt, I do not much fear the same treatment, which yet if it should happen, will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright me; nor yet deterr me from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring further into the truth of things, especially those relating to our Church; as I shall have leisure and opportunity.</p>
            <p>It ought not, nor can it be supposed, that I have discovered, and in these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers published, all the Errors committed in this History: I have indeed read the whole, but have not had opportunity to examine the truth of a third part of it. In that small part which I have examined, I have detected all the following mistakes, (for which reason I call it a <hi>Specimen</hi>) so that if I had present leisure and means to pursue the examination throughout; I could scarce hope to find the remaining part free from Errors. But I would not bestow too much time upon it; nor if I
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:62181:5"/>
would, do I enjoy yet fit opportunity. The Reflections of <hi>Varillas, Le Grand,</hi> or any others upon this History I have not read since they were first published; and then I had entertained no thoughts of such a design: so that if any observation of mine be common to them, it is by chance. But I do not much fear it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the most part drawn my Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from Books and Records which they never saw.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Fulman</hi>'s Corrections, which the Historian hath published in the end of his second Volume, I have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on any mistakes observed by him; unless where he hath either mistaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or not sufficiently cleared the matter. In the whole I have made use of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of the History, which (as the title bears) hath been <hi>corrected.</hi>

               <p>THE Historian seemeth to have been ignorant, that the Cardinal did for several years receive a very large Pension out of the Archbishoprick of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Not many weeks since I saw an Original Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writ with the Cardinal's own hand to Dr. <hi>Lee,</hi> his Agent in the Emperour's Court; wherein, among other things, he commanded him to expostulate with the Emperour's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for the non-payment of the Pension reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to him out of the Archbishoprick. The exact summ due to him is therein inserted: but having not then taken any minutes of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not so much as the date of it, I will not affirm any thing particular of the summ. Yet to do justice to the memory of the Cardinal, lest he should be thought to have been bribed by any Forreign Prince to act against the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of his Master, I will add, that when <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi> was delivered by K. <hi>Henry</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi>

Notwithstanding his asseveration, I examined the Record, and upon search found, that not it, but the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is mistaken.

               <p>Many mistakes and false consequences are contained in these lines. For 1. if <hi>Wolsey</hi> in the quality of Lord Chancellor, took place of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; it would follow that the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, as such, ought to precede the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62181:7"/>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: The contrary of which is known to be and to have always been true. 2dly. If <hi>Warham,</hi> when Lord Chancellor, took place of <hi>Wolsey,</hi> when Cardinal, in the house of Peers; it doth not follow, that at that time he took place of him elsewhere, as the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would insinuate. For in the House the Chancellor precedeth all other Peers, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> among the rest, as being in virtue of his Office Speaker of the House. Nor, could <hi>Wolsey</hi> be so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly vain as to desire the Great Seal only that he might precede <hi>Warham</hi> in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</note> as the Historian observeth, <hi>he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to govern without Parliaments.</hi> And accordingly for many years after he obtained the Great Seal, had no Parliaments. And even after the Seal was taken from him, he still took place of <hi>Warham</hi> in the house of Peers. 3dly. If in the Letter wrote to the Pope 1530. The Cardinal subscribed before <hi>Warham</hi>; he could not do this in the quality of Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, as the Historian imagins. For the Great Seal had been taken from him in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding year 1529, <hi>October</hi> 17. So that some other reason of <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s precedence must be enquired. And that reason is very obvious. For <hi>Wolsey</hi> took place of <hi>Warham,</hi> even before and after he was Lord Chancellor, as being Cardinal. This is confirmed by the relation of <hi>Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>: Who in his <hi>Life</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Historian here undertaketh to describe the way and process of making Bishops in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> received for above 300 years before the Reformation. In his description of it he hath committed several mistakes. For, first, this method was not much used in <hi>England,</hi> until within less than 200 years before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, It was not even then always used: For sometimes within that term Bishops were elected, confirmed and consecrated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consulting the Pope in the least, or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Bulls from him. Thirdly, Even after the method of expecting Papal Bulls, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in virtue of them was fully setled: the King did not always recommend, nor did the Pope always grant his Bulls to the person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. But sometimes the Pope staid not for his Recommendation, but granted his Bulls to whom he thought fit: or after he had received the King's Letters granted his Bulls to some other, whom himself liked better, or whom the Archbishop or some powerfull No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman had recommended. Indeed for about sixty years before the Reformation our Kings had got the better of the Popes in this matter, and drawn the disposition of Bishopricks to themselves, yet not altogether (for the Popes by their authority and pleasure disposed of <hi>Worcester</hi> at least three times together within that term) and after all, 4thly, the Bishops were not first consecrated and then invested in the Spiritualities of the See. But the practice
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62181:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was all along contrary. For they received the Spiritualities of their Sees, immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Confirmation; and the sentence of their Confirmation was ever accompanied with a decree for their being put in possession of their Spiritualities, and a mandate directed to the Guardian of the Spiritualities to deliver them up to them.</p>

At that time, and long after, the Monasteries were the Schools and Nurseries of almost the whole Clergy, as well Secular as Regular: For the Universities (if there were any) were then very mean Societies; and the whole Learning of the Nation was then in a manner confined to their Cloysters. As the Universities increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they gradually decreased: yet still retained and cultivated Learning, till about the middle of the 13<hi>th</hi> Age; when the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Orders arose, who by their Hypocrisie, jugling Tricks, and extraordinary Industry, ran down both them and the Secular Clergy. Within two hundred years the Mendicants became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; and then both the Monks and the Seculars began to recover their ancient Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and long before the Reformation, had made great progress in the Restauration of Learning. They had all along brought up their Novices in Learning; every Great Monastery having for that purpose a peculiar Colledge in one of the Universities; and even to the time of their Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, they continued to bring up great numbers of Children at School at their own Charge for the Service of the Church: and immediately before the Reformation, many of the great Monasteries were so many Nurseries of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62181:12"/>
and the Superiors of them very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselves, and Promoters of Learning in others. Such were <hi>Kidderminster</hi> Abbot of <hi>Winchelcomb, Goldwell</hi> Prior of <hi>Canterbury, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Austins, Wells</hi> Prior of <hi>Ely, Holbeach</hi> Prior of <hi>Worcester, Islip</hi> Abbot of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, Webbe</hi> Prior of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I do not hereby Apologize for the Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Monks in the middle Ages; but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that both in the time of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and some time after, and immediately before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they deserved a contrary Character to what the Historian giveth of them; and that even in the worst times, they were far from being Enemies, and Opposers of Learning; as he would have it believed.</p>

In the Preface the Author giveth several Specimens of his Translation of many difficult places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62181:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which agree not with <hi>Wickliff's,</hi> but with the other Translation.

I will not therefore scruple to set down the Testimonies of two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Witnesses, who lived at that time; and could not but know the truth of the whole matter. The first is of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> of whom the Historian himself giveth this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 95.</note> Cornelius Agrippa, <hi>a man very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for great and curious Learning, and so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the Kings Cause, that he gave it out that the thing was clear and indisputable, for which he was afterwards hardly used by the Emperor, and died in Prison.</hi> If this Great Person then had any partiality in this Cause, it lay on the side of the King: yet in one of his Books he hath these words. <hi>Sed &amp; quis credidisset Theologos in rebus fidei &amp; conscientiae, non solum amore odio, invidia perverti, sed nonnunquam etiam flecti con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viviis, &amp; muneribus abduci a vero; nisi ipsi illius sceleris fidem fecissent in Anglicani Matrimonii damnatione? Who would have believed, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in matters of Faith, and Conscience are not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62181:14"/>
only perverted by Love, Hatred, or Envy, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometimes bribed by Banquets, or drawn from the truth by Gifts, unless themselves had given e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Proof of this Vileness, in condemning the Marriage of the King of</hi> England. The other is Mr. <hi>Cavendish</hi> an honest, plain Gentleman, first a Servant of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> afterwards highly obliged by King <hi>Henry.</hi> He in writing the <hi>Life</hi> of his Master the Cardinal,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> giveth this account of the whole matter. <hi>It was thought very expedient, that the King should send out his Commissioners into all Universities in</hi> Christendom, <hi>there to have this Case argued substantially, and to bring with them from thence every Definition of their Opinions of the same, under the Seal of the University. And thereupon divers Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were presently appointed for this Design. So some were sent to</hi> Cambridge, <hi>some to</hi> Oxford, <hi>some to</hi> Lovain, <hi>others to</hi> Paris, <hi>some to</hi> Orleance, <hi>others to</hi> Padua: <hi>all at the proper Costs and Charge of the King, which in the whole amounted to a great Summ of Money. And all went out of this Realm, besides the Charge of the Embassage to those famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Persons of all the Universities; especially such as bare the Rule, or had the Custody of the University Seals, were fed by the Commissioners with such great Summs of Money, that they did easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to their Requests, and grant their Desires.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62181:15"/>
did by Provisions; Bulls, and other Arts of that See, dispose of Bishopricks, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, and lesser Benefices, to Foreigners, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and others that did not live in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>This is a very wide mistake: For the Popes did not then dispose of Bishopricks, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, to Foreigners, Cardinals, and others that did not live in <hi>England.</hi> The Popes did not give any Bishoprick of <hi>England,</hi> to any Foreigner that did not live therein, till about Thirty years before the Reformation; when it was not done without the Kings good liking, and in Vertue of some secret compact between them. As for Abbeys, from the first Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Dissolution, the Popes never gave any one to a Foreigner, not residing. For Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Abbots, there never was any besides Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> and of him it is well known, that he had his Abbey from the gift of the King, and lived in <hi>England.</hi> The matter therefore complained of in the Preamble of the Act of Parliament, 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. which the Historian inserteth, was this: That whereas, Bishops and Abbots ought to be Elected by their several Chapters, and Convents, and these Elections to be confirmed by the King; the Popes had taken upon them to Annul the Elections of Chapters, and then to substitute whomsoever themselves pleased, without a new Election; or to dispose of them without expecting any Election (yet still none of these were granted to Cardinals, or to Foreigners, not residing in <hi>England.</hi>) And whereas the Popes had usurped
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62181:15"/>
the Presentation of, and given to Aliens, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not residing, other Benefices, as Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Prebends, and Parsonages, which ought of right to belong to their proper Patrons; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Encroachments, a Remedy was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired and provided in this Act. Several Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners had a little before this time been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Bishopricks, such as <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury, Adomarus de Lesignan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester, Petrus de Aqua-blanca</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford.</hi> But these came in by the Election of their several Chapters, overawed thereto by the Power and Authority of King <hi>Henry</hi> III, to whose Queen they were related by near Kindred, and after all resided upon their Sees, unless when diverted by Employment in the business of the King or Church. But as for Deanries, Prebends, and Parsonages, the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Popes in the disposal of them was intollerable. These they granted to Cardinals and other Aliens, not residing, without all Shame. Insomuch, as I remember to have seen an Epistle of the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> to the Pope, wrote about that time; wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, that the Advowson of his Benefices was taken from him by Papal Provisions, he sends to him a List of all the Prebends, and Prebendaries of his Church of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and adding to the name of every one by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of what Bishop, or by the Provision of what Pope they obtained their several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, demonstrates that more of the then Prebendaries, had come in by Papal Provision, than by the Presentation of the Bishop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Patron: that so, if possible, he might shame
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62181:16"/>
the Pope out of the like Usurpation for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor was the case of other Churches, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of <hi>York</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> unlike at this time.</p>

               <p>The History of the proceedings between Pope <hi>Martin</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Chichley</hi> in the matter of Provisoes would have been very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable had not the Historian marred all for want of a little Chronology. He hath here disposed matters in a fair Historical series. But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62181:17"/>
most unhappily those two Letters which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to have been wrote at so great a distance of time from each other (I mean the first and last of those here mentioned) were wrote within very few days of each other. This with a little care might easily have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For the 8<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> in the tenth year of the Popedom of <hi>Martin,</hi> falls into the year 1426. By this mistake the whole contexture of this narration is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. But farther, both these Letters were wrote upon the same day: And the Historian in transcribing the Popes first Letter to the Archbishop, (which he hath published in the <hi>Collection of Records Pag.</hi> 98. hath given a false date of it. For whereas it is truly dated <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Id. December.</hi> He hath changed this into <hi>quinto die December.</hi> The other Letter also which he saith to have been wrote the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> is in the Manuscript Copy dated as the former, <hi>quinto Id. Decembr. anno Pontificatus nostri decimo</hi> viz. 1427. <hi>December</hi> 9.</p>

considered the Constitution of the two Houses of Convocation; and in none of our Records have I been able to discover, of what Persons they were made up in the time of Popery: and therefore since we are left to conjecture, I shall offer mine to the learned Reader. It is that none sate in the lower House, but those who were deputed by the inferior Clergy; and that Bishops, Abbots, mitred and not mitred, and Priors, Deans and Archdeacons, sate then in the upper House of Convocation. To which I am induced by these Reasons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> compleated only the first Volume of his Councils which reacheth to the Conquest. Therein he had no opportunity to treat of this matter. For we do not inquire of the Constitution of Convocations in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, but in the time immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the Reformation. As for the second Volume of Councils, which reacheth from the Conquest to the Reformation, the Collection of it was only begun by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> but compleated and published by others, without any tollerable Care or Skill. No doubt Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> knew very well the Constitution of our Convocations before the Reformation, and so do all inquisitive Persons of our Nation; however the Historian may think a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very herein to be necessary, to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Learned Reader.</hi> If he knew it not, he may be excused, as a Foreigner: Or if in none of our Records he were able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, that also may be excused. For neither
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62181:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are all our Records kept at the <hi>Rolls,</hi> nor did the multiplicity of business permit the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to attend long to the search of them; but that he should proceed to offer his Conjecture, and such a Conjecture, as, if he had industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sought to do it, he could not have made one more Erroneous. We cannot but wonder since he had sufficient means of better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Mr. <hi>Fulman</hi> hath observed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>in Addend. p.</hi> 413.</note> that the Conjecture here proposed by the Historian, doth not agree with what he had before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that <hi>Pole</hi> as Dean of <hi>Exeter</hi> was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the lower House of Convocation. This demonstrates the Error of the Historian, but doth not Correct it. It may be Corrected, and the truth of the whole matter fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the Subscriptions of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation held in the Year 1536. published by the Historian himself in the <hi>Addenda</hi> of this first part of his History:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 315.</note> wherein all the Members of the upper House subscribe apart; and then all the Members of the lower House subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by themselves. The Instrument of their Subscription is an Original, (which I did many years since transcribe) and may be infallibly relyed on.</p>
               <p>Therein it appears, that the Bishops, Abbots and Priors, constituted the upper House; and that all Deans, Archdeacons, Proctors of Clergy, and Chapters of Cathedral Churches, sate in the lower House of Convocation. The Historian himself there summeth up all the Members of the lower House,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 316.</note> who then subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this manner; 24 Archdeacons, 4 Deans of Cathedrals, three Deans of Collegiate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62181:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churches, 17 Procurators for the Clergy, and one Master of a College, (<hi>viz.</hi> Provost of a Collegiate Church.) Such an Error could not easily have been committed by so accurate an Author, after he had seen and published such an Instrument; if himself had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed so much as to read the Records, which he hath published in his <hi>Collections,</hi> and not left them to be perused and transcribed by some Under-workmen. I should have thought that he saw not this Instrument, until he had Composed and Printed of this part off the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; if he had pleased in his <hi>Addenda</hi> to have owned and amended a mistake of so great Consequence, or if in the Second part of his History,<note place="margin">P. 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.</note> he had not repeated and confirmed this his erroneous Conjecture touching the Constitution of our Convocations before the Reformation.</p>
               <p>If it should be suspected, that however it might be in the Convocation of the Year 1536, when the frequent and great Changes prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and accompanying it, might disorder and change the method and order before received, yet that it was otherwise in precedent times; I answer, that it might be undeniably demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Acts of many Convocations, for above 200 years before the Reformation, until that very time, that the Constitution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations was all along in this respect the same. For although the Registers of the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be lost; yet the Acts of many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and may be found elsewhere. I will give but one Proof of this, but that out of an Authentick Instrument. In the Convocation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62181:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
held in the Year 1462, the lower House want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a small Summ of ready Money for some slight occasion, resolved to raise it by imposing small Mulcts upon all the absent Members. To this purpose a List of the names of all the absent Members of the lower House was brought in, and they were these: the Deans of <hi>Sarum, Lincoln, Windsor, Wells, Chichester,</hi> the Archdeacons of <hi>Colchester, Winchester, Surry, Taunton, Dorset,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So then the Matter of Fact is put beyond all doubt; that all the Bishops, Abbots and Priors, sate in the upper House; all Deans, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and Proctors of the Clergy; in a word, all the Secular Clergy beneath Bishops, sate in the lower House of Convocation. But I will farther enquire, how it came to be setled in this method. It is notorious that for some time after the present Constitution of Parliaments, was introduced in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. great numbers of Abbots and Priors were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to Parliament by particular Writs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to every one. I will not now dispute, whether the second and third Estates, the Lords and Commons, then sate together: but most certain it is, that the <hi>Pares, Proceres &amp; Baronies Regni,</hi> were those who were summoned to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by particular Writs: At first, the King summoned by particular Writs all the Ecclesiasticks (<hi>viz.</hi> Bishops, Abbots and Priors) who received their Temporalities from the Crown. At least the King summoned as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as he pleased. Some Abbots and Priors were perhaps excused from attendance by reason of their Poverty. Thus <hi>Anno</hi> 49. <hi>H.</hi> 3.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62181:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there were summoned Abbots and Priors 102. <hi>Anno</hi> 35. <hi>Edward</hi> I. there were summoned 47. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1. <hi>E.</hi> II. there summoned 56. <hi>Anno.</hi> 4. <hi>E.</hi> III. there were summoned 33. Now all the Abbots and Priors, thus summoned by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Writs, sate <hi>inter Pares, Proceres &amp; Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Regni</hi>; and were held a part of the second, as well as of the first Estate of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in Parliament. They were a part of the first Estate as Ecclesiastical Prelates, and a part of the second Estate, as receiving their Temporalties, and holding their Baronies of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For such Abbots and Priors the King was wont to summon, as received their Temporalties from him. Afterwards in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. the number of Abbots and Priors summoned by particular Writs was much reduced; and so continued till the Reformation; only some of the greater Abbots being wont to be summoned. The number of them was never unalterably fixed, but received Addition, or Diminution even till the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. But from the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. till the Reformation, their number always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded twenty, and fell short of thirty. When the Kings therefore ceased to summon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the lesser Abbots and Priors, they lost their place in the second Estate of Parliament, but still continued to be summoned to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation by their several Bishops in obedience to the Mandate of the Archbishop, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to summon to Convocation, to be held at such a time all within their Diocess, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Right to sit therein: When these came up to Convocation, as many of them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62181:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Temporalties from the King, and had been wont formerly to be summoned by him <hi>inter Barones Regni,</hi> and to sit among them, claimed still their former place in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to sit with the Bishops, whether yet they sate in one House with the inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or whether they had by this time separated themselves into a distinct upper House, as most certainly they did afterwards. This Claim could not reasonably be denied to such Abbots and Priors, and this giveth a clear Account, how all such Abbots and Priors came to obtain a place in the upper House of Convocation.</p>
               <p>But the great difficulty consists in the Case of Priors of Cathedral Churches. For I find that some time before the Reformation, that they also sate in the upper House; although none of them received their Temporalties from the King, except the Prior of <hi>Coventry.</hi> They were of so great Account, that some of them had been summmoned by the King to Parliament, although they owed to him no such Service upon the account of their Temporalties, which they received not from him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prior of <hi>Norwich</hi> was summoned <hi>Anno</hi> 1293. but the Prior of <hi>Canterbury</hi> several times, as <hi>Anno</hi> 49. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Anno</hi> 35. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Anno</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>and in the Years,</hi> 1399, <hi>and</hi> 1401. This the King might do, either upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occasions with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to their Rights, or pretending to the immediate Superiority of their Temporalties; as he sometimes did, but was cast therein, and at length forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Claim. However, after the Year 1300, I find none of them summoned by the

King, but the Prior of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and him no more than these four times. But when these Priors came to Convocation, summoned by their Bishops, they could not but conceive some Indignation; that when so many Abbots and petty Priors sate in the upper House, themselves should be thrust down to the lower House, who in revenue and interest were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the greatest Abbots. So that no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they tryed all possible methods to raise themselves into the upper House, which they at last effected; at least some of them did. At what time, and by what Pretences they did effect it, I cannot certainly affirm. But I suppose, that whereas some of them had gained of the Pope, the priviledge of wearing the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Habit at solemn times, <hi>viz.</hi> Mitre, Pastoral Staff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and had thereupon assumed to themselves the name of <hi>Prelates</hi>; they claimed in vertue of that priviledge, and were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sit in Convocation among the Prelates: Or that whereas it was thought very indecent, that the Prior of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in whom the Arch-Episcopal Jurisdiction, during a vacancy, was invested, and by whom the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was summoned in that Case, should sit in the lower, and was thereupon removed to the upper House; his Example might facilitate Admission to the Priors of other Cathedrals, and open the way to them.</p>

               <p>This is not accurately said. The <hi>British</hi> Monks were subject not only to the Bishop of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> but to their several Bishops, in whose Diocesses they lived. Indeed after that the

Besides, that in this place he treateth of the ancient <hi>British</hi> Monks, which were before the Confusions of the <hi>Gothic</hi> Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> and before the times of <hi>Benedict</hi>; when the <hi>Britains</hi> were not driven into <hi>Wales,</hi> nor all their Bishops subjected to him of <hi>Caerleon.</hi> But there were at that time several other Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops in <hi>Britain,</hi> to whom the Bishops of their Provinces were as much subject; as the Bishops of the Province of <hi>Caerleon</hi> were to him.</p>

               <p>That this and all other Charters of Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Episcopal Jurisdiction, granted to Monasteries in <hi>England</hi> before the Conquest, were mere Forgeries, is an undoubted truth to all those who are not engaged by Interest to defend them.

them, and raise consequences from them, as if they were indubitably true.

               <p>Such high Figures of Rhetorick and Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Expressions are better reserved for Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, and do not well agree with History. The end of the eighth Century was the Year of our Lord 800, at which times very few Monasteries had been yet founded; nor had the Monks then in all appearance gained Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the hundredth part of the Riches of the Nation. Afterwards indeed they increased exceedingly in Number, Riches, and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62181:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
especially in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth Centuries; but after all, upon a just Account, they will not be found even in Title to have possessed above a fifth part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and considering that long before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they were wont to Lease out their Lands to Laymen, for easie Fines, and small Rents, as Bishops, and Deans, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now do; it may be truly said that they did not in reality possess the Tenth part of the Riches of the Nation. Then for that other Charge, that the best part of the Soil of the Nation being in such ill hands, it was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Nation to have it put to better uses, it is altogether Erroneous. From the beginning to the end, none ever improved their Lands and Possessions to better advantages, by Building, Cultivation, and all other methods, than the Monks did, while they kept them in their own hands: And when they Leased them out to others, it was the Interest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have such easie Tenures continued to great numbers of Persons who enjoyed them. To this may be added, that they contributed to the publick Charges of the Nation equally with the other Clergy; and the Clergy did always contribute in proportion above the Laity. So that we cannot find, to what better uses these Possessions have been since put; save only that inconsiderable part of them, which remains to Bishopricks, Cathedrals, and Schools, founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.</p>

               <p>If he speaks of the ancient times of Popery, it may be true.

Sermons wrote with his own hand, and preached at several times by him. All these Sermons could not be preached in Lent. After him we have the Examples of <hi>Bradley</hi> the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who died in the Year 1492. after he had spent many years in travelling about that Diocess, and Preaching in it: of Dr. <hi>Colet</hi> Dean of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly preached or expounded the Scriptures either in his own, or in some other Church of the City; of Dr. <hi>Collingwood</hi> Dean of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> who preached in that Cathedral every Sunday for many years together. The Practice seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to have been unfrequent long before this time, and in some places to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to all the Parish-Priests. For in the Constitutions of <hi>Iohn de Thoresby</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> made about the Year 1360. I found
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62181:33"/>
a Command to all the Parochial Clergy to preach frequently to their People, and explain to them the Articles of Faith in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue; and an Exhortation directed to the People, <hi>to here Goddys Service every Soneday with Reverence and Devocioun, and seye devowtly thy</hi> Pater-Noster, <hi>&amp;c. and here Goddys Lawe taught in thy Modyr Tonge.

For this he appealed to the Deposition of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi>; and desired the Marquess of <hi>Winchester,</hi> &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Buts,</hi> and some others, might be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Thus it appears what vulgar Errors pass upon the World.</p>

               <p>Here the Historian maketh great Ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own performance, imagining that he hath entirely overthrown the Credit of all our <hi>English</hi> Histories, and convicted the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a blind credulity. But we beg leave to put in our Exceptions. <hi>Maitland,</hi> as Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> might do well to urge any Argument tending to the Service of his Mistress, whether true or false. But what is allowable to a States-man herein, is not to an Historian. It is manifest, that <hi>Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was ill informed in one Circumstance; and if so, all the rest may be suspected, as being received from the same Authority. For he affirms Dr. <hi>Buts,</hi> the Kings Physician, to have been present at his Death; when the Stamp

was set to the Will.<note place="margin">

But King <hi>Henry</hi> died not till the 28th <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1546/7 (not 1547/8, as the Inscription under his Picture, prefixed to this History beareth.) So that the whole Story al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Maitland,</hi> may be as much <hi>a Forgery,</hi> as King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Will is by the Historian said to be.</p>

Any one who compareth his Transcript with the Original, would judge, that neither could he read the Subscriptions of the Secular Clergy of the lower House of Convocation.

                  </note> as Dr. <hi>Ryves</hi> hath fully proved; but the interposition of the Common Law would now hinder the execution of it. The Vicars then were not left to the pleasure of the Abbot or Religious House, to whom the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. But the Bishops endowed the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages with what proportion of Tithes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moluments they thought fit; in many places reserved to the Vicar one half of all manner of Tithes, and the whole Fees of all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sacramentals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in most places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to them, not some little part of, but all the Vicarage-tithes, and in other places appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them an annual pension of Money. In succeeding times when the first Endowments appeared too slender, they encreased them at their pleasure. Of all which our ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters and Records give abundant testimony. This was the case of all Vicarages. As for those impropriated Livings, which have now no settled Endowment, and are therefore called not Vicarages, but perpetual or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times arbitrary Curacies; they are such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed formerly to those Orders, who could serve the oure of them in their own persons, as the Canons Regular of the Order of St. <hi>Austin</hi>; which being afterwards devolved into the hands of Laymen, they hired poor Curates to serve them, at the cheapest rate they could, and still continue to doe so.</p>

For King <hi>William</hi> did not herein make any new Grant to King <hi>Henry,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62181:40"/>
but only confirmed and acknowledged the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Dependence and Subjection of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi>; nor did he then first subject the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> but engaged that hereafter they should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, <hi>as of right they ought to be, and had wont to be in the time of the former Kings of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been all along subject to the Archbishops of <hi>York</hi>; but having about Eleven years before this obtained an Exemption of this Jurisdiction by a Bull of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>; the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, that they should not claim the benefit of that Exemption, but be subject to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as formerly; and the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> also then present concurred with the King, and promised for themselves: although within a short time after they broke their Faith, and procured a new and fuller Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Pope; which <hi>Dempster</hi> placeth in the Year 1178. The Charter of King <hi>William</hi> before mentioned was made in 1175. But after all the Bishoprick of <hi>Galloway</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be subject unto the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> until towards the end of the Fifteenth Century, when it was by the Pope taken from <hi>York,</hi> and subjected to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> then newly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected into an Archbishoprick. Now, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Historian would invalidate the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Charter, insinuating that it may justly be suspected to have been forged by the Monks, because taken out of their Records, and coming out of their Custody; he may please to know, that this very Charter may be found entire in the Printed History of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62181:40"/>
                  <hi>Roger de Hoveden</hi>; who was no Monk, but a a Secular Clergy-man, a Domestick of this King <hi>Henry,</hi> attending him in all his Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the pretence of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their Letter written to the Pope <hi>Anno</hi> 1320. and published by the Historian; it is not to be wondered, if their minds being elated with unusual Success a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our unfortunate King <hi>Edward</hi> II. they enlarged their Pretences, and affected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which their Forefathers never pretended to, nor had themselves at any other time dared to arrogate. All the principal Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had in the Year 1291. made as ample and authentick an Instrument of the Subjection of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as could be conceived, before <hi>Edward</hi> had either Conquered, or invaded their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: which Instrument <hi>Tonstall</hi> taketh notice of in his Memorial; and this was indeed the most remarkable of all the Testimonies produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Tonstall</hi>; at least accounted by King <hi>Edward</hi> to be of so great moment, that he sent a Copy of it under the Great Seal, to every noted Abbey and Collegiate Church in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it might be safely preserved, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into their several Annals. It may be seen at length in the Printed History of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Westminster.</hi> Therein it may be observed, that it was subscribed by some of those very Noblemen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who subscribed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Pope, published by the Historian; who may be thought therein to have done no great Honour to his Countrey, by publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>When the Parliament was divided into two Houses, then the Clergy made likewise a Body of their own, and sate in Convocation, which was the third Estate— Whether ever the Clergy were a part of the House of Commons, is a just doubt.— Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, it is not certain, what was the Power or Right of these Proctors of the (inferior) Clergy in former times. Some are of opinion, that they were only Assistants to the Bishops, but had no voice in either House of Parliament.— But as the Clause <hi>Praemonentes</hi> in the Writ, seems to make them a part of the Parliament; so these Petitions suppose that they sate in the House of Commons anciently.— In a matter so perplexed and dark, I will presume to offer a Conjecture, which will not appear perhaps improbable. In the 129th Page of the former Part, I gave the Reasons that made me think the lower House of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation consisted at first only of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Clergy. It is generally believed that the whole Parliament sate together in one House before <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time; and then the inferiour Clergy were a a part of that without question. But when the Lords and Commons sate apart, the Clergy likewise sate in two Houses.— So that it seems to me most probable, that the Proctors of the Clergy were both
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62181:41"/>
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the lower House of Convocation.</p>

               <p>I will not here enter into an exact Enquiry concerning the ancient Constitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>England.</hi> A question, which hath already exercised so many Learned Pens, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dispatched in few words. I will only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that the Historian hath succeeded very ill in his Conjectures. In the first place it is a wide mistake to affirm, that after the Division of the Houses, and perfect Settlement of the Constitution of Parliament, the Convocation was the third Estate. For it was anciently accounted, and was really the first Estate. Then his Conjecture concerning the ancient Seat of the Proctors of the Clergy in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deduced with so much Labour, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny previous and concomitant Observations, is unhappily founded upon two false Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The first is, That formerly the lower House of Convocation consisted only of the Proctors of the Clergy. The contrary of this was fully proved in the preceding Papers; wherein it was shewn, that Deans also, and Archdeacons, did sit in the lower House of Convocation. The second false Supposition is, that until <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, the whole Parliament sate together in one House, and consequently that the several Estates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were then alike summoned by the Kings Writ. Now the contrary of this appears from an ancient Remonstrance of the Clergy in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the Year 1314. found in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Register, the summ and occasion of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62181:42"/>
which I will represent in few words. The King had issued out a Writ to <hi>Walter</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Die</hi> 27. <hi>Martii, Anno Regni Septimo,</hi> in this Form.—<hi>Vobis manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quatenus sitis in propriâ personâ vestrâ apud Westmonasterium in crastino Ascensionis Domini proximo futuro, coram fidelibus nostris ad hoc de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putandis, ad tractandum cum eisdem fidelibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris super competenti auxilio à Clero Provinciae vestrae Cant. nobis impendendo, pro utilitate Reipublicae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>prout in proximo Parliamento apud Westmonasterium habito, tam per Clerum, quàm per Communitatem regni nostri extitit concorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; &amp; prout per praedictos fideles nostros eritis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisiti. Et ad eundem diem venire faciatis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram dictis fidelibus nostris Suffraganeos vestros, Decanos, Abbates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; Clerum cujusque Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesis ejusdem Provinciae per duos Procuratores suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientes; ad tractandum &amp; consentiendum unà Vobiscum his quae in praemissis ibidem contigerit ordinari.</hi> In obedience to this Writ, (which is Entituled <hi>Litera de Convocatione Cleri apud Westm.</hi>) the Archbishop sent a Mandate to his Suffragans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in such Form, as repeating at length the Kings Writ, he subjoyned: <hi>Quocir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca vobis ten<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

From hence it appears, that the Clergy were even before this called immediately to Convocation by the Archbishops Writ; and that in the preceding Parliament the Clergy and <hi>Communitas Regni</hi> sate apart. But this is not all. When the Clergy met upon this Mandate of the Archbishop, they presented to him a Remonstrance, excepting against the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62181:42"/>
form of the King's Summons and his Mandate. <hi>Contra formam hujusmodi citationis Clerus Cant. Provinciae proposuit rationes subscriptas die Lunae in crastino S. Dunstani apud Westm. &amp;c. Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> That whereas the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had not been wont nor ought to be called by the King's Authority: This Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of the Archbishop proceeded in virtue of the King's command, as appeared by the Form thereof, which had never before been done. That if this Precedent were allowed without any Contradiction, the King might send out hereafter like Writs, to the great prejudice of the Church and Clergy. That the King might by the same reason summon them to meet at some place out of the Province, which would be prejudicial to the Clergy of the Province, and had been hitherto without Example. That they were herein summoned to meet at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, locum videlicet exemptum auctoritate Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarii, ad quem Clerus Cant. Provinciae ante haec tempora vocari nullatenus consuevisset.</hi> That whereas Laymen had nothing to doe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with Ecclesiastical causes and persons, this Writ summoned them to appear <hi>coram di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectis &amp; fidelibus Domini nostri Regis nullâ autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate ecclesiasticâ fulsitis,</hi> contrary to the usage of all former times. For these and many other Reasons, they desired that this Writ should be revoked, and themselves dismissed, and be summoned again in the usual and legal form. Accordingly they were dismissed on the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi> following, and were summoned by a new Mandate of the Archbishop dated <hi>Iune</hi> 6. in such Form as was wont to be heretofore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62181:43"/>
used, to meet at the Church of St. <hi>Pauls Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> on the 8th of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 6.</note> Which Form, <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis mutandis,</hi> agreeth exactly with the Form used immediately before the Reformation, and published by the Historian among the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the first Part. On the first day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> the same year the King summoned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliament to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the Octaves of <hi>Hilary,</hi> and directed a Writ to the Archbishop to summon the Clergy to meet <hi>dictis die &amp; loco:</hi> which the Archbishop did. When the Clergy were met, they protested against the Form of the Summons, because ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ad curiam Saecularem, puta Domini Regis Parliamentum, quod in camerâ ejusdem Domini fuit inchoatum</hi>; that this was contrary to the ancient Form, and that therefore they would not proceed to act, unless they might be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this should not be drawn into a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that for the future the old Form should be observed. Which assurance being given to them, the Clergy granted a Subsidy apart to the King, upon Conditions by them mentioned. From this it should appear, that before the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Provinces of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> were not held out of the several Provinces, and consequently that the Clergy of both did not meet together, and with the Laymen consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one Body in one House of Parliament; that the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were then summoned by Writs of the same Form as afterwards; that not the King, but the Archbishop, appointed the time and place; that they never sat at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62181:43"/>
other Estates of Parliament were at that time wont to sit; that they permitted not Laymen to entermeddle in their Consultations, but sate apart from them, and granted Subsidies apart; and all this, as themselves alledge, had been done, <hi>à tempore cujus memoria non existit.</hi>

               <p>As for Adulteries and Rapes (which the Historian insisteth on) it is charitably to be hoped, that they were not so frequent in the Clergy before the Reformation. But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62181:44"/>
Scandal arose by keeping Women in their Houses under the Name and Notion of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and being Licensed by their several Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to do it: which abuse obtained generally, and was practised openly, throughout the whole Western Church immediately before the Reformation. Yet in any case to cover the faults of the Clergy, and to excuse them where the cause admitteth any excuse, not only the respect due to the sacred Order, but common Justice also requireth. Had all these Women, thus generally entertained by the Clergy, been no other than their Concubines; it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have been inexcusable. But in truth, they were for the most part their Wives; whom they married secretly, and kept under the name of Concubines: since the Laws and Canons then received, forbad them to Marry openly, or to entertain Women under the name of Wives. This the Bishops very well knew: and from time to time gave them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes to do it, and tolerated them in it; not allowing them thereby to violate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws of Chastity, but only in secret to neglect the Ecclesiastical Laws of Celibacy. Now that this was the case of the Western Clergy, we are assured by <hi>Alvarus Pelagius,</hi>

And lest we should i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> in this practise to have Acted, either with less Wit or Conscience than the Clergy of other Nations; we find se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Constitutions of our latter Provincial Councils directed against the Clandestine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the Clergy.

But the most express Testimony, that can be desired herein, is given by Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi>; who publishing a large and accurate <hi>Defence of Priests Marriages,</hi> wrote by an Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Layman in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; hath towards the end of the Book, in some Copies of it, inserted ten Sheets of his own Composition, wherein he giveth a full and learned History of the Marriage and Celibacy of the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> from the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Christianity to the Reformation.

The Historian may here perhaps defend himself by alledging, that he doth not in this place propose his own arguments, but only the reasons upon which our Reformers proceeded in restoring Marriage to the Clergy. I do acknowledge, that these mistakes are found in most of their Writings concerning the Marriage of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy published at that time. But then we have just reason to complain, that it is injurious to the Honour of our Reformers to choose, from among so many irrefragable arguments and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities proposed and urged by them in this cause, such as are mistakes, or at least liable to exception.</p>

The like may be said of <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chicester,</hi> who in this same Page is affirmed to have been married. The false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Marriage seemeth to have arose, either from the hasty Inadvertency of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Writer, who first reported it; or from a double Error of the Press, substituting <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chicester</hi> instead of <hi>Robert (Peche)</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chester.</hi>

               <p>This mistake is wholly the Historians own.

Otherwise his Majesty was resolved to proceed against him as his Obstinacy and Contempt required. For the Declaration whereof, the Duke of</hi> Somerset, <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next day to repair unto him.</hi> June 10<hi>th. Report was made by the Duke of</hi> Somerset, <hi>and the rest sent to the Bishop of</hi> Winchester, <hi>that he desired to see the King's Book of Proceedings, upon the sight whereof he would make a full Answer; seeming to be willing in all things to conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thereunto, and promising that in case any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing offended his Conscience, he would open it to none but the Counsail. Whereupon it was agreed, that the Book should be sent him, to see his Answer, that his Case may be resolved on. And that for the mean time, he should have the Liberty of the Gallery and Garden in the</hi> Tower, <hi>when the Duke of</hi> Norfolk <hi>were absent.</hi> June 13<hi>th. the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the</hi> Tower, <hi>who before was appointed to deliver the King's Book to him, declared to the Counsail, that the Bishop having refused it, said unto him, He could make no direct Answer, unless he were at Liberty; and so being, he would say his Conscience. Whereupon the Lords, and others, that had been with him the other day, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62181:50"/>
to go to him again, to receive a direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; that the Counsail hereupon might determine further Order for him.</hi> July 8<hi>th the Bishop of</hi> Winchester'<hi>s Case was renewed.</hi> Then was the Lord Treasurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sent to him with the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, of which the Historian here speaketh.

Only hath erroneously put the 9th for the 8th of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Although he might mean, that the Commissioners went to him on that day: which seems to have been true. For on the 10th of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Commissioners reported his Answer in Council, related by <hi>Fox,</hi> and from him by the Historian.

mercifully handled; it was agreed, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Horse, and Mr. Secretary</hi> Petre <hi>should repair unto him again with the same Submission: exhorting him to look better upon it; and in case the words seem too sore, then to refer unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in what sort, and in what words he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise to submit him; that upon the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fault, the King's Highness might extend his mercy and liberality towards him, as it was determined.</hi> On the 13th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> his Answer was reported in Council, which was, <hi>That he stood precisely in Iustification of himself, that he had never offended the King's Majesty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he utterly refused to make any Submission at all. For the more surety of which Denial, it was agreed, that a new Book of Articles should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised; wherewith the said Master of the Horse, and Mr. Secretary, should repair to him again; and for the more Authentick proceeding with him, they to have with them a Divine and Temporal Lawyer, which were the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>and Mr.</hi> Goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.

But forasmuch as there were divers things required of him, which his Conscience would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62181:51"/>
not bear, therefore he prayed them to have him excused.</hi> Whereupon the Sentence of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration was read, and Denunciation of Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in case he did not conform within three Months. <hi>Nevertheless upon divers good Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and especially in hope he might within this time be yet reconciled, it was agreed, that the said Bishops House and Servants should be maintained in their present Estate, until the time of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation should expire; and the matter for the mean time to be kept private.</hi> There is some little difference between the Council-Book and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Journal, in fixing the days of these two Messages.</p>

between him and the Elect Bishop of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> upon certain Ceremonies belonging to the making of a Bishop, wherein their Lordships desire is, because they would in no wise the stirring up of Controversies between men of one Profession, did send for him, willing him to cease the occasions thereof; who humbly desired that he might for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his doings put in writing such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as moved him to be of the Opinion he held; which thing was granted, and was by their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships commanded to be at the Court on Sunday next, bringing with him, that he shall for an Answer have thought convenient <hi>1551. January 13th.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> Bishop Elect of <hi>Glocester,</hi> appeared before the Council touching his old Matter, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to wear such Apparel as other Bishops wear; and having been before commanded to keep his House, unless it were to go to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Bishops of <hi>Ely, London,</hi> or <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> for satisfaction or Counsail of his Conscience in that matter; nor further, neither to Preach, nor Read, until he had further License from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: it appeared both that he had not kept his House, and that he had also written and Printed a Book, wherein was contained matter that he should not have written. For the which, and for that also he persevered in his former Opinion of not wearing the Bishops Apparel, he was now committed to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Custody, either there to be reformed, or further to be punished as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of his case required. <hi>January 27th.</hi> Upon a Letter from the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> cannot be brought to any Conformity, but rather persevering in his Obstinacy, coveteth to prescribe Orders and necessary Laws of his head,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62181:52"/>
it was agreed, he should be committed to the Fleet upon the occasion aforesaid. A Letter to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Fleet, to receive the said Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> and to keep him from Conference of any Person, saving the Ministery of that House. <hi>On the 8th of</hi> March <hi>following he was consecrated. Now all this was done after the King's Letter wrote in his behalf to</hi> Cranmer; <hi>so that in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he was forced to reconcile his squeamish Conscience to the Episcopal Habit, in order to obtain his Bishoprick.</hi>

               <p>There being some mistakes in this Relation, I will amend them, and add some farther light to the account, out of the Council-Book. The Emperour's Embassadours pressed the Council 1551. <hi>Febr.</hi> 16. to observe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to him for permission to the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of the exercise of her Religion, till the King should come to age,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>March</hi> 18. The King relateth in his Journal, that he sent for her to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and told her he could not any longer bear her practise. Upon this next day the Emperour's Embassadour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red War to the King, if he continued not to her the liberty of her Religion. Thereupon <hi>Mar.</hi> 22. <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Poynet</hi> discoursed with the King about the lawfulness of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. And <hi>March</hi> 23. the Council decreed to send <hi>Wotton</hi> to the Emperour (who was not dispatched till the 10th. of <hi>April</hi>) and in the mean time to punish the offenders, first of the King's Servants that heard Mass, next of hers, <hi>March</hi> 24. Sir <hi>Anth. Brown,</hi> and Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Morgan</hi> were sent to the <hi>Fleet</hi> for hearing Mass. Thus King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Journal, which I have observed to be often false in the days, and especially in this place. For in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Book it is said <hi>March</hi> 18th. the <hi>Emperour's Embassadour had access to the Council.</hi> What was said by him, or answered to him doth not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62181:57"/>
appear; it being probable that for more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy the Clerk was then excluded, <hi>March</hi> 19. Serjeant <hi>Morgan</hi> was committed to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and <hi>March</hi> 22. Sir <hi>Anth. Brown</hi> for hearing Mass in her company, when by the King's order he attended her from <hi>Essex</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> Now all this, relating to the Emperour's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of War, to the King's Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Bishops, to the Councils debate thereon, and the sending of Dr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> is erroneously placed by the Historian before <hi>December</hi> 1550. It is also a mistake that the prosecution of the Chaplains kept from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1550, to <hi>May</hi> 1551. For it was not begun till <hi>December</hi> 15, and <hi>March</hi> 23. (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the King's Journal, I think rather the 18<hi>th.</hi>) it was resolved to punish her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hearing or saying Mass: Accordingly in the Council-Book, I find that <hi>March</hi> 22. her Comptroller Mr. <hi>Rochester</hi> was examined how many Chaplains she had, who answered, four, viz. <hi>Mallet, Hopton, Barker</hi> and <hi>Ricardes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 29. (the King's Journal saith falsly the 27<hi>th.</hi>) Dr. <hi>Mallet</hi> was brought before the Council, and <hi>being examined, what he meaned, that after he had been once forgiven, he would again wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offend the King's laws in saying of Mass, and other like, could not deny but he had done evil in so doing—He therefore was committed to the Tower.</hi> So that <hi>Mallet</hi> was now impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned for a second offence, not (as the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian saith) because he could not be before this apprehended since his first prosecution. <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> and <hi>Morgan,</hi> upon their submission were discharged from their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62181:58"/>
Nothing further was done in this matter till <hi>Aug.</hi> 9. when it was resolved in Council to send for the chief Officers of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s House, and to give them in charge not to permit Mass to be said in her House, or to hear it, and to give the same charge to her Chaplains and other Servants. The same day it was resolved not to permit the use of Mass to the Emperour's Ambassadour, since he would not permit the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in his Dominions the use of our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. So that now the Council began <hi>to be less in fear of the Emperour,</hi> not before the End of the last Year, as the Historian hath it. <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. a Warrant was signed for the appearance of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Officers. <hi>Aug.</hi> 14. there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Robert Rochester, Edward Malgrave,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Englefield,</hi> her three chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and were strictly charged, not to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the King's pleasure to her to have the new Service in her Family, and to give the like charge to her Chaplains and all her Servants, (as the Historian relateth) but only to charge the Chaplains not to say Mass in her House, or elsewhere, and the Servants not to hear it, and themselves to conform to the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to take care that the others did it. <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. (the King's Journal saith the 23d.) the Officers returning reported to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that having first related their Instructions to her Grace (which they had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do) she had absolutely forbidden them to deliver their charge to the Chaplains and Servants. They also brought with them a Letter wrote by her to the King, which I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62181:58"/>
have inserted in the following Collection. Upon which the Officers were (not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately sent to the Tower,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> as the Historian writeth, but) called before the Council next day, and reproved for not having executed their former Instructions, but <hi>troubling her Grace with the opening their Message to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Order and Charge prescribed to them; wherefore each of them by himself, and a part was commanded to return to her Graces House, and execute the said Charge apart, in such sort as the Order was given to them on the</hi> 14th. <hi>Aug. The which thing they all refused to do; albeit they were enjoined to do the same in vertue of their Allegiance.</hi> Thereupon they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend continually, till they should know the Councils farther pleasure. It was also decreed that the Lord Chancellour, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Petre,</hi> and Sir <hi>Anth. Wingfield</hi> should repair to the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> with a Letter from the King, and large Instructions from the Council, which were sent to them being then in <hi>Essex.</hi> The Letter I have put into the Collection. The Instructions contained a Command,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> to declare to her the King's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory resolution, not to permit to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer the use of the Mass, the reasons which induced the Council to send a Charge to her Chaplains and Houshold by her own Servants (which she had extremely resented) the negligence of her Officers in not executing that Charge, to justifie the King's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to her, and lastly calling her Chaplains and Servants before them, to charge them strictly not to say or hear Mass. <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62181:59"/>
Commissioners being returned, made report in Council of the Execution of their Charge, and of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Answer, whom they had attended on the 28th. The Report is large, the substance of which is rightly given by the Historian. When their Report was ended, an Order was made that <hi>Rochester, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefield</hi> and <hi>Walgrave</hi> should be conveyed from the <hi>Fleet,</hi> (to which they had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the day before) to the Tower: Next year on the 14<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> they were set at liberty, and commanded to return to their Lady, and attend her Service as she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested.</p>

For as much as for want of a Letter written by the said Bishop to</hi> Menvile, <hi>whereupon depended a great Trial of this matter, the Determination thereof was hitherto stayed, and the Bishop only commanded to keep his House, untill he should be called to further Answer; which Letter being lately come to light, found in a Cask of the Duke of</hi> Somersets <hi>after his last apprehension; the Bishop was now sent for, and this day made his appearance before the Lords, by whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged with this matter, and his own Letter produced against him, which he could not deny but to be of his own hand, and unable to make any further Answer thereto than he had done before by Writing, he was, for that the same seemed not a

sufficient Answer, committed by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>to abyde there,</hi> &amp;c. He had been accused by <hi>Menvile</hi> before 1550.<note place="margin">

to appear the day following, which he did, and being asked, what he said to the King's Letter, he answered, that <hi>he could not conform his Conscience to take down the Altars in the Church, and in lieu of them to set up Tables, as the Letter appointed, for that he seemed for his Opinion, the Scripture, and the Consent of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Fathers of the Church, and contrariwise did not perceive any strength in the Six Reasons, which were set forth by the Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>to persuade the taking down of Altars and Erection of Tables. And then being demanded, what Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures he had, he alledged a saying in</hi> Esay, <hi>which place being considered by the Archbishop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <hi>the Bishop of</hi> London's, <hi>and the Lords in the Council, was found of no purpose to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Opinion.</hi> Then the Archbishop and Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> argued the Lawfulness and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the thing, after which he was commanded by the Council to conform, which he still refusing, because contrary to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he was ordered to resort to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> to confer with them for satisfying his Conscience and to appear again the 4th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> When he then appeared, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he stuck to his former Resolution, and entred into a Dispute with the Archbishop about the merits of the Cause, and alledged the former place out of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> and a place out of the last Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Which the Archbishop and Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and shew from <hi>Origen,</hi> that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church <hi>Christians</hi> had no Altars, and urged the necessity of reforming the abuses of Altars:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62181:62"/>
But <hi>touching the naming the Table an Altar, it was left indifferent to him, so to name it because anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers sometime call that Table an Altar.</hi> Notwithstanding the Bishop persevering in his Resolution, although he was now again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on his Allegiance to comply, the Council ordered him to appear again on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and then to give his final Answer. Which he did, and answered that <hi>plainly he could not do it saving his Conscience, and that he determined rather to lose all that ever he had.</hi> Hereupon two days more were given to him to deliberate. But on the 11th of <hi>December,</hi> persisting and praying them <hi>to do with him what they thought connevient, for he would never obey to do this thing; thinking it a less evil to suffer the Body to perish, than to corrupt the Soul, he was</hi> committed to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> On the 9th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1551. an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was sent to the Warden of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> to suffer the Bishop of <hi>Chichester to have such number to attend on him, and to be ordered at those who attend on the Bishop of</hi> Worcester.

                     <p>This Year 1552. <hi>Heath</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> was put out of his Bishoprick. He had been put in Prison for refusing to Consent to the Book of Ordinations. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deprived.</p>

Nicholas <hi>Bishop of</hi> Worcester <hi>was sent for, to whom was repeated the Cause of his Imprisonment to be for that he refused to subscribe to the Book devised for the form of making Bishops, Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, being authorized by Parliament. At the time of which refusal, being not only gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to subscribe, but also being manifestly taught by divers other Learned men, that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Book were good and true, and that the Book was expedient and allowable; the said Bishop declared himself to be a very obstinate Man, and for that his doing it was now shewed to him, that he deserved longer Imprisonment. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless he was now offered to recover the Kings favour, if he would subscribe to the Book.</hi> He
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62181:63"/>
answered, <hi>Confessing he took the Cause of his Imprisonment to be as was alledged, and that also he was very gently used, rather like a Son than a Subject. Nevertheless that he remained in the same mind, not willing to subscribe it, although he would not disobey it: And although he was reasoned withall by every of the said Council</hi> (there were present only Six Laymen) <hi>in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his manner of Answer; being every thing in the said Book true and good, and being devised by Eleven other Learned men, to the which he was joyned as the Twelfth, and received of all the Realm; agreeing also that he would obey it, but not subscribe it, which contained a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Reason. Yet he still refused to subscribe it. Whereupon he was offered to have Conference with Learned men, and to have time to consider the matter better:</hi> Whereunto he said, <hi>That he could have no better Conference than he had heretofore, and well might he have time, but of other mind he thought never to be. Adding, that there be many other things, whereunto he would not Consent, as to take down Altars, and set up Tables.</hi> He was then expresly charged to subscribe before <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following, before the 24th of <hi>September,</hi> upon pain of Deprivation. Next follow the Orders of the 24th of <hi>October</hi> 1551, and 15th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1552. related in the preceding Article. King <hi>Edward</hi> in his Journal noteth, that he was deprived for Contempt 1551. <hi>October</hi> 5. The Register of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> affirmeth him to have been deprived 1551. <hi>October</hi> 10. which is chiefly to be relied on, as being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with which also <hi>Stow</hi> agreeth, adding that the same day he was committed to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> He

               <p>The Historian would have obliged us, if he had pleased to acquaint us by what Authority all this was done.

1552. be called Bishop Elect only in respect of <hi>Worcester.</hi> Nor could he now be charged with First-fruits, and Tenths, on any other Account, than of the Temporalties of <hi>Worcester</hi> newly received by him. Nor could he have passed away any of the Lands of <hi>Worcester</hi> to the King, if he had not once Possession of them. But to put the matter past all Dispute: I will alledge an Order of Council fully proving, that <hi>Hooper</hi> did enjoy the Revenue of <hi>Worcester.</hi> For 1552. <hi>September</hi> 24. the Council directed <hi>a Letter to the Dean of</hi> Worcester, <hi>to cause the Rent-Corn of the Bishoprick to be reserved to the Bishop, notwithstanding</hi> Hethe<hi>'s Claim to the same.</hi>

               <p>I fear that <hi>Holgate</hi> by his imprudent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if not by worse Actions, had brought a Scandal on the Reformation.

For in the Council-Book of King <hi>Edward,</hi> I find this Order made on the 23d. of <hi>November,</hi> 1551. <hi>A Letter to the Archbishop of</hi> York, <hi>to stay his coming up hither till the Parliament.

To represent only the laudable Actions of men, is to write an Elogy, or Apology, or Panegyrick, or whatever other Name it may assume, the name of History it ought not to claim. And after all such Scandals (if indeed this were justly so) are no more prejudicial to the Honour of

               <p>This, if true, would be a matter of great moment, and make a considerable change in the History of our Church. But really it is a meer Fiction.

                     <p>Thus were seven Bishops all at a Dash turned out (in the Year 1554.) It was much censured, that there having been Laws made, allowing Marriage to the Clergy, the Queen should by her own Authority, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing those Laws, turn out Bishops for things that had been so well warranted by Law.—And even the severest Popes, who had pressed the Celibate most, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before they proceeded to deprive any Priests for Marriage, left it to their Choice, whether they would quit their Wives or their Benefices.</p>

               <p>In the Commissions given by the Queen for the Deprivation of these Bishops, and related by the Historian; it is ordered to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Four of them only for Marriage (<hi>viz. York,</hi> St. <hi>Davids, Chester,</hi> and <hi>Bristol</hi>) but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other Three (<hi>viz. Lincoln, Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi>) for other pretended misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors. Now in aggravating the Queens injustice, in depriving them Summarily for their Marriage; the Historian plainly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Case. For they were not ordered to be deprived simply for their Marriage, but for having broken their Vows of perpetual Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and having married after a solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Chastity. This the Historian might have observed from the very Commission for the Deprivation of the Four first (published by himself) the words whereof are these. <hi>Quia comperimus Robertum, Archiepiscopum Ebor. Robertum Menev. Iohannem Cester. &amp; Paulum
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62181:70"/>
Brostol. post expressam professione in castitatis, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressè, ritè, &amp; legitimè emissam, cum quibusdam mulieribus nuptias de facto, cum de jure non debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, contraxisse.</hi> The Secular Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had never indeed made any Profession of Chastity at their Ordination. But that all the Regulars did, is notorious. And however the severest Popes had, before they proceeded to deprive any Secular Priests for Marriage, left it to their Choice, whether they would quit their Wives or their Benefices; yet no such favour was ever allowed to the Regular Priests who had contracted Marriage, but their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was accounted an heinous Crime, by reason of the Violation of their Vow included in it. It may be therefore observed, that the Queen giving Commissions at the same time, for the Deprivation of the Four first, and of the Three last Bishops, ordereth the former to be deprived for their Marriage, the later for their pretended misdemeanors, having taken Grants of their Bishopricks from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth with this Clause, <hi>quamdiu bene se ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serint,</hi> although two of the Three later Bishops were married, and all the Four former Bishops had taken Patents from King <hi>Edward</hi> with the like Clause. The reason of this diversity of proceeding was because the first Four were Regulars, and the other Three were Seculars. That the later were Seculars is well known: and of the others <hi>Holgate</hi> of <hi>York</hi> had been Provincial of the Order of St. <hi>Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pringham, Ferrar</hi> of St. <hi>Davids</hi> had been a Canon Regular of the Order of St. <hi>Augustin, Bush</hi> of <hi>Bristol</hi> had been Provincial of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62181:71"/>
of <hi>Bon-hommes, Bird</hi> of <hi>Chester</hi> had been Provincial of the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> Of the three Secular Bishops (viz. <hi>Lincoln, Glocester</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) the two later were indeed married, but of that the Queen taketh no notice in her Commission for their Deprivation; although their Ecclesiastical Judges in depriving them, thought fit to alledge their Marriage, as one Cause of their Deprivation, not in Vertue of the Queens Commission but of the Canon-Law, which upon repeal of the Statutes for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Clergy, recovered its former force in this Case.</p>

                     <p>The Clergy were now fallen on for their Marriages. <hi>Parker</hi> estimates it, that there were now about 16000 Clergymen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and of those 12000 were turned out upon this Account.

               <p>The Historian would have obliged us, if he had pleased to acquaint us, in what Book or Writing <hi>Parker</hi> hath delivered this Account.

                  <hi>Is thus the Honour of the Clergy preserved, to drive out so many, twelve of Sixteen thousand (as some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maketh his Accompt) to so great a Peril of getting their Livings, and this just at the Point of Harvest?</hi> Here it may be easily observed, that this Author will by no means vouch for the Truth of this Computation. It would in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62181:74"/>
truth be a very extraordinary matter, if 12000 Clergymen should have married between the end of the year 1548, and the middle of 1553. I cannot affirm of my own knowledge that the account is extravagantly false, but am very apt to believe it. And in this belief I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; for that having had the Curiosity to compute how many Clergymen were deprived for Marriage in this Reign, in the Diocess and Peculiars of the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I found the proportion far short of this account. For whereas there are contained therein about 380 Benefices, and other Ecclesiastical Promotions, no more than 73 Clergymen therein were then deprived for Marriage, or any other Cause; which far from the proportion of 12 to 16, scarce bears the proportion of 3 to 16. Yet <hi>Thornden</hi> and <hi>Harpsfield</hi> were as vigorous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the married Clergy of that Diocess, as any Zealots in any part of <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.269.</note> As for the severe and unjust proceedings against some of the married Clergy, related by the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; the Author before mentioned attesteth the same thing.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 5.</note> But when the Historian saith, <hi>they were all summarily deprived,</hi> I fear this is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his own. For this Author on the contrary saith, that a years time was allowed to the Clergy <hi>to abjure their heresy, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Wives:</hi> although in some places their enemies were so zealous, that they dispossessed many of them before the year expired. The first deprivation, which I find to have been made on this account, was in the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by <hi>Thornden</hi> then Vice-Dean: who on the 16th of <hi>March</hi> 1554, deprived six Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62181:74"/>
(one of them the Archbishops Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Archdeacon also,) six Preachers, and two minor Canons of that Church. In the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Vacancy may be found many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses against, and Deprivations of married Clergymen; from whence it appears plainly, that the usual forms of proceeding were, at least in many Cases observed, and that all were not <hi>summarily</hi> deprived.</p>

                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>It is true that the Secular Clergymen had made no Vow. But it cannot be denied that as many of the Clergy, as had formerly been Regulars, had made solemn and express Vows. Now the Number of these was very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among the beneficed Clergy of that time; by reason that all Priests who had been ejected out of Religious Houses, were enabled to hold Benefices; and that the King also, and other Patrons did more readily give Benefices to them, that so by that means they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves from the obligation of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Annual Pensions any longer to them. These therefore were all forced to leave their Wives, unless they evaded it by any base com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, by Connivance, or by the Favour of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62181:75"/>
any great Person. But that any of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were forced to leave their Wives, I do no where find. Indeed it was necessary to all, who would continue in their Benefices, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Wives; but we now speak of those Clergymen, who had been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Benefices. Against many of them Processes were formed for their Marriage, which may be found in the Register often made; but therein I cannot find any beside Regulars, to have been deprived by the Sentence of the Court, or their Marriages to have been annulled. And accordingly in the Articles of Enquiry or Interrogatories to be administred to every married Clergyman, formed in <hi>March</hi> 1554.

               <p>I cannot sufficiently admire, that any learned Man should commit so great a Mistake. None, conversant in the History of the Church, can be ignorant, that the Custom of sending Palls from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Archbishops owning any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon that See, or Relation to it, began many hundred years before Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> the Second. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the First had sent a Pall to <hi>Augustin,</hi> the first Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and all the Archbishops from him to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation did singly receive Palls from <hi>Rome,</hi> if sudden Death did not prevent them before the Reception. In like manner all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Archbishops of <hi>York</hi> from the beginning (if we except two or three, who for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son claimed not Archiepiscopal Priviledges) received their Palls from thence; and so also all the Archbishops of the Western-Church,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62181:79"/>
which held any Communication with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> When they were first sent to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and for several Ages after, no Oath of Obedience to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was exacted at the Delivery of them. Thus the Historian is found to have erred in fixing the time of their beginning, and in affixing a constant Oath to them. But farther he hath widely mistaken the Design of them: which was not to constitute those, who received them, <hi>Legati Nati,</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if that were true, all the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> from the first Foundation of the See, almost all the Archbishops of <hi>York,</hi> and the other Archbishops of the Western Church, would have been <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati Nati</hi> to the Pope: whereas in truth, the Number of <hi>Legati Nati</hi> in Christendom is very small, not exceeding four or five; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops of <hi>York</hi> never were <hi>Legati Nati,</hi> nor the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> till about the Year 1200. When Archbishop <hi>Herbert</hi> first obtained that Priviledge to himself and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Lastly, whereas the Historian maketh the Archbishop of <hi>Gnesna</hi> to have been one of the first, to whom the Title and Priviledge of <hi>Legatus Natus</hi> was conferred, and that by Pope <hi>Paschal:</hi> the contrary of it is so far true, that <hi>Andreas Olzowski</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Gnesna</hi> in his Letter wrote to Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Year 1675.

                     <p>It doth not appear, how soon after the Dissolution of the Parlament (dissolved 1559, <hi>May</hi> 8.) the Oath of Supremacy was put to them (the Clergy and Bishops.) For the last Collation <hi>Bonner</hi> gave of any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was on the 6th of <hi>May</hi> this Year.</p>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:62181:80"/>It cannot be imagined, that <hi>Bonner</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived before the Dissolution of the Parliament. On what days the several Bishops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were deprived, may be determined from the times of the Seisure of the Spiritualties of their Bishopricks made by the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; who then possessed and exercised the Archiepiscopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in the Vacancy of the See. These I will here present out of the Register of that Church. The Spiritualties of the See of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Edmund Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> were seized 1559, <hi>Iune</hi> 2.

(these two Bishops had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Tower on the 5th of <hi>April</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.) The Spiritualties of <hi>Ely,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Thomas Thirleby,</hi> 1559. <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Ralph Bayne,</hi> 1559. <hi>Iune</hi> 24 (he died before the end of the same Year.) The Spiritualties of <hi>Exeter,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Iames Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil,</hi> 1559. <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. Of <hi>Worcester,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Richard Pates,</hi> 1559. <hi>Iune</hi> 30. of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>David Pool,</hi> 1559. <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> void by the Deprivation of <hi>Thomas Goldwell,</hi> 1559. <hi>Iuly</hi> 15. When the See of <hi>York</hi> was first voided by the Deprivation of <hi>Heath,</hi> I shall relate hereafter. The certain times of the Deprivation of <hi>Tunstall</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> of <hi>Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and of <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find. In all 14 Bishops were deprived;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62181:81"/>
to whom may be added one Suffragan, <hi>viz. Pursglove</hi> of <hi>Hull.</hi> The whole Number of the Clergy deprived at this time, is thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a Romish Dissenter, Author of <hi>A sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere modest Defence of English Catholiques that suffer,</hi> &amp;c. Published in 1583. He saith that in <hi>England</hi> were deprived 14 Bishops, besides 3 Bishops Elect, the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> 4 Priors of Religious Houses, 12 Deans, 14 Archdeacons, above 60 Canons of Cathedral Churches, not so few as a 100 Priests of good Preferment, 15 Heads of Colledges in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and above 20 Proctours of divers Faculties therein. No great Number, to be deprived at a time of so great a Change in Religion. I am willing to believe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Authour to be exact; because I find it to be so in the Number of Bishops and Deans deprived. The 14 Bishops we have named already. The Names of the 12 Deans follow. <hi>Cole</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls, Stuarde</hi> of <hi>Winchester, Robertson</hi> of <hi>Durham, Ramridge</hi> of <hi>Lichfield, Goodman</hi> of <hi>Wells, Reynolds</hi> of <hi>Exeter, Harps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> of <hi>Norwich, Holland</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Daniel</hi> of <hi>Hereford, Salkel</hi> of <hi>Carlisle, Ioliff</hi> of <hi>Bristol, Boxal</hi> of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Windsor.</hi> Of the three Bishops Elect, who are said to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, I can recover the Names but of Two, Viz. <hi>Thomas Rainolds</hi> Elect of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wood.</hi>

               <p>THese are the Errors and Defects, which I have observed in this History. For my performance herein, I expect not either praise or thanks from the present Age; much less from the Historian: yet I thought it a Duty owing to Posterity, not to permit it to be led into mistakes in any thing, relating to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this Church, by Errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in an History published in our times, with Pomp, and seeming Authority. I do not suspect any Person to be so disingenuous, as to raise hence an Argument of my disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Reformation: or if any shall be so base, I shall slight the Calumny. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Church was begun and carried on with so much Piety, Wisdom, and fulness of due Authority; that a faithful and exact Account is the best Vindication, and Defence of it: nor should I ever have taken so much pains to rectifie the History, if I had not been fully persuaded of the Justice of it. If some favourable Passages in this History are by me disproved; the cause of our Reformation will not be really injured thereby, as not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Patronage of false or erroneous Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We were sufficiently able to defend the Justice of it, before any Forreigner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62181:85"/>
to deliver the History of it; and shall be so still, although the Reputation of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should suffer any Diminution.</p>
               <p>Lest it should be imagined, that I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this History so curiously, as to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the Errors and Defects of it, and to have left no room to after diligence, or the Enquiry of others; I do protest, that I never formed any Design of this nature until about a Month since. I have noted, what my Memory and present Collections suggested to me. But it may be easily observed, that I have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only that part of the History which is purely Ecclesiastical, and not all that. If any one should take the Pains to examine in like manner, the Civil History intermixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; it may be feared, that not a few Errors and Defects may be discovered in that part of it.</p>
               <p>In the last place, if the Historian, or any for him, shall ask why, in Compliance to his Desire, expressed in the Conclusion of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, I did not first Communicate the Papers to himself; I refer him for an Answer to the <hi>Athenae Oxonienses,</hi> par. 2. pag. 625.</p>

And I thynke that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as Canons and Rules made in this behalf, be neither universal nor everlastyng, but upon considerations may be altered and chaunged: therefore the Kinges Majestie and the hygher powers of the Churche may upon such reasons as shall move them take away the clogge of perpetual conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie from Priestes, and graunt that it may be lawfull to such as cannot, or wyll not containe, to mary one Wyfe, and yf she dye, then the said Prieste to mary no more, remaynyng styll in his ministration.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> Letter of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</head>
               <p>MY Duty most humbly remembred unto your Majesty, it may please the same to be advertised, that I have received by my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants your most honourable Letters, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof do not a little trouble me, and so much the more, for that any of my said Servants should move or attempt me in matters touching my Soul; which I think the meanest Subject within your Highnesses Realm could evil bear at their Servants hand; having for my part utterly refused heretofore to talk with them in such matters, and of all other persons least regarded them therein; to whom I have declared what I think, as she which trusted that your Majesty would have suffered me your poorest humble Sister and Bedeswoman to have used the accustomed Mass, which the King your Father and mine, with all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors did ever more use, wherein also I have been brought up from my Youthe, and thereunto my Conscience doth not only bynde me, which by no means will suffer me to think one thing and doe another; but also the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to the Emperour by your Majesties Council was an assurance to me, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I should not offend the Lawes, although they seem now to qualify and deny the thing. And at my last wayting upon your Majesty, I was so bold to declare my mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the same; and desired your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62181:91"/>
rather than you should constrayne me to leave the Masse, to take my Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto your Majesty made me a very gentle An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. And now I most humbly beseech your Highnesse to give me leave to write what I think touching your Majesties Letters. Indeed they be signed with your own hand, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse in my opinion not your Majesties in effect, because it is well known (as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have declared in the presence of your Highnesse) that although, our Lord be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, your Majestie hath farr more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and greater gifts than others of your years; yet it is not possible that your Highnesse can at these years be a Judge in matters in Religion. And therefore I take it that the matters in your Letters proceedeth from such as do with those things to take place, which be most agreeable to themselves; by whose (doings your Majestie not offended) I intend not to rule my conscience. And thus without molesting your Highnesse any further, I humbly beseech the same even for God's sake to bear with me as you have done, and not to think that by my doings or ensample any inconvenience might grow to your Majestie or your Realm. For I use it not after any such sort. Putting no doubt, but to time to come, whether I live or dye, your Majestie shall perceyve, that myne intent is grownded upon a trewe love towards you, whose Royal Estate I beseech Almighty God long to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; which is and shall be my dayly prayer according to my dewty. And after pardon craved of your Majestie for these rude and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62181:92"/>
bold Letters, if neither at my humble suit, nor for regard of the promise made to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, your Highnesse will suffer and bear with me, as ye have done, till your Majesty may be a Judge herein your self, and right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their proceedings (of which your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness yet I despair not) otherwise rather than to offend God and my Conscience, I offer my body at your will; and death shall be more welcome than life with a troubled conscience. Most humbly beseeching your Majestie to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my slownesse in answering your Letters. For my olde disease would not suffer me to write any sooner. And thus I pray Allmighty God to keep your Majestie in all vertue and honour, with good helth and long life, to his pleasure. From my poor house at <hi>Copped-Hall</hi> the XIX of <hi>August,</hi>

(tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Marriage with Queen <hi>Catherine.</hi>) After they were read and considered there, the Lord Chancellor on the 20th. of <hi>March</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did with other Lords go down to the House of Commons; and shewed the same to them.— The Matter was also brought before the Convocation, and they having weighed all that was said on both sides, seemed satisfied, that the Marriage was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and that the Bull (dispensing with it) was of no force; more not being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at that time.</p>

               <p>The Historian could not safely conclude, that no more was then required, because he could find no more. Much more was then required of, and done by, the Convocation in this affair. I have seen an authentick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their whole proceedings herein, drawn up by a Publick Notary at the King's command, and attested by the President and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Members of the Convocation, wherein this account is given. Two Questions were by the King propounded to the Convocation, to be dicussed and determined by them: The first, which was to be considered and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62181:102"/>
by the Divines of the Convocation, was conceived in these words: <hi>An ducere Uxorem, cognitam à Fratre, decedente sine prole, sit prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio juris divini, indispensabilis à Papâ?</hi> At the discussion and determination of this were present personally in the Convocation Divines 75, by Proxies 197, in all 272. The Names of all are inserted at length with great accuracy in the Instrument before mentioned. Of these 253 determined the Question in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and 19 only held the Negative. The second Question, which was to be considered and determined by the Professors of Law, (Canon, or Civil, or both) Members of the Convocation, was conceived thus: <hi>An carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eopula inter Illustrissimum Principem Arthurum &amp; Serenissimam Dominam Catherinam Reginam, ex propositis, exhibitis, deductis, &amp; allegatis, sit sufficienter probata?</hi> At the Examination and Decision of this Question were present perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Canonists and Civilians 44, by Proxy 3, in all 47. Of these 41 determined the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the Affirmative, and only 6 maintained the Negative.

                  <hi>Additament to</hi> Par. II. Sect. 76.</head>
               <p>I have there said, that besides the Speeches of <hi>Heath</hi> and <hi>Fecknam,</hi> made in the House of Lords against the Alteration of the Liturgy, (mentioned by the Historian) I had seen a Speech of <hi>Scot</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> made at the same time in the same Cause. Since that, I find, that the Historian hath also seen it, and giveth an Extract of it with the others: which, being by his Printers fault joyned to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>Heath</hi>'s Speech in the same continued Section, and only a few Syllables Intervening, I overlooked. But to make amends for this oversight, I will here correct several mistakes committed by the Historian in relating the Transactions of that Sessions of Parliament: which I am enabled to doe, having carefully perused the Journall of the House of Lords in that Session. The Historian saith, That the Bill concerning the New Service, was sent up by the Commons on the 18th of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Par. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 393.</note> and debated in the House of Lords (in which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the several Speeches, before mentioned, were made) and at length passed. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Lords Journall testifieth, That on <hi>Monday</hi> the 17th. of <hi>April</hi> the House of Lords sate, and after having read several Bills, was adjourned by the Lord Keeper to <hi>Wednesday, April</hi> 19th. So that on the 18th. the House sate not; and even on the 19th. <hi>nil actum,</hi> to use the words of the Journall, but was then adjourned to <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d. Then also <hi>nil actum,</hi> but was adjourned to <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 25th.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62181:103"/>
of <hi>April</hi>; on which day (and not before) this Bill was sent up from the Commons, with 8 other Bills. It was not immediately debated; but was read the first time on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 26th the second time on the 27. It was read the last time, and concluded, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 28th. It was debated on the two last days. <hi>Scot</hi> spoke his Speech on the last day, and therein undertook to Answer the Speech of a <hi>certain Nobleman,</hi> made in the House on the day before in favour of the Bill, wherein that Nobleman had reflected <hi>on the blindness of our Forefathers.</hi> From whence it appears to have been debated on the 27th. on which day I suppose <hi>Fecknam</hi> to have made his Speech. For he was not present in the House on the 28th. when the Bill was concluded. For the Historian mistaketh when he placeth the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Westminster</hi> among the Dissenters at the conclusion of the Bill; for the Journall hath not his Name. He hath also farther mistaken herein, in leaving out the Bishops of <hi>Landaff</hi> and <hi>Exeter:</hi> whom the Journall reports to have dissented with the rest there named. A like mistake is committed by him in relating the conclusion of the Act for the Restitution of the First-fruits and Tenths to the Crown. He saith, It was agreed to by the Lords on the 4th. of <hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 383.</note> the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>London, Worcester, Landaff, Litchfield, Exeter, Chester,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> protesting against it; but that the Bishops of <hi>Winchester, Ely,</hi> &amp;c. were then absent. Now the Journall of the Lords affirmeth, that the Bill was concluded, <hi>Dissentientibus Arch. Ebor. Episcopis London.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62181:104"/>
Winton. Wigorn. Landavan. Coven. &amp; Litch. Cestrien. &amp; Carliol. there being that day no more or other Lords Spiritual there present.</hi> So that indeed <hi>Winchester</hi> was there, and <hi>Exeter</hi> was not. But after all, the Bill was not now ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately concluded; but being sent back from the Commons with an Amendment, was read and agreed to in the Lords House on the 15th. of <hi>March</hi>; when dissented from it, besides the former Prelates, the Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Westminster:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 386.</note> but <hi>London</hi> was not then present. In the next place, whereas the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian relateth, That upon the ultimate read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conclusion of the Bill for the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, after it had been sent back by the Commons with an Amendment; <hi>it passed in the House of Lords with the same dissent,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when it was read on the 18th. of <hi>March,</hi> and sent down to the Commons, it is a mistake; for on the 22d of <hi>March,</hi> when it was ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately read and concluded, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Viscount <hi>Montacute,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> are not said in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to have dissented; all whom the Historian (therein agreeing with the Journall) maketh to have dissented on the 18th. Lastly, when the Historian, relating that the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> was absent at the passing of this Act:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 387.</note> 
                  <hi>For though he would not consent to it, yet having done all that was prescribed by it so often before, he thought it more decent to be absent, than either to consent to it or to oppose it:</hi> We cannot but except against his familiar Method of proposing such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures as assured matters of History, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them as peremptorily, as if he had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62181:104"/>
been of Councel to the several Persons. If for this reason the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> had absented at this time; he ought for the same Reason to have absented himself on the 26th. of <hi>April,</hi> when was read and concluded in the Lords House <hi>An Act Restoring to the Crown the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Iurisdiction over the State Ecclesiastical and Spiritual, and abolishing all Foreign Power Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the same,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> being then present, and with other Bishops, and Viscount <hi>Montague,</hi> and Abbot <hi>Fecknam,</hi> dissenting from it; as the Journall of the Lords testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</p>
