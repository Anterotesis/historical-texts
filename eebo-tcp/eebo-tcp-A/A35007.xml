            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Diſcovery of the</hi> ACCURSED THING <hi>in the Foxonian Quakers Camp Englarged.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Diſcovery, being before Printed, The <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers Accuſe me for falſe quoting <hi>G. Foxes</hi> words: Therefore to clear my ſelf, I think fit to Re-print it more at large, and leave it to the Judgment of the Impartial Reader whether or no theſe Quotations do not prove what I produce them for. I uſe the terms <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> becauſe I find our Lord moſtly Preach'd by that Name by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom our Lord after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſaid, (three times repeated) <hi>Feed my Sheep, and my Lambs.</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve St. <hi>Peter</hi> knew beſt how to Preach him; and this was the Food he fed them with, even Salvation by our Lord <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> as in the <hi>Acts.</hi> And he did not Preach him as a Chriſt in him, our Lord <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> or a Light in every Man: But directed to him, even the Perſon of our Lord <hi>Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> in Heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. Even him <hi>Whom the Heavens muſt receive till the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things,</hi> 3 <hi>Acts</hi> 21. And in the 1 <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 'tis ſaid, <hi>When he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, let all the Angels worſhip him.</hi> Now if this refer not to the Birth of our Lord Jeſus <hi>(who was made of a Woman made under the Law)</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> but to a Light in every Man, Then this Prophecy was not fulfilled at his Birth, but always was, and is a fulfilling to the World's end. And indeed their Printed Expreſſions imply as much, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Light in every Man is the Saviour. For one <hi>J. S.</hi> who doth own that <hi>Christ as God is in every Man—a ſpark of his Godhead-Light is in every Man. (But ſaith he) there is not that Redemption-Light which leads to the Father as a Father, reconciling ſinners to himſelf in Christ as Mediator, p.</hi> 52. <hi>R. Hubberthorn,</hi> in Anſwer to this Man, ſaith, <hi>It's Confuſion,</hi> and <hi>a Lye,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he hath no leſs than denyed the Lord that bought him,</hi> becauſe he terms their <hi>Light within, the perverſe Principle of their ſelf-adoring Light, R. H. p.</hi> And they do confound the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head being into one with the <hi>Spark or Ray of Light</hi> from him in every Man by applying all the Attributes of the Almighty to that Light in every Man, ſaying, <hi>As God is, ſo is his Light, R. Hubberthorn</hi>'s Works, <hi>p.</hi> 112. And it is not becauſe they ſay, <hi>Christ is the Light which enlighteneth every Man;</hi> or, <hi>That the Light in every Man is from Chriſt,</hi> that others do generally oppoſe <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> for. But for their over-valuing it, and giving our Lord's Titles thereto, and thereby they do degrade his Perſon; and in order thereto do they pervert the Scripture. For I think there is no Book in the Bible that does more ſully prove the Worth and Dignity of that Man or Perſon, <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> than the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth. And yet theſe Quakers do pervert ſome Expreſſions therein to Contemn his Perſon, as the 10 <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. The Apoſtle cites a Paſſage out of the <hi>ſalms, A Body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> from hence they take Advantage to term our Lord's Perſon, <hi>The, a, it,</hi> or <hi>that, prepared Body;</hi> ſo dividing him, <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> from Chriſt, as <hi>J. Cole, p.</hi> 329. denies <hi>him to be Saviour as he</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41408:2"/>
               <hi>was Man,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>J. N.</hi> who affirmed, That he was not <hi>Jeſus, or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as he was God, but as he was Man.</hi> Now I think <hi>J. N.</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Only as God.</hi> But I take <hi>J. N</hi>'s. words to be more ſound than <hi>J. C</hi>'s. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord Jeſus was God before, or without his being Man, yet he never was Man without the Divine Nature, or being God alſo; and <hi>J. C.</hi> ſeems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Manhood, and therewith his Sufferings and Blood. But <hi>J. N</hi>'s. Terms <hi>[as Man]</hi> does not exclude his Divine Nature, becauſe he never was Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Godhead or Divine Nature; but he was God before, or without being Man, and if as ſuch, he was the Saviour. (The Diſpute is not about his Power, or Ability, but about in what Capacity or Condition the Saviour of the World was a Saviour.) Now as God only he was not <hi>the promiſed Seed of the Woman,</hi> nor <hi>made of a Woman under the Law,</hi> nor had <hi>a Body to offer,</hi> or <hi>Blood to ſhed,</hi> nor <hi>laid wicked hands on,</hi> nor <hi>betrayed,</hi> nor <hi>murthered, hanged on a Tree, laid in the Sepulchre.</hi> But all theſe were propheſied of, and acted by and to our Lord Jeſus. <hi>And he ought to ſuffer thoſe things, and without Blood there was no Remiſſion.</hi> Therefore to me it ſeems more proper to ſay, <hi>He was Saviour as he was Man,</hi> than to deny it, as <hi>J. C.</hi> doth. But I find they all agree to degrade and contemn his Perſon. And as any Injury done to the Perſon of a Man affects the whole Man, Soul and Spirit, as well as Body; ſo doth their Contempts of our Lord's Perſon affect him wholly, as both God and Man inſeparable. And therefore was the wiping his Feet, and anointing his Body, ſo much by him taken notice of. And as <hi>J. C.</hi> hath, ſo doth <hi>W. Baily,</hi> by his diſtinctions in his Book, <hi>Deep to Deep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 25. He ſaith, <hi>Saith Chriſt, a Body haſt thou prepared me; mark the diſtinction</hi> (ſays <hi>W. B.) Thou, me, and a Body. This me, that ſpake in the Body, was the Christ, which had a Body prepared to do his will that prepared it. Now</hi> (ſays <hi>W. B.) was it the Body, or an inviſible Power that ſaid, A Body haſt thou prepared me?</hi> Now by his Term <hi>Body,</hi> he excludes the Perſon or Man, our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> from being Chriſt the Saviour, and makes him, as <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> doth, but <hi>a Garment, a Veſſel, or Body</hi> that Chriſt ſuffered in. But this <hi>him</hi> or <hi>me W. B.</hi> mentions, which, as he ſays, <hi>ſpoke in the Body, and was the Christ,</hi> the Jews could not <hi>lay wicked hands on, and hang on a Tree, and lay in a Sepulchre,</hi> all which was done to our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the Scriptures Preach as Chriſt the Saviour. But theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Doctrines imply them Scripture-Teſtimonies to and of him to be falſe. Alſo becauſe the Apoſtle ſays, 10 <hi>Heb.</hi> 20. <hi>Through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh,</hi> they take advantage to term him <hi>Vail;</hi> and theſe terms, <hi>a Veſſel, a Garment,</hi> they can coin to degrade him, although not in Scripture. And for that afore expreſſion, <hi>a Body,</hi> &amp;c. in the Margent it's ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt pierced mine Ears through.</hi> And for that term of <hi>a Vail,</hi> it's to ſhew, how that by that one Offering of himſelf, he purchaſed for us admiſſion to God through himſelf, as Mediator between God and Man, as he was the Man Chriſt Jeſus. And neither of thoſe terms, <hi>A Body,</hi> or <hi>the Vail,</hi> were uſed or intended by the Apoſtle to degrade his Perſon, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, to ſet forth his Dignity and Excellency. And the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Conſider how great this Man was.</hi> But theſe Quak<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

For, as <hi>G. K.</hi> well obſerved, our Lord ſaid, <hi>The Spirit he would ſend, ſhould Glorifie him.</hi> But theirs Contemn him, as farther appears; ſays <hi>W. Baily,</hi> p. 29. <hi>When he had the Body prepared, which he took up, and laid down, and took up without the Gates of Jeruſalem. This I grant</hi> (ſays <hi>W. B.) was a Perſonal coming, or the Godhead dwelt in that Perſon bodily.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 30. ſays <hi>W. B. He taught them to Pray, our Father, and not to look at his Perſon, and pray to his Perſon without them,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, the Godhead <hi>dwelleth</hi> as preſent, they ſay, <hi>dwelt</hi> as paſt. And the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they pierced. And he did ſhew them his hands and ſide, and bid them feel and handle him,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>A Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as I have.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> firſt Epiſtle, 1. Chap. 8 ver. Preach'd the ſame Chriſt without them, <hi>whom they did not, nor had not ſeen.</hi> Although theſe Quakers ſay, <hi>He did not bid them Pray, or look at his Perſon without them;</hi> but they do not prove where he ever forbid them, and unleſs they can prove there was, or is ſuch a Body or Perſon, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> without or diſtinct from the Divine Nature, their Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are vain at beſt. But it's too much the ſcope of their Books, to contemn his Perſon, under pretence of advancing his Divine Nature. For farther ſaith W. B. of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>which in proceſs of time was born of a Virgin, had a Body prepared to do the will of his Father, as it is at this day,</hi> ſays W. B. <hi>p.</hi> 20. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>That which may be known of God and Chriſt, which is one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is manifeſt in People, there he is, and is only to be found.</hi> Here you ſee they agree to degrade and contemn his Perſon from being the Saviour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to ſomething in themſelves. <hi>A Holy thing in People, there he is only to be found,</hi> ſay they, in their, or our <hi>prepared bodies.</hi> Allegorizing his Conception, and Birth, and Perſon, as but Figures and <hi>Facile Repreſentations</hi> of ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or to be acted in the Saints Bodies. But I do not find this Birth and Body W. B. mentions, propheſied of in the Scripture, as our Lord was; nor ſuch Joy in Heaven, as was at the Birth of our Lord, whom the Angels and Shepherds, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and all the Prophets from <hi>Samuel,</hi> propheſied of, and the Apoſtles Preach'd. And as a Man is not a Man without Soul, Spirit, and Body, no more was our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ever without his Divine Nature. And for farther Proof of their Contempt of him, ſee <hi>G. K's.</hi> Book, <hi>A True Copy of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>pag.</hi> 17. to the end, where <hi>S. Eagles,</hi> one of their Blaſphemous Brother Preachers, ſaying, <hi>The blood ſhed out of him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>after he was dead—was no more than the blood of another Saint.</hi> Is this all the preference you can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his Blood, and Himſelf, to be one or a Saint with your ſelves? And this doth <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> excuſe, which is Proof enough of their Contempt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Sufferings, and Blood; as alſo their now excuſing their Blaſphemy, <hi>The Jews never ſaw the World's Saviour,</hi> as in their Book, <hi>The Diſcoverer Diſcovered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 7. If there was no other Proof of their Contempt of his Perſon and Blood but this, it's enough.</p>
            <p>For as the Myſtery of Godlineſs was great, ſo is there a great Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or Antichriſt, deſcribed firſt <hi>Epiſt.</hi> St. <hi>John, 2d. Chap. He that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is Antichrist.</hi> This Spirit hath ſhewn it ſelf through many of the Chief Prieſts among theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers (as he did in their Fore-fathers the Jews) eſpecially in <hi>W. Bingley,</hi> whoſe Enmity was ſuch againſt Preaching the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41408:3"/>
Faith in our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> That he in a Publick Meeting hindered <hi>G. K.</hi> from Preaching; and as the Jews did by <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſo they gnaſh their Teeth on <hi>G. K. W. Bingley</hi> by interrupting him, and when himſelf had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, went out of the Meeting, bidding the People paſs away, as the Jews ſerved our Lord, who ſaid, <hi>He is mad, why hear ye him?</hi> And <hi>W: Pen</hi> hath done worſe by him at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> ſince, whereby they have proved their Spirit not to be the ſame that <hi>Paul</hi>'s was, who although <hi>ſome preach'd Chriſt out of Envy</hi> to him, yet <hi>becauſe Chriſt was preached, he rejoyced.</hi> But <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in theſe <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Perſecutors, is ſo far from Preaching <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth as the Saviour,</hi> that they are ſo bold as to Preach, <hi>That the Jews never ſaw the World's Saviour:</hi> As is teſtified in a Book, entituled, <hi>A Call,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>E. Burlin, from Penſilvania,</hi> p. 17, 18. And now alſo by them excuſed in their Book, entituled, <hi>The Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 7. ſaying, <hi>Though they ſaw the Man Jeſus—</hi>yet <hi>the Eyes of their minds were blinded,</hi> &amp;c. As if becauſe they ſaw him not to be the Saviour, therefore he was not ſo. But you ſay, <hi>He was both God and Man,</hi> but yet the Jews did not ſee him to be ſo; therefore by your Argument, becauſe they did not ſee him <hi>God and Man,</hi> he was not ſo. For they no more ſaw him to be <hi>God and Man,</hi> than they ſaw him to be the Saviour; and by your Doctrine either he was not the Saviour, or the Jews did not ſee him. For the difference is not about what the Jews ſaw him to be, but what he really was; and if this your Doctrine had been only to prove the blindneſs of the Jews, your excuſing it might have been born with: But being in Contempt of his Perſon, and contrary to the Scriptures, ought to be denyed. For our Lord ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and to the Man whom he cured, 9 <hi>John</hi> 36. <hi>Thou haſt both ſeen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</hi> And the 4 <hi>John</hi> 26. <hi>I that talk with thee am he.</hi> But theſe Quakers in Print ſay, in their Book, entituled, <hi>The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> p. 5. <hi>To ſay, that this Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, is a Lye.</hi> Theſe are ſo contemptible of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as being Chriſt and the Saviour, as the Scriptures declare him, that none that love him would utter or excuſe them, as theſe Quakers do: For it's no leſs than denying him to be the Saviour, and therein <hi>they deny the Lord that bought them, and trample his precious and ineſtimable Blood under foot.</hi> For the Jews did both <hi>ſee him,</hi> and handle him, and that <hi>with wicked hands too.</hi> Therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Lord's Command, go not after them, for although his Name be in their Mouths, yet he is not in their Hearts. That is, they do not mean him our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as will further appear, but ſomething that was in him, and the like in every Man. For, ſay they, <hi>The ſame Christ therein crucified aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> in a Book, entituled, <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine and Society of the Quakers cleared,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 5. Whereby it's plain they do not mean that Perſon our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> but ſomething in him, and themſelves, was and is Chriſt. And ſay they, <hi>The Apoſtle brought the Saints to hear, and ſee, and handle the Word of God; and they that will have fellowſhip with the Father, muſt ſee with their Eyes, and handle with their Hands,</hi> in their Book, entituled, <hi>The Saints and their Communion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15. But St. <hi>Peter, firſt Epiſt.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>v.</hi> ſaith of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love—Although now you ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce.</hi> Here St. <hi>Peter</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a Chriſt whom they had not, nor did not ſee, therefore ſurely they could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41408:3"/>
not handle him, as <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays. And although they falſly ſay, in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 8. That <hi>T. C.</hi> ſet St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> at variance; but <hi>T. C.</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not St. <hi>John,</hi> only ſhews how <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Doctrine oppoſed St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; and 'tis they who ſets them at variance, and not me, by falſly pretending St. <hi>John</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and <hi>G. F</hi>'s. to agree. But theſe Quakers Chriſt they Preach, being not the ſame with St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, but another, is Antichriſt. And they endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles (even our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth)</hi> in a Myſterious way; for they do not begin with the uppermoſt, or outer parts of the Chriſtian Building, becauſe then their Deſign would be too obvious. But this Myſtery of Iniquity works more ſecretly and dangerouſly, (for why is it termed Antichriſt, but becauſe it pretends to be Chriſt.) But its work is to undervalue and contemn <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> his Sufferings and Blood, and thereby make the Teſtimonies of moſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles to, and of him, in great part falſe Witneſſes, and his Sufferings, Blood, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel made void, and of no effect. And ſuch an open Gap, or great Road made for the cruel <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to excuſe themſelves, and Impeach or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Evangeliſts, that I am not only aſhamed, but aſtoniſhed to behold, how the Watchmen ſlumber, and mind not how theſe deceitful workers are lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Foundation than that on which the Holy Men were built upon. And although I have been a conſtant Hearer and Lover of them above Thirty Years, and by the love I had for ſome of them, enſnared in ſome of their Errors, and did not ſo fully ſee the danger thereof until lately, and moſtly by their oppoſing and contradicting <hi>G. K.</hi> and Perſecuting him and his Friends, greatly convinced me that they did not Preach the ſame Goſpel and Faith as the Apoſtles did. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Nor am I aſhamed to confeſs, my ſelf was not ſound in my Faith: But it was the Mercy of God to let me ſee my Error, and give me a mind to be more perfectly inſtructed therein: And I deſire the Lord, for the ſake of our dear Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to keep me under a due ſenſe of my Unworthineſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and humbly thankful for his great Mercy and Love, more eſpecially in giving his dear Son, who dyed for my Sins. And I earneſtly intreat all you Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who be honeſt minded, not to be obſtinate and high-conceited of your ſelves, rather than come under ſome blame or reproach: For I can by Experience tell you, that you will in the end find a better Peace in confeſſing than maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves in Error. Flatter not your ſelves that you have True Saving Faith, becauſe you do believe the Relation in Scripture concerning our Lord Jeſus: That he was, and ſuffered, as is recorded; and becauſe you believe he was a good Man, and had the Spirit of God in him, and in a greater meaſure than you have; and that whereas the Jews ſaid, <hi>He deceived the People,</hi> and that <hi>he did thoſe Mighty Works by the Power of Satan.</hi> You on the contrary, believe it was the Mighty Power of God in him that wrought. The Jews indeed ſeems to be more Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous againſt the Holy Ghoſt: But your Contempt of his Perſon, Blood and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, is Blaſphemy againſt the Son of Man at leaſt, and therefore a great Sin. But I ſay this of yours in the beſt ſenſe is but a bare belief of Chriſt, and is not True and Saving Faith in him, becauſe it is not fixt in him as the Foundation, and faſt-hold of your Souls for Salvation, but a Principle of Light within you. But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41408:4"/>
the True Saving Faith fixes in him, <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and his Sufferings, Blood, and Obedience, in becoming a Sacrifice or Paſſover for us: And the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the ſufficiency of the Object or Subject, and ſo relyance thereon, is Faith; and that which People moſt value or rely on, in that properly is their Faith ſixt: As the Jews profeſſed they believed in God, but would not believe in our Lord Jeſus as the Meſſiah. Therefore ſaid our Lord to them, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> That is, as he became Fleſh or Man, ſo he was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and ſo he is our Mediator and Interceſſor in Heaven, whole Chriſt, even <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And ſeeing ſince his Aſcenſion both <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſee him ſo, how and when ſince was <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> ſeparated from Chriſt? Were it not better for you to acquieſce with the plain genuine ſenſe of the Scripture, than to ſtretch and ſtrain ſome Expreſſions againſt the general ſcope thereof, to countenance ſome erroneous Expreſſions of <hi>G. F.</hi> and others? You are now to me as ſome other Perſwaſions were to you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, you having been among them. So I having ſo many Years owned and heard you, can tell you by Experience, that <hi>the Light within every Man</hi> only, nor the moſt exacteſt and ſtricteſt Obedience thereto, will not be a good Foundation for your Faith to faſten on, or build upon. Be not high-minded, but take up your Croſs, and own this contemned <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for God hath highly exalted him; and I can do no leſs than bear my Teſtimony againſt, and diſown this ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Spirit of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and them who joyn with him in theſe unchriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and do think that every individual Quaker is chargeable with them, and all other their Errors publickly printed and allowed by your Chief Prieſts and Rulers, until there be ſome publick Teſtimony given out by or on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half againſt them; and whatever my Lot may be from you, I am ſatisfied greater is he in whom I believe and truſt, even the ſame Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> preached, whom you term <hi>Veſſel, Garment, &amp;c.</hi> than the Light in every Man in the World: Therefore you may, as your fore-fathers did, cry aloud until Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt me, I cannot fear the whole Hoſt of you (although I know you be many Thouſands) for my truſt and hope is in the Mercy of God, for the ſake of my <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (without me) and his Obedience, and Sufferings, and ſhedding his ineſtimable Blood of his Body, his Stripes, his Death, and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, and Interceſſing with the Father now in Heaven. The Satisfaction he made to the Father, I ſay, in him only do I by Faith fix and rely for Salvation; and my Soul ſays to him (as the Diſciples in the Ship, when they were in a Storm) <hi>Lord ſave me, or I periſh.</hi> Even the ſame Jeſus who lived in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> I which ſate in Darkneſs among you many Years, through Mercy (by that little weak belief in him that I have obtained) found <hi>Light to ſpring up,</hi> as in the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 16. I ſay again, my Redeemer and Saviour, in whom I truſt, is the ſame Lord Jeſus St. <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd, and St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. <hi>Who was taken down from the Tree, and laid in a Sepulchre, whom God raiſed from the dead:</hi> Through this Man do I expect forgiveneſs of my ſins, and by him to be juſtified. I am not aſhamed of this my belief and hope in him whom ye contemn, and now term <hi>an outward Man,</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> II. <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered.</hi> And to cover your Errors, you would divide his two Natures, under pretence of diſtinguiſhing, whereas there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41408:4"/>
never was a Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth an outward Man</hi> only; and there is great difference between your Doctrine and the Apoſtles, for you Preach a Chriſt therein cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>i. e.</hi> in him, and a Light in every Man; but the Apoſtles Preach'd him, even <hi>him that was taken down from the Tree, and laid in the Sepulchre:</hi> This could not be the Godhead only diſtinct from his Manhood, nor could this Jeſus be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally or Subſtantially in Man, nor his Fleſh and Blood. Therefore the Light within every Man alone cannot be him, even <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> who is the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and your contempt of his Perſon is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. You ſay in Print of his Diſciples, <hi>For they loved his Perſon for the ſake of the frame and quality of the Spirit that dwelt in him; or elſe what was his Perſon (being mean and contemptible) to them, more than another Perſon, but for that which dwelt in him they loved him; let none miſtake, I do not ſlight it, nor the Perſon of any of his Brethren, or Children, as they are prepared to do the will of their Father; but I do know in God's Counſel that it was even ſo, as it bath been alſo in theſe days among whom God the Father of Mercies hath as it were deprived ſome of his Diſciples of the Perſonal Preſence of ſome of his dear ſons and Servants, which may be to this end, that the ſame Spirit and Life might be felt, poſſeſſed, lived in, and enjoyed in themſelves, in their own particulars, in which only their Eternal well-being conſiſteth,</hi> Deep to Deep, by <hi>W. B. pag.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Here obſerve, it's not the Body, but it is the Perſon, our Lord Jeſus, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, and as is proved by their aforeſaid terms (HIM) and (HIS PERSON) and in this their Contempt <hi>of his Perſon, his Blood,</hi> muſt be included; and, as is here ſhewn, they ſay, <hi>His blood was no more than the blood of another Saint;</hi> and ſo here above his Perſon is made to be but equal with theirs: There is more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in this above Sentence than I can expreſs, and if it be not alſo contrary to the 13 <hi>Acts,</hi> judge ye? But to diſcover the depth of the Myſtery of Iniquity, couched hereunder, is more than I can do; but you cannot be good Chriſtians, until you diſown theſe Contempts: And it is but deceit for you to pretend you own <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> as the Saviour, as long as you do not diſown, but excuſe theſe Contempts. Remember how you charged the Baptiſts, that if they did not condemn or diſown <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> for abuſing you, that they were chargeable, ſo alſo are you <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, the whole Body, chargeable with theſe Errors, until by or for you diſowned, much more by your excuſing them.</p>
            <p>Awake, awake all Chriſtians, eſpecially you Overſeers, who love our Lord Jeſus, and the Goſpel of Salvation, and contend earneſtly for the true Faith in him, for certain Men are crept in, ſpeaking great ſwelling words, pretending to the Power and Spirit of Chriſt, exalting themſelves above (and oppoſing) all other Chriſtians. This is the very Myſtery of Iniquity now at work: Do but conſider how furiouſly they proſecuted <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> for putting a jeſt upon twelve of them, by a Mock-Pillory: They Indicted him in <hi>London,</hi> when he above Sixty miles abſent, and knew nothing of it, nor could defend himſelf; and complained of him to the Secretary of State, and to the Parliament, as one Seditious, and of ill Conſequence to the Government, which was falſe, and a groſs Slander: Now, ſhall they be ſo concerned for the Reputation of Twelve Men among them, that the whole Nation muſt be alarmed? And ſhall our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, his</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41408:5"/>
               <hi>Blood and Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Scriptures</hi> be contemned, and you not affected, nor concerned? Surely if our Lord took ſo much notice of them that had not fed, nor cloathed, nor viſited his Diſciples, inſomuch that he took it as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 25 <hi>Matth.</hi> 42. ſurely much more will he take notice of them who do not (in this evil day and time) own and confeſs him before men, take his Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for an Example of ſuffering Afflictions, Bonds, and Impriſonments; for Preaching and Teſtifying to our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as the only Saviour. What though they will not ſuffer you to Buy or Sell in their Markets, but thruſt you out of their Synagogues, and Defame, and Perſecute, and Impriſon, and Fine, take away Goods, as they the Chief Prieſts of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers have done by <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Friends. Yet he is Faithful that hath promiſed, and hath greater Power than they. And becauſe (as they ſay) <hi>The only way to recover the Deceived, is to diſcover the Deceivers.</hi> Therefore are theſe Errors of theirs publiſhed, and not (as they falſly ſay) out of Envy, or to incenſe the Government againſt them, their falſe boaſting of themſelves and Spirit, and condemning others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> being charged to have ſaid he was Chriſt; he anſwered, <hi>It was a Lye;</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt in the Male or Female, if he ſpeak, he was Christ the Seed, and the Seed was Christ;</hi> but he ſaid, <hi>He did not ſpeak it as a Creature,</hi> p. 299. I take him to mean, it was not the Creature <hi>G. F. but Christ</hi> in him, that ſaid, <hi>he was Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 14. They charge <hi>T. C.</hi> for abuſing <hi>G. F.</hi> by miſrepreſenting him: Now I charge them in the top of this Paragraph with <hi>Falſe Boaſting,</hi> and I leave it to the Reader to judge whether or no theſe Inſtances I give do not prove it. For they themſelves ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>He,</hi> G. F. <hi>gives the name Chriſt to ſomething in him, and ſpake through him, yet it was no Creature, nor of him</hi> G. F. <hi>but of the Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> But now if it was as they ſay, <hi>no Creature,</hi> then it muſt be the Creator; and I ſee no difference between my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of his words and their own, but they delight to Quarrel, and falſly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. But for further proof of the Pride of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Spirit, one <hi>C. Wade</hi> charges them to ſay, <hi>They are Chriſt, and totally without ſin, as Chriſt is, ſaying, as he ſo are we in this World.</hi> To this <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwers, <hi>p.</hi> 248. <hi>He calls it Satanical,</hi> (ſaith <hi>G. F.) Thou haſt denyed John's words.</hi> Again, ſaith the ſame <hi>C. W. This proves that you Quakers are not Christ. as you brag you are—And yet</hi> (ſaith <hi>C. W.) you ſay, as Chriſt is, ſo are we in this World,</hi> in p. 249. <hi>G. F.</hi> Anſwers him thus, <hi>Which was the Apoſtle's words, and he was not aſhamed to ſpeak them; but thou that liveſt in the Power of Darkneſs art aſhamed to hear them.</hi> Says <hi>G. F.</hi> implying by this his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer they are without ſin, as Chriſt is, and quotes the 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 17. But the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle ſets out the Love of God, and the neceſſity of their living in love one with another: But doth not mention nor intend their being, as God is, <hi>in Perfection without ſin.</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> doth hereby, not only prove his Spirit to be a proud, boaſting one, but he doth pervert the Scripture alſo. And they ſay in the Epiſtle to this <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. p. 3. <hi>The Elect is riſen among us, whom you cannot deceive.</hi> But ſome of their Preachers have been deceived, and Deceivers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſay, <hi>The Quakers are in the Authority of the Lamb—upon the Throne, p.</hi> 31. Alſo in <hi>p.</hi> 78. ſay they, <hi>God hath ſaid, we are after his heart.</hi> Alſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41408:5"/>
by contradicting an Opponent, they do imply they are equal with God. For ſay they to one, <hi>Thou makeſt a great Pudder that any ſhould witneſs he is equal with God.</hi> And further, ſaith <hi>G. F. in a Catechiſm they have put forth to Learn, they have laid down, That the Holy Ghoſt is equal with the Father in Power and Glory:</hi> Yet (ſaith <hi>G. F.) If any come to witneſs the Holy Ghoſt in them as they that gave forth Scriptures, or witneſs the mind of Christ, and witneſs that Equal with the Father, that Equality you ſpeak of, you Prieſts deſtroy, that which you have put forth to the Nation, pag.</hi> 67. Now that which was objected againſt them, was not for ſaying, that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was equal with God,</hi> but for pretending that they, or the Spirit that guideth them, was ſo. And <hi>G. F.</hi> cites it as an Error in an Opponent for bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Quakers for ſaying, <hi>Their ſpeakings are from the Word Christ in them,</hi> (Mark, it's not the words of Chriſt) and to this <hi>G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>All you are apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatized that do not ſpeak from the Word Chriſt in you, pag.</hi> 68. Again, <hi>G. F.</hi> being charged <hi>to profeſs Equality with God;</hi> he Anſwers, <hi>G. F</hi>'s. <hi>words were ſpoken beyond and out of all Creatures, pag.</hi> 127. And again, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Aſſembly gave forth a Catechiſm, wherein they ſay, the Holy Ghoſt is equal with the Father—And is it Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy</hi> (ſays <hi>G. F.) for to come to witneſs this you have given forth, and the mind which was in Christ; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>G. F</hi>'s. <hi>words were not ſpoke as you Preach them, but beyond and out of all Creatures, he did not ſay</hi> G. F. <hi>p.</hi> 127. That is, he did not mean his Fleſh and Bone, but his Spirit or Chriſt in him: But Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſteemed according as the Spirit is which they be influenced by. But ſays <hi>G. F. The Quakers have a Spirit given them beyond all the fore-fathers, which we do witneſs ſince the days of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy: And they</hi> (Quakers) <hi>can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern who be Saints, and who are Devils, and who are Apoſtates, without ſpeaking ever a word, p.</hi> 89. And further, ſays <hi>G. F. Thou art an ignorant Man—nor canſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto the People, not knowing their condition they be in, unleſs they tell thee.</hi> Is not this a wicked, proud, boaſting Spirit? Yea, the Glover, a Quaker, that was robbed, and the Circumſtances thereabout, ſufficiently prove it, (I hope you will not be Angry for not naming the Perſons) beſides them in <hi>F. B</hi>'s. Cage. And I queſtion whether or no St. <hi>Peter</hi> knew <hi>Simon Magus</hi>'s Condition before he proffered Money. But theſe Quakers ſay (although fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſly) <hi>An Infallible Spirit is now poſſeſſed amongst the Quakers, p.</hi> 105. Yet now they would Quibble themſelves off in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 17. <hi>Pretending they do not aſcribe Infallibility to Perſons, but as influenced by the Infallible Spirit.</hi> But their Deceit is manifeſted, That <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not only pretend they <hi>poſſeſs an Infallible Spirit,</hi> but he alſo blames others for confeſſing they are Fallible. But I ſhall farther manifeſt their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as the <hi>Fallibility</hi> of their Spirit: It was by them put to one <hi>W. Thomas,</hi> a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to ſay plainly, <hi>whether they were Infallible or Fallible.</hi> To which he very Chriſtian-like Anſwers, <hi>We willingly acknowledge that we are fallible, or Men that may be deceived.</hi> In Anſwer thereto, ſays <hi>G. F. We do believe you, that you are Fallible Men, and are not Infallible—It's contrary to your Experience to be Infallible.</hi> Now, by <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Bantering Anſwer he doth imply the Quakers are <hi>Infallible</hi> Men, or elſe why doth he ſo Banter <hi>W. T.</hi> for acknowledging <hi>they are Fallible Men.</hi> And then farther, ſays <hi>G. F. You are Apoſtatized from the Infallible Spirit, in which we are come, with which you are judged—So not to have the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41408:6"/>
               <hi>G. F.</hi> goes on, ſaying, <hi>They who witneſs that which they were in who gave forth Scripture, they witneſs Infallibility, an Infallible Spirit now poſſeſſed among the Quakers. And ſo</hi> (ſays <hi>G. F.) the Devil, falſe Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>none of theſe can witneſs an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit—but being out of the Spirit that Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was in, they are not Infallible,</hi> p. 105. (ſays <hi>G. F.)</hi> But this Infallibility being about Thirty ſix Years ago, they may have loſt it ſince; yet <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Quakers be of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Stock, of Chriſt, before Antichriſt was, are made free from the wrath to come.</hi> And ſays <hi>G. F. Thou haſt diſcovered thy ſelf to be no Miniſter of Chriſt, who cannot give an Infallible Character of another Man, p.</hi> 107. Again, they ſay, <hi>They are the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, declared to be ſo in all your Conſciences,</hi> (an untruth) <hi>To be in the life of all the Prophets, and Chriſt—in the Truth;</hi> and by oppoſing the contrary, doth imply <hi>they do perfectly keep God's Commands, p.</hi> 360. And ſay, <hi>The Quakers are the Preſervers and Saviours of Souls, p.</hi> 249. Alſo they ſay, <hi>How can you but delude People, who are not Infallible, and are none of Chriſt's, which have not the Spirit, which is Infallible, are not Miniſters of the Goſpel, which is the Power of God, p.</hi> 82. Hereby it is apparent they do imply not only their Spirit but themſelves to be <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;</hi> but they are not <hi>Infallible,</hi> but <hi>Fallible,</hi> and <hi>delude the People</hi> by <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Excuſe me for troubling you with ſo much of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. impertinent ſtuff, for I am forced to it by their Clamours, they hoping thereby to tire me and you too. And what regard is there to be had to theſe Mens Writings, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe, and twenty times more I could produce of their proud boaſtings of themſelves and Spirit, as being <hi>Infallible;</hi> yet they have the Face, in their <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 17. to <hi>Challenge</hi> T. C. <hi>to prove that ever they aſcribed Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Men, but as influenced by the Infallible Spirit.</hi> But if <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Spirit were not both Infallible, he was, according to his own Judgment in Print, a <hi>Bantring Conjurer, a Diviner, and falſe Prophet.</hi> For beſides what I have before quoted, he ſays, <hi>How can you be Miniſters of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, if you be not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible—</hi>And <hi>ye do well to confeſs you have not the Infallible Spirit, are not Infallible; and how can they but delude People, which are not Infallible, p.</hi> 82. All theſe prove that <hi>G. F.</hi> did aſcribe <hi>Infallibility to Perſons</hi> as well as to his wicked Spirit. And this alſo proves, that theſe <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi> are ſo notoriouſly falſe, that they are not to be believed: For it's the <hi>Fallibility</hi> of themſelves, as Men, that theſe Men whom <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes, do acknowledge, and for which this Juggler, <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſo Banter them; for it's not the <hi>Spirit of God's being Infallible,</hi> that they oppoſe. And I ſhall further manifeſt the Fallibility and Wickedneſs of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Spirit, who brings in <hi>W. T.</hi> ſaying, <hi>We are juſtified by Chriſt without us, and not within us, p.</hi> 104. Now <hi>W. T.</hi> ſays in his Epiſtle, <hi>We are freely juſtified by the Grace of God through the Redemption and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which is not within us, but without us.</hi> Now <hi>W. T</hi>'s. words refer to the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> of our Lord, as performed in his own Perſon without us, as is plain by his term <hi>which,</hi> and not as <hi>G. F.</hi> perverts his words, as if he oppoſed Chriſt's Spiritual working in us, for, as is here ſhewed, he owns that: And <hi>W. T</hi>'s. Sentence is 24 words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 12 of them, and perverts them too. Alſo in <hi>p.</hi> 106. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>W. T.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Chriſt is not come to them in the Fleſh.</hi> Now W. T's. words in his 45 Page are thus: <hi>Chriſt is come already in the Fleſh to us, in the Spirit into us,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41408:6"/>
               <hi>But is not come yet, nor till the laſt day is to come in his Power and Glory.</hi> Here <hi>W. T</hi>'s. Sentence is 32 words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 10 of them, tranſpoſing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, and falſly accuſing <hi>W. T.</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is come already in the Fleſh to us;</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays, that <hi>W. T.</hi> ſays, <hi>Chriſt is not come to them in the Fleſh:</hi> Here is a Lye, a falſe Accuſation, and falſe Quotation, all theſe wicked deeds in this one Sentence of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Again, in <hi>pag.</hi> 106. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>W. T.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Men are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but not by Chriſt within us.</hi> But <hi>W. T.</hi> ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 42. <hi>Whether he build his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on Chriſt as be is within, that is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>on that of Chriſt, which is within, I grant Chriſt is in us, except we be Reprobates;</hi> this grant of <hi>W. T</hi>'s. proves <hi>G. F.</hi> a falſe Accuſer. (ſaith <hi>W. T.) But it's true alſo, Chriſt doth not ſave us as within us, nor by any thing he hath put within us, as if that were the cauſe of our Juſtification, or Chriſt by that,</hi> &amp;c. Here <hi>W. T</hi>'s. ſentence is 40 words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 8 of them, and perverts them, and falſly accuſeth him. And this is that fame <hi>W. Thomas</hi> that <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſo banter, as before, <hi>for acknowledging they were Fallible Men.</hi> Therefore if <hi>G. F.</hi> had any Honeſty, or <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he would here have ſhewed it, when he ſo highly pretended to it; but indeed he hath herein proved himſelf and his Spirit to be <hi>Infallibly</hi> wicked. This is an <hi>Infallible</hi> Truth proved here, and in my Eſſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where I omitted many of his falſe Quotations of thoſe two mens words, becauſe I would not burthen the Reader. And he often omits to mention Pages, but ſays, <hi>be ſaith,</hi> but no body knows where, for ſome of them I cannot find in all the Books; therefore do not you think to delude People with your ſham Stories, That theſe are from <hi>F. B.</hi> or <hi>I. P.</hi> for I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Books; but if they were from them, they are not the leſs true, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are guilty of ſuch wickedneſs, as your great Prophet <hi>G. F.</hi> is. And hereby is not only <hi>G. F. diſcovered,</hi> but his Spirit alſo, in hopes that it may not trouble Chriſtendom ſo much as it has done, or was intended by you: And I queſtion not, but a more ſerviceable and truer <hi>Journal</hi> than yours will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of him and his Spirit, of which, ſays he, <hi>Saul's Errand to Dam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

F. And this I witneſs to be fulfulled, for the ſame Spirit where it is, is equal with God; for he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one, and it is God that ſanctifieth,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. F.</hi> But this doth not prove <hi>G. F.</hi> or his Spirit more Holy than another, for <hi>all are of him.</hi> Again, ſays <hi>G. F. I am the way, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith Chriſt, Chriſt is but one in all his Saints, and he ſpeaks in them.</hi> So that it's the Spirit that he, <hi>G.

And what ſhall he ſaid to ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, who ſo Revile me for leaving out ſome of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. impertinent words, an <hi>And</hi> and a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> and yet themſelves ſo groſly guilty of falſe Citing and perverting mens words, that I queſtion whether any Popiſh Writers do exceed this <hi>G. F.</hi> therein; he not only perverting mens words, but the Scriptures alſo; for to warrant being Equal with God, he brings 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 5. which I deſire you to read, and you will find the whole ſcope thereor to exhort
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41408:7"/>
to Humility <hi>in lowlyneſs of mind:</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let each eſteem others better than themſelves.</hi> And, ſays the Apoſtle concerning our Lord, <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death,</hi> &amp;c. Now, here is not any word ſpoke, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to exalt any Man or Spirit in him, but on the contrary, according to our Lord's Example, to humble our ſelves: <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you;</hi> that is, to humble our ſelves, and not as <hi>G. F.</hi> doth, exalt himſelf and his falſe Spirit, under the Notion of the ſame Spirit that Chriſt had, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Fruit ſhews it a contrary Spirit. Alſo for that Text which <hi>G. F.</hi> brings to make himſelf one with God, 2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, are all of one.</hi> And ſaith <hi>G. F. It's God that ſanctifieth,</hi> thereby implying his Spirit was one with God; for ſaith he, <hi>the ſame Spirit where it is, is equal with God,</hi> &amp;c. And then in the concluſion of that Paragraph, ſays he, <hi>This I witneſs what the Scripture ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 6. And all this not in denyal, but in confirmation of his claiming Equality with God. But this Text doth ſet out the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſenſion of our dear Lord Jeſus, how he became one with us, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt any to equality with God; but to the contrary, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We ſee Jeſus, who was made lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death—For it became him for whom, and by whom, are all things—To make the Captain of Salvation perfect through Sufferings,</hi> 2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Therefore hereby it's evident, that <hi>G. F.</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Scripture as well as mens words. And obſerve in the ſecond of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> it's ſaid of our Lord, <hi>And being found in faſhion, or ſhape, as a Man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf.</hi> And it's not ſaid, he was found in that Man, but he was that very Perſon, God and Man, and not a meer Man, without or diſtinct from the Divine Life, for <hi>the Word was made fleſh;</hi> and as Body and Soul make but one Man, ſo the Divine and Humane Natures are both one Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I have made a long Digreſſion, but am by their Clamours forced to it.</p>
            <p>For farther Proof of their Contempt of our Lord, and his Sufferings, They ſay in Print, <hi>The Sufferings of the People of God</hi> (themſelves) <hi>in this Age, are greater, and more unjuſt than in the days of Chriſt, or of the Apoſtles—For what was done to Chriſt or his Apoſtles, was chiefly done by a Law, and in great part by the due execution of a Law,</hi> Edw. Burroughs <hi>Works, p.</hi> 273. If this be not abominable Contempt of our Lord's Sufferings, and excuſing the Jews, I know not what is. And I am ſure it was no Chriſtian Spirit, that wrote, or excuſed ſuch Antichriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Judge ye, if this be not more properly denying the Lord that bought them, than <hi>J. S</hi>'s. calling their <hi>Light within, perverſe Principle of Self-adoring Light.</hi> Of this they ſay in Print, it's <hi>Blaſphemy, and no leſs than denying the Lord that bought him, R. Hubberthorn</hi>'s Works, in Anſwer to <hi>J. S. p.</hi> 89. And for Proof of their Contempts of the Magiſtrates and Laws of the Nation, and their Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Arrogancy. Obſerve, They ſay in Print, <hi>Truth allows no Payment of Tithes at all, but condemns it, ſo would you alſo, were your hearts right to God. They who pay Tithes, do thereby deny Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh, which is a mark of Antichriſt,</hi> in their Book, <hi>An Antidote againſt Infection,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 78. This cruel and illegal Sentence of theirs is againſt <hi>W. R.</hi> a Chriſtian Quaker, who doth not plead the Right of Tithes, but for Liberty of Conſcience, for <hi>theſe who could freely pay them, and not by conſtraint.</hi> And it's this juſt Liberty that they oppoſe, and will-not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch to be Chriſtians, but condemn them as <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Denyers of Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41408:7"/>
and ſo for Damnation. And this affects no leſs than all Chriſtendom, even ever ſince the Apoſtles to the World's end; even Kings and all Eſtates and Degrees whatſoever, who pay Tithes; nay, their own deareſt and neareſt Relations. And if it do not condemn Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> yet I am ſure it doth that Divine <hi>Judge Hale,</hi> whom they pretend in their Journal to ſpeak well of, and I am ſure did deſerve better from them. And this their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is ſo Uncharitable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian a Judgment, that it concerns all true Chriſtians to diſown it. But theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers are ſo hardy, that they are not aſhamed to tell the Parliament, That <hi>their Teſtimony againſt Tithes, is not a Law of their making, but of Chriſt's, Counterfeit Convert,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 73. Alſo they ſay, <hi>They cannot hold up Tithes in the War, nor in the Law—nor they that give them—and do ſee that they that give them, and they that take them, are neither agreeable to Law nor Goſpel,</hi> in a Book, entituled, <hi>Theſe ſeveral Papers were ſent to the Parliament,</hi> 1659. Now, until they diſown this aforeſaid unchriſtian Teſtimony of theirs, all the <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi> are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therewith. And hereby it's evident, That a Liberty for ſuch as cannot for Conſcience-ſake pay Tithes, will not ſatisfie them; but they will impoſe upon them who <hi>can freely pay them without conſtraint,</hi> under the Penalty of being <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and denyers of Chriſt.</hi> And it's of concernment to be determined which is moſt binding, the <hi>Foxonian Quakers Teſtimony againſt Tithes,</hi> being <hi>a Law of Chriſt's making,</hi> as they ſay, or the Laws of the Nation: For by theſe Quakers Doctrine, all who pay them are in a damnable condition, although they pay them <hi>freely without Conſtraint;</hi> and more eſpecially they who receive and make the Laws for the Payment of them. For <hi>G. F.</hi> alſo ſays, <hi>Tithes muſt be taken away from Men as well as Miniſters, pag.</hi> 368. So here is a Law made by Chriſt in <hi>G. F.</hi> that <hi>Tithes must be taken away,,</hi> not only from Miniſters, but from <hi>other Men;</hi> and it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> to the Parliament. And alſo they ſay, <hi>That Antichriſtian Generation, the National Miniſtry, have received a deadly blow by our Witneſs againſt their forced Maintenance and Tithes, against which we have witneſſed by cruel Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as our Chronicles ſhall make known to Ages to come; ſo that their Kingdom in the hearts of thouſands begins to totter, and ſhall aſſuredly fall to the ground.</hi> In their Book, <hi>The Anarchy of the Ranters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 42. And alſo above Thirty Years ſince did one <hi>S. T.</hi> ſay in a Publick Meeting, <hi>As there was not then a Biſhop in</hi> England, <hi>ſo there ſhould not be a Prieſt.</hi> And in the Epiſtle to <hi>G. F</hi>'s. <hi>Great Myſtery;</hi> they ſay, <hi>Our Spirits were firſt filled with Indignation against the Prieſts and Teachers, and againſt them we first began War.</hi> Alſo in <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi>'s Works, in Anſwer to <hi>J. S. pag.</hi> 130. They ſay, <hi>When the Law of the Land ceaſeth to maintain them, which will come ſooner than they expect, then may they beg their Bread, or periſh for want.</hi> Alſo <hi>W. P.</hi> in his Guide Miſtaken, ſaith, <hi>The Idle, Gormandizing Prieſts of</hi> England <hi>run away with</hi> 150000 <hi>l. a Year, under pretence of being God's Miniſters—No ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ſo univerſally the bane of Soul and Body, as that abominable Tribe, for whom the Theatre of God's most dreadful Vengeance is reſerved to Act their Eternal Tragedy upon.</hi> What Mouth all theſe uncharitable and wrathful Sentences came forth of, it is not difficult to judge: And if they were not from <hi>the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> then <hi>G. F. W. P.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were Conjurers, Diviners, and falſe Prophets,</hi> by their own Printed Doctrine. And as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> took Counſel, and made two Calves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41408:8"/>
and ſaid to the People, it is too much for you to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> behold your Gods: So they have made their Female Prelates for Licenſing Marriages, and Laws againſt paying of Tithes, to hinder People from converſing with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and them from what benefit they can: This <hi>G. F.</hi> as the Carpenter, hews them out, and <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P. &amp;c.</hi> they have been the Carvers and Painters thereof. He ſays, he <hi>was moved,</hi> and they ſay, they be Ordinances of Chriſt. And much more ſuch of their deadly Fury I could produce, which plainly proves their <hi>Indignation</hi> is, as they ſay, againſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of all ſorts, and to bring them into contempt and <hi>want;</hi> and therefore do defame them, and all who pay <hi>Tithes,</hi> although <hi>willingly, and not by conſtraint.</hi> But I believe if a true Account were given, of what Charges <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſome others of them, have been to ſome Perſons, it would appear <hi>he hath run away with,</hi> or there hath been ſpent for and about him, as much or more than on many a Prieſt and Teacher in <hi>England,</hi> conſidering his Circumſtances; and hath been <hi>the Bane of more Souls</hi> than any one Prieſt in <hi>England.</hi> And it's time for them concerned to conſider what Foundation they have, or ſtand on, conſidering the <hi>Number, Strength, Riches, Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, <hi>whoſe Spirits are filled with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against them;</hi> and have declared in Print, <hi>their Kingdom ſhall fall,</hi> and they <hi>beg their Bread, or periſh for want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to plead for Liberty of Conſcience in the caſe of Tithes, for ſuch as can freely pay them, is ſo great a Crime among them, that they made it the Heads of two Articles againſt <hi>J. Story,</hi> one of their Miniſters, for ſaying, <hi>He knew an honest Friend, who had, and would pay Tithes. And that he believed all Friends had not a Teſtimony against Tithes.</hi> And againſt this <hi>J. S.</hi> and one <hi>J. W.</hi> they ſent out a more fierce <hi>Roating Bull,</hi> than that now againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> All theſe ſhew their great Hypocriſie, in that they now, in Anſwer to <hi>F. B</hi>'s. <hi>Impeachment,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they deſire <hi>People may keep their Conſciences clear,</hi> and that their <hi>Orders are but Counſel and Advice.</hi> But they are ſo arrogant (as is proved by theſe afore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) in thus affronting the Law and Government, that it's the Duty of all good Chriſtians and Subjects concerned, to Teſtifie againſt them. And if you Chriſtian Quakers do not diſown all theſe their Errors, you are great reſpecters of Perſons, and therein great Sinners, and indeed great Slaves to your Chief Prieſts. But notwithſtanding they have uttered all this Fury and Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt all Chriſtendom but themſelves, yet they pretend great Charity for the Pious Gentiles, ſaying in their Book, <hi>The Chriſtian Society and Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. <hi>Must all be excluded any true knowledge or Faith of Christ within them, unleſs they have the knowledge of Christ without them? No ſure, for that would imply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency in Chriſt as within them.</hi> Here is much of their Secret, Myſterious undermining the Faith in our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and the Authority of the Evangeliſts, in this their pretended Charity to the Gentiles. And it ſhews there was but little Love to our Lord, or the Evangeliſts Teſtimony in the Contrivers of this piece of Antichriſtian Charity: For at the beſt it doth but advance Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and degrade the Faith in our Lord Jeſus according to the Evangeliſts Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And I pray Judge who be moſt likely to be <hi>denyers of Christ, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, they who freely pay Tithes without conſtraint,</hi> or they who uttered, and do
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41408:8"/>
now excuſe theſe Contempts of our Lord Jeſus, Scriptures, Governours, Laws, and all Chriſtians beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, ſay they, <hi>The Prieſts work hath been to teach People to keep in their Luſts, and not forſake and come out of them to Chriſt,</hi> p. 228. And <hi>You all Prieſts and Teachers, ſince the days of the Apoſtles, who are inwardly ravened from the Spirit, have kept Millions of Souls in Damnation, keeping them in the way of Hell, who are Satan's Miniſters, p.</hi> 267. If it be objected, that they do not mean the Miniſters in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it is before proved they have condemned all, from the Throne to the Dunghil: Alſo they ſay, <hi>Them, called Quakers, the only Miniſters of Christ,</hi> p. 267. Therefore they mean all National and Congregational, as is further evident by their ſaying, <hi>Equivocating, deluding Hypocrites, he hath proved himſelf and all others, except the Quakers,</hi> p. 249. Again, ſay they, <hi>They must all come to the Quakers, if ever they own Christ,</hi> p. 119.</p>
            <p>What they boaſt concerning the Light within (not only within themſelves, but) in every Man, they ſay to two Baptiſts, who, they ſay, are out of Peace, <hi>If you look to the Light within, it will not let you have Peace—The Saints Peace is in the Light within; For the Light is Christ the Covenant of God,</hi> p. 295. And one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting againſt them, becauſe they ſay, <hi>There is no other way to bring People to God, but by the Light in them. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>which is Christ, the way to God, p.</hi> 38. Another Objecting againſt the Light within, ſays <hi>G. F. which is Christ, p.</hi> 49. Alſo they quote theſe following as Errors: One ſaying, <hi>They that ſeek for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by Obedience to the Light within, differ nothing from the Jews—And them who Preach Redemption by the Light in every Man, are not of God, p.</hi> 60, 61. Again, one ſays, <hi>To call that Light in every Man Christ, is to ſlight his Glorious Perſon in Heaven. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>The Apoſtle ſaid, Christ is all in all, p.</hi> 94. One ſays, <hi>There is not in every Man that Redeeming Light, nor is the Light every man hath his Meditation, p.</hi> 154. Now although <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not poſitively deny theſe, yet they are cited as Errors. Again, one ſays, <hi>To ſay the Light in every Man is Chriſt, the Redeemer, is an Error.</hi> Alſo that they who affirm <hi>the Light in every Man is Chriſt the Redeemer, ſets up an Idol, p.</hi> 58. Long, ſide-long Anſwers <hi>G. F.</hi> makes to theſe, and in his Concluſion ſaith to the Perſon who affirms theſe Truths, <hi>For the reſt of thy Lyes,</hi> &amp;c. Thereby implying theſe aforeſaid Affirmations falſe, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary, That the Light in every Man is Chriſt the Redeemer. For ſays <hi>G. F. He (the Devil) teacheth them not to have the Light within them, the Seed Chriſt—</hi>The <hi>Root</hi> of God. Now, in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 18. they charge me for <hi>Quarrelling with</hi> G. F. for calling Chriſt <hi>the Root of God:</hi> But they are falſe Accuſers, for it's his terming <hi>the Light in every Man the Root of God,</hi> that I objected againſt, as the head of that Paragraph ſhews, where I ſay, <hi>What they boaſt concerning the Light within every man;</hi> and <hi>G. F</hi>'s own words do prove that he doth term <hi>the Light within, the Root of God.</hi> For he ſays, <hi>The Devil teacheth them in whom he ſoweth his Seed, not to have the Light in them, the Seed Chriſt, the Tree of Righteouſneſs, the Root of God, p.</hi> 185. Now, were you not paſt ſhame, you durſt not Print ſuch groſs falſhood, as that I Quarrel with <hi>G. F.</hi> for calling Chriſt <hi>the Root of God,</hi> when as his own words be, <hi>The Light in them</hi> (even <hi>in them whom the Devil teacheth)</hi> ſaith <hi>G. F. The Root of God.</hi> And <hi>it's the Light in them whom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41408:9"/>
the Devil teacheth,</hi> that <hi>G. F.</hi> gives theſe terms to, <hi>The Seed Christ, Tree of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, The Root of God.</hi> And as I ſaid before, ſo I now ſay, <hi>I think this is the Root of Rantiſm.</hi> And I have examined all the Scriptures you mention, and do not find therein <hi>The Light in them whom the Devil teacheth</hi> is termed <hi>the Root of God,</hi> as <hi>G. F.</hi> Blaſphemouſly doth. And I deſire the Reader to conſider what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency there is between <hi>G. F</hi>'s. giving theſe high Titles to <hi>the Light within every Man,</hi> and your Pretenſions in your <hi>pag.</hi> 7. to ſay, <hi>The Rays, or Beams of Light which proceed from him, the Son of Righteouſneſs, ſhine into the hearts of all Mankind.</hi> This is granted by moſt Proteſtants, but differs much from <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Expreſſions; and how can you expect to be thought ſincere in this or any other Confeſſions you now make, ſo long as you by Slanders and Quibbles endeavour to excuſe and cover your Old Blaſphemous Expreſſions in Print: And if it's a Sin to Lye for God, it's groſs Wickedneſs to do it for ſuch an one as <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One ſays, <hi>Man hath received a Light from Christ as a Creature, but not as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>That's falſe, whoſo hath received Light from Chriſt, hath received a Redeemer and a Saviour, and he that believes in it is ſaved,</hi> p. 215. This I think is falſe, for hereby <hi>G. F.</hi> makes the Saviour but a Principle, and not a Perſon: But <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Goſpel and the Apoſtles differ much, and, as they ſay in the Epiſtle to this Book, <hi>We cannot own both, but we muſt deny one;</hi> therefore I deny <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Again, ſays <hi>G. F. They that have Chriſt within have Sanctification, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Juſtification, p.</hi> 230. Now he ſays, <hi>Every man hath the Light, and the Light is Christ.</hi> Now I Appeal to common Experience, nay, <hi>G. F</hi>'s. own words before cited; <hi>If you look to the Light within, it will not let you have Peace,</hi> ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> Now thoſe who are condemned by the Light within, have they <hi>Sanctification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification?</hi> According to his own Doctrine above, they had not Peace, and therefore had not Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſuch a Man needed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Memory. Again, one ſays, <hi>There is not whole Chriſt, God and Man, in Men.</hi> To this <hi>G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>How then muſt Men grow in Chriſt? p.</hi> 249. And in his Concluſion ſaith to this Man, <hi>Theſe be thy Principles—all People may Judge thee.</hi> This plainly ſhews he denies our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Chriſt, for he as God and Man cannot be in Men. One ſays, <hi>Such be in Error, that know no Chriſt but a Chriſt within. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>They that profeſs a Chriſt without them, have another Chriſt within them; here is two, ſays</hi> G. F. <hi>For if it be not the ſame Chriſt that ended all Types,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—If it be not him that is within them, they have not the poſſeſſion of the Subſtance, nor the comfort of the true Christ: But thoſe who have not Chriſt, the end of all Types, in them, they are among Antichriſts,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—And they that have a form of Godlineſs, can confeſs a Chriſt without them, and not within them, p.</hi> 225. Now, from the firſt part of this Sentence I obſerve <hi>G. F.</hi> doth make two Chriſts, as his own words prove; and being two, his Chriſt within muſt be another than him without us: For if there be, as he ſaith, two, that is more than one; nay he, <hi>G. F.</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>another Chriſt within them.</hi> And in all this ſide-long Anſwer of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. he doth not contradict his firſt Aſſertion, that there is <hi>a Chriſt within,</hi> and <hi>another without,</hi> and <hi>here is two,</hi> ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> And obſerve, the Objection was not made againſt Chriſt's being Spiritually within, but againſt them <hi>who know no Chriſt but a Chriſt within.</hi> As <hi>C. W.</hi> doth Object againſt their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41408:9"/>
ſaying, <hi>That whole Chriſt is in them, and that Chriſt, God and Man, Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is in them.</hi> All which <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not deny, but by his long, ſide-long An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers doth imply it is ſo, and thereby diſown our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Chriſt, or elſe there is two; for he as <hi>God and Man, Fleſh and Spirit, whole Chriſt,</hi> cannot be in Man, as <hi>G. F.</hi> by his oppoſing <hi>C. W.</hi> doth imply. Again, one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Lord Jeſus is afar off in his Bodily Preſence,</hi> p. 8. And <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>God-man, is abſent from his Church. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>Contrary to Chriſt.</hi> Again, ſays <hi>G. F. The Body of Chriſt is not out of the ſight of his Saints, p.</hi> 12. But hear what the Scripture ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love—whom though now you ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce.</hi> Here is the Scripture and the <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Quakers</hi> contrary to each other, Judge ye which is to be believed. Again, one ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſaith, he ſhall be abſent from his Apoſtles touching his Body, pag.</hi> 205. Again, <hi>He is abſent from them touching his Fleſh, pag.</hi> 210. And <hi>the Man Christ, that was crucified, his Body is abſent from his People, as touching his bodily Preſence, p.</hi> 211. All theſe <hi>G. F.</hi> cites as Errors, and in his Concluſion ſaith to the Man, <hi>Thou haſt lifted up thy ſelf against the Lamb—the Witneſs in thy Conſcience ſhall Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thee.</hi> Again, one ſays, <hi>The Perſon Chriſt is Perſonally abſent from Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> G. F. Anſwers, <hi>The Saints he is not abſent from, p.</hi> 135. And now for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof of their Contempt of the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> this following is enough, if there were no other; For, ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> to <hi>C. Wade, The Devil was in thee, thou ſayeſt, thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee, and ſo haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded thy ſelf a Reprobate, and ignorant of the Myſtery of Chriſt within thee, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that thou doſt not know Salvation.</hi> Now, the firſt part of this Cruel Sentence I brought to prove their Contempt of our Lord's Perſon, becauſe that <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſhew no other Reaſon for his <hi>Deviling</hi> and <hi>Reprobating</hi> C. W. but becauſe he had in Print <hi>(which</hi> G. F. <hi>calls a Record)</hi> acknowledged <hi>Salvation by Chriſt without him,</hi> as appears by G. F's. words <hi>[ſo.]</hi> And for the latter words of G. F's. which in my former Quotations I left out, they ſhew no other Reaſon for his <hi>Deviling</hi> and <hi>Reprobating</hi> C. W. only they do ſhew his Enmity againſt <hi>C. W</hi>'s. Chriſtian Confeſſion <hi>to Chriſt without him.</hi> And G. F. thinking that <hi>Deviling</hi> and <hi>Reprobating</hi> him not enough, but to aggravate the wretchedneſs of his ſtate, that he was not only a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> but an ignorant one too. This is that <hi>C. Wade,</hi> whom G. F. ſo groſsly abuſed, as I have ſhewed in my Eſſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo G. F. ſaith, <hi>he ſays,</hi> but no body knows where, for he quotes no Page, and I have read the Book all over, containing 60 Pages, and cannot find ſome Sentences, that G. F. ſays, <hi>he ſays</hi> ſo. And although G. F. hath ſo <hi>Devilled</hi> and <hi>Reprobated</hi> him, and ſays, he is <hi>ignorant of Christ within;</hi> I ſhall ſhew you what he ſays of Chriſt within: In <hi>pag.</hi> 36. ſays C. W. <hi>The Saints are ſaid to be the Habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>God whoſe Throne is in Heaven—is in his gracious and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Preſence in and through his Son dwelling in the hearts of his People.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>Chriſt is by his Spiritual Influences in all his Saints.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>Chriſt that is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally abſent from Believers, is dwelling in their hearts by Faith.</hi> All theſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Chriſt within by <hi>C. W.</hi> be in that one Book G. F. pretends to Anſwer. Now, if <hi>C. W.</hi> believed this with his heart, I do not ſee, but according to the Tenth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he might be ſaved; and G. F. hath rather <hi>recorded</hi> his own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41408:10"/>
               <hi>Reprobate</hi> ſtate, than <hi>C. W</hi>'s. and his own Spirit more like the <hi>Devil</hi>'s than <hi>C. W</hi>'s. But it was <hi>C. W</hi>'s. bold and open Confeſſion to Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that did tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment G. F. as he did the ſame Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 34. And ſo the ſame Confeſſion how doth torment the ſame Spirit in G. F's Succeſſors, the Chief Prieſts and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, <hi>W. P. W. B.</hi> &amp; <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. And for their Pretence in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 20. That they ſee not how <hi>the Apoſtle can be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and</hi> G. F. <hi>Erroneous,</hi> (their Blindneſs is to be pitied) but to them who are not blinded it is plain that G. F. was erroneous and wicked. For <hi>C. W.</hi> as is afore-ſhewn, doth Confeſs to Chriſt within, according to theſe Scriptures, 3 <hi>Eph.</hi> 17. 3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 26. 4 <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. read them. And <hi>Paul</hi> doth no where ſay, <hi>The Devil was in thee, thou ſayeſt, thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee, and haſt recorded thy ſelf a Reprobate,</hi> as G. F. wickedly doth. But in 10 <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and neither doth St. <hi>John</hi> countenance G. F's. Contempts, although you would ſhelter him under them both.</p>
            <p>And further, ſaith G. F. <hi>Can you call him Chriſt in Man, without the Man being there?</hi> p. 68. This is in Anſwer to one who charges them to ſay, <hi>Chriſt is in them as Man.</hi> By theſe you may ſee <hi>what a Man Chriſt</hi> they mean, when they ſay, they believe in the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And that, <hi>he became Man,</hi> they mean even ſuch a Man as is in them: For ſays G. F. <hi>If they muſt eat his fleſh, is it not in them?</hi> Again, one ſays, <hi>That Chriſt our Juſtification ſhould be in us, that dyed, that ſuffered, and aſcended, to fancy him in a particular Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>p.</hi> 130. <hi>ſays, the ſame Man Chriſt is Perſonally abſent from a Believer.</hi> So that it's our Lord Jeſus, as God and Man, Perſonally being in People, that this <hi>T. M.</hi> oppoſes, and not <hi>his enlightning men,</hi> for that he acknowledgeth, as <hi>G. F.</hi> cites him, <hi>p.</hi> 130. ſaying, <hi>Yea, when enlightened by that Heavenly Light from Jeſus.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 131. ſaith <hi>T. M. There is ſomething of God in Man.</hi> And <hi>G. F.</hi> doth by his oppoſing theſe ſound Doctrines imply, there is no Man or Perſon Jeſus abſent from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, nor no other Chriſt ſuffered and dyed, but what is in us Perſonally, or whole Chriſt, as by his Anſwer. <hi>And ſo all be in the fancy that be out of the ſtate of witneſſing Chriſt (that ſuffered) within them.</hi> Now in the <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 20. They blame me for leaving out the word <hi>And,</hi> and the <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> which I did not to wrong his ſenſe, nor is there any Emphaſis in them, nor did I quote this place to prove that <hi>G. F.</hi> did <hi>make Chriſt's Sufferings within Man only,</hi> as they falſly inſinuate, <hi>p.</hi> 21. nor made any Obſervations on this place particularly. But I do believe that in this place, as well as in many others, his deſign was to contemn the Perſon of our Lord, and conſequently <hi>his Blood and Sufferings,</hi> as more fully appears by your ſaying, <hi>That Blood of his let out of his Side by the Spear, after he was dead, was no more than the Blood of another Saint.</hi> This is a wicked Contempt: And for your fallacious Pretence, <hi>p.</hi> 21. That <hi>G. F.</hi> means no other, but that <hi>Chriſt who ſuffered without,</hi> to be <hi>revealed within.</hi> That is acknowledged by all Proteſtants, and would not be contradicted. But if he meant ſo, why did he not expreſs it as you do? And at beſt, in this he ſhews himſelf a very perverſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter, and cauſer of Diviſions, and therefore to be avoided. And although <hi>G. F.</hi> do not in that place make <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings to be in Man only,</hi> yet he doth ſay, <hi>And all be in the fancy who be out of the ſtate of witneſſing Chriſt (that ſuffered) within
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41408:10"/>
them.</hi> Now, it was the Man our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that ſuffered, and he as ſuch cannot be Perſonally in any Man; therefore in this he doth contemn our Lord's Perſon. And for your ſo ſevere charging me for omitting the word <hi>and,</hi> and the <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> now you have them in, they will not excuſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: But you have hereby aggravated his groſs wickedneſs; for if that be ſo great a ſin in me, how wicked was he, to falſifie Mens words and ſenſe, as he hath done, and is proved in my Eſſay, and this Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Let's ſee now what juſt Judges you will approve your ſelves, in condemning his erroneous Spirit; but I know you dare not touch that, it being your Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for if you do, down comes your Building of Infallibility and Church-Power.</p>
            <p>Further, ſays <hi>G. F. Chriſt is come now, who treads the Wine-preſs alone without the City;</hi> ſo making the Work now a doing, which our Lord finiſhed in his own Perſon, as by the Prophet is ſaid, <hi>Hath trod the Wine-preſs alone.</hi> Again, one ſays, <hi>If there be not a diſtinction between the Righteouſneſs imputed on account of the Blood of Chriſt, and that wrought in us by his Spirit.</hi> G. F. Anſwers, <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Blood and Spirit, are all one,</hi> p. 183. And ſays to the Man, <hi>For the reſt of thy confuſed ſtuff, it is not worth mentioning:</hi> Thereby making theſe ſound words <hi>confuſed ſtuff.</hi> Again, one ſays, <hi>The work in us is not the ground and Purchaſe of true Peace.</hi> To this he makes a perverſe Anſwer, and ſays to the Perſon, <hi>For the reſt of thy Lyes, they turn on thy ſelf, p.</hi> 171. Thereby implying that before was one. One ſays, <hi>The Fleſh of Chriſt is not in them.</hi> G. F. Anſwers, <hi>They that eat it, have it in them, p.</hi> 222. But where was it before they eat it? Or how came they by it to eat? By all theſe it is evident, They, <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> reject the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as the only Chriſt and <hi>Saviour, his Fleſh, Blood, and Body,</hi> which was <hi>laid hands on, and ſlain, and laid in the Sepulchre;</hi> whom the Apoſtle bore witneſs to, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>As the Word of Salvation, and the Saviour;</hi> and not only the Godhead in him, but him, that Perſon our Lord Jeſus. Nay, ſuch was their Reverence towards his Holy Perſon and Body, that the Apoſtle treats of him as the Meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification. But he is by theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers contemned, and the Light within every Man dignified with his Titles and Offices, and to be his Fleſh, and his Blood, contrary to the Scriptures; for in the 13 <hi>Heb.</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>That he might ſanctifie the People with his own Blood, he ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> 10 <hi>Heb. By the which will we are ſanctified, by the offering of the Body of Jeſus once for all.</hi> Now judge ye which is ſafeſt, to take that Perſon our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his Body and Blood, for the Object of our Faith, and Hope of Salvation, through the Satisfaction he made to the Father in his own Perſon, and being thereby juſtified in the ſight of God, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or <hi>the Light in every Man,</hi> which theſe Quakers make to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Fleſh and Blood, Juſtification, Sanctification, &amp;c.</hi> nay, the very <hi>Root of God;</hi> but I think this their Doctrine is the <hi>Root of Blaſphemous Rantiſm.</hi> I could give many more Inſtances of the perverſeneſs and erroneouſneſs of their Spirit; but theſe and a few more that follow are enough and too many, to teſtifie againſt them, and manifeſt that this Spirit, they blaſphemouſly term <hi>Chriſt his Infallible Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> is that mentioned 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2. <hi>The man of ſin, that exalteth himſelf</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41408:11"/>
               <hi>above all that is called God.</hi> But according as is propheſied, <hi>he is</hi> (in meaſure) <hi>revealed.</hi> Therefore all who love the Lord Jeſus beware.—Again, one ſays, <hi>The Seed, to whom the Promiſe of Salvation is made, is, or hath been ſinners. G. F.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>The Promiſe is to the Seed, which Seed is the hope Chriſt, that purifieth even as God is pure; and here is the Creature come to know his Liberty among the Sons of God, and the Seed Chriſt never ſinneth, p.</hi> 324. From <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Anſwer I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he did imply, as if Chriſt, (whom he terms the Seed) had need of Salvation; and I leave it to the Reader to Judge, conſidering the Affirmation and his Anſwer thereto; and notwithſtanding they Quarrel with me, yet they ſeem to allow as much. For in their <hi>Diſcoverer Diſcovered, p.</hi> 21, 22. ſay they, <hi>For</hi> G. F's. <hi>aſſerting that the Seed, to whom the Promiſes were made, was Chriſt; read Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Pray obſerve their deceit here, for the difference between <hi>T. T.</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> was not whether or no, there were not Promiſes to Chriſt as the Seed: But ſaith <hi>T. T. The Seed, to whom the Promiſes of Salvation are made.</hi> And although Chriſt be in Scripture termed the Seed, and the Seed ſaid to be Chriſt; yet in a Scripture-ſenſe, Men alſo are termed the Seed; as all the Poſterity of a Man are his Seed. And in the 3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 29. <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed.</hi> Theſe were Perſons, and <hi>had been ſinners,</hi> as <hi>T. T.</hi> affirms, and <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes him therein. Alſo in <hi>pag.</hi> 325. <hi>T. T.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are Men, and not only ſomething in Man.</hi> Now, by his words <hi>not only,</hi> it is evident he doth allow that <hi>ſomething in Man,</hi> may in a ſenſe, be alſo called <hi>the Seed;</hi> but <hi>G. F.</hi> by oppoſing him herein, doth imply, as if <hi>the Promiſe of Salvation</hi> was to Chriſt, as if he had need of Salvation. And beſides the unſoundneſs of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Juggling, long, two-faced Anſwers, he hath ſhewed himſelf void of Charity; and therefore his Spirit cannot be the Spirit of Chriſt: And by the Fruits they bring forth, it's eaſie to Judge into what Root <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> are grafted, and grown out of.</p>
            <p>And they are as Scandalous and Offenſive in ſome Expreſſions above Civil Government. They ſay, <q>Are not all thoſe Elders, Chriſtians, that will dote ſo much on an Earthly King, Traytors againſt Chriſt—Neither do you read that there were any Earthly Kings ſince the days of the Apoſtles, but among the Apoſtate Chriſtians<hi>—Herod</hi> the King was mad at the Child Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay all the Children in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> There is the Fruit of Earthly Kings, and ſuch a King would our falſe Chriſtians have, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> G. F. <hi>To the Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo obſerve how they treated the Peers of the Realm: Say they, <q>What a Sincerity was there once in the Nation? What a dirty, naſty thing would it have been to have heard talk of a Houſe of Lords among them.</q> In a Book, <hi> To the Council and Officers</hi> of the Army, <hi>p.</hi> 7. Again, ſay they, <q>Let all thoſe Fines that belong to Lords of Mannors, be given to the Poor People, for the Lords have enough.</q> 
               <hi>G. F</hi>'s. <hi>Counſel to the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Alſo concerning Epiſcopacy, they ſay in their Book, entituled, <hi>An Alarm, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>T. E. p.</hi> 6. <q>Did not you make a Solemn Covenant with God, that you would utterly extirpate Epiſcopacy, that dead, loathſome Form—Did not you ſpew it up, and will you turn again and lick up your own Vomit? Oh, do not ſo, do not run wilfully into Deſtruction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>G. F.</hi> in his Great Myſtery, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 90. ſaith, <hi>M. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41408:11"/>
               <hi>Reign, his Power is of God, and Saints are to yield to the Power; and it muſt have Honour and Obedience from the Saints.</hi> This is ſound Chriſtian Doctrine, but <hi>G. F.</hi> he oppoſes it, and ſays to this <hi>M. B.</hi> in Anſwer, <hi>Such as are turned into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and are Hypocrites, they are gone from the Higher Power, and ſo for the Lord's ſake the Saints cannot be ſubject to that Power—</hi>Again, ſays <hi>G. F. The Saints cannot now bow to that which the Pope, Kings and Queens ſet up, although they call it a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power that commands the things—For the Beaſt's Power hath ſet up your Tithes; Temples, and Colledges.</hi> This is againſt <hi>M. B.</hi> who does not plead for Obedience to things contrary to the Will of God. And this of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. is unchriſtian; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repreſents all thoſe <hi>who be of one mind,</hi> or <hi>the ſame mind and Judgment with him,</hi> not profitable Subjects to the Government. Notwithſtanding they thus contemptuouſly Print of others, whoſe Degree and Station is far more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than theirs, in reſpect of their Intereſt in the Government. Yet in a Book, called <hi>Certain Certificates,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>J. P.</hi> I find they are greatly offended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it very highly, and of ill conſequence, that one of their Preachers, being a Juſtice in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> was by one termed <hi>Prick-louſe Taylor</hi> (although he was by Trade a Taylor before) for which he was puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And <hi>G. K.</hi> I find is repreſented a very ill Perſon, becauſe he takes notice of the Severity of the Puniſhment, as from them who pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt; but this Action ſhews their Spirit is not the ſame with the Apoſtles, for <hi>they being defamed, they entreated,</hi> and did not Whip, and Fine, and take away their Goods, as the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preaching Quakers have done. Alſo to magnifie their Sufferings in Print, they fill their Books with many frivolous Stories; as in their <hi>Cry of the Oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 19. They tell a Story of <hi>a rude Boy's coming within their Meeting door when they were there, and brake wind backward, and ſaid, the Spirit moved him.</hi> This is but a Windy Story to trouble the King and both Houſes of Parliament with; but by this, and ſuch like Stories as this they Print, it may be judged what kind of Chronicles we ſhall have of their Sufferings hereafter, and whether or no ought not ſome inſpection to be made therein while Perſons concerned are living.) But ſome of your way have done worſe by and in ſome <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> calling them <hi>Bawdy-Houſes,</hi> or <hi>Whore-Houſes,</hi> as one now living knows this to be truth, and that by one who was of higher Pretenſions than a Boy. Alſo ſome other unſeemly carriages have been acted by ſome of you more offenſive than breaking Wind backwards, and that not by Boys, but Perſons of higher Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But if theſe, and giving a contemptible name to one of your Preachers, were ſo hainous a Crime, and deſerved ſuch ſevere Puniſhment alſo, but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſeverity or rigor that you uſed in Puniſhment, be of ſo ſcandalous and dangerous as they repreſent <hi>G. K.</hi> becauſe thereof, and if the Lad deſerved Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore by the ſame Rule ought your Printed Books, which ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> accordingly be taken notice of, and puniſhed accordingly, for they are more hurtful than Boys words; and as <hi>England</hi> and the Government and Governours thereof, have preference before <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> ſo is the contempts of the Laws and Governours of <hi>England</hi> Offences of greater concernment. And if it were ſuch a great Crime in <hi>G. K.</hi> to take notice of this Severity in Puniſhing for ſpeaking contemptuouſly of but one of them, a Preacher,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41408:12"/>
they are guilty alſo who excuſe and countenance theſe Printed Contempts; as for that in <hi>pag.</hi> of their Contempt of our Lord's and the Apoſtles Sufferings, and Magnifying their own. Alſo in theſe againſt the Peers and Epiſcopacy, as afore, and more eſpecially in their dooming all Eſtates and Degrees, from the Throne to the Dunghil, who pay, receive, or uphold Tithes, for Antichriſts, and denyers of Chriſt. Theſe are on Record in Print, and I am ſure more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the Perſons concerned, and more <hi>dirty, naſty,</hi> and <hi>loathſom</hi> to good Proteſtants and <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> than to term a Man <hi>Prick-louſe Taylor,</hi> who was a Taylor, although one of their <hi>Foxonian</hi> Preachers and Juſtices in <hi>Penſilvania;</hi> for that affects but that one Perſon, but theirs affects and reflects on the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the Eſtates of the Government; and other foul-mouth'd printed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of theirs here inſerted of their foul-mouth'd Language of <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. F</hi>'s. of the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> in general, and whether theſe, the Fruits of theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts, do not manifeſt them more like the grievous Wolves foretold, than Chriſt's Sheep or Lambs.</p>
            <p>Much more ſuch loathſom, dirty, naſty ſtuff of theirs may be ſeen in a Book, entituled, <hi>The Quakers Unmasked,</hi> &amp;c. And theſe arrogant Expreſſions being in their printed Books, reflect on their whole Body, until by ſome on their behalf, teſtified againſt, being Unchriſtian and Seditious. Yet ſuch is their Pride and Partiality, that they will not, or dare not diſown what their Chief Prieſts have done; but 24 of the Chief of them in <hi>London</hi> could Publiſh in <hi>the Weekly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</hi> Their diſowning of <hi>D. S.</hi> (a Chriſtian Quaker) becauſe he honeſtly confeſſed (as they all ought) that <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſome others of their Chief Prieſts were blameable. But let the Reader obſerve that honeſt Anſwer of <hi>D. S</hi>'s. to <hi>F. B.</hi> and their Errors here mentioned, and judge whether they are not of a much more dangerous Conſequence, and ſcandalous to Proteſtantiſm in general, than any thing of <hi>F. B.</hi> or <hi>D. S</hi>'s. and thereby it will appear, that the Body of <hi>Foxonian Duakers</hi> (eſpecially thoſe 26 in <hi>London)</hi> are guilty of great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and reſpecting Perſons in the higheſt degree; and thereby are great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and proved themſelves falſe Witneſſes in their fore-mentioned high boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For I did but ſpeak to a great Rabby and Teacher among them, <hi>R. S.</hi> of ſome of theſe Errors, who was ſo confident and offended, that he challenged me to ſhew him one in all the Book; and I being from my own, where I had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſome, knew not that I could find them then: But his confidence put me on a ſtricter ſearch into that Book, <hi>viz. The Great Myſtery of the Great Whore, G. F</hi>'s. Spirit, where I found abundance more than I mentioned; and indeed is ſo wicked and falſe, that it deſerves to be burnt. And I complained by Letter to three Eminent ones of them in <hi>London,</hi> of ſome of theſe Errors and Evil Deeds. I alſo wrote to another Eminent Preacher of them, of my being diſſatisfied in their countenancing the Errors of them in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> who oppoſed <hi>G. K.</hi> and perſecured him, but little notice they took. All theſe conſidered, and how they have in Print reviled that Chriſtian Quaker <hi>D. S.</hi> not only diſowning him as a Quaker, but have reflected on his Credit, in relation to his Employment, by baſe Inſinuations, as they have done by me, and ſeveral others who diſcover them, as may be ſeen in <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 10. &amp; 40.

Again, they ſay, <hi>You are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened who ſtrike at Creatures, p.</hi> 126. Behold how they have condemned themſelves, and are contrary to their own Doctrines (as they are to the Apoſtles) in their <hi>Defaming, Indicting, Impriſoning, Fining, and taking away Goods;</hi> and out of their own Mouths are they proved Guilty (in Matter of Fact) as being <hi>Falſe Prophets, Conjurers,</hi> and <hi>Diviners,</hi> and <hi>inwardly ravened;</hi> and are them our Lord commanded ſhould not be gone after. Therefore all that love our Lord Jeſus (which we do not if we keep not his Commands) turn from them, and deny them, and their Practice and Doctrine, being indeed another Goſpel. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they will what they can hinder People from Reading this, or any thing that diſcovers them: Yet you who love our Lord Jeſus, who be of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, who have Relations or Acquaintance that are deceived by their good words, and perceive not the depths of Satan among them, if you judge this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery Serviceable, uſe your endeavour to poſſeſs them with the danger of their Errors, for ſurely they are the grievous Wolves foretold of, although they have the Sheeps Cloathing of Good Words.</p>
            <p>It's not my intent hereby to make void, or undervalue the Light of Chriſt, or Spirit of God within, and Obedience thereto; for it's our Duty to walk in the Light within, but not to build thereon only, the Foundation, our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> being already laid, according to the Purpoſe and Promiſe of God. But yet that Faith, that brings not forth Fruits of Holineſs, is not the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith. And the Apoſtle doth not mention <hi>the Word,</hi> or <hi>Faith within,</hi> as the Foundation, or Object for them to truſt in only, but as the Evidence or Proof of their Faith; nor doth not aſcribe Salvation to that only, and give all our Lord's Titles and Offices to the Light within, as <hi>G. F.</hi> doth: He ſays, <hi>Now the Seed of the Woman is come, in which Seed, Chriſt, all Nations are bleſt,</hi> G. F. <hi>to all Friends every where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 2. By theſe his words, <hi>now is come,</hi> he implies a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within; but the Apoſtles Teſtimony was to him, even our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was before come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>God hath ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> (mind theſe words) it's not doth ſpeak, but hath ſpoke; and ſaith further, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation—began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed by thoſe that heard him.</hi> Theſe refer to the words of our Lord Jeſus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſpoken, as often in the Epiſtles the Saints are put in mind of the Words and Commandments of our Lord Jeſus as words without. And I Appeal to all true Chriſtians, if it be not the chief ſcope of the Goſpel, eſpecially <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who have in their Preaching Jeſus, uſed for ſubſtance moſtly the ſame words, and teſtified to the ſame Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, ſlain, taken from the Tree,</hi> and <hi>laid in</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41408:13"/>
               <hi>the Sepulchre.</hi> But if thoſe wiſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Foxonians,</hi> had been in the Apoſtles time, might not they have oppoſed with their own Reaſon, and ſaid, What, a Man that was killed and buried, laid in a Sepulchre, can he, <hi>a Finite Being, a Garment; a Veſſel;</hi> ſatisfie <hi>Infinite Juſtice?</hi> Yea, ſuch a Man as he was, can: But <hi>that within</hi> (ſay theſe) <hi>Quakers, is the only Principle, and admits not of another,</hi> W. S<hi>'s. Gatechiſm, p.</hi> 57. What, not out Lord Jeſus? Alſo; ſay they, <hi>That the ſame Spirit and Life may be enjoyed within themſelves, wherein only their Eternal well-being conſiſteth,</hi> Deep to Deep, <hi>p.</hi> 30. What Part or Office have theſe Men left for our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth's Sufferings in our Eternal well-being?</hi> But in this as well as many other of their Doctrines, they have degraded and robbed our Lord Jeſus, dividing him from Chriſt; for ſays <hi>J. Cole; The Body of the true Chriſt in which he ſuffered,</hi> &amp;c. And in their Book, entituled, <hi>The Chriſtian Society and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> &amp;c. They ſay, <hi>The ſame Chriſt that was therein crucified aſcended, pag.</hi> 5. Hereby they imply a Chriſt in Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> beſides him whom they term <hi>Veſſel</hi> or <hi>Garment, mean, contemptible, it, that;</hi> and <hi>a Chriſt in him,</hi> or <hi>therein cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:</hi> But in your next let us know who ſcourged, pierced, and laid hands on, and took down, and put into the Sepulchre this your Chriſt. But if you ſay, it is the <hi>Son or Word that was with the Father in the beginning:</hi> But as ſuch, without not only coming into Man or Fleſh, but becoming Fleſh, or Man, could he, or was it poſſible for thoſe things to be accompliſhed on him as ſuch? Your Notion makes the Prophets falſe as well as the New Teſtament, and his Blood and Death ineffectual; for it was not him, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but one in him, as your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes to be the Saviour, and ſo the ſame in Men. But the Apoſtles Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are to him, whom you call the <hi>Fleſh and the Body he took up,</hi> but he took it into himſelf, and both Natures are but one individual Jeſus Chriſt; neither had he any other Fleſh and Blood, to be the Attonement but that of the Man Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> And if there was no Remiſſion without Blood, it behoved him to become Man <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> and not as you would have it, he only came into that Man Jeſus to ſuffer thoſe things, which as <hi>the Word in the beginning</hi> only he could not, for it was his Death gave force to, and made the Promiſes Effectual to us, as himſelf ſaid to the two Diſciples, <hi>Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer thoſe things? Luke</hi> 24. And who is this Chriſt? Even <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the Jews crucified; it was him the Diſciples truſted in as the Redeemer, whom you ſay, <hi>You can never call Chriſt, but ſomething that dwelt in that Body,</hi> Iſ. P. Again, you ſay, <hi>Is not the Life called Chriſt where ever it is found—doth not the Name belong to every Member in the Body, as well as to the Head?</hi> For ſhame! no, The Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Saviour, belongs to none but to him the Head; for your Notion implies a Monſtrous Body, all Head. Again, you ſay, <hi>Such as be falſe Miniſters preach Chriſt without, and bid believe in him as he is in Heaven above, W. S</hi>'s. Primmer, <hi>p.</hi> 8. Then St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a falſe Miniſter in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. Again, you ſay, <hi>That of God within us, is the only Foundation, it's Chriſt, and being Chriſt, it muſt needs be only, and principle, admits not of another—is greateſt in being—And thus we know Chriſt in us, to be the only Principle, W. S</hi>'s. Catechiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 57. They have not only hereby laid another Foundation than our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but have rejected him; for ſay they, <hi>Your imagined God</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41408:13"/>
               <hi>beyond the Stars, and your Carnal Chriſt is denyed. To ſay, this Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, is a Lye., The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> p. 5. Again, ſay they, <hi>The Name is not given to the Veſſel, but that of him in Veſſel,</hi> Iſ. P. But was him, whom you contemptuouſly <hi>term Veſſel,</hi> ever diſtinct from or without that which you ſay, <hi>was in the Veſſel?</hi> And him you call <hi>Veſſel,</hi> the Scripture ſays is <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and Juſtifier, and the Lamb of God, who takes away the ſins of the World.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſay, <hi>Nothing that was Mortal was called Chriſt, Quakers Refuge,</hi> p. 38. Was not Jeſus Mortal when taken from thee, and laid in the Sepulchre? 30 <hi>Acts.</hi> And ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 24. This was he whom the Diſciples truſted in, to Redeem <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom you contemn. But whereas <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. does here afore make the Light in every Man to be whole Chriſt, as by their aſcribing all the Offices and Names of our Lord Jeſus to it, making that the <hi>only Principle, and admits of no other.</hi> But yet contrary thereto, ſays <hi>G. W.</hi> in his Book, <hi>The Life of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>As to Chriſt's being in every Man, that's not our Affirmation, nor Words; But that there is a Light of Chriſt in every Man.</hi> This I take to be ſound Doctrine, and if <hi>G. W.</hi> be ſincere herein, he oppoſes <hi>G. F.</hi> and they are not all <hi>of one mind,</hi> as they falſly boaſt, although they are generally guilty of that great Evil the Wiſe Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, even to advance the Servant, and degrade the Maſter. For in their treating on the Belief of what our Lord did and ſuffered without us, alſo of the belief of the Light within, they ſtate the Caſe unequally, (and therein are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt) to the undervaluing of the true Faith in our Lord Jeſus, and give prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Light within, in the Book entituled, <hi>Truth's Principles,</hi> p. 11. (my great Reſpect to that good Man, whoſe Name is to it, and the Truths therein, cauſed me to omit the Book and Name in my former Diſcovery, and I queſtion whether this Paſſage be of his wording.) <hi>There may be</hi> (ſay they) <hi>a Belief of what Chriſt did and ſuffered without, &amp;c.</hi> (mind theſe words) <hi>and the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation not known,</hi> &amp;c. But it may be the ſame alſo with a <hi>Belief of</hi> the <hi>Light within:</hi> And I appeal to your own Conſciences whether you do not believe it's ſo now with many among you. Therefore this Argument of yours is of as much force againſt <hi>the Light within,</hi> as againſt the <hi>Faith</hi> in our <hi>Lord Jeſus without us.</hi> But now obſerve farther, when they come to ſpeak of the <hi>Light within,</hi> in what advantageous terms to that they expreſs themſelves, above what they do the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of our <hi>Lord Jeſus without.</hi> For, ſay they, in the ſame Book and Page, <hi>It cannot be ſo</hi> (the Work of Regeneration not known, <hi>&amp;c.) where the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is believed on and obeyed, ſo as to have its perfect work in the Heart, to Regenerate and make all things new.</hi> Now I appeal to their Conſciences, whether or no, if our Lord Jeſus is <hi>ſo believed on and obeyed,</hi> ſo as <hi>to have his perfect work in the heart to regenerate and make all things new,</hi> whether this can be, and the <hi>Work of Regeneration not known.</hi> In the variation of their terms they have undervalued our Lord Jeſus and the true Belief in him. For they ſay, a belief <hi>of</hi> Chriſt; but of the Light they ſay, believed <hi>on.</hi> Now, there is great difference between believed <hi>of</hi> and believing <hi>on;</hi> but it's not a bare belief <hi>of,</hi> but true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt that <hi>G. K.</hi> contends for; and their Injuſtice and Partiality (even in the Caſe betwixt our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>the Light within)</hi> ſhews that they are not his Miniſters, nor is it his Goſpel they Preach. Do but compare
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41408:14"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Goſpel of Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. (it's worth reading) and theirs, and you will find theirs is another; and therefore, as in 1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 8. is accurſed, and ought to be put out of the Chriſtian Camp. And although they ſay, Chriſt and his Light are not divided, yet here to ſerve their turn, they can divide them; for if they be not divided, then they who Preach or believe in one, do the ſame in the other alſo. There is a ſilly Argument <hi>G. F.</hi> much makes uſe of to undervalue and contemn the Worth and Authority of the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 137. <hi>For the Phariſees crucified Chriſt had that which teſtified of Chriſt, the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Argument is of no more force againſt the Scriptures, than it is againſt the Light in every Man, <hi>which</hi> G. F. <hi>ſays is Chriſt;</hi> for the Phariſees and wicked Men have that Light, as well as the Scriptures, and more univerſally; for you ſay, every Man in the World have that, but few have the Scriptures in compariſon. But can you produce any ſince our Lord's Aſcenſion, who have come to Faith in him as Preach'd in the New Teſtament by the Power or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that Light, without ſome ſpecial Revelation or outward Inſtructions by Words or Writings? We can find ſome that have been deprived of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, have loſt that knowledge they had, as the Ten Tribes.</p>

            <p>And for your endeavouring to cover your wickedneſs, pretending that ſome of theſe Quotations are from <hi>J. P</hi>'s.

Saith he, <hi>Whereas it's ſaid, I would have burnt all thoſe Books; I ſay, I would not have burnt any more than what was already burnt,</hi> (which was about a quarter of a ſheet of Paper, and a News Book or two at moſt, therefore not <hi>the Bible</hi> to be ſure, as you wickedly and falſly ſay.) <hi>I ſay</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I ſhould not have done it to gain the World.</hi> Again, ſays he, <hi>The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is, I would have burnt the Bible—rather than I would burn that, or the leaſt Leaf thereof that may be ſerviceable, I ſhould rather Sacrifice my Life.</hi> This, and much more of his in Print above 25 Years ſince about that Slander, theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts now ſpread againſt him: Rather than want a Sacrifice for their Fury, they will, as far as they can, ſlay a Man's Reputation, although it be ſo falſe and ſcandalous a Work, that the Chief Prieſts themſelves dare not appear in it, but it muſt be done by this their Servant <hi>Edward Pennington, Acts</hi> 24. 2. Becauſe this Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath been ſerviceable to diſcover their Wickedneſs, therefore they are tormented and rage (as one <hi>Sanders,</hi> a Wine-Cooper, did lately on the <hi>Exchange</hi> come to him, and there openly give him worſe Language than that that they puniſhed one for giving to <hi>S. Jennings,</hi> one of their Chief Prieſts; and yet this of that foul mouth'd <hi>Sanders</hi> was without any Provocation, or word ſpoken to him.) And <hi>the Bible</hi> is but a fallacious pretence for them to cover their Envy with, but their Envy and Rage was becauſe Contempt was juſtly ſhewn to their Erroneous Pamphlets; for they contemn the Scripture, terming it Blaſphemy to ſay, <hi>it's the Word of God,</hi> but entitle <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Pamphlets ſo; and they excuſe this <hi>G. F.</hi> but can ſlander others on <hi>Credible Information:</hi> And <hi>it's ſaid,</hi> but it's not only <hi>ſaid,</hi> but proved, that <hi>G. Fox, &amp;c.</hi> were wicked Men in matter of Fact, and ſo is this the High-Prieſt's Servant, <hi>Edward Pennington.</hi> Alſo in their Title Page they make <hi>C. C. Achan,</hi> and they can bring Scripture, as their fore-Father did, that <hi>T. C.</hi> ought to be ſtoned. But they are in this, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more, proved ſelf-condemned Apoſtates, according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Doctrine, as well as by Scripture; for they do that to others they would not have done to themſelves, and therein ſhew they love not Chriſt, becauſe they keep not his Commands: And indeed the whole Work of this falſe, envious, ſelf-exalted, contemptuous Spirit of theirs, ſhews it is the <hi>Great Myſtery of the Great Whore,</hi> as themſelves entitle their Book, not only by their Reproaches and Slanders, but by their Flatteries, <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>He that hateth, diſſembles with his lips—</hi>

               <hi>when he ſpeaks fair, believe him not—but his hatred being covered with deceit, his wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed,</hi> 26 Proverbs. And although they endeavour to excuſe their Errors by ſome ſound Expreſſions in their Books, but there are few if any Hereticks, or their Books, but ſpeak ſome Truths; but they muſt not excuſe the Errors, for it's them which be objected againſt, and not the Truths; but them Truths are but as the Golden Cup in the Hand of the Great Whore, to allure People to drink of her deadly Poyſon; and do, <hi>as the dead-Fly, cauſe the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour.</hi> And that People may not be thereby decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I am concerned to diſcover the wicked <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>this Great Whore, G. F</hi>'s. Spirit, which, as they ſay, <hi>excels all;</hi> therefore I expect they will allow me to give it the preference, and not be angry. I do not attend their Lot, but if I ſhould take their Example, and Print againſt them what I have by <hi>Credible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as it's ſaid,</hi> much filthineſs would appear to be under their Skirts: And this Spirit of theirs cannot be the Spirit of Truth, for that was to lead into Truth, but theirs have lead them into Untruth and Error, therefore is Antichriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they call it <hi>Light.</hi> And there was a Generation who called Darkneſs Light, but if that Light in you be Darkneſs, how great is that Darkneſs? And for your Charge, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that I incenſe the Magiſtrates againſt you, becauſe I cite ſome of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Errors about Civil Government; that is alſo falſe, and your own Printed Doctrine and Practiſes ſufficiently warrant me therein. See your wicked Pamphlets, <hi>Truth's Character, &amp;c. p.</hi> 15. Say you, <hi>Muſt not Jealouſie be ſtirred up in the Powers of the Earth againſt them, as they have againſt others—</hi>(and ſay you) <hi>As they have ſought to make others ridiculous, even ſo ſhall they become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</hi> I can give you an whole Book of theſe your wickedneſs, and not out of the <hi>Quaker unmask'd</hi> neither, as you falſely inſinuate, although I refer to that, becauſe much of your Wickedneſs is there collected together out of ſome others. I wiſh you had minded what I before ſaid to you in <hi>Animadverſions, &amp;c. p.</hi> 11. Lay your hands on your mouths, if you have any ſhame left: But I ſhall not now trouble my ſelf to take notice of all your Slanders and Untruths, becauſe it's not for my own Vindication that I contend, but for the true Faith in our Lord Jeſus, as it was delivered to us by the Holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles; therefore I no more mind this Servant of the High-Prieſt's, <hi>Edward Pennington</hi>'s <hi>ſmiting</hi> me, than was taken of his Predeceſſor, in <hi>23d.</hi> of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but I rather obſerve the Advice in 26 <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 4 &amp; 5 <hi>Verſes.</hi> For ſuch <hi>evil men muſt grow worſe and worſe, foaming out their own ſhame,</hi> but their Folly muſt be made manifeſt unto all Men. And I fear not but the ſame Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who hath delivered me from the Paw of <hi>J. Field,</hi> and from the Mouth of <hi>G. Whitehead, Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, will alſo deliver me from this uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> the High-Prieſt's Servant, <hi>Ed. Pennington.</hi> And for their Rage becauſe I diſcover <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Errors now he is dead, but theſe Errors are living; and they have done much worſe by <hi>J.

F.</hi> alſo agravated by you in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to preſerve that which is for Deſtruction, 10 <hi>Proverbs</hi> 7. And its not intended to prejudice any, as you falſly ſurmiſe, nor can any harm be to you, but good. If you be Chriſtians, you muſt deny thoſe groſs Errors in Print; for either
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41408:16"/>
               <hi>G. Fox, W. Pen, &amp;c.</hi> had them from the mouth of the Lord, or they were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, Diviners,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> (you muſt own or condemn them) and ſuch <hi>their mouths muſt be ſtopped,</hi> much more their Books, being much worſe than Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Errors, eſpecially as you magnifie the Authors; for the Devil may no more ſpeak in your Books than by word of mouth. See your <hi>Diſcoverers, &amp;c. p.</hi> 5. And whereas theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts charge me for abuſing <hi>G. F.</hi> becauſe I ſay he claimed to be <hi>Equal with God.</hi> I have now the Book which <hi>G. F.</hi> pretends to Anſwer in <hi>Great Myſtery, p.</hi> 67. from whence I took that Sentence; and although there <hi>G. F.</hi> only ſays, <hi>Thou makeſt a great pudder that any ſhould witneſs he is equal with God;</hi> but he, <hi>G. F.</hi> is there poſitively charged in the Book, entituled, <hi>A Brief Relation of the Irreligion, &amp;c. p.</hi> 2. The words be thus: <hi>G. F. hath avowed himſelf over and over, to be equal with God; and being asked in preſence of many Perſons there named, whether he was equal with God, as he had before been heard to affirm? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I am equal with God.</hi> And ſaith the Book, this hath been atteſted on Oath before the Juſtices of the Seſſions, and alſo the Judge at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Aſſizes, 1652. Now, to all this, and more, <hi>G. F.</hi> Anſwers, as above, <hi>Thou makeſt a great pudder, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had not ſo affirmed of himſelf. But if he did not ſo ſay, why did not he deny it? But that he durſt not, becauſe of ſo many Witneſſes. But he, <hi>G. F.</hi> takes no notice of the Man's charging him as <hi>avowing</hi> it, but would by his Juggling Anſwer blind the Readers, that they might not know he had ſo affirmed of himſelf, but that he were only a Witneſs. But the Charge was not for ſaying, the Holy Ghoſt was equal with God, but that he, <hi>G. F.</hi> was ſo, and he anſwered in the Affirmative. Alſo in <hi>pag.</hi> 3. he is charged to have ſaid, he was <hi>the Chriſt, the Eternal Judge of the World,—</hi>he paſſes it by, and does not deny it, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to other impertinent things, and ſpends almoſt a Page to prove the falſe Prophets were come in the Apoſtles time, thereby to blind People, that he may not be ſuſpected as one, as if becauſe there were ſuch then, therefore he could not be one; but although there had been many before him, yet he might be one alſo: But I obſerve it was his way to make People believe him to be in the Truth by manifeſting others Errors, and thereby prevailed on People to believe him without due Tryal. And notwithſtanding it's ſo plainly charged in Print that <hi>G. F.</hi> did ſay, he <hi>was equal with God,</hi> and he does not deny it, but by ſhifts and Quibbles vindicates it, as from the Aſſemblies Catechiſm, allowing <hi>the Holy Ghoſt equal with God;</hi> which is beſides the Queſtion, which was, whether he, <hi>G. F.</hi> was ſo, and not whether <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was equal with God;</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwered, he was. Yet theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Prieſts, to blind People, charge me with abuſing him, becauſe I do not cite his long ſide-long Quibbles. And I have now another Book, entituled, <hi>The Perfect Phariſee, &amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>pag.</hi> 1. where it's ſaid, it was propoſed to <hi>G. F. Whether he was equal with God? In Anſwer thereto, he,</hi> G. F. <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively affirmed, I am equal with God.</hi> Alſo in the ſame Page it's ſaid, <hi>J. N.</hi> was asked, <hi>Whether he believed any could be as Holy—as God himſelf?</hi> And he, <hi>J. N. anſwered, He did witneſs that he himſelf was as Holy as God.</hi> Several other Errors are there charged on them, which <hi>G. F.</hi> does not deny, but over-looks them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be in the beginning of the Book) unto the <hi>19th.</hi> Page, where he begins to take notice of ſome Impertinencies, and ſo all along the Book, being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41408:16"/>
51 Pages. Alſo I have another Book, entituled, <hi>The Scornful Quaker, &amp;c.</hi> where <hi>G. F.</hi> practiſes his old Trade of falſe Citing and Perverting, as I ſhall ſhew in time; but this is now to prove the Pride and Self-exaltedneſs of his Spirit. One <hi>M. B.</hi> ſays of <hi>our Lord Jeſus, he knew our thoughts—all our ways, and who ſhould betray him—never the leaſt Error-nor deceived,</hi> &amp;c. Much more he ſays in three or four Pages, how far our Lord Jeſus excelled all Saints, and they inferiour to him in Knowledge and <hi>Infallibility:</hi> But he, <hi>M. B.</hi> does allow <hi>the Saints do partake of the Nature and Fulneſs of God,</hi> p. 92. But, ſaith he, <hi>They are not the Father, nor the Godhead in fulneſs, nor in part.</hi> Yet <hi>G. F.</hi> is ſo wicked in his 89 Page to ſay, in Anſwer to this, <hi>Thou ſayeſt, they</hi> (Saints) <hi>have no part of the fulneſs of God,</hi> quite contrary to what the Man ſays. Here is an Untruth, and a falſe Accuſation, and Perverſion, and falſe Quotation in theſe few words; and yet this Spirit that is thus groſsly wicked in him, the <hi>Foxonian</hi> High-Prieſt, <hi>W. Penn,</hi> ſays, <hi>he excels them all;</hi> and nothing leſs than <hi>being equal with God,</hi> and <hi>as he is in this World,</hi> will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie this Self-exalted Spirit; but as I have ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, this Spirit could not be the Spirit of Truth our Lord promiſed the Diſciples he would ſend, becauſe it's ſo wicked and untrue, therefore is Antichriſt. But to return to this good humble Chriſtian, <hi>M. B.</hi> After he had ſhewed how our Lord ſurpaſſed any Saint, yet he allows that they <hi>partake of his fulneſs in meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. But this would not ſerve <hi>G. F.</hi> becauſe he, <hi>M. B.</hi> ſays, <hi>Our knowledge of others is by Obſervation, or by Fruits, or by ſpecial Revelation,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—We know not the way of God in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits until it be written on their foreheads, and ſo</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are not as Chriſt in that reſpect.</hi> And again (ſays <hi>M. B.) But the Quaker is bolder than all his fore-fathers, he knows a Man as ſoon as ever he ſees him, or whether he be a Saint or a Devil, though the Man diſcover not himſelf by word or action, yet the Quaker knows him, and all that he may be, as Chriſt is.</hi> Much of this <hi>G. F.</hi> quotes (although not truly) in his 89 Page; and in Anſwer, ſays to this <hi>M. B. Here thou haſt ſhewn that the Quakers have a Spirit given to them beyond all the fore-fathers (which we do witneſs) ſince the days of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy; and they</hi> (Quakers) <hi>can diſcern who be Saints, and who are Devils,—without ſpeaking ever a word.</hi> And in <hi>pag.</hi> 31. ſays <hi>G. F. Are upon the Throne—</hi>And then farther, ſays <hi>G. F. As Chriſt is, ſo are we in this preſent World;</hi> and theſe words are not put in a different Character for Scripture. And then farther on, ſays <hi>G. F. Thou art an ignorant Man—not knowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they</hi> (People) <hi>be in, unleſs they tell thee.</hi> Obſerve, <hi>G. F.</hi> cites this <hi>M. B</hi>'s. words as an Error, becauſe he, <hi>M. B.</hi> ſaid, <hi>We are not as Chriſt is in this reſpect;</hi> and does banter this good humble Chriſtian, <hi>M. B.</hi> for ſo ſaying; and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>M. B.</hi> ſays, <hi>As he is ſo are we,</hi> &amp;c. All this plainly proves <hi>G. F.</hi> did claim himſelf and wicked Spirit <hi>to be Infallible in Knowledge, and as Chriſt is in that reſpect;</hi> and not only that God's Spirit was ſo (for that was not denyed) but that himſelf and the Quakers was ſo, as further appears, comparing this with <hi>p.</hi> 5, 10, 11. in his oppoſing <hi>W. T.</hi> and <hi>R. F.</hi> when he, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſo Luciferian-like aſſumes to himſelf and his wicked Spirit <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he with both the ſame Perſons is guilty of falſe Citing, falſe Accuſing, Perverſion, and Lyes: And it is not, as <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Charitable Eſſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 6. by his wicked Quibbles would inſinuate, as if <hi>G. F.</hi> intended to know Peoples ſtates only by <hi>their proud and lofty Looks, wanton, ſcornful,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41408:17"/>
               <hi>envious, and fallen Countenances, which teſtifie againſt them,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. W.</hi> But I am into this wilful wickedneſs of his will teſtifie againſt him, for his Conſcience knows better, becauſe this <hi>M. B.</hi> did allow, and ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 93. <hi>Our knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is by Obſervation, Fruit, and appearance of Things in the outward Man, or by ſpecial Revelation from God: Otherwiſe</hi> (ſays <hi>M. B.) all other mens Spirits are in the dark to us.</hi> Here it's plain this <hi>M. B.</hi> allows as much as <hi>G. W.</hi> by his Quibbles would make believe <hi>G. F.</hi> claimed. But this would not content <hi>G. F.</hi> nothing leſs than <hi>being as Chriſt is in this reſpect of knowing mens inward conditions, without diſcovery by word or action;</hi> for that which <hi>G. W.</hi> pretends to by Looks or Actions, is a ſort of telling; but ſaith <hi>G. F. Thou art an ignorant Man—not knowing the condition they be in, unleſs they tell thee.</hi> And alſo <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes <hi>M. B</hi>'s. ſaying <hi>the Saints are not the Father, they are not the Godhead, neither in fulneſs nor part,</hi> although this <hi>M. B.</hi> do allow <hi>they partake of the Nature and Fulneſs of God.</hi> And for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof of <hi>G. F</hi>'s. aſſuming Infallibility, in <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he ſays, <hi>S. E.</hi> ſays, <hi>That which is within them is not Eternal and Infallible,</hi> &amp;c. Now in <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>S. E. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the Saints have the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in them, which is Eternal and Infallible,</hi> &amp;c. Now here is a groſs Slander <hi>G. F.</hi> Prints againſt this Man, quite contrary to his expreſs words, and this proves him and his Spirit wicked and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and a deluder of the People. Therefore what heed or Credit can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to theſe mens Printed Books, that dare now Print ſuch groſs Slanders and Lyes? What may not they Print hereafter, when theſe Perſons and their Books be extinct? For moſt that are wrote againſt them are ſticht Pamphlets, now they re-print theirs in Volumes, and ſo preſerve them to Poſterity, to defame this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and their Religion, and thereby exalt themſelves and their Errors. And as I ſaid before, <hi>S. E.</hi> did not deny they had the Infallible Spirit in them, but owns it; but does deny that <hi>that Spirit ſhould do and ſay all that Saints do or ſay, and ſhould judge for them both, for perſons and of things after an Infallible manner; and that they ſhould neither ſay, nor do, nor judge any thing by any underſtanding of their own, but the Spirit; all this we deny,</hi> ſays <hi>S. E.—</hi>And farther, ſays he, <hi>So far as we judge according to this word,</hi> (of Chriſt) <hi>our Judgment becomes Infallible; and ſo we may ſpeak of Peoples preſent condition with much certainty—</hi>(but ſaith he) <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their future, final ſtate, we muſt leave them to the Judgment of God.</hi> And correſpondent with this humble Chriſtian doth <hi>W. Thomas</hi> ſay. But this would not ſerve <hi>G. F.</hi> but to oppoſe this <hi>S. E.</hi> and ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>Which is contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who ſaith, as many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God, and Chriſt acts all in them, and for them—and that is it which leads the Saints to divide and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all things both Spiritual and Temporal.</hi> Now here you may ſee, although <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not aſcribe Infallibility to his Fleſh and Bone, yet he pretends its <hi>the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit guides him and them in all they do or ſay;</hi> for it's that this <hi>S. E.</hi> diſowns, and <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes him. And although <hi>G. F.</hi> does, as above, falſly quote him, as ſaying, <hi>That within them is not Infallible,</hi> &amp;c. yet but three lines lower himſelf quotes him allowing <hi>all Saints have the Spirit in them, which is Infallible;</hi> therefore ſuch a falſe Accuſer as <hi>G. F.</hi> needs a better memory: For its not the having of the <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> that this <hi>S. E.</hi> denies, but, as he alſo ſays in <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>Though there be the ſame Spirit in Saints that gave forth Scripture, yet all Saints have not the ſame</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41408:17"/>
               <hi>Inſpiration as the Prophets and Apoſtles had, ſo as they ſhould he able to give forth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truths, and immediately diſcover the pure and clear will of God, as the Prophets and Apoſtles did.</hi> This compared with what is juſt afore, ſhews he allowed enough for any Chriſtian, although it would not ſerve <hi>G. F.</hi> but he and his wicked falſe Spirit muſt be as <hi>God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And this <hi>S. E.</hi> ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. <hi>The Spirit that they call Chriſt within</hi> them, <hi>ſpeaking and acting all Infallible that they do or ſay; and that it's not they, but Chriſt and the Spirit within them.</hi> Saith <hi>S. E. Now it doth appear it is a Spirit of Deluſion, becauſe it contradicts both Chriſt and the Scriptures.</hi> And although <hi>G. F.</hi> does not here aſcribe Infallibility to his Fleſh and Bone, yet he does imply that all he ſaid and did, was by that Infallible Spirit in him; and ſo this and all other his untruths, are not his, but his Infallible Spirit within, which was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly a wicked one. And this ſhews <hi>G. W.</hi> a meer Quibbler in his Pretences about <hi>G. F.</hi> aſſuming Infallibility, as if it were only a knowing by <hi>looks or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance,</hi> or, as he falſly ſays, <hi>by a Spirit of Diſcerning given to ſome in the Church.</hi> But that, as I have ſhewed, was allowed <hi>G. F.</hi> yet it would not content him; and the Objections are not made againſt the poſſibility of ſuch a Gift, but againſt the Saints or Miniſters of the Goſpel in general having it, and <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> themſelves in particular, which he, <hi>G. F.</hi> did, in oppoſition to them, maintain they had. And for your ſhameleſs Quibble, that <hi>G. F.</hi> did <hi>not aſcribe Infallibility to Perſons but as influenced by the Spirit;</hi> it's fully proved he hath by blaming others, as I have ſhewed it, aſcribed it to themſelves as Perſons; and who of you that are not Infallible, are by his Doctrine <hi>Conjurers, Falſe Prophets, and Diviners:</hi> But that is alſo but a pitiful Evaſion, as I aforeſaid, although he does not aſcribe it to his Fleſh and Bone, yet he does pretend he was acted by that, and that which ſpoke and acted by or through him, was Chriſt, or the Infallible Spirit; and as you ſay in your <hi>Diſcoverer, &amp;c.</hi> He gave the Name Chriſt to ſomething in him. And it's juſtly come on him to be detected of ſo many Untruths and falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Men, and perverting and mangling their words and ſenſe, (and making them ſpeak Non-ſence) as a warning to others, not to be ſo preſompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for I think this his <hi>Great Myſtery, &amp;c.</hi> is the greateſt Myſtery of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this Age hath produced of a Book. And his, <hi>G. F</hi>'s. Errors and Falſeneſs is not eaſily found out by reading only his own Writings or Sayings, for he writes ſo fallaciouſly, ſeldom plainly affirming or denying, but in a double, two-fac'd, looſe way, moſtly by Queries; that it's difficult to know his meaning, ſo as to prove a thing againſt him; but by reading thoſe Mens Writings whom he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his drift is better underſtood than by his own, for they, like honeſt Chriſtians, plainly affirm and deny, which he ſeldom doth. And therefore who would fully and truly underſtand <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. their Principles, they muſt read their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents Books. But for this <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> it is ſo falſe in Fact, that I fear many more of theirs be of the ſame kind, if ſtrictly examined by underſtanding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, capacitated for ſo great and ſerviceable a Work; for I think it's of great Concernment to the whole Nation, eſpecially who take on them Care and Cure of Souls; and it's obſervable, where ever <hi>G. F.</hi> ſo highly pleads for his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt thoſe humble Chriſtians, who honeſtly acknowledge they have it not, (as the Apoſtles) he, <hi>G. F.</hi> in the ſame place, and with the ſame Perſons, is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41408:18"/>
guilty of ſome more than uſual Falſity, as I have in this and other Inſtances ſhewed; indeed he hath abundantly proved the Fallibility and Wickedneſs of himſelf and Spirit, and not only as to himſelf, but as the ſame Spirit doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and guide the now <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and the other <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> who Rule now among theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers; who, although they may alter their terms or words about our Lord Jeſus, as they do about their Infallibility, yet that's no Evidence of their altering their Judgment; and as the Infallibility of them and their Spirit is gone, ſo is alſo their Perfection; for neither they nor their Spirit is no more Perfect than Infallible, which is not at all, but on the contrary falſe and Fallible. I could give you a whole Book of Proofs of their Pretences to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, but theſe are enough to ſhew them and their Spirit's wickedneſs and falſeneſs.</p>
            <p>Alſo to further manifeſt the wickedneſs of theſe <hi>Foxonian</hi> Chief Prieſts, whereas I quoted <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſing <hi>T.

F.</hi> who not only oppoſes the Truth, but in citing <hi>T. M</hi>'s. words in his 135 <hi>pag.</hi> does by him there, as his uſual manner was; he here alſo leaves out, and adds, and of forty words takes but eight, and adds the word <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and cutting the Sentence in two, leaves out the moſt material words, and takes a few out of the middle of the Sentence. Now from all theſe judge ye who is wicked; <hi>T. C.</hi> in forgetting an inſignificant Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis and <hi>and,</hi> or <hi>G.

Spirit or Light, as in the work of our Salvation.) Although he dare not deny, yet ſidelongly miſrepreſents <hi>T. M</hi>'s. Doctrine; as farther, he brings in <hi>T. M.</hi> ſaying, <hi>And that Chriſt our Juſtification ſhould be in us, that dyed and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that aſcended, this</hi> (ſays G. F.) <hi>he calls a fancy, to fancy him in a particular Perſon.</hi> But <hi>T. M</hi>'s. words in <hi>pag.</hi> 59. are thus, (ſpeaking of <hi>J. N.) Doth he not mean</hi> (ſays T.

M</hi>'s. 70 words, G.

               </gap> further Proof of the wickedneſs of theſe <hi>Foxonians,</hi> I find <hi>G.

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41408:19"/>
               <hi>us in our particular Perſons.</hi> Now, <hi>pag.</hi> 61. <hi>T. M.</hi> ſays to <hi>J. N.</hi> thus: <hi>Doſt not thou herein ſignifie that the end of thy Meſſage—was to Preach down that Perſon, and thoſe Works wrought and finiſhed in that Perſon in his own Body, as diſtinct from every one of us, and without us in our particular Perſons, which the Apoſtle ſaid, ſhall remain in the Eſſence of the Perſon—with the Father for ever.</hi> Now, of <hi>T. M</hi>'s. 40 words <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 16, and changes his word <hi>Perſon</hi> into the word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and leaves out all the moſt material words, wickedly miſrepreſenting <hi>T. M.</hi> as oppoſing Chriſt's being in his People, and as if that were the chief matter of their difference, as by his Anſwer, <hi>the Apoſtle ſaid, Chriſt was in them,</hi> &amp;c. Which, as I have ſhewed, this <hi>T. M.</hi> did own, and not deny; therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> herein is not only a perverſe Diſputer, but very fallacious; for by the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> which <hi>T.

For it was the <hi>denyal of him and the works wrought and finiſhed in that one Perſon in his own Body without us,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe <hi>G. F.</hi> leaves out; and it was not, as I afore ſhewed, Chriſt's being in them, but the contemning the Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus in his own Perſon and Body, that this <hi>T. M.</hi> oppoſes <hi>J. N.</hi> for, and does aſſert the Dignity and abiding Worth and Merit of them for Salvation, in Oppoſition to any thing wrought in any Man, as <hi>G.

Books, that it was as I ſaid, not Chriſt being in the Saints, as Scripture holds, for that this <hi>T. M.</hi> oppoſed <hi>J. N.</hi> in, but <hi>J. N</hi>'s. preferring the Works of the Light or Spirit within his Fleſh or Perſon, to the Works wrought and finiſhed in and by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our Lord Jeſus in his own Perſon, or Body diſtinct from and without us. This was the chief matter in debate between <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>T.

And now I find their wickedneſs in pretending that <hi>G. F.</hi> meant, <hi>That Chriſt, who ſuffered without, ſhould be revealed within us,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. <hi>Diſcoverer, &amp;c.</hi> No, I find that was no part of the Controverſie, but about the Value and Dignity of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> his Perſonal Sufferings and Righteouſneſs in his own Perſon, which this <hi>T. M.</hi> did magnifie, in oppoſition to <hi>J. N</hi>'s. Preaching them down, and magnifie and exalt ſomething in themſelves in room thereof: And I now find it apparently that <hi>G. F.</hi> as well as <hi>J. N.</hi> did here intend to undervalue the Perſon, Blood, and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus, altho not <hi>publiſh that Chriſt's Sufferings were within man only;</hi> for you may allow he did ſuffer without, but that does not excuſe <hi>G. F</hi>'s. contempt of his Sufferings, as you allow his Blood was ſhed, but allow it to be no more than the Blood of another Saint, and ſo his Perſon and Sufferings; and although you pretend a high value for the Blood of Chriſt, it's not that Blood of the Body of that Man and Perſon our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that you mean, but ſuch a Perſon, and ſuch Blood as <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>G. Fox</hi> had in them; for ſays G. F. <hi>They eat his Fleſh, and drank his Blood, then it was within them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 136. But could the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> be preſent in Spirit, although abſent in Body, and cannot our Lord Jeſus his Fleſh

and Blood likewiſe? Take the Pillory to your ſelves, there's no room for <hi>T.

            <p>Here is a great deal of Wickedneſs as well as Envy againſt me manifeſt in this one Paſſage more than I can diſcover; but I hope the Lord will raiſe up ſome more abler to detect their Wickedneſs, and defend the true Faith; for indeed they are ſo Rich and Numerous, that without a Miracle it's not likely ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Perſons as <hi>G. K. E. B.</hi> and my ſelf ſhould be able to carry on ſo great a Work; for by their ſtrength of Purſe and Perſons, and Intereſt they have ſo ſpread their Erroneous Books, they have great Advantage, and Truth ſuffers; but I am not out of hopes but that our Lord Jeſus and the true Faith ſhall and will overcome, whatever my Lot may be from them who take ſuch a ſmall and cauſeleſs occaſion to revile me, when themſelves are guilty in ſuch an abominable degree: This ſhews that if they had Power they would be as kind to me as they were to the poor Lad they cruelly whipt for throwing a little dirt or duſt on one of them. And for further Proof of their contempt of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his Blood and Sufferings, I find they in <hi>Penſilvania</hi> charge <hi>G. K.</hi> with Hereſie, and for Proof of their Charge bring his ſaying, <hi>The Light within was not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe;</hi> and he, <hi>G.

(Much more ſuch I could cite out of this Book, but I believe they will think this enough.) But if it be ſuch <hi>a damnable</hi> ſin in this Juſtice to uſe one <hi>et caetera,</hi> how will they <hi>damn</hi> me, who have uſed ſo many <hi>et caetera's</hi> in Controverſie with them? Can any one Copy out their own Condemnation more exacter and effectually than theſe, <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> have done theirs, by this afore exclaiming againſt others for calling them <hi>Quakers,</hi> and putting <hi>et cetera</hi> into their <hi>Mittimus.</hi> For if their Perſecuting by Fine, and Impriſoning <hi>R Bradford,</hi> and taking away his Working-Tools in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania;</hi> alſo their Proſecuting of <hi>F. Bugg</hi> by Indictment, as Seditious, and for Scandal or Deſaming them, and Printing without Licenſe, and complaint againſt him to the Secretary of State, when themſelves greatly guilty of the ſame Crimes they falſly and maliciouſly proſecuted <hi>F. Bugg</hi> for. I ſay, theſe truly conſidered, they, the <hi>Foxonian Quakers,</hi> have manifeſted themſelves as unjuſt, and as great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders as this Juſtice they ſo exclaim againſt, and their Proceedings as unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and deſerving Puniſhment more than what they ſo complain of. And if they be not <hi>Self-condemned Apoſtates,</hi> there is none in this Age; for theſe Actions of theirs be much worſe than terming them Quakers, and uſing the word <hi>et cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera,</hi> which they ſo <hi>damn</hi> and the uſers thereof. I ſhall not trouble you with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations hereon, there needs little, only I mind how they here alſo endeavour to magnifie and exalt their own Sufferings, to undervalue them of our Lord and the Apoſtles and Martyrs, as is afore ſhewed by <hi>E. B.</hi> And if it be ſuch a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crime, and ſo puniſhable, to term them <hi>Quakers,</hi> how much more guilty

and puniſhable are they by their own Judgment, who have ſo groſly <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> by <hi>hateful names and terms of Reproach,</hi> Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as is a fore ſhewn, it deſerves to be taken notice of. I find their Books ſtufft with ſuch baſe Inſinuations and Defamations of almoſt all People, that the chief drift of them ſeems to be to render the New Teſtament and the true Faith in our Lord Jeſus, and the Miniſters and Profeſſors thereof Infamous and worſe than the Papiſts, and are ſo bold to adviſe and direct to the taking away and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Property: Let their own above <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <hi>G. K. F. B.</hi> and my ſelf, ſeeing our Lord Jeſus himſelf, the Scriptures, Laws, Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, and all Chriſtendom, have not eſcaped their contempts. Now, <hi>G.

For your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in general terms, <hi>Whoever he be.</hi> For here is more of your Envious terms given to the Miniſtry in general; as <hi>Conjurers, raiſing dead Doctrines out of the Letter, which is Death; notable Conjurers, Thieves, Robbers, Antichriſts, Prieſts of</hi> Baal,<hi>—cannot ſhew any Scripture for their beaſtly Worſhip, Witches, Devils, Lyars—Stewards of the Devil's Magazine, Diſſemblers, a Viperous and Serpentine Generation, going about to murder and ſtrangle the Child Jeſus, Blaſphemers—yea, of the Devil, Scarlet-colour'd Beaſts—ſelling beaſtly Ware—the Letter, which is Duſt and Death—greedy Dogs, really they are Blood-Hounds, ſtill hunting and gaſping after their Prey, like the mouth of Hell, barking and raging like</hi> Sodomites, <hi>of the Devil—woe is the Portion of the upholders of that Generation.</hi> And ask <hi>W.

Now I have diſcovered ſo much of their wickedneſs, I expect they will damn me worſe than they have done the Biſhops and Juſtice (for terming them Quakers, and uſing the <hi>et caetera,</hi> for ſurely they are the fierce Deſpiſers fore-told of) but I am not afraid of the whole Hoſt of them, if they Curſe me, as <hi>G.

But as <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays, <hi>I am not the Man that gives out things to lay open wickedneſſes, but that Men my take warning, and fear, and come to know themſelves.</hi>
