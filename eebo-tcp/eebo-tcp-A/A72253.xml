            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the thinges contained therein: and ſecondly that he ſhould bee ſtrong, and of a good courage, not to feare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee faint hearted, for (ſaith God) <hi>I will bee with thee at hande which way ſoeuer thou goeſt.</hi> Whatſoeuer <hi>Saule</hi> doth pretende of the intent of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and of his fearing the people, yet <hi>Samuel</hi> ſheweth him what was indeed the true cauſe of his wilfull rebellion in ſparing the cattell of the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>turned thy ſelfe to the prey and doone wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in the ſight of GOD.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſpoyles of enemies is a thing of it ſelfe not vnlawfull in thoſe which are authoriſed and armed with the ſworde of Iuſtice: for ſundrye times did <hi>Dauid</hi> carie away ſpoyles euen from the <hi>Amalekites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 3.12. 1.

Againe though it be permitted in lawfull warre
<pb facs="tcp:150945:76"/>
to cary away the ſpoyles of ſuch enemies as the Lord ſhall deliuer into our hands, yet is it not lawfull to ſet our heart vpon the ſpoyle, &amp; to make that as it were the principal drift of our labours and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, as heere it is ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> that hee turned himſelfe to the prey, as ſetting his heart eſpecially vpon it:<note place="margin">Eph. 5. v. 5. Phil. 3. v. 19.</note> Which if he did of a couetous affection, then did hee make <hi>Mammon</hi> his Idoll: If he did it for his owne feeding and refreſhing, then did hee make his belly his God and his glory to his ſhame: If he did it to pleaſe man, then was it alſo ſpirituall whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Idolatrie, As Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Iam. 4. v. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>O ye adulterers and adultereſſes know ye not the friendſhip of the world is enmitie againſt God? If any man will be a friende of the world, he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the enemie of God.</hi> So that euery way this rebellion of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt the commaundement of God may bee fitly compared with the ſinne of Idolatrie. The fourth thing wherein rebellion may well be compared with witchcraft and Idolatrie, is in ſundry effects which they do equally worke in the hearts &amp; eſtates
<pb facs="tcp:150945:76"/>
of men: as firſt they do harden and make obſtinate the heart of man. In witches what one amongſt a thouſand hath in many years bene ſeene to returne to the Lord by vnfained repentance?
