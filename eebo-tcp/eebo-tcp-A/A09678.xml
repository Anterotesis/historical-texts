         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

alacrity to vndergoe the burthen of theſe graue studies,
which my function inceſſantly requireth. In the <hi>interim</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:15130:3"/>
finding it to containe matter of pleaſure and profite, I
thought it a fit ſubiect for my exerciſe, to employ theſe

ſpare or steale from my grauer ſtudies) in the tranſlating
of it into the Engliſh tongue, taking more delight in theſe

ſometime Councellor vnto two mighty Emperors,
<hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and by them
employed in diuers weighty affaires of the Empire, among
forraine Princes, which he managed with great wiſedome
and credit. Hee was for the ſpace of many yeeres peſtered
with the force of Dame <hi>Podagras</hi> furie, and repented that
he was deluded, or rather befooled by fooliſh Phyſicians,

through theſe Countries where the waters were corrupt

more wiſe, and found more eaſe, &amp;c. What I haue done in

this, may eaſily perceiue: what was ſuperfluous, I haue
pruned: what was <hi>vitio Impreſſoris,</hi> defectiue, I haue

of the Incondite,
rude and vnlearned vulgar,
which are not ſo much led

aptly call <gap reason="foreign">

Truth, for a time may be oppreſſed, (God ſo diſpoſing for
our puniſhment, or tryall) but finally ſuppreſſed it cannot
be. Truth is ſtronger then all falſhood: it is <hi>temporis filia,</hi> the

if it be, I doubt not but truth ſhall be of more validitie with
you, then the malice, enuie and taunts of all men. For, I

And, I againe would aske theſe iolly fellowes, mine
accuſers, Why doe Children hate their Schoole-maſters,
though neuer ſo wiſe and learned? Why doe wicked men
contemne good Lawes? Is it not becauſe the Schoole-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
laboureth to furniſh the minds of his Schollers with
good Arts, and diſcipline; that they may hereafter become
the better men? And Lawes are a bridle to curbe the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of badde men, to reſtraine them within the limits of
their duty, that they dare not commit what villanie they
would.<note place="margin">Epict.</note>

returne from whence I haue digreſſed: it followeth not that
the Schoole-maſter ſhould be euill, becauſe hee is hated of
Children, neither that the Lawes ſhould be blamed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected;
becauſe they are abhord of lewd Luskes, and vaine
Varlets, euen the worſt kind of men; but, wee muſt hold
that children want iudgement, and do cenſure of Diſcipline

that there were no Lawes, that there might bee no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

as to giue them no remiſſion and eaſe of their paine, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

like a good Husband-man, who is wont to vnyoke

            <p>Againe, I am ſo gracious vnto them, knowing them (for
the moſt part) to be of an haughty and proud heart, and to
ſtand much vpon their Generoſitie, I ſatisfie their humour
ſo far, that I become an Heraldeſſe vnto them, and doe blaze

their armes fitted to their nature, and permit them <hi>Oneris

            <p>Beſides, I am not ſo hurtfull as ſome affirme; as it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth by this: That no man is much grieued, when
he heareth his friend to be taken with the Gout, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
merrie; he commeth vnto him, laugheth, ieſteth, hee
preſenteth him with ſome pretie gifts, ſitteth by him, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
pleaſantly, and as it were congratulateth with him, as
doe alſo his kinde neighbours, which come daily to viſite
him; which ſurely they would neuer doe, if I were ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
troubleſome and hurtfull, as they pretend; for there
is no man, when he heareth his friend to be affected with any
incurable Maladie, that will laugh, ſport and ieſt, but rather
weepe and be ſad: for how can he be a friend, that laugheth
at the miſery of a friend? and if men laugh at me, they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

as hitherto yee haue done, to giue an attentiue care to
what I ſhall ſay. I deny not, that to many I ſeeme very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
and grieuous; but if they would rightly conſider,
they ſhould verily finde many good things, which by my
meanes they enioy, which, were it not through my benefit,
they ſhould want.<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Gout.</note> How many (I pray you) for my ſake are

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15130:12"/>
And not only at meetings, but at feaſts alſo I am honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before others: for commonly I am placed in the higheſt

willed to call for whatſoeuer I thinke fitteſt and conuenient

            <p>But haply ſome froward cauiller may here reply: This
is done not for honour ſake, but in regard of their miſerie.
I anſwere, that men are wont to reſpect not ſo much, why
a thing is done, as the good that commeth thereby; and it
is ſufficient to me, that I am permitted to doe that, which is
not granted to another, and this I repute a great honour:
a poore man conſidereth not ſo much why, or from whence
hee receiueth a benefit, as hee is glad in the preſent fruition
thereof.</p>
            <p>And why ſpeake I of poore men? Doe wee not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee rich and great men to poſſeſſe whole Fields, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
Lordſhips, and yet little regard whether by right or

not but there are many poore men that would thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
happie, if they might exchange their pouertie for this
calamity,<note place="margin">Hee ſpeaketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their manners in Germanie.</note> and bee freed from labour, and ſuffer no want.
And what, I pray you, is more delicate then thoſe rich
men, with whom I dwell? what more neate then their
furniture? what more elegant then their houſes? If thou
come to viſite them, thou ſhalt find their lodgings, not to
lye ſluttiſh, rude and filthy, as other mens, but all things
are cleane, bright and finely trimmed, and decked like the
Tauernes at a Faire, or as the Temples vpon high feſtiuall

ſo hateſome is my name vnto them. But to omit theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

they vnderſtand the vertue of hearbs, flowers, plants, ſeeds,

the Phyſicions themſelues: beſides, their knowledge in the
bloud of beaſts, their skinnes, milke, galls, fat, bones,

cold and what is hot, what is drie and what is moyſt, what

            <p>No man is ignorant, that the bodie is the polluting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Soule, the Soule cannot floriſh except the body
fade and diminiſh; for this groſſe lumpe of the fleſh is an

anxieties are men pearced, in procuring the things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to this mortall body, and vſe of this fraile life? I ſpeak
not of ſuperfluous things, but of things very neceſſarie,
though (as the Poet ſayth:)

And what is aboue neceſſaries, may be called the ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
or maladies of the minde, as pleaſures, opinions, feares,
perturbations, deſires, loue, hatred, &amp;c. which ſeldome or
neuer permitteth the minde to be at reſt, like the violent
force of fire, which cauſeth the water alwaies to boile vp
till it be remoued. For what (I pray you) ſtirreth vp warres,
brawles, murthers, ſeditions, rapines, iniuries; but the fleſh
and the deſire of hauing which is neuer ſatisfied? For wee
ſee now a dayes mony is able to atchiue all things. And all
this the loue of this fraile body compelleth vs to doe, which
is the cauſe, that while we pamper vp the body our thoughts
are farre eſtranged from any care taking of the Soule, and
our mindes diſtracted from prouiding for the life to come;
for our ſenſes are like vnto violent horſes, which without
the reines of reaſon runne away violently with the chariot,
but the ſoule like a waggoner holdeth the bridle; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as horſes without a guide, ſo the fleſh without reaſon
and rule of the minde runneth haſtily to its owne ruine:
what a ſlauery is it then to ſerue our owne appetite? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a leſſon which I learned long agoe of a learned
Preacher:<note place="margin">D. B.</note> That in chooſing a Maſter euery man will ſhun
three ſorts of men; his enemie, his fellow, his ſeruant. Hee
that ſerueth the Diuell, ſerueth his greateſt enemy; he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his fellow, who ſerueth the luſt of the fleſh; he ſerueth
his ſeruant, who ſerueth the world; it is a baſe ſeruice to
ſerue the world, for that is to become a ſlaue to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant:
it is an vncertaine ſeruice to ſerue the fleſh, for it is
ſo fraile, weake and ſickly, that he may looke euery day to
be turned out of dores, and which is worſt of all, it is leaſt
contented when it is moſt ſerued; but to ſerue the diuell, is
the vnthriftieſt ſeruice of all, for the wages hee payeth, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, wiſe men are wont to ſequeſter themſelues
as farre as they may, from the commerce of the bodie and
worldly affairs, to the end, that the mind may the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee lifted vp to the contemplation of heauenly things;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15130:16"/>
and the more a man is auerted from the bodie, the more hee
is conuerted to heauenly meditations, hee abſtaineth from
fleſhly deſires, he ſubdueth his pleaſures, he little eſteemeth
honors riches, nobilitie, fame, and whatſoeuer the world
holdeth moſt precious: he feareth not ignominie, pouertie,
affliction, nor death it ſelfe, and all things which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the fleſh, that hee moſt deſireth. And wiſe men are
wont to meaſure their life not by the number of yeeres, but
by the time they haue liued well.</p>
            <p>I haue read of one <hi>Similus,</hi> who hauing ſpent the greateſt
part of his life,<note place="margin">A Hiſtorie.</note> in the troubleſome employments of the
weale publick, and being now old, retired himſelfe into a
Farme hee had in the Countrie, and gaue himſelfe to prayer
and contemplation; and when hee dyed, commanded this
Epitaph to be ſet vpon his Tombe:</p>
            <p>Hic iacet <hi>Similus,</hi> cuius at as multorum a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Here lyeth <hi>Similus,</hi> whoſe age was of many yeeres, but he liued
only ſeuen.</p>
            <p>But whoſo ſerueth his bodily ſences, beſides that hee muſt
needs depart from the path of vertue, he ſhall neuer obtaine
what he deſireth: for being deceiued with the falſe ſhewes
of goodnes, he loſeth the ſubſtance for to catch the ſhadow,
and as the body tooke beginning from the earth, ſo the
ſoule had her originall from heauen, as one ſaith not vnfitly:
<q>
                  <l>Immortall ſoule, from heauen God gaue,</l>
                  <l>But bodie fraile, from earth we haue.</l>

            </p>
            <p>The body as a ſeruant ſhould be ſubiected vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the ſoule; the one is heauenly and immortall, the
other common to vs with the brute beaſts. Nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is more excellent then the ſoule, nothing more diuine,
it as farre excelleth the body, as the maſter doth his ſeruant,
as the liuing doth the dead; and as the body maketh earthy
things its full ſcope and marke whereat it only aymeth, ſo
the minde erecteth it ſelfe to heauenly things, as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end for which it was created. Yee ſee here (O Iudges)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15130:16"/>
how much more noble the Soule is then the bodie.</p>

garniſh the celeſtiall Soule, whiles I extinguiſh the vices of

wont commonly to profit it alſo: for I attenuate ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fatneſſe, I drie vp humours which redound through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
and conſume them, leſt they ſhould encreaſe to
a huge greatneſſe, and bring no ſmall danger to the whole
bodie. Againe, as Phyſicians affirme, I alſo prolong the life:
for except I did depell and driue down to the feet and ioints
that noxious and pernicious matter, it would doubtleſſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
the braine, heart, liuer, and ſtomake, and ſoone extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

to the body, let vs proceed to mens vices and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which I aboue others am very expert to cure; ſo that
in this Art I yeeld to none, whether Philoſopher or Diuine:
for I am not only an impediment and curbe to my ſeruants,
that they runne not headlong in wickedneſſe, but alſo the
vices which through cuſtome are become inueterate, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate

And as for hatred and enuie, my ſeruants are ſo far from this

would regard nothing but backe and belly, and like ſwine
wallow in the puddle of their pleaſures: but the afflictions
which I lay vpon them may be likened vnto the tree, called
<hi>Rhamnus,</hi> whoſe root, leaues and branches, though (as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicions
ſay) they be exceeding bitter, yet are they very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable;
for the ſeede thereof purgeth the body of all
groſſe humours, and the iuice thereof cleereth the ſight.
So afflictions,<note place="margin">Aug in Pſal.</note> though to fleſh and bloud they ſeeme auſtere
and bitter, yet are they very healthfull to the Soule, they
purge out the noyſome humor of ſinne, cleere the eyes of
the minde which proſperity blindeth, that wee may truly
know our ſelues, ſee our owne corruption, and become
henceforward more warie how we offend our louing God,
and fly vnto him in al our miſeries; the ſcourge of affliction,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15130:18"/>
awaketh the drowſie, humbleth the proud, purgeth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
and crowneth the innocent.</p>
            <p>But I feare I haue too much offended your patience with
my tedious prolixitie: I will therefore conclude with ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe certaine particulars, to proue what a precious
<hi>panacea</hi> and all-ſaluing plaiſter I am for the curing of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
infirmities of the ſoule: and firſt for Selfe-loue, the
pernicious daughter of Pride, the fountaine of much euill,
the <hi>Lerna malorum,</hi> the <hi>Sentina</hi> and packe of all miſchiefe in
the world. Now for the abating of this vice; what remedy
better then afflictions, which I lay vpon the fleſh? I cauſe
men thereby to know themſelues, that in their beſt eſtate
they are but a dung-hil couered with ſnow, ſubiect to paine,
aches, ſores, rottenneſſe and corruption, we were all taken
out and faſhioned of the ſame lumpe of clay, of the ſame
piece of earth as the pooreſt and baſeſt whom wee ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe;
and ſo I teach men to eſteeme of others as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
ſeeing we are all made of the ſame ſubſtance, all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the ſame infirmities, and all haſtening to the ſame end
to become meate for wormes. Why then art thou proud,
O earth and aſhes, ſeeing that in thy moſt floriſhing prime,
thou art but filthy ſlime, a packe of diſeaſes, a ſacke of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
a Store-houſe of miſeries, thy body but compact of
clay, thy head but a panne of earth, thy whole life beſieged
with a huge army of diſeaſes, and euery one both threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to arreſt thee, and able to kill thee? Thus with my
diſeaſe I ſtoope the proudeſt, and make ſelfe-loue to
quaile.</p>
            <p>And for the Viper Enuie that miſerable fretting ſlaue, a
wretch euer ſad and penſiue;<note place="margin">Anacharſis.</note> for beſides his owne griefes,
he euer tormenteth himſelfe at another mans felicitie:<note place="margin">Senec.</note> I ſay
of him, as <hi>Seneca</hi> did once; I could wiſh that the eyes of the
enuious were ſo opened, that in euery towne they might
behold all that be in proſperity, that their torments might
be increaſed; for as the ioies of others do increaſe, ſo the
ſorrowes of the enuious doe multiply: we can no way more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15130:19"/>
vexe the enuious man, then by applying our ſelues to vertue:
for he hath ſo many torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tors to ſcourge him, as his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
hath vertues to commend him. The poiſon of enuy is
far worſe then the poyſon of Serpents; for their poyſon hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
others, but not themſelues: but the poyſon of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
hurteth themſelues but not others. Moreouer, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
man imagineth another mans good greater than it is,
thereby to increaſe his owne ſorrow and miſerie.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I remember a pretie tale;<note place="margin">Note a pretie tale.</note> that certaine
Phyſicions meeting together, there grew a queſtion among
them concerning the chiefeſt medicine for the eies: one ſaid
<hi>fennell,</hi> another <hi>eye-bright,</hi> another <hi>greene glaſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Nay
(ſaith another merily) it is enuie; for that maketh other
mens goods to ſeeme greater then they are, and confirmed
it by this ſaying of the Poet:

            <p>There is a Fable, but it hath a good Morall, of the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <hi>Iupiter</hi> granted their petitions
vpon this condition, that whatſoeuer the one did craue, the

many things, and had them, but the other alwaies had them
doubled; the enuious man ſeeing this, was grieued, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>But when I come to grapple with this Caytife, I will ſo
perplexe him, and make him ſo wretched, that no man ſhall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15130:19"/>
enuy him, nor himſelfe haue little luſt to enuy others. I tell
him that he is moſt his owne enemy; for the man whom he
enuieth, may depart from him, but he can neuer depart from
himſelfe: whitherſoeuer he goeth, hee carrieth his enemy
ſtill in his boſome, his aduerſary in his heart, his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
within himſelfe, and thus I ſeeke to cure this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>
            <p>And for Couetouſnes,<note place="margin">Couetouſneſſe.</note> I am like the clubbe of <hi>Hercules</hi> to
beat it downe: when paines and inceſſant torments enforce
the couetous worldling to confeſſe, and meditate with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that riches are fickle, that the liues of the poſſeſſors are
brittle, that tranſitory riches are but run-awayes, they will
either runne from vs as they did from <hi>Iob,</hi> or we ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

worldly minded;<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou foole, this night ſhall thy ſoule be taken

               <note place="margin">Abuc. 2. 3.</note> The couetous man is like hell in the inlarging of
his deſires,<note place="margin">Baſil in hom.</note> to containe all; more greedie (ſayth <hi>Baſil</hi>) then
the very fire which goeth out when the matter faileth: but
Couetouſneſſe is neuer quenched, whoſe deſire burneth as
well when he hath matter, as when he hath none, Hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
goeth with a three-toothed fleſh-hooke; the one is
called <hi>Petax,</hi> which deſireth all; the other, <hi>Rapax,</hi> which
catcheth at all; the third, <hi>Tenax,</hi> which holdeth faſt all.
Now when the Gout gripeth him, I teach him to meditate
thus with himſelfe: O, what pleaſure can I take in riches
which I haue ſo greedily ſcraped together? I ſee they can
yeeld me no eaſe at all, no, not ſo much as free me from a fit
of feuer: I now take no more pleaſure in them,<note place="margin">Qui cupit aut metuit, &amp;c.</note> they no

                  <l>Who couets, or who liues in feare, his goods do him delight,</l>
                  <l>As much as blinde man pleaſure takes in pictures finely dight;</l>
                  <l>Or one that's deafe doth take delight in Muſikes ſiluer ſound;</l>
                  <l>Or as the Gout in foments, when the griefe doth moſt abourd.</l>

What ioy take I now in my ſtately houſes, which I haue
built by theft? in my large fields which I haue gotten by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit?
my curſed ſacriledge, in deuouring Chriſts patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which will bee like the Eagles feather, to conſume all
that I ſhall leaue to my heire? in my reuenues, for which I
haue damned mine owne ſoule? In my gold and ſiluer,
which I haue heaped together with the ſweat, yea with the
bloud of the poore? what comfort take I in my life it ſelfe
which I haue ſo vnprofitably ſpent, when I made my heapes
my heauen, my gold my god, my lands my life? I ſee now
I haue choſen droſſe for gold, ruſt for ſiluer, loſſe for gaine,
ſhame for honour, toile for reſt, hell for heauen. I ſee now,
all worldly cares are fruſtrate, and fruitleſſe; I wil therfore
aſpire to heauenly treaſure, which is eternall, which no ruſt
can corrupt, no moth fret, no theeues ſteale; in regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all other things are but dung and droſſe. I will now fixe
my deſires vpon the life to come, where there ſhall bee no
ſickneſſe to afflict me, no maladie to torment mee, no gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
griefes to aſſault me. Thus, where there is any ſparke
of Gods Spirit, I teach men ſeriouſly to meditate; Happy,
and thrice happy they, which haue the grace thus to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
their inordinate deſires of riches.</p>
            <p>The ambitious man in his ſwelling humour,<note place="margin">Ambition.</note> which by all

had rather be <hi>vulpeculae caput, quàm cauda leonis,</hi> the head of a

viſite him, I cauſe him ſoone to ſtrike his loftie ſayles, I
humble him, and enforce his haughty heart to ſtoop, I make
him to know that he is like a Carbuncle, which is the name
of a precious ſtone, and of a ſwelling ſore or tumor: hee

him. I cauſe him with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to chooſe rather to ſuffer

of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court: I make him conſider, that wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and gnaſhing of teeth is the reward of the proud, and
the requitall of the honours which the wicked haue in this
life; I cauſe him ſeriouſly to ſay with himſelfe: O why
ſhould I be ſo fooliſh as to ſuffer my ſelfe to be carried away
with the vanities of pleaſures, riches and honours, ſeeing I
finde no contentation in them? I enforce him when he gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of the Gout, to crie out: <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;</hi>
and thus though I afflict the bodie, I lift vp the Soule,

beginneth with mirth, is continued with cares, and endeth
in torment. Wanton pleaſures begin in luſt, proceed with

my force, and when need requireth, in conuenient time to
remit it againe and giue them eaſe, which other diſeaſes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
doe.</p>
            <p>Albeit (O Iudges) I could alledge much more for my
ſelfe, yet will I now make an end, when I haue ſhewed by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15130:22"/>
the example of great men, that my ſocietie is neither ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
nor wretched. It is the part of Heroicall and Noble
mindes, indifferently to ſuffer proſperitie and aduerſitie, and
to make a vertue of ineuitable neceſſitie. And to let paſſe
many Potentates of the Earth: that <hi>Troian</hi> Monarch, <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
admitted me into his golden Palace; <hi>Peleus, Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
and <hi>Oedipus,</hi> did not exclude me; <hi>Pliſthenes, Prothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilus,</hi>
and prudent <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> receiued mee courteouſly; and
haply (which ſome may wonder at) <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelfe, though
ſwift of foot, could not auoid my power. Let the <hi>Grecians</hi>
fable as much as they will, That hee was diſpleaſed for the
taking away of his Paragon; it was I that kept him from
the battaile; I, (I ywis) was that <hi>Briſes,</hi> which made him
contemne the entreatie of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Would not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wiſe man chuſe rather to ſuffer ſome hardneſſe, with
thoſe famous Noble Perſonages, then with vile, baſe, and
abiect perſons, to wallow in Swiniſh pleaſures? and rather
labour to adorne his mind with Vertue, then like brute
Beaſts, to become a ſlaue to the belly, and corruptible fleſh?</p>

               <l>Mala quae cum multis patimur, leuiora videntur;</l>
               <l>The griefes that we with many beare, the better may ſuſtaine.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Ye haue heard (O Noble Iudges) my iuſt <hi>Apologie:</hi> now
it remaineth, that I beſeech you to weigh all things in the
ballance of Equitie, and then by your vpright ſentence free
me from theſe malicious calumniations and falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which my wicked enemies lade me with, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
are moſt in fault, and inflict vpon them deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for their licentious and filthie liuing: ſo ſhall
Truth be honoured, your ſelues for Iuſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
and my Accuſers reformed, and
my ſelfe bound inceſſantly to pray
vnto the Almightie, that your
Honours bee neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
