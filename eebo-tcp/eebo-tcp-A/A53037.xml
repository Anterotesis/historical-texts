            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am heartily sorry for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port I heare of you For in those parts where wee here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, it is constantly r<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lated, that you are fled from your Countrey, whether it be out of discontent, or any other intended designe, is not as yet certaine. Trust me, I ever retained this opinion of you, that your <hi>heeles</hi> were as swift
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109177:3"/>
for any action as your <hi>head.</hi> And if you shewed your Countrey a paire of faire heeles, you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded but your action at <hi>Newbourne:</hi> where wee thanke you, wee received from you more then you intended to give, by leaving with us an <hi>Inventory</hi> of your clothes: and furnishing us with such a Wardrobe, as if you purposed to doe a worke of charity, in covering your <hi>naked</hi> Enemy.</p>
            <p>Now it may be some will conceive you to be a man of action: and that you intend strange stratagems of Stat<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: nay, that you will imbarke your perfumed person in some military service, to recover your lost fame: and make the world ring with the brute of your actions. But this is the least of my feare or thoughts. I know you love your selfe too well, to put your tender flesh upon so desperate an hazard. Wee that can write no strong lines; nor are able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our thoughts in any other language, then Buffe-Rhetoricke: nor were ever acquainted with your Potato's, Eringo's, Caviare, or any such Kix-shawes, are fitter to be employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such exployts, then your Civet Carpet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whose valour is best displaid in the armes of your Mistresse: or hazarding your patience and necessitous fortunes at <hi>hazard.</hi> Go to Sir; let not your countrey feare you. My life for hers, you will doe her no harme. You may, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, present some massacres upon the Stage with your pen: but if ever you commit such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109177:3"/>
out-rage with your pike, you deceive the world. For my part I must tell you, I would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a more indulgent, nor favourable enemy: For I am stedfastly of this opinion, that the sweetnesse and affability of your condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly hates shedding of blood. Your addresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I know well, are for more amorous employments: Such as may satisfie the sense, and close better with the safety of your person. Nay, <hi>feare</hi> is such a <hi>fever,</hi> as I am perswaded you are never without it, which will be a means to secure you from those hazardous overtures that we poore Souldiers are subject to. You are <hi>nimble,</hi> I am <hi>lame,</hi> you may <hi>fly,</hi> I must <hi>stand</hi> to't. Thanke God for your <hi>speed</hi>; as I shall for my <hi>spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee are now upon our retrait; and to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the world our joy in this happy union, wee intend upon our returne to regreet our countrey with some pleasant Pastorall, or delightfull Commedy; and if you please in this short va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from your more serious affaires, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Poet, though wee cannot accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date our Actors with such <hi>Properties,</hi> as you sometimes bestowed on the <hi>Globe,</hi> yet shall wee suite them with such Habilliments, as may sort with our <hi>Countrey-garbe.</hi> Your answer is expected by him, who honours your parts and person.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou expect my answer, and I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it, and in such a Dialect as may suite with a Souldier, especially such an one as is no Scholler. You are pleased to jeere me with my flight from my countrey: and I must tell you, it were well for my countrey, if you would fly into your owne. And for my action at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi>; it was more noble for me to fly, then it was loyall in you to pursue. I left my cloaths, it is true: they were mine owne: but you in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing them, deckt your selves with others fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by seazing on that which was not your owne. And in it, you say<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I did a worke of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; and so I account it, for if they knew how to put them on, I am sure they might cover ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were <hi>naked.</hi> You write unto me, that some will conceive me to be a <hi>man of action</hi>; and so I am; my thoughts are ever <hi>active,</hi> nay, shall I speake really to you; they are <hi>passive,</hi> till you performe what you professe, &amp; leave our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; where report goes, you intend to sojourn and take your repast<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> till your ragged Regiment has brought them in with their Harvest. Your opinion of me, of tendernesse and effeminacy shall little move me: when actions of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall invite me, I have a spirit in me to evince that opinion: and make the world know, that I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109177:4"/>
dare doe what may fairely close with loyall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. For my <hi>Potato's, Eringo's, Caviare,</hi> &amp; such <hi>Kix-shawes,</hi> you say you were never acquainted with them, and I e<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sily beleeve it: These are too delicate viands for a <hi>Buffe-palat</hi>: yet I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, should you retire but a season from your military discipline, you would quickly incline to such delicacy, and from the <hi>Campe</hi> become a <hi>Carpet Knight,</hi> and bestow this weakned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your time on ease and effeminacy. For my <hi>Mistresse</hi>; If I win her, I deserve to weare her; shee shall need no <hi>pension</hi> from you to supply her. For my <hi>Feverish feare,</hi> you were never yet so nearly imbosom'd in me, as to know any such passion yet surprize me; if flight from an Enemy deserve such a style; what may hee deserve, who flyes from his Countrey to prey upon an others state? For my <hi>Massacres</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi>; of a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> I made a <hi>Comedy:</hi> and so might you doe by dis-banding and leaving our <hi>Countrey</hi> upon your retreat, you intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greet your countrey with a Pastorall; or some pleasant Comedy: And you would have the assistance of my Poetry: but your <hi>Excellence</hi> cannot digest <hi>strong Lines,</hi> some <hi>Calidonian</hi> Bard then will better suite you, and leaue me a daily Petitioner for your speedy departure.</p>
