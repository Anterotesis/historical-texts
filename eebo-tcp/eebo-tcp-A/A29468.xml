            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A brief Narrative of the late Treacherous and horrid Designe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter a continuall succession of secret Conspiracies and open violences, Plotted and attempted against <hi>The true Protestant Religion, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom,</hi> there hath of late risen up, under the plausible Pretences of <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> a most dangerous and wicked Plot of divers persons, to joyn themselves with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies raised by the King, and to destroy the Forces raised by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, to surprise the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>VVestminster</hi> with the Suburbs, and by Arms to force the Parliament; and in a word, <hi>To have delivered up Religion, Parliament, Citie and Kingdom,</hi> into the meer will and pleasure of the King, now in the hands of most desperate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Councellours.</p>
            <p>Towards the effecting whereof;</p>
            <p>There was framed a mixture and conjunction of Persons of severall qualities, some whereof were of both Houses of Parliament; others of the Court and of the Citie, who were in their respective Places and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to form and perfect this Work, raised out of the Ashes of the late Petition of <hi>London</hi> for Peace.</p>
            <p>The Method observed by them for the Conduct and carrying on their Designe, was first for severall persons in the City, to dispose of themselves into a Committee, being those who had been principall Movers and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of that Petition.</p>
            <p>The part that this Committee was chiefly to act, was;</p>
            <p n="1">First, To hold intelligence with both Armies, Court, and Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, To take a generall survey of the Affections and numbers of persons, within the severall Wards and Parishes of the City and places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, by the Weekly Bill of Mortality, under three Ranks; of, <hi>Right men,</hi> (or the Kings party) of, <hi>Averse men</hi> (or the well affected to the Parliament) of, <hi>Moderate men,</hi> (or Neutrals) as they called them.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, To consider of Arms, Ammunition, and all other Provisions of War requisite thereunto.</p>
            <p n="4">Fourthly, Out of themselves to appoint some select persons to treat
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40366:3"/>
with M. <hi>VValler,</hi> and M. <hi>Tompkins,</hi> with relation to the City, Court, and Parliament, as also with <hi>Crispe, Roydon Broome</hi> and <hi>Binion;</hi> then at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Master <hi>Wallers</hi> part in this businesse was;</p>
            <p n="1">First, To ingage a considerable Partie of the Lords and Commons in the Designe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be the means of conveying all Councells, Resolutions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences between the said party of Lords and Commons, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Citie.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Tompkins</hi> was not onely an Assistant to M. <hi>Waller</hi> in the premisses, but an Instrument to convey by <hi>Hazell,</hi> and others, the particulars of their proceedings in the Court, by addresse principally to the Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> and to receive from Court directions, Powers, and commands, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the work. For preventing discovery, Protestations of secrecie were taken by them to this effect, <hi>As they were Christians, not to disclose it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>No man to indeavour the ingaging above two, whereby no one man could impeach many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The part which was acted from the Court was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By M. <hi>Herne, M. Alexander Hampden,</hi> and others imployed upon Messages from the King to the Parliament, under pretence of Treaties for Peace, to convey their directions, incouragements, and Councels unto their partie in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To give Power and Authority by Commissions under the great Seal, by Warrants under the Kings hand; and otherwise for setling of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of War; naming of Generalls (and other Officers.) Execution of Marshall Law; Raising of Moneys, and Provision of Arms and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the disposing of some part of the Kings forces at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be neer the Citie, and in readinesse to assist the Partie here, as cause should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>The steps and degrees to bring this into Action were:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Commission under the great Seal brought from <hi>Oxford,</hi> about a fortnight ago, by the Lady <hi>Aubigny,</hi> with the Authorities aforesaid, thereby inabling and commanding them by force of Arms to destroy, kill, and slay, the forces raised by the Parliament, and their Adherents as Traitors, and Rebels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Severall Propositions, most of them agreed, and resolved by <hi>Master VValler,</hi> in behalf in the said Partie of the Lords and Commons, and the Committee of the Citie, in behalf of the Partie depending upon them, for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40366:3"/>
the more ready and orderly execution of the designe. As first, <hi>Concerning the number of men Armed.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The places where Magazines were laid; The places for Randevouz, and for retreat upon occasion, The Colours, the Marks and Tokens for distinction from others, The strength to be relied on within the walls, and without, What to be done with the Tower, Where the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders affected to the Parliament dwelt, The time of executing the designe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Declaration was framed by them under pretence of asserting and maintaining the heads of the Protestation, thereby the better to colour mischieuous intentions to the people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Message was sent from <hi>Oxford,</hi> on Saterday was fortnight to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> by <hi>Hazel,</hi> that the designe was come to good perfection, unto which, Answer was returned, <hi>That they should hasten it with all speed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particulars of the designe it self were:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To seize into their custodie the Kings Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To seize severall Members of both Houses, the Lord Major, and Committee of the <hi>Militia,</hi> under pretence of bringing them to a legall Tryall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To seize upon the out-Works, Forts, Tower of <hi>London,</hi> Magazines, Gates, and other places of Importance in the Citie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To let in the Kings forces to surprise the City, and to destroy all those that should oppose them by Anthority of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By force of Arms to resist all Payments imposed by authority of the Houses of Parliament, for the support of the Armies imployed for their just defence, and preservation of the true Protestant Religion, and Liberties of the Subject; To suspend, if not alter, the whole Government of the Citie, and with assistance of the Kings force, to awe and master the Parliament.</p>
            <p>All which hath been made appear to both Houses of Parliament, by the Examinations and Confessions of <hi>M. VValler, M. Tompkins, M. Challenor, M. Hazell,</hi> and other persons, principall Actors in the same, now under restraint; The publication of the evidence being deferred till after their Tryall.</p>
