            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppose I shall do but justice both to my self and thee, if I give thee an account why I let this poor inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable piece go abroad into the world; especially now, when there is such a swarm of printed Sermons flying up &amp; down already. Know then, that I thought my self concerned to give some publick testimonie of my thankfulness to that Honourable Audience to whom it was preached; particularly to the then L. Major,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Thomas Aleyn.</note> who was pleased freely and of his own accord, without any motion or seeking of mine, to call and invite me to that service. And I have the more reason to acknowledge his respects to me herein, because hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for several years last past it was otherwise with me. For when some offers and overtures were made in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half by some friends for my preaching at S<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Pauls, which I was bound to do (once at least in two years) by vertue of a place I hold in the University,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Lady</hi> Margarets <hi>Preacher.</hi>
               </note> yet I found not <hi>a door open unto me,</hi> nor had the favour to be admitted or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of. I speak not this by way of complaint, nor with any unkind reflexions upon any particular man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men whatsoever (as imputing it wholly to the common distractions of those times) but the more to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify my gratitude to the aforesaid person for his great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
<pb facs="tcp:100933:3"/>
to me, and (so undeserved) good opinion of me: A further evidence whereof he was pleased to give me, by his favourable and candid acceptance of my weak unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pains, with an intimation of his desires to have them made publick by recommending my Sermon to the Press. Now though this indeed alone might be a sufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and encouragement to me for this publication; yet there were other arguments and inducements moving me thereunto. Not to mention that stale and common mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife of the Press, importunity of friends (though of them there wanted neither godly nor judicious to solicite me to it) That which somewhat prevailed with me was the seasonableness of the argument, both as to the former part of it, concerning <hi>Evangelical walking,</hi> or a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-conversation</hi>; as also to the latter, touching <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical worship,</hi> or a <hi>Gospel-adoration</hi>; both which rightly and duely preached, considering the profaness of some, and the hypocrisy of others, and the un-Gospel-like lives of the most, I conceived to be very usefull and necessary doctrine for these times either from Press or Pulpit. But next to Gods glory and the common benefit and good of the Church, which I desire to make my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal aime in all my designs, that which most of all perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to present this rude unpolisht discourse to the view of the world, was I confess partly for my own vindication, and partly for the further satisfaction of some, who, as I am told, seemed to take a little distast and offence at a passage or two I then delivered concerning the misuse and profanation of that famous Cathedral wherein we were assembled, and the burying-place or Church-yard adjoyning thereunto. As to this, I must needs profess, I have been so much affected to see and observe the ruins
<pb facs="tcp:100933:3"/>
and devastations of that Church, that of late years as I could never pass through it almost without fear least the stones should drop down upon me, so I could never pass by it without pity and regret to behold so sad a spectacle. Whereupon I resolved with my self (I had almost said solemnly vowed) and, I hope, in the fear of God, and out of zeal to his glory, that if ever providence called me to that place, I would speak my thoughts freely and plainly (though soberly and modestly) as to that particular. And now if by any thing I have said, I have cast in any the least mite into the treasury of the Church, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the least stone to the rebuilding of the house of God, or rather thrown the least stone that may sink into the forehead of that great Goliah of this latter age, I mean Sacrilege, that hath so defied not onely the <hi>hosts,</hi> but the <hi>houses</hi> of the living God, then I shall think my self abundantly happy. However I have <hi>paid my vows in thee,</hi> O Paul's; I have discharged my duty, <hi>liberavi animam,</hi> and must leave the success to God to give a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as it pleaseth him. <hi>My witness is in heaven,</hi> and my comfort is the singleness and integrity of my heart, that my earnest desire and endeavour was to deliver such doctrine as might be most suitable and seasonable to the time and place I appeared in; and that I aimed at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all my discourse, but the glory of God, the good of souls, and the honour of that renowned city, whereof that (once magnificent and stately) Cathedral hath been accounted (and I hope shall be again) both at home and abroad, the chief beauty and ornament. But wo and alas, that ever it should be said, to the shame of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet say it we must, for so it is (—<hi>Pudet haec op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probria</hi>—) As things consecrate to God and his Church,

               </note> If upon this account <hi>I am become</hi> any mans <hi>enemy, because I have told them the truth</hi> as becometh the messenger of Christ, in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then I must count it my unhappiness, but not my crime. I would not willingly offend nor displease any; but then again I consider, it is impossible to please all, (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</hi> How far from any personal reflexions, or harsh and bitter invectives my expressions were; what tenderness and moderation I used in disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving (rather then reproving) the sacrilegious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments made upon Churches in these latter times, more particulary, as the place put me in minde, upon that of S<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Paul's; I say <hi>quàm molli manu hoc ulcus tetigi,</hi> I appeal to the judgement of all unprejudiced and impartial Readers: Who, I verily believe, will be apt to think, that I rather toucht this sore too lightly and gently, then rubbed or grated too hard upon it. Nor am I altogether out of hopes, but that they (if any there were) who for want of due attention or consideration either mistook or took amiss what was then delivered, will upon second and more mature thoughts do themselves and me that right, as to mend with the eye what was marred with the ear, and upon a serious review afford it a right understanding, and a candid reception. To which purpose as well for my own vindication, as their satisfaction, I have printed my Sermon <hi>verbatim</hi> almost as it was spoken, with very little or no alteration, I am sure with no alteration at all
<pb facs="tcp:100933:4"/>
of those passages concerning the abuse and misimployment of Church and Coemetery, at which, if at any, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, it seemes, were taken; but how justly, I shall leave it, as I said, to all unbiased and indifferent Readers to judge. The Lord in much mercy make up the rents and breaches of our Church, and put it into the hearts and hands of our Rulers and Governours, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, like good Nehemiahs, to promote and set forward the building of the Temple, and to help to repair the breaches and ruins of our Churches and Cathedrals: that so we may all with one heart and mind glorifie God, and agree together to worship and serve him in the power of godliness, and the beauty of holiness, <hi>as it becometh the Gospel of Christ.</hi> This is (Christian Reader) the constant and hearty prayer of</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100933:6"/>
               <hi>Harmonia Evangelica,</hi> The <hi>Harmonie</hi> of the Gospel: this is the true Gospel-<hi>Harmony</hi> indeed, when there is a mutual <hi>harmonie</hi> and agreement between a Gospel-profession, and a Gospel-conversation, between the life of a Christian, and the Gospel of Christ. This lies so clear in the words, as if it were writ with a sun-beam; so that I shall not need bring any reasons or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, either to demonstrate &amp; prove the Doctrine to you, or to press and enforce the Duty upon you. Else I might tell you, 1. That this is the onely way, (and so take in the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the onely thing God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and requires of us, a Conversation suitable to our Profession, and (to allude to that, 1 Cor. 9.14.) that <hi>they which live under the Gospel should live up to the Gospel.</hi> But this in the general is so evident in the Text, and withall so rational in it self, that it needs neither proof, nor pressing. And therefore in stead
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100933:7"/>
of this, I might rather come to particulars. Indeed <hi>Generalia non pungunt,</hi> while we hover in generals, we do but beat the air, and flutter about the head; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome touch the quick, or pierce to the heart. And therefore here I might bring sundry particulars, to show wherein this conformitie stands, wherein this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and correspondence between a Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and the Gospel of Christ should hold, and wherein it consists; and to this purpose I might lay down several intrinsick essential marks and characters and properties of the Gospel, wherein, and according whereunto a Christians conversation should be suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and agreeable to it; as <hi>viz.</hi> these five especially.</p>
            <p>First, The Gospel of Christ is a Gospel of truth and faithfulness, sinceritie and plainness; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a faithfull saying,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>the word of truth,</hi> Eph. 1, 13. 2 Tim. 2.15. and <hi>truth</hi> it self, Joh. 1.17. Gal. 3.1. Suitably and agreeably hereunto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian conversation should be a true, upright, single-hearted, sincere conversation, without fraud or deceit, lying or dissembling, guile or hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Gospel of Christ is a Gospel <hi>of peace,</hi> expresly so called, Rom. 10.15. Eph. 6.15. The main designe of the Gospel is, to make peace in the world, to compromise all differences, to unite all parties, to reconcile God and man, man and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: therefore it is called the <hi>ministery of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and <hi>the word of reconciliation,</hi> both in one cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, 2 Cor. 5. Christ is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6.</note> the great peace-maker, the <hi>Prince of peace</hi>; the Spirit of the Gospel, the Spirit of peace; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 20.</note> Gods Ambassadours, messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100933:7"/>
of peace; and the Gospel it self the Gospel of peace. Now in a conformity hereunto, Christians should be men of peace, peace-makers, as Christ himself was, lovers of peace, and livers in peace, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of peace with all men; men of closing, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling, healing, uniting, cementing spirits; and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian conversation a quiet, calm, and peaceable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Gospel of Christ is a Gospel of love, and philanthropie, grace, and goodness, and mercy; the Gospel is wholly made up and compounded of love: or if truth be the matter of it, love is the form: if truth be the body of it, love is the soul: it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of pure love and philanthropie, of free grace and mercy; that is the very essence and genius of the Gospel all along; every leaf, every line, every letter in the Gospel, breaths nothing but love, and pure love. Such is the rule, and such should our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be: this the true character of the Gospel, and this the character of a true Christian: the badge and cognizance of Christs disciples this, the mark and brand of his sheep, by which they are known to be his, and distinguisht from all other. Joh. 13.35. <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> And this was the mark and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whereby the Primitive Christians used to be painted and pointed out:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertull. Apologet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Vide, inquiunt, ut invicem se diligant; See how these Christians love one another.</hi> If then you would have your conversation suitable to the Gospel of Christ, it must be an amicable, loving, and charitable conversation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Gospel of Christ is a Gospel of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100933:8"/>
humilitie and meekne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; indeed the Gospel is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a continued history of Christs humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the cratch to the cross, a Sermon of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity all along. Christ the great gift of the Gospel, and the Spirit the great promise of the Gospel; the one a <hi>lamb,</hi> the other a <hi>dove,</hi> both emblems of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and meekness; and the chief lesson of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Christ came to teach, was humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Learn of me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.</note> 
               <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Ye see what the rule is, would ye frame and square your life and conversation according unto it? why then it must be an humble, lowly, and meek conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; ye must follow the Lamb, flee after the Dove, <hi>be clothed with humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is the Gospel robe, Christs livery, the Christian gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even <hi>the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. Humility the first, second, third thing in Christianitie, as Pronunciation in Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, The Gospel of Christ is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of holiness and purity, <hi>Sacrosanctum Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the <hi>Holy Gospel,</hi> is the proper style and epithet of it. The Gospel is a glass, wherein we <hi>behold the glory of the Lord,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 2 Cor. 3.18. and it is a pure spotless mirrour, a clear crystal glass. The fountain of Christs bloud that runs so fresh and so freely in the current and stream of the Gospel, it is a clear and a pure fountain, the Gospel-promises are purifying and cleansing promises, 2 Cor. 7.1. God a holy God, the Spirit a holy Spirit, the Gospel a holy Gospel. Suitably and agreeably hereunto a Christian Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation should be a pure, and holy, and spotless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. A profane, unholy, impure Christian, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100933:8"/>
               <hi>contradictio in adjecto.</hi> Saints by profession, should be Saints indeed: the Gospel say's to us, as God himself does;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.45.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given you as it were the sceleton of a Sermon already;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek</hi> 37.6.</note> I might <hi>lay sinews and flesh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and cover it with skin,</hi> as the bones in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel:</hi> and so I would have done in another congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for indeed, these particulars might deserve to be further enlarged, and set home upon us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very usefull and profitable in themselves, and likewise suitable to the scope of the Text, and not unseasonable for the times we live in; wherein there hath been so much profession of religion, so much noise, and sound, and talk of the Gospel of Christ, and (God knows) so little life and practise suitable and agreeable thereunto. Yet I shall not go this way neither, but wave all these for the present: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are common themes, ordinary beaten tracks, and I would willingly go off of the thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare common, or at least handle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because these are transcendents, of an universal aspect, and of general concernment to all, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be a little more particular, proper, and pertinent in my discourse to such an Audience, considering where I am, and to whom I speak. I shall therefore crave leave to use another method, and that is a little to insist upon those two words in the Text, which speak the duty of Christians in complyance with the Gospel of Christ, the <hi>Verb</hi> and the <hi>Adverb</hi>; the one expressing the matter of the duty, the other the manner: the matter we have in the <hi>Verb</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the manner in the <hi>Adverb</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both words very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100933:9"/>
full, and significant: the strength and energy, importance and improvement whereof I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make out unto you, and to fasten upon you.</p>
            <p>First, for the Verb, take it first in the general, as we render it, according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>Conversamini, Let your conversation be,</hi> or as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> very well, <hi>Vos gerite, Carry,</hi> or <hi>behave your selves,</hi> or as <hi>Castelio</hi> not amiss, <hi>Vitam agite, Lead your lives:</hi> and so it denotes an uniform, constant, continued course. Let your constant carriage and behaviour, your whole course and <hi>conversation</hi> be agreeable to the Gospel of Christ. Have a care of your <hi>conversation,</hi> that is, of the constant continued frame, and model, and tenour, and course of your carriage. Good men may have their flaws and failings, bad men may have their fits and flashes; but what a man is in his common ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course and <hi>conversation,</hi> that he is. What ever trade or occupation ye are of besides, to be sure there is one trade and vocation ye all profess, <hi>viz.</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that is your profession; religion, that is your trade: I pray then, make it so, and use it so. Ye are not at your trade by fits and girds; a man is at his trade, at the works of his vocation and calling every day, and commonly all day long, it is his business, his constant, daily, ordinary imployment. If then Christianity be your trade and profession, ye must be at it continually, ye must shew what trade ye are of by your constant course and conversation. That that is called <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here, is termed a <hi>walking</hi> elsewhere, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> very often in the New Testament: nothing more frequent and ordinary in Scripture, then to express the course of a mans life and <hi>conversation</hi> by the metaphor of a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100933:9"/>
               <hi>way</hi> or <hi>walk</hi>: so we find, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>utrâque paginâ,</hi> all along in the Hebrew of the Old Testament, whence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so often in this sense in the Hellenistical, or rather Hebraistical Greek of the New. Now <hi>walking</hi> ye know, is an uniform, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, continued motion, course, or progress. Tell me not then of this or that good work that you do once in a moon, of one or two holy duties you perform now and then in your holy-day clothes: Is your general carriage good? is your constant ordinary course and <hi>conversation</hi> right? <hi>To him that orders his conversation aright, will I shew the salvation of God,</hi> Psal. 50. last. Would ye be good Christians, good Gospellers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? have a care of your general carriage and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi>; look to the constant frame and bent of your spirit, be sure to get your bias right set, to get a good bias clapt upon you, a good principle grafted and planted in you, pointing, and winding, and bending towards heaven; let your common, ordinary, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al course and <hi>conversation</hi> be right and good. Thus in the general. But then again further;</p>

so miserably rent and torn the body, so fearfully blemisht and defac'd the beauty of our Church: I say, this alone were enough to confirm and settle us.

            <p>And now, if after all that hath been said, this must needs be counted and called superstition, who can help it? I am sure it will be hard to prove it to be so: and I dare boldly say, That among those who exclaim most against superstition, our Separatists, I mean, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, not one of an hundred knows what it is, either
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100933:18"/>
name, or thing. But whatever it be, truly I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the case stands, there is little fear of it now adays. For were we not rather in the other extreme? were we not run so far from the <hi>Scylla</hi> of superstition, that we were fallen into the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of Atheisme and profaness? Did not ataxy and confusion, rudeness and irregularity, irreverence and irreligion, swell, and overflow, and break in upon us like a land-floud, or a mighty torrent? High time, I trow, to mend the banks, and put a stop to the inundation, if ever we look to have an orderly, decent, <hi>comely</hi> face of a Church, and such a publick worship, as <hi>becomes</hi> the Gospel: nay, if ever we look that holiness and righteousness, true religion and the fear of the Lord should get up, and grow, and spread, and flourish among us. And indeed this is that that I drive at in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course all this while: for to this purpose onely it is, and for this reason and no other, that I commend or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and decencie, and <hi>comeliness</hi> in a Christian Church, and a Gospel-worship, because I conceive, it really makes for the advancement of godliness, and hath a natural tendency to the encrease of true pietie and religion: so far am I from thinking it bears any antipathy or repugnancie to it, or any the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency with it. And therefore upon these grounds I shall once be bold to ask the banes; If any one can shew any just cause, why outward decencie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion; bodily service and spiritual worship; due reverence without, and true religion within; the <hi>comely</hi> face of a Church, and the heavenly heart of a Saint, the beauty of holiness, and the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness

Did I think otherwise, far be it from me to further or favour the match, or to speak the least word in behalf of external reverence, order, and decencie in the worship and service of God. But being verily perswaded, and clearly convinc'd of the truth hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that outward <hi>comeliness</hi> doth very much conduce to inward holiness, and that order and decencie in worship, is a great help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to religion and godliness, and a means to kindle and encrease true pietie, zeal, and devotion; upon this account, and upon this occasion, at this time, and in this place especially, I could not choose but set my seal to it, and give this fair testimonie of it, and recommend it to you, but still in order and reference to the main end, <hi>viz.</hi> as it conduces to the <gap reason="foreign">
