            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LOARDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter my hearty loove rememberd until your Loardſhips, hoping that yea are very weel as my ſell, Goad
be praiſed, at the writing of theſe preſents: Theſe are to giff your Loardſhips till underſtaund, that
I'ſe ne crave your pardon at aw, for that I laboured for Advauncement in this woarld, accoarding to
the practicks of aw gude men, but that I ſought it in ſe bad a time, whareby I'ſe incurd the Odium of your
gude Loardſhips, whoſe diſpleſure hath gar'd muckle ſorrow until your pure ſarvant, which gares me now to
writ thilke lines until your Loardſhips, that I'ſe may humble my ſel, and greet before your Loardſhips for the
ſinn whilk Iſe ha committed againſt aw the gude People in <hi>England.</hi> I doe mack confeſſion unto your Loard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
fra the vary bottom of my heart, that Iſe ha ne car'd ene pin foar the Kirk of <hi>England,</hi> ne foar the Kirk
of <hi>Scotland</hi> nather, the Dec'l fa the luggs of aw thoſe men that ſeduced me untill ſyck an errour and miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
againſt your Loardſhips; for in troath, my Loards, I thought there would nere ha been any Kirk in
<hi>England</hi> again: and Iſe began to hate the Kirk, foar becauſe my gude Loard and Maiſter, my Loard <hi>Laembert</hi>
hated the Kirk as weel as my ſell, and for that Sir <hi>Harry Vane</hi> went about till deſtory aw the Kirks and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in <hi>England;</hi> but ſhame fa me, Iſe now ſee my fault, and giff your Loardſhips gares me till ſit in aw the
Stuies of Repentance in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Iſe ne be ſoarry at aw. The Dee'l bla <hi>Machiavels</hi> weam fou a ſma ſteanes, for
that he bad me be of that Religion my Superiours were of. Yet what gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s me to ſpeak evil of that gude man,
foar that nouw by my troath, Iſe ne think Iſe can gang any better wea than to follow his gude Coonſel, for that
now by his ene rule Iſe ought to be of your Loardſhips Religion, foar that yea are nouw by the permiſſion of
God my Superiours, as he was than; and in troath, my Loards, Iſe eene be ſe, if your Loardſhips will give
permiſſion to your pure ſervant.</p>
            <p>My Loards, In gude ſooth Iſe ha thought my Loard <hi>Lambert</hi> had bin a very gude man, and that aw the
Committee of Safety had bin alſe vary gude men: in troath, my Loards, giff they were not gude men, they
were aw vary gude company, and Iſe had muckle reaſon to con them muckle thanks; for that though I were
ne Prophet, yet I had mere credit and eſteem amid them, than ere Iſe had in my ene Countrey. But, my
Loards, ſithence it plainly appereth that yea are muckle wiſer and better men than they, Iſe tell yea ene great
Secret, That none of them aw ere car'd ene button for yee: my Loards, this is the vary troath.</p>
            <p>My Loards, Whan yee had broken the Crags of aw our Undertackings, Iſe thought it was my beſt way to
gang heme agen into my ene Countrey; for my Loards, I was like to e Ratt, in troath whan I was gat till my
ene heam, I was as glad as ene had gin me e groat, and my Loards, Iſe warrant yee Iſe not come among yee
agen in haſte. My Loards, I was reſolved till have gon till-have kiſs'd the haunds of my Loard <hi>Monk,</hi> but the
Loard be praiſed for it, he was marched out of <hi>Scoatland</hi> before my occaſions would permit me to wait on him,
and in troath my Loards, I did not owe him ſuch muckle ſervice as to gang after him. My loards, whan he was
gang'd away, I eene went till ha made ſome Commotions in my ene Countrey, to teſtifie my loove to my
gude loard <hi>Lambert,</hi> but I could do ne gude; wharefore I hope your Loardſhips will mack my excuſe till him,
and aſſure him I did aw that I could, and could do ne mere. My Loards, I ha nouw ne thing to do, but to bla
my pip, and wear a blew Bonnet. I hear that yee are calling our Committee to an Accompt, my Loards, I
ſhall deſire yee not to ſend foar me, foar Iſe be vary weel whare I am; Iſe be an awd man, and tharefore deſire to
be at peace, and to end my days in my ene Countrey. Pray remember my loove to my gude loard <hi>Fleetwood,</hi>
Sir <hi>Harry Vane,</hi> my loard <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the reſt of my gude friends, with whom I lately ſate in Cooncel. My
loards, this is aw Iſe ha to ſay till your loardſhips, and giff your loardſhips have any thing mere to ſay to me, 'tis
mere than is deſired from you, by</p>
