            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>By the Letter you ſent to Us, with this bearer, Mr. <hi>James Sharp,</hi> and by the account he gave of the State of Our Church there, We have received full Information of your ſenſe of our Sufferings, and of your conſtant Affection and Loyalty to Our Perſon and Authority. And therefore We will detain him here no longer, (of whoſe good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices We are very ſenſible) nor will We delay to let you know by him Our gracious acceptance of your Addreſs, and how well We are ſatisſfied with your carriages, and with the generality of the Miniſters of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in this time of trial, whilſt ſome, under ſpecious pretences, ſwerved from that Duty and Allegiance they owe to Us. And becauſe ſuch, who, by the countenance of Uſurpers, have diſturbed the Peace of that Our Church, may alſo labour to create Jealouſies in the mindes of well meaning people; We have thought fit by This, to aſſure you, that, by the grace of God, VVe do reſolve to diſcountenance Profanity, and all Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Oppoſers of the Ordinances of the GOSPEL. VVe do alſo reſolve to Protect and Preſerve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is ſetled by Law, without violation; and to countenance, in the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Functions, all ſuch Miniſters who ſhall behave themſelves dutifully and peaceably, as becomes men of their Calling. VVe will alſo take care, that the Authority and Acts of the General Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the year, 1651. be owned and ſtand in force, untill VVe ſhall call another General Aſſembly (which We purpoſe to do aſſoon as Our Affairs will permit) And VVe do intend to ſend for Mr. <hi>Robert Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe,</hi> and ſome other Miniſters, that We may ſpeak with them in what may further concern the Affairs of that Church. And as We are very well ſatisfied with your reſolution not to meddle without your Sphere; So We do expect, that Church-judicatories in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Miniſters there, will keep within the compaſs of their Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, meddling only with matters Eccleſiaſtick, and promoting Our Authority and lntereſt with Our Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Oppoſers; And that they will take ſpecial notice of all ſuch, who, by preaching, or private Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or any other way, tranſgreſs the limits of their Calling, by endeavoring to corrupt the people, or ſow ſeeds of diſaffection to Us, or Our Government. This you ſhall make known to the ſeveral Presbyteries within that Our Kingdom: And as We do give aſſurance of Our favor and encouragement to you, and to all honeſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Miniſters there; So We earneſtly recommend it to you all, that you be earneſt in your Prayers, publick and private, to Almighty God who is Our Rock and Our Deliverer, both for Us and for Our Government, That We may have freſh and conſtant ſupplies of his Grace, and the right improvement of all his Mercies and Deliverances, To the honour of his great Name, and the peace, ſafety and benefit of all Our Kingdoms: And ſo We bid you heartily farewell.</p>
