            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Account of the NEGOTIATION, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Embaſſy which the Evangelick <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons ſent to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in the Year 1686, to intercede with his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in favour of the Proteſtant Churches of the Vallies, being a buſineſs of as much difficulty as importance; and becauſe it may give occaſion to ſome perſons of making different and quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reflections, I have thought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109768:3"/>
fit to publiſh a true account of that Negotiation, that unbyaſs'd Perſons, being rightly inform'd of what paſs'd, may, according to Reaſon, juſtly and equitably judge of it.</p>
            <p>I will therefore relate the moſt conſiderable Paſſages of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie; and as I will make uſe of no Memoirs but what are good and authentick; ſo neither Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, Hatred, or Affection ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence my Pen; and then if the elegancy of my Stile do not pleaſe the Reader, yet I hope he will be ſatisfied with the ſincerity and truth of the Narration.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant States, the Evangelique Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons have ſhewed as much love to their Religion as any, by their ſo zealouſly eſpouſing the intereſt of the Reformed Churches; for ever ſince the light of the Reformation firſt begun to ſhine in <hi>France,</hi> they have, to the utmoſt of their power,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109768:3"/>
endeavour'd to forward the work of God in that Kingdom, and did ſend ſeveral Ambaſſadours to <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and likewiſe to ſucceeding Kings, to deſire there might be a ceſſation of thoſe Cruelties which were practiſed by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy againſt thoſe Faithful People who made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Truth.</p>
            <p>And they have made the ſame Zeal appear in all the Perſecutions which the Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> have ſuffer'd; for in thoſe which were in the years 1655 and 1663, they ſent Ambaſſadors to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to mediate with him in behalf of his Proteſtant Subjects, and to ſupport them in thoſe Rights, which by ſeveral Grants they had obtain'd from his Anceſtors. In 1686, as ſoon as they heard what was contain'd in the Edict which that Prince had publiſhed againſt their Brethren of <hi>Piemont,</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear'd how much they were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109768:4"/>
troubled; for when the miſerable <hi>Vaudois</hi> were intolerably and moſt unjuſtly oppreſs'd, and ſtill threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be treated with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cruelties, the Cantons reſolv'd to do all they could to ſhelter and ſave thoſe poor perſecuted People.</p>
            <p>In former times nothing more was deſign'd againſt them by their Enemies, than to coop up thoſe poor Proteſtants within certain bounds and limits, and to take from them their right of living in the plain Country, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had liberty to do; but now a reſolution was taken, not only to deprive them of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion in all places, but alſo of the liberty of their Conſciences; ſo that now their condition did indeed deſerve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and that People may the better judge of it, 'tis neceſſary here to inſert a true Copy of the Duke's Edict faithfully tranſlated.</p>

This courſe hath been taken in other Monarchies, and by our moſt Serene Predeceſſors, who indeed never had any other intention than to draw their Subjects, who profeſs'd the pretended Reformed Religion, out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hereſy, which by the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py viciſſitude and fatal corruption of times, hath from the centre of the Vallies of <hi>Luzerne,</hi> ſpread it ſelf ſo far as to enter into the very heart of <hi>Piemont:</hi> And becauſe thoſe Religioniſts have had Succours from foreign Countries, this good work could never be brought to its
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109768:5"/>
deſired end; ſo that we not being able to purge this Poiſon quite out of our Country, we ſtopp'd and ſhut it up in the Vallies of <hi>Luzerne, Angrogne, St. Martin, Ceruſe, St. Bartlemy, Roccapiata,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſtin,</hi> and by Toleration only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to exerciſe their falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion within certain preſcrib'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, complying with the neceſſity of the times, till it ſhould pleaſe God to afford us a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to bring back theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Souls to the boſom of the Holy, and only Catholick, Apoſtolick, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion: But time having now diſcover'd the neceſſity of quite deſtroying this Serpent, and many-headed Hydra; ſince the aforeſaid Hereticks, inſtead of anſwering this favour with humble ſubmiſſion and thanks, for our gracious Permiſſion and Toleration, have often, with ſcandalous diſobedience, inſolently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt us: And whereas the chief cauſe of granting ſuch a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109768:5"/>
now ceaſeth, by the Zeal and Piety of that Glorious Monarch the King of <hi>France,</hi> who hath brought back again his Neighbour Hereticks to the true Faith; we think the particular favours which we have received from the Divine Majeſty, and which we ſtill enjoy, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us of great ingratitude, if, by our negligence, we let ſlip the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of perfecting this work, according to the intention of our Glorious Predeceſſors. For the cauſes aforeſaid, and for other preſſing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by virtue of this preſent Edict; we, of our certain knowledge, by our abſolute Sovereign Power, and by the advice of our Privy Council, have Decreed, and Ordain'd, and we do Order and Command by theſe Preſents, all our Subjects of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformed Religion, for the time to come, to forbear all Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the ſaid Religion, and we forbid them henceforth to Aſſemble in any Place or private Houſe to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109768:6"/>
exerciſe the ſaid Religion, under any Title, Pretext, or Occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon pain of Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of Goods. In like manner, we Ordain that the paſt pretended Toleration be utterly void, and of no effect, what colour or pretence ſoever may be alledged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Our Will and Pleaſure alſo is, That all Churches, Granges, and Houſes wherein the ſaid Religion is at preſent exerciſed, be pull'd down and raz'd, as alſo all other Places wherein for the future there may be any ſuch Aſſemblies, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Tenour of the preceding Article, yea, tho' the Perſons to whom ſuch Places belong know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſuch Meetings. We fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Command all Eccleſiaſticks, all Miniſters and Schoolmaſters of the ſaid pretended Reformed Religion, who, within Fifteen days after the Publication hereof, ſhall not embrace the Catholick Religion, to depart out of our Dominions at the expiration of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109768:6"/>
the ſaid term af Fifteen days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Death, and Confiſcation of their Goods; with expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand alſo, under the ſame Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that during the ſaid term, before their departure, they do not Preach any Sermons, Exhort, or do any other Acts of their ſaid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Moreover, we forbid all that profeſs the pretended Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, under the aforeſaid Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that of incurring our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to keep for the future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny School, Publick or Private; that their Children may henceforth be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Catholick Schoolmaſters. As concerning thoſe Miniſters, who during the ſaid term ſhall embrace the Catholick Religion, our Will is, that during their lives, and after their death their Widows ſhall dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Widowhood, enjoy the ſame Exemptions and Immunities which they before had, during the Exerciſe of their Charge. And our further Pleaſure is, That to thoſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109768:7"/>
who ſhall in this manner be converted, there be paid, during their life, a Penſion, which ſhall be a third part greater than the Wages which they had as Miniſters of the ſaid Religion; and that after their death their Widows ſhall receive the Moiety of that Penſion ſo long as they continue ſole. For what concerns the Children that ſhall be born of Parents of the ſaid pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformed Religion, our Pleaſure is, That after the publication of this preſent Edict, they be baptis'd by the Prieſts of the Pariſhes which are already eſtabliſhed in the ſaid Vallies, or which ſhall be eſtabliſhed hereafter. We therefore Command their Fathers and Mothers, that they either ſend or bring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the Churches, under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Father's ſerving Five years in the Gallies and the Mothers being publickly whipp'd: and the ſaid Children ſhall henceforward be brought up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109768:7"/>
Apoſtolick Religion. We expreſly Command all Judges, Provoſts, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telains, and other Officers, to ſee that theſe Preſents be duly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We alſo confirm the Edict which we cauſed to be Publiſh'd the <hi>4</hi>th of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, concerning the Subjects of his Moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who profeſs the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, who are now in our Dominions, or who have left in them any Merchandiſe, Money, or other Effects, and for what concerns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Strangers of the ſaid Religion, who contrary to the tenour of our Predeceſſors Edicts, have ſettled themſelves in the Vallies, without their conſent ſhew'd in writing, comprehending alſo their Deſcendants, who have been born in it: We Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that in caſe they do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fifteen days after the Publication of this Edict, declare they will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, they ſhall be obliged, that term being expired, to depart
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109768:8"/>
out of our Territories, under pain of Death, and Confiſcation of their Goods. And tho' by virtue of our Predeceſſors Edicts, the Goods which ſuch Strangers have gotten in our Dominions, ought of right to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to our Publick Treaſury; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, intending in this caſe to ſhew our wonted Clemency, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to ſell their Goods within the ſaid term, and to diſpoſe of them as they pleaſe; yet always with this condition, that there ſhall be no ſale of their Lands, but to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; and if no ſuch Buyers can be found, the Goods ſhall be prized, ſold, and annexed to our Demeans at a reaſonable price. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we command all Magiſtrates, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd by us, all Miniſters of State, Officers, Counſellors of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and War, and all others who are concern'd, to ſee that this Edict be inviolably obſerved, and cauſe the Council of <hi>Piemont</hi> to Regiſter it, and give their entire approbation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109768:8"/>
to every thing therein contain'd· And moreover our Will is, That the Publication which ſhall be made of this Edict, in all Places, according to the uſual form, ſhall have the ſame force and virtue, as if it had been notified to every particular Perſon; and that as much credit be given to the Copy Printed by <hi>Sinibal</hi> our Printer, as to the Original it ſelf, for ſuch is our Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. </p>

            <p>The Evangelique Cantons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of this Edict, a while after alſo knew that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had in vain ſought relief againſt it; for they had preſented Two Petitions to their Prince, which were never anſwer'd. By the Firſt, they deſir'd a Revocation of this Edict; and by the Second, leave to depart out of his Dominions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109768:9"/>
within ſuch a term as might be neceſſary to find a ſettlement elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Cantons ſeeing that the ordinary means which had been uſed to ſtop the execution of this Edict had not been effectual, they thought ſome extraordinary courſe was to be tryed. They therefore at firſt wrote to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Praying that he would make good to his Subjects of the Vallies thoſe Conceſſions which had been granted to them by his Predeceſſors: But when they ſaw the Duke delay'd to give them any anſwer, and that they knew he prepar'd to execute his Edict by force, they reſolv'd in a Diet held at <hi>Baden,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1686, to diſpatch two Ambaſſadours to him, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the obtaining, by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, that which they could not procure by their Letters.</p>
            <p>The Perſons pitched upon for this Embaſſie were <hi>Gaſpard de Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralt,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:109768:9"/>
and <hi>Bernard de Muralt,</hi> both Councellours of State; the Firſt, of the Republick of <hi>Zurich,</hi> the other of <hi>Berne</hi>; who had all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities neceſſary to fit them for ſuch an Employ, either in reſpect of their Virtue and Piety, or of their Prudence and Perſonal Abilities.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ambaſſadours were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe their beſt endeavours to oblige the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Edict which he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt the Valley Churches. And becauſe they had reaſon to fear that his Royal Highneſs would continue firm in his Reſolution of cauſing it to be executed in all points, the Proteſtant Cantons, after having maturely conſidered the ſtate of the People that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Churches, and the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Forces of the Prince, who reſolv'd totally to extirpate them, if they refus'd to ſubmit to his Will, they thought, in caſe their Ambaſſadours could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109768:10"/>
a Revocation of the Edict, that then it would be expedient for them to endeavour the procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of liberty for thoſe miſerable People to retire into ſome other Country, to ſell their Goods, and to carry with them all that they could get together of their ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Lords who were preſent in this Diet were too prudent and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to take any other courſe but this; they ſaw on the one hand, how few they were who could bear Arms in the Vallies; for they were at moſt but Two Thouſand Five Hundred Men, the greateſt part of them ill armed, and had neither Commanders, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, or Ammunition, and could not from any place expect Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; that they likewiſe who had Commanded in the Wars of 1655 and 1664 were now all dead. But on the other hand, when they conſidered the Prince's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109768:10"/>
Forces, who had reſolved to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their Religion, they ſaw that they infinitely exceeded thoſe of his Subjects, who were of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion contrary to his; for the Duke had enjoy'd a long Peace; he had a great many good Troops, brave Captains, and experienc'd Generals; he had nothing to fear, either from his Neighbours or any Prince in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More than all this, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Troops were joyn'd with thoſe of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was then ſo dreaded, that his very Name made all the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Europe</hi> tremble; whereas heretofore though the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> fought together with the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> to aſſiſt and guard them from the oppreſſion of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, yet, notwithſtanding their being ſo aided, they were driven out of their Vallies, and could not defend themſelves againſt the ſingle Forces of their Prince. They far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109768:11"/>
conſidered, that if by ſome unexpected chance the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> ſhould at firſt have the good luck to get ſome advantage over their Enemies, yet in the end, they muſt needs be overpower'd by the great number of thoſe that attack'd them, whoſe loſſes could be repaired by being recruited with new Troops; but the <hi>Vaudois</hi> could make no new Levies, to fill the places of thoſe that muſt be flain in ſeveral Combats. More than all this, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> having to do with the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was the proudeſt Prince in the World, and who at that time had no Enemy upon his hands, he would have armed all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Kingdom againſt them, rather than have fail'd to bring his deſign to paſs, wherein he thought conſiſted his chiefeſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and by which he believ'd he ſhould merit the higheſt Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109768:11"/>
the greateſt Saints in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</p>
            <p>The Cantons had before their eyes the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, whom they had receiv'd into their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; and comparing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with that of their Brethren of <hi>Piemont,</hi> they found that even in that miſerable ſtate to which they were reduced, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> being ſtill able to obtain free leave to go out of their Country, were in that reſpect much happier than the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, who were not only obliged to quit their Houſes and their Country, when all their Goods were taken from them, but yet could not buy their Baniſhment, without hazarding their Lives and their Liberty.</p>
            <p>All things thus conſidered, the Cantons at laſt concluded they could do nothing of more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the <hi>Piemontois,</hi> than to obtain for them that which they themſelves had now, and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109768:12"/>
deſired when they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted concerning the exerciſe of their Religion; for in former times they moſt humbly petition'd their Prince, that they might ſeek a retreat in Foreign parts.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours furniſhed with theſe Inſtructions, went into <hi>Piemont</hi>; and being arrived at <hi>Turin,</hi> and admitted to Audience by his Royal Highneſs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, That ſeeing the mediation of their Maſters, the Evangelique Cantons, with his Royal Highneſs, in favour of his Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, had been always acceptable and effectual, their Sovereign Lords, having with extreme grief heard that his Royal Highneſs had reſolved to deprive his Proteſtant Subjects of the liberty of their Conſciences, and the exerciſe of their Religion, which they had enjoy'd for many Ages; their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns moved by Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by the ſtrict union with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109768:12"/>
thoſe of their Communion, and by the confidence they had in his Royal Highneſs's Clemency and Juſtice, had preſumed to intercede by their Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in favour of their Brethren of the Vallies. But having received no anſwer to thoſe Letters, their Maſters had charged them with this Embaſſie, to teſtifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they had for his Royal Highneſs, and likewiſe to ſhew how much they were touched with the late Edict which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt his Highneſs's poor Subjects, and had commanded them to aſſure his Highneſs how ſincerely they regarded his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and with all poſſible inſtance to pray him to ſuffer the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Vallies quietly and perpetually to enjoy the exerciſe of their Religion, and that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience his Predeceſſors had granted to them, upon the preſſing Interceſſions and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109768:13"/>
of many Princes and Proteſtant States, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Interpoſition and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of their Sovereigns: And that which made them hope to obtain what they deſired, was that his Highneſs's Subjects had done nothing to render themſelves unworthy of the continuance of the Favour and Affection of their Prince, or that ought to deprive them of the right which they had acquired by his own conceſſions, which ought to be inviolable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not bare and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Tolerations, but Authentick Treaties, made with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Vallies, and therefore ought to be perpetual and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as may be ſeen in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Article of the Grant paſs'd in the year 1655, and the Fourth Article of the Patent in 1664, which declares, That they ſhould be perpetually and irrevocably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and that in effect they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109768:13"/>
have been Ratify'd and Regiſter'd by the Senate of <hi>Chambery,</hi> to be <hi>Bona fide</hi> executed according to their Form and Tenour.</p>
            <p>That their Lords were verily perſuaded, that his Highneſs in his own Reign, full of Glory and Felicity, would not ſuffer thoſe Grants, follow'd with many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and ſolemn Promiſes, to be made void, and all the fruit of their Mediation, Pains, and Care come to nothing.</p>
            <p>They hoped that his Highneſs would not have the World believe he had not the ſame eſteem and regard for the Evangelique Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons which his Predeceſſors had; or that the perfect Amity, and ſincere Correſpondence which hath always been between his Royal Highneſs and their Lords, as good Neighbours and Friends, was in any wiſe alter'd; that his State would be expos'd to troubles and calamities; that the Conſciences
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109768:14"/>
of his Subjects (which ought not to depend upon any but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone) would be forced, by the fear of Death and Torments: In a word, the Inhabitants of the Vallies would be overwhelm'd with Miſery, and reduc'd to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
            <p>They alſo earneſtly pray'd his Royal Highneſs, to receive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably their Sovereign's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in the behalf of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, made their Brethren by Communion in one and the ſame Religion; and that he would ſuffer himſelf to be moved by the Cries, Tears, and Groans of ſo many innocent Souls, who did beſeech him to ſuſpend the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Edict, and not to turn his Arms againſt his People, who in rendering to God the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious homage due to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, with the loſs of their Blood, to ſeal the fidelity which they had vow'd to his Royal Highneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:109768:14"/>That if their Mediation did produce the effect which their Superiours deſired, it would be the moſt convincing evidence his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs could give them, that he no leſs valu'd their Mediation than his Predeceſſors of Glorious Memory had done; and that on their part, they would endeavour by all manner of ways, to teſtifie their thanks, and to render his Highneſs reciprocal Services upon all occaſions; and becauſe, in the Conference which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours had with his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Miniſters of State, ſome of thoſe Reaſons had been declared which his Royal Highneſs had to publiſh the Edict, whereof they deſir'd the Revocation, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours judg'd it neceſſary to anſwer thoſe Reaſons, to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to back their own Demands, contain'd in the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:109768:15"/>
               <p>His Royal Highneſs's Miniſters of State having declar'd to us, when we diſcourſed privately with them, that the Engagement into which, by the neceſſity of the preſent juncture of Affairs, your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was forced to enter, was a great obſtacle to the ſucceſs of our Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; we are oblig'd to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Royal Highneſs, that the Valley-Churches of <hi>Piemont</hi> did never ſeparate themſelves from the Religion of their Prince; ſeeing they live in that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from their Anceſtours more than Eight Hundred Years ago, and which they profeſs'd before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Royal Highneſs's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours; who finding them in the poſſeſſion of their Religion, have maintain'd them in it by ſeveral Conceſſions, and principally by thoſe of the Years <hi>1561, 1602,</hi> and <hi>1603,</hi> which have been ratified by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109768:15"/>
the Senate, and by the Chamber, in the Year <hi>1620,</hi> for the Sum of <hi>6000 French</hi> Duccatoons, which thoſe Churches paid, as by the very Act of Confirmation plainly appears; Their Right paſs'd in form of a Treaty, and of a Law Perpetual, and Irrevocable; which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved during the life of his Royal Highneſs <hi>Victor Amadeus,</hi> and during the Regency of <hi>Madam Royale,</hi> which ſhe confirm'd by an Ordinance, in the Year <hi>1638:</hi> After this, theſe Churches obtain'd many other favourable Decrees of his Royal Highneſs <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> your Royal Highneſs's Father, of Glorious Memory; particularly in the Year <hi>1649,</hi> and <hi>1653;</hi> but becauſe, contrary to a Right ſo well eſtabliſh'd, by a Poſſeſſion time out of mind, and by ſo many Grants, the Seignior <hi>Guaſtaldo,</hi> in the Month of <hi>January, 1655,</hi> cauſed an Edict to be publiſh'd, which produc'd terrible and fatal effects
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109768:16"/>
againſt thoſe poor Churches; all the Kings, Princes, and Proteſtant States of <hi>Europe,</hi> and among others our Sovereign Lords, compaſſionating their miſery, became Mediators and Interceſſors for them to his Royal Highneſs <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> and obtain'd a Confirmation of their Priviledges and Conceſſions by two ſolemn Patents, perpetual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, in the Years <hi>1655</hi> and <hi>1664,</hi> Ratified in due form, and Confirm'd by Letters which he wrote to our Superiours the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> in the Year <hi>1664;</hi> by which Letters he promis'd thoſe Patents ſhould <hi>Bona fide</hi> be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; whereto <hi>Madam Royale,</hi> your Highneſs's Mother did likewiſe oblige her ſelf, by her own Letters, Daied the <hi>28.</hi> of <hi>January, 1679.</hi> So that your Royal Highneſs's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors having ſo many times paſs'd their Royal Word, eſpecially in the Patents given in the Preſence of our Soveraigns Ambaſſadours, ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109768:16"/>
for that purpoſe. It cannot be juſt to break ſo many formal and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Engagements; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Conceſſions and Patents were agreed to in the face of all <hi>Europe,</hi> by the Interpoſition and Mediation of many Kings, Princes, and States, as perpetual Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Pledges of the Publick Faith; but alſo becauſe the Words and Promiſes of Princes ought to be Sacred and Inviolable; for if ſuch Engagements may be infring'd and made null, under pretence that a Prince is neceſſitated to it by the juncture of his Affairs, or for the advantage of them, there will be nothing certain in the World, and nothing but War and Confuſion to be expected; If this Maxim be once eſtahliſh'd among Soveraigns, Proteſtant Princes may deſtroy their Catholick Subjects, and Catholick Princes do the ſame to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in their Dominions. It is then certain, whether the thing be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109768:17"/>
conſidered either as it reſpects the Honour and Reputation of a Prince, or whether, it be conſider'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Rules and Principles of true and juſt Policy, whoſe chief and only end, is the ſafety of Princes, People, and States; it will be found that the Words and Promiſes of Princes ought to be inviolable. 'Tis this which tells us, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the neceſſity of preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, nor any other Intereſt, can oblige a Prince ſo Juſt, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and Prudent as your Royal Highneſs, to enter into, or make good any new Engagements, which will not only overthrow all that your Predeceſſors have done in the ſight of the whole World, but will alſo expoſe your own Dominions and Subjects to Fire, Sword, Miſery, and Deſolation, and to all that in Rage and Brutality is cruel and inhumane.</p>
               <p>We confeſs it natural for a Pious Prince to deſire that there may be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109768:17"/>
but one Religion in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and being perſwaded that that which he himſelf profeſſeth is the true, he may think Charity binds him to endeavour to make all his Subjects of his Religion; but it muſt be alſo confefs'd, That Religion, enters into our Hearts by Perſuaſion, not by Force and Compulſion; and to make Men taſte Divine Verities, we ought to make uſe only of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Exhortation, and gentle means, according to the practice of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Tho' Kings and Princes are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their People, yet they have no Empire over their Conſciences, which are ſubject to none but God; ſo that we have reaſon to hope your Royal Highneſs will be ſo far from forcing the Inhabitants of the Vallies to do things contrary to the dictates of their Conſciences, that you will reſtore to them the Peace we implore for them; that you will confirm their Priviledges, and let them have they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109768:18"/>
liberty of rendring to God the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is due to him, ſo long as they pay to you the reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which, as your faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they owe to your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Your Highneſs's Miniſters of State have alſo told us, That your Subjects of the Vallies have made themſelves unworthy of their Prince's favour; but all the World knows, that before the Publication of your laſt Edict, they gave your Royal Highneſs no cauſe of Complaint; and therefore, 'tis not any ill behaviour of theirs that hath been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo rigorous an Order againſt them: Beſide, if any particular Perſons among them ſince that time have committed any fault (which yet is more than we know) can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man wonder that miſerable People, driven to abſolute deſpair, ſhould act imprudently? We hope your Royal Highneſs hath ſo much Goodneſs and Mercy, as to pardon faults of his nature, and you have too much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109768:18"/>
Juſtice and Equity to puniſh a whole Community for Diſorders which may have been committed by a few private Perſons.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it hath been pretended that the Patents which his Royal Highneſs <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> granted in the years <hi>1655,</hi> and <hi>1664,</hi> did not concern Religion, but only gave the Proteſtants leave to dwell in ſome certain places of the Vallies; and therefore, neither our Soveraign Lords, nor other Princes who were Mediators and Interceſſors in that Affair have any intereſt in this: But we pray your Royal Highneſs to conſider, Firſt, That the buſineſs then in agitation was Religion, and that directly no other thing was treated of: For beſide Signior <hi>Guaſtaldo</hi>'s Order, which was the cauſe of ſuch diſmal effects, and took away thoſe Priviledges which had been granted to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> concerning Religion, there was then a deſign to force them to do things
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109768:19"/>
contrary to their Conſciences; for they were threatned with Death, and Confiſcation of Goods, if within twenty days after they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo to do, they did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Catholick Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All the Mediation and Interceſſion of the Proteſtant Princes and States had no other foundation but that of Religion and Conſcience; it was upon this very Principle they acted, and their Ambaſſadors had not been heard or received, but as they were concerned in a buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their Religion; and it was for this Reaſon that your Highneſs's Predeceſſors, by their Letters, gave many aſſurances to their Excellencies the <hi>Evangelick Cantons,</hi> that the Patents which they had granted a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their Interceſſion ſhould be punctually and faithfully executed.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe your Royal Highneſs hath publiſh'd an Edict, to take away all that was granted to them, which forbids them the Exerciſe of their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109768:19"/>
Religion in all the Vallies upon pain of Death; orders all their Churches to be demoliſh'd, baniſheth their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Schoolmaſters, commands all their Children to be baptis'd, and brought up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and conſequently deprives the People of the liberty of their Conſciences: Our Soveraign Lords, who are united to thoſe Valley-Churches by the bonds of the ſame Faith and Belief, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd to continue their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions for them, which we do in their name; hoping that your Royal Highneſs will have ſome regard for our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and ſome pity for your own Subjects.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors, having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their Propoſal and Memoir to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of his Royal Highneſs's Miniſters of State, who had the direction of Forreign Affairs; ſome few days after receiv'd an Anſwer to it, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to the following purpoſe.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109768:20"/>
That his Royal Highneſs was very ſorry he could not yield to what they deſired in their Maſters name; That he had much better Reaſons to maintain his Edict, than thoſe which were offered to him to revoke it: That he could not make it leſs ſtrict in any particular: That the Great Wheels moved and carried on the leſs: That the Letter which the Cantons had written to him was not delivered till after the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Edict: That having ſo near him a King no leſs powerful than jealous of his Authority, he ought to be very circumſpect: That he was oblig'd to act according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture and ſtate of Affairs. That even in <hi>Switzerland</hi> there was according to the tendency of Affairs, ſome times a neceſſity of taking reſolutions contrary to thoſe good intentions which otherwiſe Men might have: That the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had given good and ſafe Counſel to the two Deputies ſent by the Vallies to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109768:20"/>
and that inſtead of giving any ſigns of their ſubmiſſion and obedience, to which they were bound, they had committed all ſorts of Hoſtilities againſt his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects; they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a thouſand inſolencies; they held Aſſemblies, provided Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Ammunition for War, cut off Paſſes, and intrench'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; all which they had done during the term of Twenty Five days given them for taking their laſt reſolution. That the Duke was now too far engag'd; the Troops which he had been at great charge to levy, were already on Foot, that the Edict could not be recall'd without great diſhonour to his Royal Highneſs, and that he was obliged to cauſe it to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for very great and preſſing Reaſons, which he left to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours conſideration. That the Conceſſions of 1655, and 1664, amounted to no more than bare Tolerations; and that the Vallies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109768:21"/>
had no poſitive right to exerciſe their Religion: That Soveraign Princes do nothing that can be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unjuſt, in not ſuffering any more than one Religion in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: That the Cantons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did juſtifie his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that particular, ſeeing they would ſuffer no Catholicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: Moreover that the Conceſſions granted to thoſe of the Vallies had been juridically examin'd, and that the reſult of that examination was, That the Priviledges and Favours which a Prince granted to his Subjects, might at his Will and Pleaſure be revok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That his Royal Highneſs did only forbid the Inhabitants of the Vallies to exerciſe their Religion, but did not intend in any manner to offer violence to their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>But the Ambaſſadours, by their Reply, made it appear to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> That how ſtrong ſoever the Reaſons were which had induced his Royal Highneſs

               </hi> laſt, yet they could not be of ſo great ſtrength as thoſe were which had poſitively engag'd his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obſerve thoſe Promiſes which were paſt before the ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; and that no Conſiderations, or Reaſons of State could free a Prince from the Obligation of keeping his Word; eſpecially when he engag'd himſelf upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of ſome other Prince; and that as the Patents and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges granted to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had been obtain'd by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Kings, Princes, and States; particularly by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of their Excellencies the <hi>Evangelick Cantons,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by his Royal Highneſs; nothing could be alledg'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Highneſs from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to cauſe them to be punctually obſerv'd; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe thoſe Patents had been ratified by the Senate of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109768:22"/>
and that the bare Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 'em in the Year 1620. had coſt the Valley-Churches Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>That if the changes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in States, or the different Meaſures which according to the Rules of Policy may be taken, ſhould be valuable and ſufficient Exceptions to elude the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treaties, there could be nothing certain in Soveraigns Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; Faith would be totally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd out of the World, and there could never be any aſſurance that thoſe things ſhould be performed which had been ſolemnly ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and there could be no way of ending War, or concluding Alliances. So that the Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted by his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Predeceſſors to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> did convey to them an indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right, which they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe, but by being guilty of ſome heinous Crime, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109768:22"/>
Rebellion againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: But they are ſo far from being juſtly accus'd of having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way fail'd in their duty to him, that they can produce a Letter from his Royal Highneſs, dated the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1684, which is an authentick, and manifeſt Proof of their Fidelity, and their ſtedfaſt reſolutions to ſerve him. If ſince the Publication of your laſt Edict, ſome particular Perſons among them have taken Arms, it was not againſt their Soveraign, but only to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, who, abuſing his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had fallen upon, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them; and if any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had been committed, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were to be chaſtiſed who had been the Authors of it; and it ought not to be imputed to the Collective Body of the Valley-Churches, who were no way guilty.</p>
            <p>It could not be ſaid, That the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109768:23"/>
Vallies had not acquired any Right by the Conceſſions of his Royal Highneſs's Predeceſſors, or that thoſe Conceſſions were but Favours and ſimple Tolerations; ſince it is plain, that they are Treaties paſt between the Prince and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that theſe Treaties are perpetual and irrevocable, and ought to be inviolably obſerved.</p>
            <p>That a Prince is equally oblig'd to perform the Promiſes which he makes to his Subjects, as he is thoſe which he makes to Perſons not ſubject to him; that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Obligations was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which ought to govern in all Princes Treaties, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinction made between thoſe with whom they enter into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; for if it were lawful to fail in the performance of thoſe ſolemn Promiſes they make to their People, it would be impoſſible to end any differences which might happen between them, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109768:23"/>
any troubles in Kingdoms or States; and that between two Parties in War with one another, there could be no end of their Quarrel, but by the entire ruine of one of them.</p>
            <p>They further ſaid, That if So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns had reaſon to do what poſſibly they could to make all their Subjects of one Religion, yet to compaſs that, they ought not to infringe thoſe Treaties they had made with them; and that the only means which in ſuch a caſe were lawful to be uſed, was Inſtruction, Exhortation, and all thoſe gentle ways which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make Truth enter into the Souls of their People, to enlighten their Underſtanding, and lead them voluntarily and ſincerely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace true Religion: But that which deſerves particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this matter, is, That the Inhabitants of the Vallies do not hold by Grant from their Princes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109768:24"/>
the liberty of publickly exerciſing their Religion, it having been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Country more than Eight Ages ago, and that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd this Right a long time before they were Subjects to the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of his Royal Highneſs; ſo that they never having been of their Prince's Religion, it cannot be ſaid they have quitted it, or that they are obliged to embrace it.</p>
            <p>Beſide, his Royal Highneſs's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, who permitted the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> to continue the exerciſe of their Religion, very well knew that Unity of Faith was not abſolutely neceſſary for the Publick good and ſafety of their State; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would never have paſs'd ſuch ſolemn Patents, or from time to time confirmed them as they have done.</p>
            <p>And certainly there is little to be feared from the diverſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is in <hi>Piemont</hi>; becauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109768:24"/>
thoſe that are not of the Prince's Communion, are ſhut up in a little corner of the Country, and are a People without Authority or Power, and have no deſign to ſpread their Doctrine in any other parts of his Royal Highneſs's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it was to be fear'd that Proteſtant Princes might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Royal Highneſs's Example, and might treat their Catholick Subjects as his Highneſs dealt with thoſe of their Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Intereſt of his own Party ought to hinder him from uſing force to oblige the Inhabitants of the Vallies to renounce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>That altho' his Royal Highneſs ſeem'd not to force his Proteſtant Subjects to embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and was contented with depriving them of the exerciſe of their own Religion, leaving to them in other things perfect liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109768:25"/>
of Conſcience; yet it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they were not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged (under very great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) to baptiſe their Children in Catholick Churches, and to bring them up in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, which was as inſupportable and grievous to them, as to compel the Parents themſelves to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it; but they were alſo kept from Praying to God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Faith, which muſt be a terrible torment to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and was an impoſition upon them as hard and cruel, as if they were by force compell'd to a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip condemn'd by the Religion in which they were educated.</p>
            <p>Beſide, to forbid People the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion, is to caſt them into indevotion, and even into Atheiſm, which may prove a greater miſchief to them, than driving 'em by force into the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Reaſons there was ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109768:25"/>
much ſtrength, that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors hoped they would make great impreſſion on the mind of his Royal Highneſs; and that the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> would truly report them, and employ his credit with his Highneſs to obtain a Revocation of an Edict, which doubtleſs he believ'd to be juſt, and which he had not publiſh'd had he thought it contrary to what a juſt and equitable Prince owes to his faithful Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with only repreſenting the juſt Right of the <hi>Piemont</hi> Churches, and maintaining it by ſollid Arguments, but they alſo ſpent ſome days in ſolliciting his Royal Highneſs's Miniſters, and all others whoſe help they thought might make their Embaſſie ſucceed; but they more particularly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as to him, on whom depended all the Good and all the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109768:26"/>
Ill which was to be expected in the Affair; and if one may judge of things by appearances, the pains they took to diſpoſe him to be favourable to them were not in vain.</p>
            <p>For he proteſted with an Oath, That he had ſhew'd to his Royal Highneſs all that was contain'd in the Reply they had oblig'd him to preſent, and that he had done all he could to make their Arguments prevail for obtaining a Revocation of the Edict; but the preſent ſtate of Affairs was the cauſe of his not being able to perſwade his Royal Highneſs to grant that which they deſired. <hi>However,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeeing the Prince's Troops are not yet upon their March, the Inhabitants of the Vallies may make a ſhew as if they would comply with the Edict; that not being contrary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your Religion, tho' it be to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church; and by this means they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109768:26"/>
will diſarm the Prince, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards find ſome way to prevent the miſchief wherewith they are threatned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Doctrine,</hi> replied the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, <hi>doth in no wiſe allow us to diſſemble our Faith, but obligeth us to confeſs with our Mouths that which we believe in our Hearts to be truth; but this is not the preſent buſineſs: The Queſtion is, Whether his Royal Highneſs hath power to revoke the Priviledges granted to the Valley Churches; for as they are Engagements into which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Mediation of many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, and among others, by that of the</hi> Evangelick Cantons <hi>our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lords, it is certain that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to infringe or make them void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours in the mean time neglected nothing that might make their Negotiation ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore made new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:109768:27"/>
and to others of his Royal Highneſs's Miniſters, but they all ſaid (as if they had concerted what anſwer to give) that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was irrevocable, by reaſon of the preſent juncture, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which his Royal Highneſs had taken.</p>
            <p>Beſide the Reaſons drawn from the Nature of the Grants paſs'd to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and the concern which the <hi>Cantons</hi> had that they ſhould be obſerv'd, the Ambaſſadours repreſented the inconveniencies which might follow the execution of the Edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among others, thoſe which his Royal Highneſs might well fear would happen by the entry of Foreign Troops into his Country, by the loſs of a great number of his Subjects, who had done their Prince very great ſervice, and were ſtill ready to loſe their Blood to reſtifie the love they had for him: By the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Revenue, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109768:27"/>
muſt neceſſarily follow the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe miſerable People; and to which might be added, the blame his Royal Highneſs muſt incur, by turning his Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own People, and the damage which his other Subjects, who were Neighbours to the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, muſt needs ſuffer by a Civil War, with many other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this nature, which were not regarded by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Miniſters; who told the Ambaſſadours, That the Council of State had examin'd their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and did not think them weighty enough to hinder him from Publiſhing his Edict againſt his Subjects of the Vallies; and tho' by the execution of it, his Royal Highneſs might ſuffer ſome inconvenience, yet he muſt go on, becauſe a change of this nature would be prejudicial to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and by being willing to preſerve ſome of his Subjects, he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109768:28"/>
might be in danger of loſing all.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Miniſters of State ſeem'd to be firm in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pretended not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Juſtice of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours Demands, yet it was well known, that they maintain'd the Edict againſt their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and one of them freely confeſs'd, that his Highneſs's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had not ſufficiently examin'd the Conceſſions of the Year 1655, and 1664; and if they had made ſuch reflections on them as they ought, they would never have been of the opinion that they might be revoked: But he told the Ambaſſadours the miſchief was not now to be remedy'd, and it would be in vain for them to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit his Highneſs to change his mind. Another of them freely confeſs'd that his Highneſs was not Maſter of this Affair, and that thoſe Orders muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109768:28"/>
at <hi>Turin,</hi> which had been given at <hi>Verſailles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This free and ſincere Confeſſion made the Ambaſſadours conclude, That all their Inſtances and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations would prove ineffectual; ſo that ſeeing it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to obtain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Edict, they were reſolved, according to the firſt Article of their Inſtructions, to demand that which they were by the ſecond Article of the <hi>Cantons</hi> Orders directed to ask, <hi>viz. To procure leave for the</hi> Vaudois <hi>to retire ſome where elſe, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of their Goods as they ſhould think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe by their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were to propoſe nothing in this particular to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> without the conſent of the Valley Inhabitants, they told the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> That ſeeing many Conſiderations had hinder'd them from entertaining any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109768:29"/>
mith the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> they were willing to go into the Vallies, to know certainly how the People ſtood diſpos'd; and when they underſtood their intentions, they might by ſome other Overtures renew their Negotiation; but at the ſame time declared, they would not undertake the Voyage without firſt having his Royal Highneſs's conſent.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Ambaſſadours deſign, the Duke ſent to let them know, he approv'd of their reſolution, and that he would give order to the Governour of <hi>Lucern,</hi> to pay them all the civility and reſpect that was due to their Character.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours, as ſoon as they came into the Vallies, made known their arrival to all the Communities, who preſently ſent to 'em their Deputies and their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109768:29"/>
Miniſters, to whom the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours declared, That they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the moſt powerful Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they poſſibly could, to get a Revocation of the Edict of the 31<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi>; but that they had been told his Royal Highneſs had entred into ſuch ſtrict engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with one of the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Monarchs on Earth, that it was impoſſible for his Highneſs to break 'em; and that he had reſolved to do all he could to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite all his Subjects in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one and the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, according as he had ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promis'd; ſo that there was not the leaſt hope of obtaining a Revocation of thoſe Orders which had been given out againſt them. They alſo declared, that their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lords the <hi>Cantons</hi> had commanded them, in caſe his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs ſhould perſiſt in his reſolution of cauſing his Edict to be executed, then to preſs his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109768:30"/>
Royal Highneſs to permit his Subjects of the Vallies to depart out of his Dominions, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their Goods; but in that particular they would do nothing till they firſt knew what was their intention, and therefore they wiſh'd them to meet together, and ſeriouſly deliberate upon a buſineſs of ſo much weight, and then make known what they deſired of them in the preſent juncture.</p>
            <p>The Deputies and the Miniſters having conferr'd together upon this Propoſition, before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd any thing, pray'd the Ambaſſadours to give them their prudent advice: But the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours at firſt refuſed to give them any counſel in ſo nice a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; ſaying, <hi>That they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew their own Strength, the ſituation of thoſe Places where they intended to intrench; their Proviſions both for the Belly and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109768:30"/>
the War, better than they whoſe advice they ask'd; and therefore they could take better and ſurer meaſures themſelves, than could be given them by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, at laſt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to deny their earneſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and believing they were bound by Charity to aſſiſt them in a Concern ſo ſlippery, and full of hazard, they willingly conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what they deſired.</p>
            <p>But that they might give them Counſel according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had of their condition, they informed themſelves exactly of the number of thoſe in the Vallies that could bear Arms; of their Experience, their Courage, and of the ſervice of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, of the Paſſages and Avenues of the Country, of their Stores, of the quality and goodneſs of their Arms; and above all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were a perfect and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Union among themſelves:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109768:31"/>
But underſtanding that at moſt they were not above 2500 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, and more than 12000 unprofitable Mouths; that Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als already began to fail in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places; that the Troops of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> had ſhut up all the Paſſages whereby they might be provided of neceſſaries; that they could not hope for any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; and that it was eaſie to deſtroy them by Famine, or to reduce them by Force; that they had no Neighbours to retreat to as in former Wars; that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them, was now their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemy; that they had but few Soldiers to defend a great deal of Ground; that being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another, they could not give ſpeedy ſuccour to thoſe that might want it; that there were in the Vallies <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, who would watch all their motions, and give intelligence to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109768:31"/>
the Court of all that paſs'd; and what was yet worſe, that two great Princes had join'd together to deſtroy them: The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours told them, <hi>That in the ſtate wherein they were, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt ſo great a Force as was ready to fall upon them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be more for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to chuſe forſaking their Country, provided they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leave to ſell their Goods, and ſave as much as they could. They did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed know poſitively his Royal Highneſs's intention in this particular; but tho' he had refuſed to grant that which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Vallies had requeſted of him in the third Petition they had preſented to his Highneſs, yet they did hope it might now be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, out of reſpect to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſters and Deputies hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard this advice, intreated the Ambaſſadours that they might
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109768:32"/>
conſult together before they gave any anſwer; and then quitting them, they ſpent more than three hours in conſulting one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, each Party maintaining their own Opinion with a great deal of heat: Some ſaid they ought not to quit their Country, but expoſe their Lives to maintain their Liberties, which had been ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickly granted to them; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was baſe Cowardiſe not to ſhew their Courage, when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Cauſe of God was at ſtake; that the favour which was to be ſhown them, would ſignifie nothing, to ſuch as had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to defray the charges of their Voyage; that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſell what they had in the Plains, but no body would buy their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in the Mountains. That there was no ſafety for them during their departure; that ſome change might happen in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> which might better their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109768:32"/>
That perhaps <hi>France,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could make no Reſiſtance, when it ſaw how bravely they defended themſelves, and that they had deſtroy'd part of their Troops, would recal the reſt, and keep them for ſome more conſiderable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; that they expected Mony and Men, which were to be ſent them by Captain <hi>Janavell,</hi> and that they ſhould not want Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, becauſe by Sallies from time to time, they could oblige their Neighbours to furniſh them with ſuch Neceſſaries as they wanted.</p>
            <p>They that were of a contrary Opinion, anſwer'd all this, ſaying, It was true, that both Reaſon and Piety oblige us, to hazard our Lives in defence of our Liberty, and the Exerciſe of our Religion, when there is any appearance it may be done with Succeſs; but when the danger is inevitable, and our ruin certain, it is Deſpair and Madneſs to throw our ſelves
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109768:33"/>
headlong into it, and Men are their own Enemies and Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, to take Arms againſt thoſe, whom (do all they can) it is impoſſible to vanquiſh; that they had but few among them, who were able to defend themſelves; and how Brave and Reſolute ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might be, it was evident, they could not long reſiſt two powerful Armies, and ſo many Troops as were ready to attack them on all ſides. To think the State of Publick Affairs would change, was to flatter themſelves with vain imaginations: That Men ought to take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures according to the preſent ſtate of things, and that which appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently was like to come to paſs: That common Senſe and Prudence, would never build important Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, upon Miraculous Events: That all <hi>Europe</hi> enjoy'd perfect Peace, and <hi>France</hi> was dreaded by all the world, and had therefore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109768:33"/>
no Reaſon to fear its being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd by any Prince, or that any thing could happen to occaſion the recalling of thoſe Troops which were in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in any other place; that they ought not to depend on the Succours they expected, and tho' they that were promis'd ſhould be ſent, yet againſt every ſingle man that ſhould come, their Enemies could oppoſe whole Companies. That they could not long ſubſiſt for want of Victuals, and that tho' their Sallies ſhould be ſucceſsful (which was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) all the Proviſions which they would that way be able to get, could not ſuffice to maintain ſo great a number of people; in ſine, they made it appear, that Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would infallibly be their total ruine, and that then thoſe Ancient Churches would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, which had ſubſiſted with ſo much Glory, in the midſt of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109768:34"/>
ſo many Perſecutions. And that it was much better, by a prudent retreat, to remove the Sacred Candleſtick to ſome other place, than to put out the light by raſh Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid, that ſuch as were of ability might contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to thoſe that were poor, to help them in their Voyage; and their not being able to ſell all their goods, was not ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as ought to ſtay them; becauſe life ought to be dearer to 'em than their Lands, and that it was much better, to loſe part of a man's goods, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters and Deputies ſeeing they could not agree, and that the point in queſtion could not be otherwiſe decided, than by their Communities, told the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that the buſineſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate being of the higheſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, they could not poſitively
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109768:34"/>
reſolve upon any thing, without having firſt aſſembled their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, to know what they would do in this occaſion, and therefore promis'd to bring their laſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Turin,</hi> provided they might have a Paſs-port for their ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors being return'd to <hi>Turin,</hi> informed the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that the people of the Vallies, thought it better to die upon the Graves of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, than to loſe their Spiritual Liberty, in ſubmitting to his <hi>R. H.</hi> Edict; beſeeching his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with all due Reſpect, that he would in ſome meaſure moderate the rigour of it; and that if his <hi>R. H.</hi> would not mitigate the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity thereof, in favour of his miſerable Subjects, things muſt apparently come to dreadful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and that the rigour he uſed in this occaſion, muſt cauſe the ruine of a great part of his people. The Embaſſadors further
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109768:35"/>
ſaid, that hoping his <hi>R. H.</hi> would for their Maſters ſake, moderate thoſe orders he had given againſt his Subjects of the Vallies, they had taken the Liberty to make ſome Propoſals, which might prevent all the miſchiefs the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Execution of the Edict was like to produce; and that they might know the intention of thoſe people, they pray'd the Marqueſs to obtain a ſafe Conduct for ſuch Deputies as ſhould be ſent from the Vallies.</p>
            <p>But the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> told the Ambaſſadours, <hi>That his Royal Highneſs, for very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, would not give the Deputies of the Vallies a ſafe Conduct; and that the Secretary to their Embaſſie might be ſent to bring back thoſe Peoples Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Secretary was then ſent to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> with this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter.</p>

            <p>The Communities being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, the Secretary deliver'd to 'em the Ambaſſador's Letter, which when read, he told 'em, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs grew daily worſe and worſe; and that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour continually preſs'd his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have the Edict executed; that his Royal Highneſs on his part was very impatient it was not done, becauſe his Reputation was engaged, or becauſe he was at very great charge to maintain
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109768:36"/>
the Troops that were in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that ſeeing it was impoſſible to obtain a revocation of the Edict, they ought to think of the beſt means to mollifie his Highneſs, and procure ſuch a mitigation of it as might yet be demanded: Laſtly, he pray'd them to reflect on all thoſe Conſiderations, which had been alledged by the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and to give him their anſwer in writing.</p>
            <p>After this Repreſentation, the Miniſters and other Deputies having conſulted together, agreed to anſwer the Embaſſadors in this following manner.</p>

            <p>In their Memoir, in the firſt place, they obeſrv'd, That none but the rich Families could go out of the Country; and that others, how willing ſoever they might be to depart, that they were not able to do it, by reaſon of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; and if they ſtay'd in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109768:38"/>
Country, they would certainly be forced to change their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It might happen, That when the chiefeſt Families were gone out of the Country, the reſt might be ſtopt upon one pretence or other, notwithſtanding they have been promiſed Liberty to do what they pleaſed; That if their Patents, granted them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of many Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were revoked, there would be no ſcruple made of breaking the Promiſe paſt to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the ſale of their Goods might be ſecretly oppoſed, by forbidding the <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> to buy them; or at leaſt, they ſhould be able to ſell only their Lands which they had in the Champain Country, and not thoſe which were in the Mountains and barren places.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, They pray'd the Embaſſadors, to deſire, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109768:39"/>
thoſe Debts might be paid which were legally due to them, and which they could not get in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure; that his <hi>R. H.</hi> would likewiſe be pleas'd, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the King of <hi>France,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſell the Eſtates which they had in the Vallies of <hi>Perouſe,</hi> and to look after the payment of what was due to them from the Inhabitants of that Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They did humbly pray, that ſufficient time might be given them for ſelling their Goods, and to find out a place of retreat; and that in the mean while, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Edict might ceaſe, and their Miniſters continue their Exerciſes as formerly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They propos'd to the Embaſſadors, the difficulty of finding Waggons to carry away their Families, and their Baggage, they being no leſs than 15000 perſons.</p>
            <p>This Writing being deliver'd to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109768:39"/>
the Embaſſadours, with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent from the Inhabitants of the Vallies; they made a Viſit to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told him, that they hop'd to perſuade the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to leave their Country, provided they might do it in a ſafe and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner; they deſir'd him to ask his <hi>R. H.</hi> whether he would permit his poor Subjects to quit his Dominions; and in caſe he found him ſo diſpos'd, then to ask him, whether he would be pleas'd to name ſome perſons of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, with whom the Embaſſadors might treat of Conditions for their departure, and remove all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles which might ſtand in their way.</p>
            <p>While they were waiting for his <hi>R. H's.</hi> anſwer, the Embaſſadours warmly ſollicited the Miniſters of State, to perſuade his Highneſs to grant that which they now deſir'd, but their endeavours had not that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109768:40"/>
ſucceſs they expected; for his <hi>R. H.</hi> commanded Count <hi>Marſenas</hi> to tell them, he was inform'd by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that they were very ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to obtain free leave for his Subjects to go out of the Vallies, and to adjuſt with ſome of his Miniſters, terms for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but he had commanded them to declare, that this people had been ſo audacious, as to take up Arms againſt him, even in a time when he had no Troops near their Country, that they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a thouſand inſolencies, and braved him with ſuch boldneſs, as deſerved ſevere puniſhment: They therefore were unworthy of that favour, the Embaſſadors deſired for them; and ſo much the more unworthy, becauſe before their arrival at Court, theſe people had with great ſubmiſſion, preſented ſeveral Petitions, to obtain ſome moderation in the Execution of the Edict; but now pretended with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109768:40"/>
Swords in their hands to force him to revoke it; nevertheleſs he aſſur'd the Embaſſadors, that if theſe Rebels would ſhew their Repentance for what had paſt, and ſubmit themſelves with that reſpect which was due to him, he was inclin'd to be merciful to them, and to let them ſee how much he regarded the <hi>Cantons</hi> mediation. The Embaſſadors ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with this new Propoſition, told Count <hi>Marſenas,</hi> that they did not ſee how his <hi>R. H.</hi> could require from his Subjects ſuch a ſubmiſſion; for ſhould his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple own that they had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful to their Prince, they would render themſelves guilty by their own confeſſion, and therefore they ought not to be obliged to make any declaration of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſhould any go about to bring them to ſuch a reſolution, it would be impoſſible to prevail with them, becauſe they would
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109768:41"/>
never blacken themſelves with a crime, of which they knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves innocent, and give juſt occaſion to have their Goods confiſcated, that they would have juſt reaſon to ſuſpect any man that ſhould propoſe ſuch a thing to them, and that from ſuch an Overture, nothing could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but prolonging their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and rendring it ineffectual.</p>
            <p>But when Count <hi>Marſenas</hi> told them, his <hi>R. H.</hi> was poſitively reſolved, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhould precede the favour he intended to ſhew them, the Embaſſadors thought fit to have recourſe to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> deſiring him to ſoften a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his <hi>R. H.</hi> When they came to the Marqueſs they prayed him to repreſent to his Highneſs, that in obliging his Subjects to confeſs they were guilty of Rebellion, he required that of them, to which they could never yield.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109768:41"/>
That ſuch a Declaration would cover them with eternal ſhame, and that they could not in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confeſs crimes, of which they were not guilty. That now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd his <hi>R.H.</hi> made little account of the mediation and interceſſion of their Soveraign Lords, in reſolving that the favours which they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhould depend upon a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which his Subjects could never ſubmit.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> gave them the ſame anſwer they had from Count <hi>Marſenas,</hi> which was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Prince was inflexible in this point, that it was impoſſible to alter his mind by any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that could be urged, and that it would be in vain, to try to make him change his reſolution.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer from the Marqueſs, very much troubled the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who begun to fear, that ſome ſnares were laying for the poor <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and that there was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109768:42"/>
a deſign to condemn them, by the Confeſſion they themſelves ſhould make of their Rebellion: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they reſolv'd this difficulty ſhould not make them break off the Treaty they had begun; they conſider'd, that his Highneſs might tell the World, his Subjects had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to accept the Favours he had offered them; beſides, they thought the ill ſucceſs of this Negotiation, might be imputed to them; but the Reaſon which moſt prevail'd with them, was, that they plainly ſaw, it would be more for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> to ſubmit to the Will of their Soveraign, than to expoſe themſelves to all the miſchiefs their Diſobedience might bring upon them.</p>
            <p>They therefore determin'd to conſent to the accommodation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, as a leſs Evil, than to ſee the <hi>Vally</hi> Churches brought to Deſolation: and the rather, becauſe the Marqueſs
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109768:42"/>
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> aſſur'd them, that his <hi>R. H.</hi> to teſtifie the eſteem he had for them, would at their interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion grant all that could be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably deſired, without wounding his reputation.</p>
            <p>But before the Embaſſadors would propoſe to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> that which their Prince required of them, the Embaſſadors deſired not only to be inform'd, of what nature the ſubmiſſion was to be, which was expected from them; but alſo to regulate and agree with his <hi>R. H.</hi> Miniſters, in what form and term it ſhould be drawn up.</p>
            <p>Several Projects of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be preſented to his <hi>R. H.</hi> by the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> were by each party propoſed; but at laſt it was agreed, it ſhould contain a moſt humble ſupplication, beſeeching the Prince to pardon thoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and if they had not paid
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109768:43"/>
that reſpect which was due to him, yet they had never fail'd in the Allegiance they had ſworn to his Highneſs.</p>
            <p>After which the Embaſſadors having got a ſafe conduct for five or ſix of the Inhabitants of the Vallies, they ſent it away to them by the Secretary of the Embaſſie, with a Letter whereof you have here a Copy.</p>

of his Miniſters ſignified to us, That he being your Soveraign, he could not without a breach of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority, enter into any Treaty with you; but will have you depute five or ſix Perſons, with full Power to make the ſubmiſſion which is due to him; and to petition for the favour you deſire ſhould be granted to you; and then his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will teſtifie what eſteem he hath for our Lords.

                  <p>IT is true, that a Man's own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath very great Charms, and the greateſt part of Mankind have a natural deſire to live and dye in it, but yet the Children of God, ought not to ſet their Hearts upon it, ſeeing they are ſtrangers upon Earth, Heaven being their proper Country; ſo that you will be guilty of diſtruſting Divine Providence, if you fear you ſhall not be able to find another Country, where you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently live and adore your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father. In what part of the World ſoever a Man is, he ought
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109768:48"/>
to think himſelf happy, if he there have liberty to ſerve God according to the Dictates of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. You ought to follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Patriarchs, who drew down God's Bleſſing on themſelves, by relying on his Promiſes, and by abandoning their Houſes and Lands, when he commanded them to go and dwell in a ſtrange Country. The like Confidence cannot but be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and it is without doubt, more conformable to the mind of the Goſpel; to forſake a Man's Country, than to take Arms againſt his Soveraign. Chriſtians are called to ſuffer, and not to reſiſt, and we do not find that the Apoſtles or the Primitive Church, made uſe of any other defence, but Prayers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, againſt their Perſecutors. Theſe are the Conſiderations which obliged our Soveraign Lords the Evangelick Cantons to give us or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; to procure from his Royal Highneſs, your lawful Prince, free
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109768:48"/>
leave for you to depart, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to diſpoſe of your Goods, in caſe he will not any longer ſuffer the Exerciſe of your Religion: And tho' you look on this retreat as an intollerable Miſchief, yet our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lords conſider it as a favour, when they reflect on the ſad Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereto you are reduced; they alſo think it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to obtain it from his Royal Highneſs: If he grant it at their interceſſion: You ought not only to accept it with ſubmiſſion, but alſo to be very thankful for it. After this, you cannot doubt but that we have been very much ſurpriſed to hear, that you have reſolved not to take this Courſe, but intend to reſiſt two mighty Potentates; who have oblig'd themſelves to extirpate you, in caſe you do not ſubmit to their will: And herein you do not only act againſt your Duty, againſt Chriſtian Prudence, and againſt your own Intereſt; but you give us
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109768:49"/>
juſt cauſe to complain of you, ſeeing that after having engaged us in a Negotiation with your Prince, you will not ſo much as ſtoop to lay hold on thoſe advantages we are able to procure for you. Open your Eyes then, and ſee the miſchief into which you are running headlong, and the fatal conſequences of your reſolution, which muſt neceſſarily ruine your Churches, and deſtroy your Families; know that what is offered you, is ſo much for your advantage, conſidering the preſent ſtate of your affairs, that many perſons of the beſt quality, would have embraced it as a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in the late Perſecutions in <hi>France,</hi> yea would have been glad with all their Hearts, if they might have been ſuffered to quit their Country Stark-naked. If you will conſider all theſe things, we hope their Example, whoſe Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more reaſonable, will move you, and perſwade you to be of their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109768:49"/>
opinion; if you refuſe to follow their Example, and perſiſt in your obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, you will be guilty before God, not only of throwing away your lives, which you might have ſaved, and of expoſing your Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to butchery, but alſo of having cauſed the ruine of the reſt of the Valley Churches, which you might have removed into another Country. Flatter not your ſelves with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving you ſhall be able to eſcape theſe Miſchiefs, by the ſuccours which ſome have told you you ſhall receive, for we aſſure you that they who entertain you with ſuch vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, abuſe you; there is not any place that will or can aſſiſt you, you will be forſaken by all people, even by one part of the Inhabitants of your Country, ſo that you will ſoon be deſtroyed either by Famine or the Sword; they that eſcape the fury of their Enemies, muſt expect to dye at a Stake, on the Wheel, or the Gallows: We therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure

you, to let ſuch conſiderations as theſe prevail with you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with thoſe Communities, that have reſolved to deſire their Prince's leave to retire out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; believing that Gods Providence will lead you into ſome place, where you may find perhaps a better and more advantageous ſettlement, than that which you leave, and where the poor will meet with charitable Perſons who will provide for their neceſſities.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109768:50"/>
they thought it neceſſary to let the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> know in what diſpoſition the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were, and prevent thoſe Evils which their Diviſion might draw upon them from His Royal Highneſs, and the Enemies which they had in his Council. They therefore went to give this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a Viſit, and told him, the Deputies were come, that five of them were ready in the name of their Communities to make their ſubmiſſion, which His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required of them: But others who did not know what they were to expect from His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Clemency, were not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Sign the Submiſſion. In the mean time a Letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them, to adviſe them to follow their Example, who had reſolved to ſubmit, and that their Reſolution would be very ſpedily known.</p>
            <p>After this, they pray'd the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109768:51"/>
Marqueſs to intercede with His Royal Highneſs to favour thoſe poor People, and beſeech him to have ſome pity on them; That His Highneſs ſeeing they were prepoſſeſs'd with diſtruſt, would ſo far declare his Intentions, as to put them out of pain, and that the ſubmiſſion might be made by common conſent, to the ſatisfaction both of Prince, and People.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> told the Embaſſadors, that the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> did very much ſurprize him; nevertheleſs, he promis'd to do for them all the good Offices he could with His Royal Highneſs, that ſo their delaying to give His Highneſs the ſatisfaction He expected, might not be prejudicial to them, and that His Highneſs might not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Counſel of other Perſons, who preſs'd him to uſe ſeverity.</p>
            <p>The Court was very impatient to ſee an end of this Affair, the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109768:51"/>
Embaſſadors wrote a Letter to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to let him know they had prepared the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> Petition, and that it ſhould be ready to be preſented, when it was Signed by all the Deputies; but one of them being abſent, they pray'd nothing might be done 'till his return.</p>
            <p>The next day after this Letter was deliver'd to the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Embaſſadors waited on him, to learn what effect it had wrought, when he preſt very much that the five Deputies who were then at <hi>Turin,</hi> ſhould Sign the Petition, whereof he liked the form: The Embaſſadors told him, that the Subſcription could not be made by the Deputies who were preſent, in his abſence who was ſent to the <hi>Vallies</hi>; for their Intereſts being joint, they could not ſeparate one from another, and that it had been agreed, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſhould be Sign'd at one and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109768:52"/>
the ſame time by all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties.</p>
            <p>But the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> having ſecret Orders to haſten the Subſcription of the Deputies who were at Court, was not ſatisfied with the Reaſons given for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing what he demanded; and the next day he ſent one of his People to the Ambaſſadors, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they would diſpoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to give him the ſatisfaction he deſired; but the Embaſſadors wrote a few Lines to the Marqueſs, wherein they ſaid it was not juſt to divide thoſe in the Subſcription, who were engaged in the ſame Cauſe; and that if ſome Signed the Petition without the others, ſuch a Proceeding muſt needs have ill Conſequences, and therefore intreated the Marqueſs to ſtay but one day more for the ſixth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and prevail with his Royal Highneſs to grant them the ſhort ſtay they deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109768:52"/>The Marqueſs having received this Note, told the Secretary of the Embaſſy who brought it, that his Royal Highneſs was extreamly diſpleas'd with theſe delays, and likewiſe ſaid he very much fear'd his Highneſs would take ſuch a Reſolution, as would carry things to fatal extremities; the Deputies muſt therefore Sign their Petition immediately, and bring it to him, that he might preſent it to his Royal Highneſs.</p>
            <p>The Deputies fearing to irritate ſo powerful a Miniſter, if they refus'd to appear before him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go to his Houſe; but all the Arguments the Marqueſs us'd, could not perſwade them to Sign the Petition, tho' he aſſur'd them it ſhould be no prejudice to thoſe of <hi>Boby</hi>: But they ſtood firm to their firſt Reſolution; their excuſe was, that they were oblig'd to ſtay for the Deputy who was gone to the <hi>Vallies,</hi> That the ſucceſs
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109768:53"/>
of his Negotiation was uncertain, That he was to return ſpeedily, and that Signing ſeparately, might involve them in a great deal of danger.</p>
            <p>The Reſolution of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties at <hi>Turin,</hi> and that of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> who intended to take Arms, very much diſquieted his Royal Highneſs; and that which more diſpleas'd him, was the news brought him, that they had kill'd two <hi>French Men,</hi> who belong'd to the Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Embaſſador of <hi>France</hi> who was extreamly impatient, becauſe his Royal Highneſs delay'd the execution of his Edict, fail'd not to take advantage of this accident, and by it to diſpoſe his Highneſs to take vengeance on his Subjects, who had committed this Crime in contempt of his Authority, and to deal with theſe People like Rebels. While the Enemies of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were contriving their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109768:53"/>
deſtruction, the Deputies at <hi>Turin</hi> were in a ſad Condition; and not knowing what to reſolve, they took Counſel of the Embaſſadors, to know what courſe they ſhould take in this their preſent extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the Embaſſadors hoping that the Deputy who was gone to <hi>Boby,</hi> would ſpeedily return, and that he might bring back News which might appeaſe his Royal Highneſs, thought it beſt to ſtay for his coming, before they took any particular Reſolution.</p>
            <p>But the Deputy ſtaying a long time, and his Royal Highneſs being continually ſollicited by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, to put an end to this Affair, otherwiſe the Troops which were in his Country would put him to exceſſive Charge; his Highneſs, being likewiſe inform'd, that the Embaſſadors had diſpatch'd a Courrier into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> who might bring them new Orders, reſolved, for theſe Reaſons, to put
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109768:54"/>
an end to the buſineſs, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the earneſt and preſſing Reaſons, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors urged in favour of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> to incline the Duke to defer for ſome little time his laſt Reſolution, he cauſed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Edict to be Publiſhed the 9<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>June.</hi>

their wickedneſs, and are fallen into notorious and horrible Rebellion; yet our natural Clemency ſurpaſſing their Crimes, We with fatherly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance have a long time in vain expected their Repentance, and tho' they have hitherto follow'd ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, We are ſtill willing to leave them to their own Reſolutions, either to chuſe a good or bad Condition: We open to them a door of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may make advantage of it, in the manner following; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with if they do not comply, by their ready obedience, let them thank their own temerity for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have deſerved, and ſhall receive without remiſſion, from Our injur'd Patience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore We confirm Our Order of the <hi>31th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> in all things, wherein it is not contrary to this; and We, by Vertue of this preſent Edict, do of our own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge, full Power, and abſolute Authority, by the Advice
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109768:55"/>
of Our Council, Order, and Command all Our Subjects of the Vallies of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,</hi> profeſſing the pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, to lay down their Arms, and retire to their Houſes, within the time hereafter limited.</p>
               <p>We alſo command them not to have any Meetings or Aſſemblies in any manner whatever, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Our intention, the Judges of the places may have free acceſs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the Fathers Miſſionary, and other Religions may return to the Churches they were forced to leave, and that the Catholicks, and thoſe that have embraced the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, may return unto the Houſes which they quitted.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is not reaſonable that the Miſſionary Religious, the Catholicks, and ſuch as have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Catholick Religion, ſhould be at any loſs for the many damages they have ſuffered from thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, We Intend, Will, and Ordain, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109768:55"/>
there be Levied indiſtinctly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, upon the Goods of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, all ſuch neceſſary Sums to indemnify them, as ſhall be ſummarily proved before the Chevalier <hi>Monroux,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Vallies;</hi> Declaring nevertheleſs, that in caſe thoſe of the ſaid Religion, do prove parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons were the cauſe of thoſe damages, then ſatisfaction ſhall be required of thoſe particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew Our ſaid Subjects how great Our Clemency is, towards them, we permit all who reſolve to depart out of Our Dominions, to do it within the term, and upon the Conditions hereafter preſcribed.</p>
               <p>But becauſe their evil intentions have been too well known by their paſt Behaviour, and many may hide their wicked Deſigns under the Cloak of Obedience, We reſerve to Our ſelves Power of making ſuch Laws concerning thoſe who ſhall not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109768:56"/>
voluntarily quit Our Dominions, as We think good and moſt expedient, to ſecure the peace of thoſe that ſtay; which Laws we expect ſhall be obſerved by them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And for an addition to Our Grace and Favour, We grant, as well to thoſe that ſhall depart vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, as to thoſe that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by Our Command, leave to carry with them what Neceſſaries, Goods and Effects they pleaſe, and to ſell ſuch Goods and Effects as they leave behind them, but in the manner hereafter expreſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame is intended concerning Foreigners, and thoſe that are deſcended from them, who are to conform themſelves to the laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the above-mentioned Order, Dated <hi>January</hi> the <hi>31th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sale of Goods aforeſaid ſhall be made to Catholicks, and to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have embraced the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion; but becauſe ſuch
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109768:56"/>
buyers may not be found within the term hereafter expreſt, and becauſe it is not our Will, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioniſts who ſhall depart out of Our Dominions, ſhould be deprived of the benefit of our preſent Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; We grant them power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point four or ſix Perſons, with whom they may leave their Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and who ſhall with our permiſſion ſtay three Months in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,</hi> with free liberty to treat and negotiate with any Perſon for the ſelling the Goods of thoſe that are gone, who likewiſe may ſpecifie in their Procurations, upon what terms they would (for their greater Security) have their Goods ſold, and receive their price from their Proctors, without Fraud or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezelment, whereever they deſire to have it remitted, whereof the Chief Juſtice <hi>Monroux</hi> ſhall be charged to take care.</p>
               <p>They that will retire ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be ready at ſuch days and

               <p>The term within which our Subjects of the pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, Inhabiting the Vallies of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> are to lay down their Arms in the manner expreſt in the firſt Article of the preſent Order, is eight days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhall be Publiſh'd in <hi>Lucerne,</hi> within which time they are to obey the Contents of the Order, if they expect to enjoy the fruits of Our Clemency, and of that Paternal affection, wherewith, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of their Crimes, We regard Our Subjects, and We grant to all Our ſaid Subjects, who punctually obſerve all that is above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Grace, Pardon, Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Abolition, and an ample Amneſty of all their Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Faults, Crimes, and other Offences they may have done or

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109768:58"/>

            <p>As ſoon as this Edict was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> brought it to the Embaſſadors, whom he would have made believe, that it was for their ſake his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been ſo gracious to his Subjects, and that tho' the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador was extreamly angry ſo much favour was ſhew'd to the Inhabitants of the Vallies, yet His Royal Highneſs intended the Edict ſhould be <hi>bona fide</hi> executed.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors having read the Edict upon the place, in the preſence of the Marqueſs, made ſome Reflections on it, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted chiefly on the ſhortneſs of the time given to theſe miſerable people to depart out of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Dominions, and to diſpoſe of their Effects; they likewiſe took notice of the ſmall number of Proctors who were charged to ſell the goods of ſo great a number of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109768:59"/>
Perſons; they reflected on the time preſcribed for ſale, and ſome other difficulties they met with in the execution of the Edict, which when they had well conſider'd, they intended to lay before his Royal Highneſs.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Embaſſadors had left the Marqueſs, they ſent for the Deputies of the Vallies who were ready to make the ſubmiſſion, and bid them return home, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to inform their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of all that had paſt, and what was contain'd in the Edict, and to let them know, that if they did not ſubmit, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to procure the rigorous execution of the Edict to be in any particular mitigated.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were doing, the ſixth Deputy who had been ſo long expected, came back from the Vallies, and told the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that the Communities who deſign'd to defend themſelves, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109768:59"/>
in that reſolution, and that all the arguments which had been us'd to incline them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts, wrought no change in their minds, as appear'd by the Letters written from the Vallies, which were to the following effect.</p>

                  <p>PReſently after the arrival of of our Deputy, we did not fail to give Copies of the Letter which your Excellencies were pleaſed to write to our Churches, they have been every where read, immediately after Sermon; nothing can be written more true, more moving, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory; and your Excellencies may be perfectly aſſur'd, that there is not a perſon who doth not ſee and acknowledge the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of your Chriſtian Charity towards our Churches; however,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109768:60"/>
it hath been hitherto impoſſible to perſwade the greateſt part of the People to go out of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; ſome out of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it will be the loſs of many who ſtay; ſome out of a Principle of Conſcience; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for divers Conſiderations, which our Deputy will tell your Excellencies by word of mouth. We are at our wits end about it, and ſcarce dare to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Excellencies after ſo much irreſolution; our People are the more obſtinate in their opinion, ſince they have heard that ſeveral other Churches, or at leaſt a good part of them, never underſtood that any ſuch thing as going out of the Country was in queſtion, when they gave their Mandate and Procuration to their Deputies; or if they have heard of it, they are return'd to their firſt Reſolution; which makes us juſtly fear, that when
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109768:60"/>
your Excellencies ſhall be further engaged for theſe People, they will hereafter repent their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to depart, which we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thought the <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, when we told your Excellencies that we deſir'd to have the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our People upon this point; foreſeeing at firſt that it would be very difficult to make them conſent to it; the greateſt part of them are reſolved to be their Fathers own Children, and hope the Lord will be their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, and ſerve himſelf of the weak, to confound the ſtrong, and that Heaven by ſome means or other will prevent the deſigns which are laid againſt them. We doubt not but this will very much trouble your Excellencies, and we are ſorry for it with all our Souls; nevertheleſs, we with all poſſible humility, conjure your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies not to wax cold towards our Churches, nor to deprive us of

your powerful aſſiſtance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which under God, hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made us ſubſiſt; for Gods ſake have ſtill pity upon us, which way ſoever things go; we pour out our Souls before God, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeeching him, that he will be pleaſed to diſpoſe all things to the glory of his Name, and for the preſervation of our People; and that his Divine Providence will wake your Excellencies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to procure ſome few days longer for us, once more to try the Peoples minds, and if it be poſſible to know their final reſolution by majority of voices, that ſo we may not be blamed by either ſide; the Lord will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly reward all your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Charity, and we are with all reſpect,</p>

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:109768:63"/>The Ambaſſadors had no ſooner read theſe Letters, but they ſent back the Deputies with another Letter, whereof two Copies were taken, and one of them ſent to thoſe of St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Boby,</hi> the other, to thoſe of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and <hi>de la Tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter ſhew'd them the vanity and little ſolidity of thoſe Reaſons upon which they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Reſolution, not to accept of the Grace which was offer'd them. The Letter told them, it was not to be deny'd, but that the Law which oblig'd men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Countrey, was very ſevere, yet at the ſame time, the Law is much more rigorous, which forces men to forſake the Eternal God, and renounce the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that they ought to think themſelves happy, that of theſe two ſad extremities, they were left to their choice; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was denyed in <hi>France,</hi> to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109768:64"/>
People of great Birth, and known Merit, who were kept by force in their Countrey, and compelled to give themſelves up to Idolatry. That the things of this World are ſubject to continual Changes; that Kings and Princes are often forced to quit their Crowns, and give up their Dominions to their Enemies; and therefore private perſons ought without murmuring, to be ſubject to this common Fate, and ſubmit with reſignation to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Gods Providence, who by his chaſtiſements tryes the faith of his Children, and takes off their hearts from this World, to make them the more earneſtly ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Celeſtial Country. They had indeed reaſon to believe that God's arm which had ſupported them in former Wars, was not ſhortned; but that they ought to conſider, God then had raiſed up their Neighbours to aſſiſt them, with Men, Money, and Officers;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109768:64"/>
then they had none but friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, whereas now they were compaſſed with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on all ſides: Heretofore there were a great number of People among them able to bear Arms, but at preſent, they were deprived of all thoſe advantages, their Prince alone was able to extirpate them, and yet his Forces were not the only Troops they had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. That thoſe of <hi>France</hi> were ready to fall upon them, and though they might be ſo fortunate to have the better in ſome of their firſt engagements, yet in the end, they muſt needs be totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the multitude of thoſe that would ſupply the places of the vanquiſhed: That the diviſion which was among them would be very prejudicial to them; That the refuſing to accept the offer made by their Soveraign, would make all the Proteſtant Princes to forſake them, becauſe they choſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109768:65"/>
raſhly to take up Arms, rather than to follow the good Counſel which was given them. That they ought not to flatter themſelves with the hope of ſome miraculous Deliverance, as was that which God gave the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd all the Army of <hi>Zena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib.</hi> That in the Age wherein we live, God doth not work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in favour of his Church, as he did in the time of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The Holy Scripture telleth us, that to caſt our ſelves into dangers, out of which we foreſee 'tis impoſſible to deliver our ſelves, is to tempt God, who forſakes thoſe that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully run headlong into danger. That Chriſtian Prudence, the Charity due to their Wives and Children, and that love they ought to have for themſelves, did oblige them to follow the Example of other Inhabitants of the Vallies. That their Prince, looking upon them as Criminals, would ſeize
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109768:65"/>
their Goods, and make them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ignominious puniſhment, if they perſiſted in their reſolutions. That ſeeing Divine Providence had bleſt their endeavours who interceded for them, it was plain that God would not have them proceed any further in the way they were going. That ſeeing a mitigation of the rigour of the Edict had been obtained for them, they ought to accept it; it was not the fault of thoſe who had mediated, that their Condition was no better, and they might be aſſur'd, the Ambaſſadors would zealouſly endeavour to obtain for them ſomewhat of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but if that ſhould be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet they ought to accept of that which was offer'd, ſeeing in the ſtate wherein they were, they could not capitulate with their Prince, who had Forces enough to compel them to obey him. That if they refus'd to ſubmit to his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109768:66"/>
will, their obſtinacy would not only coſt them the loſs of their Bodies, but alſo of their Souls; and they had reaſon to fear that they who eſcaped the Sword of their Perſecutors, would at laſt periſh under the cruelty of thoſe puniſhments which would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them, to force them to renounce their Religion. That they had no cauſe to fear, that the leave granted to them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire where they pleaſed, was a ſnare laid for them; ſeeing the Court gave them ſuch ſecurity as ought to have quieted their Minds in that point, and ſatisfy'd them, that his Royal Highneſs would not ſuffer any thing to be done contrary to his promiſe, to ſtain his honour and reputation by publick perfidy, or fail in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he hath hitherto had for the Evangelick Cantons. That if there had been a deſign to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, it might eaſily have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109768:66"/>
been done at firſt, but his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would not permit it, nor ever will for the future. In fine, the Troops of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> were ready to attack them on all ſides, and yet they might be ſure no harm would be done them, if they did ſubmit to his Royal Highneſſes Orders.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors at their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure having reflected on his Royal Highneſſes laſt Edict, were of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> would not ſubmit to it without expoſing themſelves to very great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to renew their ſollicitations, to procure better Conditions for them: They pray'd the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to obtain an Audience from his Royal Highneſs; having obtain'd it, they told his Highneſs they had conſider'd his laſt Edict, and had taken the liberty to make ſome obſervations upon the three principal points contain'd in ſome
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109768:67"/>
Clauſes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, that Clauſe which gave the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Vallies ten days time to go out of his Dominions; ſecondly, that which preſcribed to them the number of ſix Proctors to ſell their goods; and thirdly, that which for ſelling their goods allow'd them but three Months. They pray'd his Royal Highneſs to caſt his eyes on the remarks they had made in the Memoir they had preſented to him, and to conſider, that to abate the rigour of his Edict could in no wiſe be prejudicial to his Highneſſes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but would be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to his Subjects, who had ſo great a reſpect, and ſo much affection for their Soveraign, that they could not reſolve to leave his Dominions, becauſe, in quitting their Countrey, they knew they ſhould be deprived of being able to teſtify their fidelity in all occaſions, by venturing their Lives in his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109768:67"/>
ſervice; they therefore hoped his Royal Highneſs would ſhew his Clemency towards them, and give ſuch Orders as were neceſſary for their going conveniently out of his Territories, and carrying all that with them which they could ſave of their Ship-wrack'd fortune; by this favour his Highneſs would give their Excellencies the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Cantons</hi> a new occaſion of continuing that affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Highneſs which they have always had for the Royal Family of <hi>Savoy</hi>; and as to their own particular, his Highneſs would convince them, that their good Offices had not been unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, for thoſe poor miſerable People for whom they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded.</p>
            <p>The Duke anſwer'd the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and ſaid, That to ſhew the eſteem he had for the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Cantons,</hi> he had given his People teſtimonies of extraordinary
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109768:68"/>
Clemency; that he had not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis'd them as they deſerv'd, but had waited with patience their coming to themſelves, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to their duty; that they having carried on their Rebellion to the utmoſt extremity, and given him new cauſe to complain, by the Inſolencies they had of late committed, they had now ty'd up his hands ſo that he could not grant what they demanded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding his Reputation and his Authority. That his forbearing them, had drawn upon him great reproaches from <hi>France</hi>; however he was willing they ſhould enjoy the benefit of his Edict, and if they expected, that the rigour of the Orders therein contained ſhould be abated, they muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves worthy of it, by laying down their Arms, and ſubmitting themſelves to his Will. The Embaſſadors then delivered to his Royal Highneſs the following Memoir.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:109768:68"/>
               <p>YOur Highneſs is moſt humbly pray'd to conſider, That he who will, or muſt leave the Vallies, in Obedience to the Edict Publiſh'd by your Highneſs, is oblig'd to prepare himſelf for his departure; for the carrying away his Wife, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his Neceſſary Goods: He muſt provide for the ſale of his Corn, his Wines, his Proviſions, and his Cattle, which cannot be left in his Houſe without care taken of them: he cannot leave them with his Proctor who will be at <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and who by being at a diſtance cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take charge of them: That within the term of eight days a man cannot account, either with his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors or Debtors; becauſe thoſe with whom he hath had dealings, may perhaps not live in the Vallies, or becauſe he may have accounts which cannot be adjuſted without the interpoſition of ſome Arbitrator. That as to real Eſtates in Land, an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109768:69"/>
exact and particular deſcription ought to be made of every Field, Vineyard, Meadow, Wood, their limits and boundaries ſet out, as alſo the rights appertaining to them, and the Sums for which they are engaged; and concerning all this, ſpecial and large Procurations muſt be given.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mov'd by your Juſtice and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, hath been pleas'd to grant to your Subjects of the Vallies leave to retire where they think fit, and to ſell their Goods which they leave behind them; it cannot be your Highneſſes intention, that your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be deprived of the Benefit and Effects of your gracious conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by not allowing them time enough to depart, for that will be taking away with one hand, that which is given them with the other.</p>
               <p>Your Royal Highneſs is further humbly pray'd to conſider, that ſix
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109768:69"/>
Proctors are not enough to ſell the Goods of ſome hundreds of Families who are willing to depart, and that the Employment cannot be given to any but people of the Country, and conſequently to ignorant and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Perſons, without capacity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd with their own Affairs: beſides, theſe Proctors muſt be obliged to run from place to place to get buyers, and to ſhew the Lands that are to be bought; they muſt paſs Acts in ſeveral places before Publick Notaries, and muſt look after the ſale of a great quantity of Goods diſperſt in divers Houſes; they, muſt tell Money, change it, remit it to foreign Countries, and look after conveniencies to do it. They muſt clear Objections, remove Obſtacles, defend themſelves againſt unjuſt demands; They muſt receive Letters from thoſe that are gone, and ſend them an account of their buſineſs; in a word, they will have a thouſand other things to do,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109768:70"/>
which cannot at preſent be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
               <p>Seeing then your Royal Highneſs doth not intend to make any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your poor Subjects Goods, nor to augment your Revenue with the Spoils of your People; your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would do well to permit them to name twelve Perſons, who during the time granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by your Royal Highneſs, may proceed to the ſale of thoſe Perſons Goods who ſhall retire.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it will certainly fall out, that during the term of three Months, be the Proctors never ſo diligent to ſell the poor Refugies Lands, there will be found but few Buyers; and that every one will ſtay till towards the end of the ſaid term, on purpoſe to take advantage of the neceſſity wherein People are, to put off their Eſtates, and to get them from theſe miſerable People at a very low Price; they otherwiſe fearing they ſhall loſe all. We hope
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109768:70"/>
your Royal Highneſs will be ſo good as to remedy this inconvenience; and according to Covenants paſt with his deceaſed Highneſs of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory, in <hi>1663.</hi> cauſe a valuable price to be given for thoſe Lands and Goods, which could not be ſold in three Months.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs being ſo exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily good and merciful, certainly will not oblige any Perſon whatever to impoſſibilities, and therefore will readily diſpence with Women who Lie in, or are near their time; and alſo with Old or Sick People, and not require them to obſerve the Law which you have preſcribed to others concerning their retreat. That your Highneſs will be pleas'd to exempt them from quartering of Souldiers, who be they never ſo well diſciplin'd, are always diſorderly; that your Highneſs will likewiſe ſuffer them to live and die in their Houſes, without fear of being ill us'd, and robb'd of their Goods and Proviſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:109768:71"/>In fine, we earneſtly pray, that your Royal Highneſs will be pleaſed to ſhew your Clemency towards thoſe of the Vallies, who are in your Highneſſes Priſons; and likewiſe towards thoſe that have been taken upon their account, and be ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to give them their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> when he received the Embaſſadors Memoir, promis'd to conſider it, and ſaid he would let them know his mind concerning it.</p>
            <p>While the Embaſſadors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at <hi>Turin</hi> to do all the good they could for the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> thoſe People took up a reſolution, which prov'd their utter ruine; for whereas before the publication of the laſt Edict, the greateſt part of them had reſolved to ſeek out a retreat ſomewhere elſe; they now joyn'd all together in one common conſent, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Armies which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109768:71"/>
were ready to fall in upon them.</p>
            <p>In their Conſultations, the Reaſons given for this Reſolution, were, that the Edict to which his Royal Highneſs required their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, contain'd many things which they could not own, and others which they could not do; in the firſt place, they ſaid it was not juſt, that they ſhould be bound to acknowledge themſelves guilty of the Rebellion wherewith they were charged, ſeeing they had done nothing againſt his Royal Highneſs's ſervice, but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for maintaining the Exerciſe of their Religion, they were oblig'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they ought not to ſubmit to the laſt Edict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it confirm'd that of <hi>January</hi> 31. which deprived them of the liberty of ſerving God according to their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:109768:72"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to obey the Command of laying down their Arms, becauſe if they did, they ſhould run the hazard of loſing their Lives here, and their Souls hereafter, and be in a condition as bad as they were in former Perſecutions, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe in the year 1655. when by woful experience, they found that ſome People made no ſcruple of breaking their word, and that which confirmed them in this Opinion, was, the Troops coming ſo near to them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had promis'd and aſſur'd them, none ſhould enter into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try till the term mention'd in the Edict was expired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the time given to prepare themſelves for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, was too ſhort, and that they could not comply with the Edict, becauſe the number of their Valley Inhabitants was very great,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109768:72"/>
many were very old, and many others ſick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It was impoſſible for their Goods to be ſold by Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Proctors, and tho' they did reſolve to ſell them, yet it was upon condition they might receive the price they was ſold for, before they went away, or to have it depoſited in the hands of the Embaſſadors; that their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates likewiſe in the Mountains, might be ſold as well as thoſe in Plains, and alſo what they had in the <hi>French</hi> King's Territories; in fine, ſeeing the ſale was to be made to Roman Catholicks, they had cauſe to fear the Eccleſiaſticks would not ſuffer them to be ſold, in confidence that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould be maſters of them, when all the Inhabitants were gone out of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> All things were to be feared from thoſe who held it for a Maxim, that <hi>Faith was not to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109768:73"/>
be kept with Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſters and ſuch of the Vallies, who had moſt ſenſe and reaſon, did all they could to hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the People from coming to this extremity, but all the Arguments that were us'd would not divert them from their Reſolution, not keep them from being led by thoſe that flatter'd them with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary hopes of Succours; theſe were the Perſons, who by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them not to accept of the Grace which was offer'd, were the cauſe of their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>By the following Letter it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears what art was us'd to make thoſe People change their minds, and run headlong to their own Ruine.</p>

            <p>In another Letter written by the Paſtors of the Vally-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, there is a Poſtſcript in theſe words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr.— Miniſter in the Church of <hi>Pinache,</hi> a Valley of <hi>Perouze,</hi> is come from—who, we verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve hath given him Inſtructions to ſtir up and perſwade, as he doth all people, to dye rather than ſubmit to leaving their Country, tho' never
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109768:74"/>
ſo many Promiſes be made them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Reſolution being reported to the Embaſſadors, they plainly ſaw that in the mind theſe People were, there was no appearance of making them change their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or of bringing them to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But however the Embaſſadors reſolv'd to try once more, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to accept the favour their Prince offer'd, tho' it was not ſo advantageous as they wiſh'd, and conſidering the only way to make ſome impreſſion upon them, was to make their Retreat leſs inconvenient and leſs troubleſome than it would be, if the Terms of the Edict were to be obſerved; they fell to ſolliciting for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Memoir they had preſented to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that in caſe it were favourable, they might ſend it to the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> as the beſt Argument they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109768:75"/>
could uſe to prevail with them.</p>
            <p>But the Anſwer was not ſuch as they deſired, for the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas</hi> told the Embaſſadors, that his Royal Highneſs would not make a more ample, or any other Declaration, touching thoſe things which were contained in his laſt Edict, becauſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſtood out ſo obſtinately in their Rebellion, and refus'd to lay down their Arms, boaſting they were in a Condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him; his R.

            <p>As ſoon as the Embaſſadors had left the Marqueſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> they diſpatch'd a Currier to thoſe of the Valleys, and by the following

We repreſented to him as well <hi>Viva Voces</hi> as by a Memoir, thoſe Reaſons which we thought might prevail with him to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate thoſe Orders which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready publiſh'd againſt you; We ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray'd him to grant you longer time to prepare your ſelves for ſo ſad a parting, to ſell your goods, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the number of the Proctors who were to make the ſale; to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Aged, Sick and Weak, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men very big with Child, and thoſe that lay in, to ſtay in the Country, free from ill uſage, and from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

of Souldiers; in fine, to give orders that the Proctors ſhould buy thoſe goods which they did not ſell within the time ſpecified in the Edict, but of all this we could obtain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his R.

            <p>Tho' the Embaſſadors now ſaw that the Affairs of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were deſperate, and to remedy them was impoſſible, they would not abandon thoſe poor People, thinking they might ſome way or other be ſerviceable to them, if they follow'd his Royal Highneſs's Camp; and that they might ſo do, they prayed the Marqueſs St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to ask his Royal Highneſs's leave.</p>
            <p>But the Marqueſs told them their preſence might give ſome jealouſie to the French Embaſſador, and to the <hi>Pope</hi>; therefore ſince his Royal Highneſs had great reaſon not to diſoblige the moſt Chriſtian King, the Embaſſadors did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any more on that demand:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109768:77"/>
Things being in this condition, had his Royal Highneſs been never ſo well diſpos'd to ſhew how much eſteem he had for the Embaſſadors, yet he could not let them know how much he regarded their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.</p>
            <p>When the Embaſſadors had their Audience of leave, they were told, if any occaſion ſhould hereafter bring them to Court, all deference ſhould be paid due to their Character. They reſolv'd to return to their Country, according to an Order which within few days they had received from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, in a Letter written to them from <hi>Zurich</hi>; wherein the Proteſtant Cantons recalled them from their Negotiation, if they thought it would prove ineffectual.</p>
            <p>They ſuppoſing that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or ſome other Miniſters, might find ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity to incline his Royal Highneſs to be merciful to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109768:77"/>
his poor Subjects of the Valleys, reſolved to make them a Viſit, and intreat them to have compaſſion on thoſe poor Creatures, and do them all the good Offices that were in their Power; but the Court parting in great haſte, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to do what they intended; and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that by writing, which they could not by word of Mouth. A little while after they receiv'd an anſwer from the Marqueſs, who aſſur'd them, that upon any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> he would employ his utmoſt power to ſerve them.</p>
            <p>Some few days before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors went a way, they receiv'd two Letters from the Valleys; one written by all the Communities of the Valley Inhabitants, directed to the Evangelick Cantons.</p>
