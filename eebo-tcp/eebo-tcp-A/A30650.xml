            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The People are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ignorant of a right Reformation. A right Reformation is a setting up of Christs spirituall kingdome, first over the hearts and consciences, and then over the severall Churches. For this,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53107:4"/>
the <note n="*" place="margin">Zach. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Carpenters</hi> and <hi>Masons</hi> must be set a work, godly and able Ministers must be sought out, and sought for of the Lord, to fit the crooked timber, and rugged stones, for the Spirituall Temple. For <hi>England</hi> is generally ignorant of the mysterie of Christs Kingdome; the <hi>Prelates</hi> usurped all, suppressed altogether this Spirituall kingdom; no Ministers durst so much as mutter a word of it. Who durst say, that mens Consciences are subject to none, but Christ? That Christ is the only Law-giver of his Church? That the Churches of Christ ought not to be burthened with any humane ordinances in Gods Worship? That all humane rites and ceremonies invented by men, and imposed on men in Gods service, are all a <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note> will-worship, condemned by the Apostle? And the like. And yet wee deny not that every member in a Church is to be subject to the Officers thereof, holding out the Word, for conscience sake, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 17. Now if the People have not heard of Christ thus a King, no, not to this day in most Congregations of <hi>England</hi> do heare, or understand any thing of Christs kingly Office over Consciences and Churches, as whereupon a right reformation doth principally depend: how can such a Reformation be speedily set up, when the preaching up of Christs Kingdome is altogether silent, as if Ministers mouths were not yet freed from their old muzzle? Therefore, I conceive, if the better heed be not taken, there may be <hi>more hoste</hi> to a <hi>Reformation, then good speed:</hi> when among so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, so many thousands in <hi>England,</hi> very few would be found to have on the <hi>Wedding garment.</hi> A Reformation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, such as God requires, will necessarily require longer time yet, that we may not go blind-fold about it.</p>
            <p>You tell us, that <hi>importunity of some reverend friends hath drawn from you your digested subitane apprehensions of these distracting Controversies.</hi> Who those reverend friends are, it matters not. But had I been accounted worthy to be reckoned among those <hi>reverend friends,</hi> to have been made acquainted with such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I should have used all <hi>importunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But some will say, When the Tribes of Israel were reduced under a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly government, as in <hi>Davids</hi> time, the service of God was in greater state and externall pomp, when the Temple was built, then it was before in the Tabernacle; whereby it may appear, that there was a liberty left to <hi>David</hi> to alter the form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship so, as was sutable to the Regall state. But I answer, Here was no liberty left to man to alter any thing in the worship of God, or in the <hi>Church-government.</hi> For God was so exact in this, that he would not leave it to <hi>David</hi> himself, though both a King and a Prophet, and a man after Gods own heart, to set up what worship he pleased in the Temple, but God gave him an exact patterne of all, and that not onely by his Spirit, but in writing, that he might neither adde nor omit in the least tittle, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. And you know it was never left to the Kings of Judah, to do the least thing in point of Reformation, but onely to see, that the Priests do all strictly, (not any thing as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to them, but all) according to the precise rule of the Law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. Now was the great Law-giver so strict under the old Testament, and is he grown more remisse under the New? In <hi>Ezekiels</hi> vision of the Temple, or Church in the time of the Gospel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 10, 11. wee reade of a patterne, form, fashion of everie particular thing of the House of God, which is his Church, exactly set down, and measured by Gods own speciall direction. Or are men more wise and more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now then <hi>David</hi> was, that Christ should trust every Nation with such a liberty as this, to alter and diversifie <hi>Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Discipline,</hi> so as might be most <hi>agreeable</hi> to this or that <hi>Kingdoms, Common-weales, Countreys custome, commodity, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie?</hi> And as for your <hi>Nationall Church</hi> here mentioned, we shall take a just measure of it when we come to your ninth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>And whereas you quote in the Margine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. &amp; 11. 34. on which you ground your liberty to form your Church-government &amp; Discipline sutably to each particular Civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Alas, brother, these very Scriptures our Prelates abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to maintain their unlimited liberty of setting up their rites and ceremonies, as sutable to the Civil government; which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity

I have fully refelled in my <hi>Reply to Canterburies Relation.</hi> Whereas the Apostle there exhorteth, <hi>that all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order,</hi> according to those rules they had received of him: to which agreeth the other place alledged by you, <hi>Other things will I set in order when I come,</hi> as Titus 1. 5. He left <hi>Titus in Crete, that he might set in order the things that remained;</hi> but all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostles direction for <hi>Church-government,</hi> and choice of <hi>Officers.</hi> And we should have a mad world of it, if civill States in severall Countreys should have liberty to frame Church-government and Discipline, as should most sute with their particular conditions. This liberty is that which both Ecclesiasticall and Civill States usurping, turned the spirituall Kingdom of Christ over Consciences and Churches, into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and secular Kingdom, or rather indeed an Anti-christian Tyranny, or Hierarchy, so as by this means it came to passe, that the <hi>second Beast ascending out of the earth,</hi> to wit, the Pope, (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 13. 11.) commands the <hi>inhabitants of the earth to make an image,</hi> that is, to set up a forme of Religion and <hi>Church-government,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>Image of the first Beast,</hi> to wit, the Imperiall State of Rome. And thus came to be erected the <hi>Hierarchicall Church-government,</hi> in all pomp and points sutable with the Romane Monarchy. So dangerous is that libertie which brings such bondage.

               <p>I answer: That is, <hi>Whether the Kingdome and Nation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> The summe is, you would here make way for a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call State Church-government, or a mixt Church-government,

Truly, brother, your very question is hereticall, you must pardon the expression, which otherwise would not come home to the full truth. And your word <hi>Elect,</hi> imports no lesse. For <hi>Elect</hi> taken in that sense, as you here apply it, to set up a form of <hi>Religion, of Church-government, and Discipline, with Rites and ceremonies sutable to the Laws and customes of a State, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people:</hi> and, <hi>AS MEN CONCEIVE,</hi> is of the same signification with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifieth a taking up an heresie upon humane <hi>election;</hi> or, as you say, <hi>As they conceive.</hi> For you say not, <hi>Such a Church-government, &amp;c. as is most consonant to Gods word:</hi> but <hi>such as they conceive to be most consonant.</hi> So as you hang your <hi>Church-government</hi> upon mens <hi>conceit,</hi> or opinion of <hi>consonancy</hi> with <hi>Gods word,</hi> and not upon a reall and essentiall <hi>consonancy.</hi> Just like the Prelate of Canterbury, who in his <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> hangs the credit of the Scripture upon the Author, and <hi>the opinion we have</hi> (saith he) <hi>of his sufficiency.</hi> Which I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my Reply. But thus you open a wide sluce, to let in an ocean of inundation of all sorts of Religion into all parts of the vvorld, vvhen every Religion shall be measured by the line of mans conception, what men <hi>CONCEIVE agreeable to Gods word.</hi> Thus might <hi>Henry</hi> 4. the late French King (to make his way the easier to the Crown through so many difficulties) apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize from the Protestant Religion, and turn to Popery, as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> it <hi>sutable to the word of God,</hi> to comply with the State of France, and the manners of the people, for the establishing of his kingdome (as he <hi>conceived,</hi> though he was deceived) by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming himself a Popish King. And so <hi>Jeroboam</hi> with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell might <hi>CONCEIVE</hi> it agreeable enough <hi>to Gods word,</hi> to set up his <hi>Calves</hi> most <hi>sutable</hi> to the new <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>customes</hi> of that <hi>State,</hi> and to the <hi>manners of the people,</hi> who are apt enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace idolatry and superstition, as <hi>Ephraim willingly walked after the commandment, Hos.</hi> 5. 11. And so in the rest. Now that is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie which is an error <hi>conceived</hi> and maintained against the word of God. That the maintaining of such a liberty as you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume here, is so, we have in part shewed already from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53107:7"/>
whence you are not able to bring the least shadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to maintain it. Nay, we need go no further for the disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising of this your liberty, but your own words. Your words are <hi>asistata,</hi> they cannot cohere in any true Theologicall sense. For first, we ought not to assume, or pretend a liberty, as left us of God, when we want our evidence, and are not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Charter out of the Magna Charta, the Scripture. And this, brother, not you, nor any man can do. Again, nothing is more presumptuous; then to attempt to mingle heaven &amp; earth together, that is, to mingle Christs Kingdom with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, or to these to frame and fashion that, which what is it else, but to set up a Babylonish <hi>Church-government.</hi> Did the Apostles thus? Did they frame Christs Kingdom &amp; <hi>Church-government</hi> to the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>customes</hi> of the <hi>Romance Empire?</hi> Or did they vary their orders for Church-government &amp; Discipline, according <hi>to the different manners and customes of those Nations, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys or Provinces</hi> where they planted their Churches? Had they one order for the Church of Corinth, and another for the Churches of Galatia, and a third for the Churches of Asia and the rest? No: But *<hi>so ordain I in all Churches,</hi> saith the Apostle.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 17. 1 Cor. 16. 1.</note> And * <hi>concerning the collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</hi> So also for making of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and other Church-officers, Act. 1. &amp; 14. 23.</p>
               <p>Again, Your <hi>Church-government</hi> must be <hi>conceived</hi> to be <hi>conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods Word,</hi> yet with this restriction or limitation, that it be also <hi>consonant to the Laws and Government under which we live.</hi> You speak indeed like a pure Lawyer, &amp; one that will stand for your Profession, were this the way to uphold it. But cannot your Law, and our Gospel cotton together, unlesse the Gospel weare the Laws livery, like to your Serjeants gown, made up of two severall colours'; or unlesse Law and Gospel be woven together into a linsey woolsey garment? But what if your Law present, stand still in force for <hi>Church-government,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repealed? Must the <hi>Gospel</hi> be brought again under your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall <hi>Church-government?</hi> Or rather why should not a <hi>generall law</hi> (to use your words) be enacted, to inhibite all formes of <hi>Church-government and Discipline,</hi> which are not every way <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to Gods Word,</hi> without this addition, <hi>And to the Laws and Government under which we live?</hi> For certainely, if the <hi>Lawes and</hi>

                  <hi>Government of the State under which we live,</hi> be good and just, there is no need why you should put upon Christs kingly <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in his Church, such hard conditions, as not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but so farre as it is consonant to mans Laws. As <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> said, when upon the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> his motion to the Romane Senate, that Christ might be admitted and enrowled among <hi>Romes</hi> gods, and the Senate refused, because they had made a Law, that none should be chosen for a god, unlesse first propounded by the Senate: <hi>Ergo nisi homini placuerit, Deus non erit Deus; Therefore if it please not man, God shall not be God.</hi> So let it be lawfull for me to say; <hi>If it please not man, not the Senate, Christ shall not be King, his kingdome shall have no place in this or that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> As if the good Laws of a civill State, and the good Laws of Christs kingdome, could not, ought not to stand together in their distinct forms unmixed; when certainly a State stands strongest, while most consonant to Gods Word, and to the <hi>Church-government and Discipline</hi> of Christ, and not when Christs kingdome and Government is made <hi>sutable to the Laws and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the State.</hi>

the great difference between that, and after-times, wherein the Mystery of Iniquity grew up to its height, in assuming such an unlimited liberty to set up such a Church-Government, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of humane invention, as were haled in by the head and shoulders. But brother <hi>Prinne,</hi> you see here, how in those purer primitive times, even the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> himselfe was so farre from admitting a Church-Government sutable to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall lawes and customes of every Nation, (as you would have it) as he tels King <hi>Lucius,</hi> he hath both the Testaments, by the rule whereof he should not onely see the Church to be governed, but his own Realme also. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Kingly government of Christ in his Church is not to be fashioned and moulded according to the lawes and customes of temporall and civill States, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily the lawes of Civill States are to be reduced to the rule of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>But you adde also, <hi>And manners of their people:</hi> that is, in their severall Countries, and Common-weales.

For if you aske the Prelaticall party, consisting of multitudes of their Priests, and of their ignorant and prophane people, together with all the Kings Army, they will all with one voyce and vote, roare it out at the Canons mouth, W will have the Bishops Church-government and Discipline continued without alteration.

The first Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> consisting of 318. Bishops, how did they all agree to bring in a Doctrine of Devills, prohibiting Priests marriage, had not one Confessor, <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> by evidence of Scripture, and reason, cryed it downe, and so swayed the whole Councell? And you know very well, that Generall Councels, as well as Nationall, have not infallibilitie of judgement in all things. And it cannot be unknowne to you, that even this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Divines are of different judgements about Church-governement and Discipline; nor have they perhaps had so much time since their being under the Prelacy, as to be throughly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the way of Churches, commonly called <hi>Independent,</hi> but that many of them may possibly gaine much more knowledge of it, by spending some more time and study in it.</p>
               <p>But Sir, besides all this, you seeme to lead them such a way, (should they follow you) as would necessarily bring them into an inevitable and inextricable errour, in case they should <hi>elect</hi> such a <hi>publick Church-government, Rites, Discipline, as they conceive to be most consonant to Gods Word, to the Lawes, Government under which we live, and manner of the people.</hi> For if they looke upon the manner of the people, which they must needs finde to bee for the most part very loose (to speake nothing of Ignorants and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Malignants) some men might <hi>conceive,</hi> that such a <hi>Church-government and Discipline</hi> were most <hi>sutable,</hi> as doth most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, and give some indulgence to such manners, as cannot easily be brought to enter in at the <hi>straite gate,</hi> and <hi>narrow way,</hi> that <hi>leads</hi> into Christs kingdome.

                  <hi>the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth; let them returne unto thee, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not thou unto them.</hi> Whereupon the most learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as the learned <hi>Beza</hi> constantly styles him) <hi>Calvin,</hi> among many other excellent observations on this place, thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; <hi>Summa est, veritatem Dei non debere flecti ad hominum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium, quae Deus non mutatur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ita nec verbum ejus ullam varieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem admittit:</hi> The summe is; That the truth of God ought not to bee bended according to mans will or conceit, because God is not mutable, so neither doth his Word admit of any change. Now the forme of Church-governement and Discipline laid downe in the New Testament, is a Doctrine of Christ, and no more alterable according to the varieties of mens customes and manners in all nations and ages, then the Gospel it selfe is; which the Apostle would not have to bee altered into another Gospel; though another Gospel cannot bee; as neither another kingdome of Christ, another Church-governement, another Church-discipline ought not to be, but that alone which we find in Gods Word, which must not bee reduced or conformed (as a nose of waxe, to which the Papists, as <hi>Hosius,</hi> and <hi>Pighius</hi> doe compare the Scripture) to the fashions of worldly governments, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.) and popular <hi>manners,</hi> but these must be conformed to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Hence it may appeare, how rough your conclusion of this Question is, if to such a generall law, as you propose, all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, members of this Kingdome and Nation, should not yeeld to be actually obliged in point of <hi>conscience, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, and readily to submit thereunto, and no waies to seeke an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from it, under paine of being guiltie of arrogancy, schisme, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Good Brother let's not have any of <hi>Dracoes</hi> Lawes executed upon Innocents. And remember how not long agoe the Prelates served us; we could not have the benefit of Law, of Appeale, no exemption from bloud letting, and eare-cropping, and pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, &amp;c. And shall wee now turne worse persecutors of the Saints, then the Prelates were? <hi>Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco,</hi> saith that heathen Princesse.</p>
               <p>But in the margent you put some places of Scripture to prove this. But truly, when I well view the places, I find them not to answer to what you would seeme to prove by the Quotation. The first is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32, 33. <hi>For the Spirit of the Prophets is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Prophets.</hi> And what of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of all the <hi>Prophets</hi> in <hi>England</hi> must be <hi>subiect to the Prophets in the Assembly upon paine of being guiltie of Arrogancy, Schisme, Contumacy, and liable to such penalties, as are due to these offences.</hi> O brother <hi>Prynne,</hi> you must as well note, as quote the place. But let me note it for you. The Apostle there speaks both to, and of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when assembled together in one place: that the Prophets should observe order, and give place each to other in Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as the reason is rendered, and not of any such Assembly of that sublime and supreame Authoritie, or the onely Prophets, to whom all other Prophets wheresoever dispersed must be subject. <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. <hi>For God is not the Author of confusion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi> Which place also is no lesse wide from your purpose. What? Will there be no peace, but all confusion, unlesse all be subject to the Assembly upon such paine, as before? The Apostle speaks here of the Order to be observed in every Church, as in all the Churches of the Saints. The other places quoted by you, are no lesse misapplyed. Will they prove, trow you, blind obedience?</p>
               <p>But come on brother, (if you will needs put us upon such hard exigents, as to give us no quarter, without present lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down our Armes and cause, and so captivating our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to the Dictates and Decrees of men; If you will make

And the first and main is this: First, brother, make it cleare unto us, that an Assembly of men <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, pious,</hi> what you will, living in ages succeeding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, have, or ever had, infallibility of judgement, so as to say, (as Acts 15. 28.) <hi>It pleased the holy Ghost and Us,</hi> to make these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, that so wee may without further scruple of conscience, submit and conforme thereunto. But (I say) you must give us very good assurance and evidence hereof, that they are infallibly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy Ghost, that when they shall say, <hi>It pleased the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost and Us,</hi> we may safely believe them. For when you can resolve us of their conclusions no further, then as they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to bee consonant to the word of God:</hi> Alas! Sir, you leave us in a Wood, or Maze, whence no extricating of our selves, without <hi>Ariadnes</hi> thread, Gods word, to set us where wee were before. For you knew what variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits many men have, <hi>Quot capita, tot sententiae.</hi> This is the first and main condition we stand upon; and truly it were sufficient alone. We might in a second rank (but not equall to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) name a selfe-deniall, and humble spirit, &amp;c. You know the story of the Monkes of Bangor comming before <hi>Austin</hi> the first Archbishop of Canterbury, whom they seeing to fit in his Pontificall Chaire, and not rising up, nor moving unto them, they left him as a man no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For neither of these can you find ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the New Testamens, or in the Old. In the old we read of one Church, to wit, that of the Nation of the Jewes: But that whole Church was one intire congregation, Act. 7. 38. they had one Church officer over all, it is called the Tabernacle of the congregation in the singuler; and they all assembled three times in the yeare at Jerusalem, in the Temple, where they offered Sacrifice, and not else where: So as the Church was a type of every particular Church of Christ under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, as being both one intire Church and absolute, subject to no other form of government, but only that of the only Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and Mediator Jesus Christ; and no pattern of any such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church as you would have. Every particular Church now, consisting of visible Saints, is under Christ, as the onely <hi>Head, King, Governour, Law-giver</hi> of it, and so is subject to no other jurisdiction then that of Christ, his Spirit, his Word. Were there none other particular Church in the world, then one, as that of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, should it not be a compleat Church, untill there were other Churches on whose jurisdiction it should depend; though for ordinary Families, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have such a number as is requisite to make up a ministeriall body, &amp; so are bound to unite to others for this end. Wee hold communion and consociation of Churches for counsell in doubts, and comfort in distresse: but we deny any such combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches as whereby the true liberty of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is taken away, And this communion of Churches doth no lesse (if not more) prevent <hi>Heresies, Schismes, Injustice,</hi> then your Presbyteriall.

                  </gap>, in the beginning of Protestant Reformation, could they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so clearly see in the dawning, as wee may now in the meridian, if we will but open our eyes? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches have taken up one or other of them upon the matter the maine things we contend for: 1. The Church of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land receive none to the Table, nor have a vote as a member of that Church; but such as first give satisfaction to the Elderships
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53107:13"/>
and then to the Congregation: and 2. have a forme of covenant propounded by them. Secondly, the French Churches exercise excommunication in their particular congregations, though with liberty of appeale. And this was the governement of the Primitive Churches in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> hundreth yeare, as appeares, <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>Tit. de Synodis:</hi> but especially. <hi>Tit. de consociatione Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> So as no long debate neede to be, if but Christs word alone may take place, without the necessary accommodation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Lawes, Customes, Manners of the people,</hi> as you doe plead.</p>
               <p>And lastly for appeales in case of <hi>Injustice,</hi> you know, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if injustice be done in any civill matter, if redresse may not be had by the mediation of the Church, whereof the parties are members, then the Law is open there to appeale for justice. And if it be about the Churches censure for some miscarriage of a member towards the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any member thereof, if the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure bee unjust, the party grieved may desire to have his cause heard by some other Churches, who may accordingly deale with their Sister-church to require a brotherly account of the whole businesse, as is the duty of all the Churches in such cases. And if it be in matter of opinion, here the appeale lies principally and in the first place, to the Scripture, as the supreme Judge; and if the things be obscure, &amp; too hard for that Church to resolve by the Scripture, then to call in the helpe of other Churches for their best information. And in summe, brother, there is no case can fall out in any Church, which hath not as many helpes by a free communion of Churches, wherein every Churches peculiar liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and priviledges are preserved as they ought to be: as any you can name to bee in your obligatory combination of Churches, wherby the liberty of each Church is by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent sold over to others, by which it ceaseth now to be a free Church of Christ, under his onely jurisdiction and government. So as herby great mischiefes may redound even to the purest Church, when once things come to be carried by the vote of a generall or Classicall Assembly of Divines, swaying things besides the Rule, and stretching them beyond their line. And therefore famous was that saying of <hi>Nazianzens,</hi>

of the present times, and State: as suppose Prelaticall Spirits should turne to be your Presbyterians, or as when (in case the Lord Christ shall resume his Kingdome over his Churches in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill State) we should perhaps see some of your Presbyterians as fast to turn Independants, were the preferments sutable.</p>
               <p>But some may object, that one Church standing by it selfe, is<note place="margin">Obj.</note> more subject to fall into errour, then when combined with other Churches.</p>
               <p>To which I answer; That every particular Church injoying<note place="margin">Answ.</note> its own freedome, without any injoyned combination with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, may much longer preserve it selfe from danger of errour, when it hath its free choise in matters of difference or difficulty, to consult onely with those Churches, which it knows to be most sound and orthodox, then when it is fast bound, and incircled with this or that combination of Churches, being in number twelve or twenty, or more or lesse, whose votes must carry every controversie, according to the severall humours of such and such, at all adventure. And (brother <hi>Prynne</hi>) the world is not so plentifull of sound spirits, as to supply every Hundred in the Land with twelve or twenty able and godly Ministers to be of a combination. Nay, you may observe what poore shifts are used for the supplying of places with godly and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which are grown so geason, that the City now is faine to be supplyed with plundered countrey Ministers, in stead of their out-cast Malignants: And suppose all these to be as good as they should be, where shall those country-places be supplyed? And besides, such is the penury of good Ministers (if not of care to provide better, if possible) that such as are for their demerits cast out of one place, are (for I wot not what merits) put upon some other people, where their good qualities are not knowne. Being such as verifie the Proverb, <gap reason="foreign">

If you say, if things goe amisse

For, <hi>totius &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium eadem est ratio;</hi> if all the members be corrupt, so also must the whole body be.

And again, the case between our Reformation at this time, and that of the Jewes church, is much alike: For as th a was the Gospell-Reformation, so is this; as that was a gathering of such churches out of that of the Jewes, as acknowledged Christ to be their onely King and Law-giver, to govern consciences and churches by his Word, when the rest of that church, even the main body of it, did reject Christ, and renounce him for their King, this being the very Title set over him on his crosse, for which they crucified him: So the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Christs Kingdome in these dayes, is that which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and gathereth those unto Christ, who acknowledge him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for their King to govern them; and this out of those, that doe not, or will not submit unto his Kingly government, but depend upon the sole determination of men, what kinde of church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement they will set up in the Land, which you tell us must be <hi>sutable to the lawes and customes of the Realme, and manners of the people.</hi>

               <p>But there is yet one thing more, for which you say, you can see no ground, and that is particular <hi>church-government.</hi> Why, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why should the lawfulnesse of this be doubted, whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit or implicit? It is the churches wisedome and care, yea, conscience and duty too, as we humbly conceive to admit of none but such as can give some account of the worke of grace wrought in them, though but in the least degree, yet in truth, so far as we may discern them to be Saints: for such onely are fit members of a church, or body of Christ, so as to partake of those holy Ordinances of Christ, which none but visible Saints ought to partake of. And who are fit to receive the Seales of the covenant, but such as professe to be in covenant? And surely if any shall refuse to make this profession of their being in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as being ashamed thereof, with what conscience can the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53107:17"/>
Church admit them into fellowship? And you know this is a time of Reformation, and we have long been under a yoke of Antichristian-government, and of humane ordinances in the worship of God; wherein we have all violated our vow and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in our names in our Baptisme: Now, doth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son require, that we should renew our covenant in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, when we come to enter into the way of Reformation, and that in as full a manner as possibly we can? And when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Ierem. 50. 5.</note> of God came out of Babylon to inhabit Ierusalem again, they made a covenant among themselves, when seeking the <hi>way with their faces thitherward, they say, Come and let us joyn ourselves to the Lord in a perpetuall covenant that shall not bee forgotten.</hi> The case is ours in a great measure, who are now inquiring <hi>the war to Sion, with our faces thitherward;</hi> and shall we be abashed to come to Sion from all the reliques of Babylon, and not incite one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they did, to enter into a perpetuall covenant with the Lord Christ, as our onely King not to be forgotten? And the like wee read <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 5. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 38. so did King <hi>Asa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 12. Now if any require an example hereof in the New Testament, I answer, what needs it, when wee have it in the Old? What example have we in the New Testament for baptizing of Infants? Yet having a * commandement in the Old<note place="margin">Gen 17 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> for circumcising the Infants of beleeving <hi>Abraham,</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the same covenant with faithfull <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had unto circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision (in stead whereof baptisme by Gods institution succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and this by a strict charge and command from God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13, 14.) which is as strong now for baptizing of Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents, as it was to the infants of beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> for circumcision. Again, what example, yea or precept is there of giving women the Lords Supper in the New Testament? yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good consequence it is drawn from thence. But this by the way. And to conclude this point, what reason can any man bring against this particular Church-covenant? And if any doe

disrelish it, they are onely such as take a disgust of the way itselfe, and then no marvell if every thing about it be quarrelled and questioned, though no other reason can be given of it, but a <hi>Nolumus:</hi> such as the Jewes gave when they said of Christ, <hi>Nolumus:</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Now for answer to this large Argument, brieflly: And first, to the Proposition. I deny that you can bring any infallible proofes, or one proof, that there either are, or ever have been any Nationall Churches by any other institution, but meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; nor any one of divine institution, but onely that of the Jewes in the old Testament, and now wholly dissolved; of which we have spoken sufficiently before: And which also was not onely Nationall, but in a manner Oecumenick and universall, as appeares Acts 2. and such therefore as I hope you contend not for now; for then there would be a Pope, as there was an high Priest then &amp;c. And brother, you must give us leave to stand upon this, as for our lives, that we dare not admit of any Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as the true and genuine Churches of Christ, which are not of his owne institution, that is, such as are not called and gathered by the voyce of Christ in his word, and by that Scepter of his swayed, and by that alone Law of his governed. And therefore be intreated, good brother, not to presse upon us such your Churches, whose not onely institution in their severall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, but government also in their combinations, is meerly humane, and therefore as a house founded on a sand, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a storme cannot stand You must first be able to found your Nationall Church in the Scripture, or assure yourselfe, if a man will build upon it a common Presbyteriall Classicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dwell there, he will bring an old house upon his head, when God shall begin to storm it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53107:18"/>But to come to your perticular instances in the Assumption, for the proofe of your Nationall Church. The first is, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church throughout the world. What is this to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church? Though the Catholick include all the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the world, yer doth it not therefore conclude any Church to be Nationall.</p>
               <p>The second instance is, the Nationall Church of the Jewes, and from hence you can conclude as little for your Nationall Churches; as before we have shewed. For bring us any one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, that is one intire Church, or congregation, as that of the Jewes was: or, that is of one family, as that was: or, that is a type of Christs spirituall Kingdome, as that was: or, that is the universall Church of God visible on earth, as that was: or, that is governed by the like lawes, that that was: when your selfe doe confesse, that the government of your Nationall Churches is to be regulated by <hi>humane Lawes, Customes, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and not by Gods word alone; whereas that of the Jewes was wholly governed by Gods own Law, and not at all by the Lawes of men, untill it came to be corrupted, contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Law of God. And you confesse also, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Nationall Churches is alterable, according to the <hi>Lawes, Customes, Manners of severall Nations:</hi> whereas the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of the Iewes was unalterable, till Christ himselfe did put a period to that Oeconomy.

               </p>
               <p>Your third instance is the <hi>Synodall Assembly of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Elders, and Brethren at Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 15. who made and sent <hi>Binding Decrees,</hi> to the Churches. And what of this, brother? Therefore Nationall Churches, or generall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53107:19"/>
Councels, or Provinciall, have the like power to make and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose binding Decrees, and send them to the Churches? Why, first of all, that Assembly was not any Nationall Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative. Secondly, neither was it a Generall or Provinciall Councell. Thirdly, being an Assembly of the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Elders and Brethren, it could not erre: for the Apostles had infallibility of judgement, being guided by the holy Ghost infallibly, and the Elders and Brethren did assent to their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. And was there ever such a Synodicall Assembly since that? Had euer any Councell besides that, infallibility of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Shew it, brother, and then wee will beleeve they may make <hi>Binding Decrees,</hi> and wee will submit unto them. Nay, dare any Assembly of men on earth, say, <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost, and Us?</hi> That's enough for the black mouth of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Roman lying Oracle. But in your second thoughts, you traverse this <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> place more largely, which wee shall consider when we come to it. In the mean time, what I have here and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, may suffice to stay the Readers stomace.</p>
               <p>But you adde, All this is seconded with all <hi>Occumenicall, Nationall, Provinciall Councels, Synods, and the Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment throughout the world in all Christian Realmes, States,</hi> &amp;c. Alas, brother, all these put together, are in no sort sutable to make a second to that Apostolicall Assembly; they cannot hold the least proportion with it, to make a second to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sampled sample, though they make never so great a summe.</p>
               <p>And whereas you make the up-shot of this your question, <hi>to the apparent sub version of Novell Independent Invention,</hi> (these be your words) we have proved it to be neither mans <hi>Invention,</hi> but Gods own institution, nor <hi>Novell,</hi> as having its foundation in the New Testament; nor yet <hi>Independent,</hi> otherwise then that it depends not upon any humane authority, or jurisdiction out of it self; not upon any such conformity to humane <hi>lawes,</hi> or <hi>customes,</hi> or <hi>manners</hi> of every Nation or people, as you speake of. Neither doe you take away our Argument from the most usuall phrase of the Apostles calling the Churches in the plurall, by saying, <hi>Historians often speake of the Churches in England:</hi> for they doe not so speak when they mean the congregations, but the material Temples: but speake of England as one Church when they

And thirdly, because they are not able to shew this, they must use their liberty no further, then the lists and limits of Scripture doe permit, which holds forth an exact and perfect rule, for all precisely to observe, without the least variation. As knowing that severe law of God, often used in Scripture, and wherewith, as with a bounder-stone, the whole Book of God is closed up, and that with a solemne protestation of Christ himselfe: <hi>If any man shall adde unto these things, God</hi>

               <p>But some will haply object; This is meant, not in point of <hi>Church-government, Discipline, Rites, Ceremonies, as left to mans liberty to ordaine, adde, supply, institute, according to the diversity of the lawes and customes of every Nation;</hi> but in matter of Doctrine, Story, and Prophecy. To which I answer (though sufficiently noted before, and now in one word) if God were so exact about the forme of the Tabernacle, (a type of Christs Church under the Gospell) to have all things observed according to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, even unto the least pin; what reason can any reasonable man give, why Christ, the same Law-giver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and patterne it selfe, should be lesse carefull over his Church in the New Testament, so as to leave it at six and seven, to the liberty of all <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>Nations of the world,</hi> to set up in the Church what <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Discipline, Rites, Ceremonies, Canons,</hi> they pleased, upon what pretence soever as for the <hi>Churches peace and welfare?</hi> Hath not the opening of this one sluce, let in such an Inundation of all manner of humane inventions in this kind, as hath wel-nigh drowned the whole world in all manner of superstition and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?

Would you admit of a member into your family who is disaffected with your courses, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the family? What cause then hath he to complain, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowledge thereof you refuse to entertain him? If therefore every family should be carefull to provide for its own peace, by having all in it of like affection and judgement, (if possible) why not Christs owne house and family? And, brother, the truth is, (for we love no <hi>disguising,</hi> as to need any <hi>unmasking</hi>) wee love not in a time of reformation, after a generall tincture of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will-worship, blindly to goe to work, to admit of all commers, and to cast Christs <hi>Pearles</hi> and <hi>holy things</hi> to such as we know not. Or if we b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if not, how can the Church receive them? Nor indeed doe any such offer themselves; nor doth the Church impose any such conditions, as a godly Christian hath cause not to accept. We desire to doe those things that please God, namely, such as he commends and commands. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. Christ commends the <hi>Angell of the Church of Ephesus, for not hearing with those that are wicked, and for trying those that sayd they were Apostles, and were not, but were found ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what interest hath any to Church Communion, that is not a member, or to the seal, that is not in Covenant? And we love not to do that, for which to repent afterwards. We desire all our members may be such as they may peaceably and sweetly continue with us. We are loath to have the world offended by the unworthy walking of any one member. And we desire by our best providence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, that none once admitted, should ever be cast out again. And brother, all this we hold to be our duty, for the preferring of the honour of Christ, and of his Ordinances, and of his

Which as they are fewer, so I shall be the shorter, for as much as in the former, I have been the larger. But brother, I find not that in your Book, which you pretend in your Title, to wit, the <hi>Unmasking of Independency.</hi> Nor can we expect it of you: for in your Proeme you say, that <hi>the Independents have not dogmatically, and in direct termes, discovered the full truth of what they assert.</hi> If not, what kind of visage will you discover, when you have taken off the mask? Surely, by <hi>your</hi> handling of the matter, you mean to unmask some hags face, such as pleased the Painter.

But when it is exactly done, you will find no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed parts at all in it: but contrariwise a greater beauty then in that famous Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> built, as being the spirituall Temple of Jesus Christ; so as I am sorry you are put to the paines of <hi>pumping out our determinations</hi> (as you say) <hi>by your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions:</hi>

And therefore, brother, you are wondred at, that being a man of much reading, and mightie parts, you should utter such strange things (<hi>ne quid dicam durius</hi>) as these are, and that so confidently, when you neither doe, nor ever can bring the least proofe, yea or colour of what you affirm.

               <p>Touching this: 1.

               <p>2. Such as are thus called, to acknowledge Christ their onely King, were not begotten <hi>to this acknowledgment</hi> by such Ministers as you speak of, who deny, disclaime, and preach against Christs Kingly government over mens consciences and Churches. So as such a conversion as you speak of, comes not home to whole Christ: and such, with their converters, doe deny Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly government; what kind of converts call you these? Or at least and best they are converted but in part; and that main thing wanting, to wit, Christs Kingly office, they come up to by the preaching thereof.</p>
               <p>3. Such Ministers, when they set up Christs government, may (being agreed upon by all sides) have those Parishioners again, that for want of it at the first went from them.</p>

These Senater-like Declamations though they be very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and incense the mindes of many against us, yet they may be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by most true and substantiall arguments.</hi> As, <hi>All the Prophets and Apostles were true lovers of the peace and concord of Nations and people: yet were they constrained by the commandement of God, to warre against the Devils kingdome, to preach heavenly doctrine, to collect a Church unto God,</hi> and the like. And, <hi>The true doctrine of God, and his true worship, must needs be embraced and received; and all errors, that tend to the dishonor of God, must be abhorred and forsaken, though all the world should break and fall down.</hi> And much more there.</p>
               <p>6.

               <p>7.

And for difference of mens judgements in points of Religion, how can it be avoided? And yet it followes not, that upon such differences should come ruine to a State. What serveth the Magistrate, and the lawes of a civill State for, but to keep the peace? And as for Parishes, will you allow no Churches but Parishes? Or are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes originally any other but of humane, politicke, and civill constitution, and for civill ends? Or can you say, that so many as inhabit in every Parish respectively, shall bee a Church? Should such Churches and Parishes then necessarily be Churches of Gods calling and gathering? Are they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of mans collection, constitution and coaction meerly?

               <head>The fourth Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This is much like the next before. For that was about <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters power to gather Churches:</hi> this, <hi>concerning the peoples power in uniting themselves in a Church, choosing their Minister, erecting such a Government, as they conceive most sutable to the Scripture. And so all manner of hereticks may set up Churches, and all manner of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, sects, be brought in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, as before. A Church is a Citie of God, which by her Charter becomes a Citie, being called of God, and by the same Charter (the Scripture) chuseth her own Officers: and sets up no other government, but what her Charter prescribes. If any other doe otherwise, and doe pervert the Scripture, it is not to be imputed to the Church of Christ. Her liberties are no law for others licentiousnesse. It was so in the Apostles times, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53107:32"/>
next ages after. The true Churches liberties were no true cause of so many heresies; no more then the Christians of old were the cause of the calamities of the Citie or Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Nero</hi> and other Tyrants falsly charged them, and as injuriously dealt with them. Nor may we cast away the priviledges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, because others abuse them. Yea, whether we use our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, or no, errours and heresies will be. The Apostles, and Apostolick Churches, could neither keep, nor cast them out; as is shewed before.</p>
               <p>But brother, where you say, that <hi>if this liberty of setting up an Independent Church-government be admitted: then by the selfe-same reason, they must have a like libertie to elect, erect what Civil forme of government they please: to set up a new Independent Republick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c. By the selfe-same reason?</hi> Surely by no <hi>reason</hi> at all. Shew us a <hi>reason</hi> hereof, and take all. And you know, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, Kingdomes</hi> are <hi>Independent,</hi> though not of Churches <hi>electing, erecting.</hi> It is unsatisfiable injury, and extreame irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality thus to argue; for hath Christ given the same command to his people, as such who are not of this world, nor their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he hath done to them in spirituals which he commands them to practise whosoever forbids? 2. They set up no forme, but take that which is prescribed, which God hath not done in civill government, but left it free, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The fifth Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>Herein you make a comparison between <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> and <hi>Independent Churches;</hi> Why not that, as well as this? And if this, why doe we not shew solid proofe of it? I answer: We desire to enjoy ours, without making comparison with yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For proofe we have shewed sufficient.</p>
               <p>Then to a second <hi>Quere;</hi> the answer is, not the Minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor the Congregation alone, but both together admit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and set up Christs Government, not their own. And how ever you make us a Conventicle, consisting of inconsiderable ignorant members: I beleeve, brother <hi>Prynne,</hi> when you shall have any thing to doe with the most contemptible of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, as you esteeme us, you will not altogether find us
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53107:33"/>
such, as you are pleased to terme us. And for <hi>Nationall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, States,</hi> wee honour them with whatsoever honour is due unto them, as Gods <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> Word commandeth us. And for a <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Councell,</hi> as this is, called to advise, not to be peremptory Judges in the matters of God over our consciences, wee detract not their due honour too, as they are pious, and learned men. 2. Where you would have them have the same power in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Synod, that they have in a Church, if they be members, it is answered, that all power is restrained to its own sphere and place, so that we may have a greater power in another kind, and yet not that; as no Parliament man hath the power of a Master of a family in the Parliament, though he have a greater.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The sixth Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Interrogatory</hi> hath sundry branches: the answer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto respectively, will intimate what they be.</p>
               <p>1. Wee say, as before, None of our Ministers doe by any <hi>usurped authoritie gather Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We cannot conceive, that any law of the Land is against the setting up of <hi>Christs kingdome</hi> in the hearts of his people; and in those Congregations called and gathered by the voyce of his Word. Nor doth the Ministery of Christs word more in this, then it did by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Christ himselfe, and his Apostles, when they called Christian Congregations out of the <hi>Jewes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church.</hi> Even the Imperiall heathen Roman Lawes gave way to the preaching of Christs kingdome, and gathering of Churches within their Territories, Provinces, Cities.</p>
               <p>3. For <hi>Church-government, Covenant,</hi> wee have said enough before.</p>
               <p>4. Concerning a <hi>Nationall Church</hi> also, we have spoke already in the former Answer. And I desire brevitie, and not to answer all your repetitions and aggravations, lest I may <hi>nauseam movere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. It is one thing for a State to set up a new forme of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Government, and another to pull downe the old. This they were bound unto by the Word of God: but not so that, unlesse it be the same Church-government which Christ sets downe in his Word; besides which none other ought to be set
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53107:33"/>
up, though never so much pretended, and by men <hi>conceived</hi> to be <hi>according to Gods Word,</hi> when made <hi>sutable to the Lawes, Customes of every Nation, and manners of the people,</hi> as you affirme; of which before.</p>
               <p>Lastly, This <hi>Church-government,</hi> which we professe, you shall never be able to prove <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> as you conclude your <hi>Interrogatory.</hi>

               <head>The seventh Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Interrogatory</hi> is about the <hi>dismissing of members:</hi> 1. to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>members of Presbyteriall Churches:</hi> 2.

Yet it is the Churches care and duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it selfe, and all the members in unity of the body; and also from whatsoever may be sinfull. If any shall repent, and fall back, Churches are not more free, then <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 66.</note> Christ himselfe was. If any for conveniency sake, or necessary occasion, desire to joyne with some other Church, doe you think it unreasonable, first to acquaint the Church with their desire? And doe you not allow of Letters of recommendation, when any is to passe to other Churches? May not els jealousies and suspicions arise, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings between Churches? Do you not remember, what divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and emulations the want hereof did cause among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of old? And, brother, we desire to doe all things in love. And we desire <hi>that others should doe no otherwise unto us, then we doe unto them:</hi> as you object. You twit us againe, for <hi>respecting the rich, more then the poore.</hi> If it be true, it is <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 22.</note> our fault, and ought not so to be: if not true, it is yours, and that so often as (as you doe) you cast it in our dish.</p>

               <head>The eight Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This Interrogatory is to charge us, <hi>for not admitting to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme any Infants of such Parents, who are not members of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> And, brother, you make this a most hainous and intolerable thing. Why, you know, if we would admit of all, it would be no small benefit and advantage to us, especially when we are to deale with <hi>rich</hi> mens children, such as you say we have in such <hi>high estimation.</hi> Therefore that we doe it not for rich men, you may thinke there is something in it, that covetousnesse is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so predominant in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to corrupt our <hi>Conscience.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53107:34"/>
brother, let some charitable thought take place in you, that we doe it rather of <hi>Conscience,</hi> then of <hi>Covetousnesse.</hi> And what say you to this, brother? We preach Christ to the Parents. We preach him no lesse a King, then a Priest and Prophet. We preach him the onely King of our Conscience, and the onely Law-giver and Governour of his Churches. We exhort them to set up this King in their hearts. Wee exhort them to become and professe to be those Saints, of whom he is King. For <hi>he is</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>King of Saints.</hi> But, brother, they will not beleeve us; they will not depend upon Christ, as the onely Lawgiver, and King over their consciences. Now, what would you have us to doe in this case? Baptize the Infants of such Parents, as will not, in this respect, professe, nor confesse Christ to be their King? Why, doe you not know, that no Infants have any title to Baptisme, that are not within the Covenant visibly? And how are they within the Covenant visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but by vertue of their Parents faith outwardly professed? And what outward profession of faith in the Parents, that refuse Christ for their onely King? that are ashamed, or afraid, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be in covenant with Christ, as their King? If therefore the Parents professe not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea refuse thus to be in visible, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, can the children be said to be in visible Covenant, and so to have a right to Baptisme, the externall seale of the Covenant? Brother, here is <hi>obex,</hi> a barre put.</p>
               <p>If you say, <hi>The child shall not beare the iniquitie of the father.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note>
               <p>True; but the Parents keep themselves off from the covenant<note place="margin">Ans.</note> by refusing Christ, in whom alone the beleever hath right to the Covenant; and so the child is withall kept off. For it is not now under the Gospel, as it was from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Christ, The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, so as by vertue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the male Infants of beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> were and ought to be circumcised. But now under the Gospel, those onely are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, who professe the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which faith looked upon Christ, and embraceth whole Christ in all his offices, and professe the same outwardly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. So as the Covenant is entayled onely to beleevers now, and so to their children (as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.) If then the Parents by refusing Christ as their King, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did (<hi>Luk</hi> 19. 14.) doe hereby out themselves off from the Covenant, they do therewith cut off
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53107:34"/>
their children too: and this not to be recovered in the child, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till either the Parent be restored, or the child coming in time to beleeve, and to professe the faith of Christ, doe hereby claime his right to the Covenant, and so to Baptisme, as being a <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11. 16</note> childe of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Let this suffice for the present, why we dare not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the children of those Parents, that refuse to professe the faith of Christ, as their onely King, as well as their onely Priest and Prophet. For Christ divided, becomes no Christ to the divider. This is, according to the vulgar Latin translation, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 3.) <hi>solvere Iesum,</hi> to dissolve Jesus, that is, to receive him only in part, and not in whole. Which is the spirit of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Besides, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling disobedience to any good order in a Church, deprives a man of the liberties of the Church: (for so he may not eat of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, that will not undergoe the yoake) Now this of a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profession to walk with the Saints of such a place, according to Christ, is a thing so just, as following the example of the old Church, who were in particular Covenant with God. 2. In the New, they professed their giving themselves to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. 3. All societies require some promise of their members. If it be said, we are members of the universall Church by faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: we reply, 1. this faith must be shewen by a voluntary giving our selves to Christ visibly, and then to some Church of his, if opportunitie serve; for Christ will not have his people to be wandring sheep, when they may have a fold; nor to be <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua vaga,</hi> when they may be reduced to order.</p>

               <head>The ninth Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Interrogatory</hi> lays a charge upon <hi>Independents,</hi> for <hi>refusing to admit to the Lords Supper such as are not notoriously scandalous, nor grossely ignorant, but professe repentance, &amp;c.</hi> which you say, <hi>is a very uncharitable, arrogant, yea unchristian practise, contrary to Christs own example in admitting Iudas to the Lords Supper;</hi> Also to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. you calling it also <hi>a transcendent straine of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall usurpation over soules and consciences, and Gods Ordinances, worse then our most domineering Lordly Prelates, &amp;c. yea Lording o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Christ himselfe, and more then ever the Apostles did, but onely by their extraordinary calling, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer in one word (omitting your copious aggravations, and sharp censures) that we look further, then to a generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53107:35"/>
and conversation, namely, to their faith in Christ, that it be sound intire, and whole, and namely, whether they hold him to be as the onely Prophet and High Priest, so the onely Prince of his People, the onely Lord, and Lawgiver to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and over every Congregation or Church of his Saints. If they thus acknowledge not Christs kingly office, as well as his other offices, we doe not, we dare not receive them.

                  </gap>e did: the Churches Censure had not yet past upon him: onely <hi>John</hi> by a secret signe knew he was to be the traytor. For that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. that was a true Church, though now disordered; and the Apostle refers the redressing of their abuses to themselves. The case is otherwise here, so as all your accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted calumniations fall to ground. And concerning the Apostles extraordinary calling, if we must expect the like calling, we must not in the meane time admit of any, either to Baptisme, or to the Lords Supper; neither should there be any gathering of Churches at all; as some from hence doe gather. Besides, what shall the authority be, that <hi>Luther</hi> gathered the Churches by, and those that followed him? and what lawfull gathering then have the Reformed Churches?</p>
               <p>For your marginall note of <hi>Moses, David, Solomon, about set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Religion by Gods own direction:</hi> herein you come home to that I said before, alledged against your unlimited law.

               <head>The eleventh Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Interrogatory</hi> is to perswadeus, that in that <hi>Assembly,</hi> or <hi>Evangelicall Synod</hi> (as you call it) Acts 15. <hi>the Apostles voted not as</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53107:36"/>
                  <hi>they were Apostles infallibly guided by the holy Ghost, but rather as they were in their ordinary capacitie, as Elders and chiefe members of it.</hi> Whereupon (producing your six reasons for it) you perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude, that <hi>this is an undeniable Scripture-authority for the lawfulnesse, use of Parliaments, Councels, Synods, under the Gospel, upon all like necessary occasions; and for their power to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Religion, to make Canons in things necessary for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace and concernment, maugre all evasions, exceptions (of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents) to elude it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us examine your <hi>six reasons,</hi> why the Apostles sate not as <hi>Apostles,</hi> but as <hi>ordinary Elders, &amp;c.</hi> Where first, we lay this ground for the contrary, <hi>scil.</hi> that they sate as Apostles, because not ordinary Elders, as Elders, can say, <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us.</hi> But the Apostles, as Apostles, might say so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in any doctrinall point they had the promise of the Spirit, to bee <hi>led into all truth,</hi> as upon whom the Church was to bee built, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. Secondly, if they sate as ordinary Elders, then their decrees did no further bind, then as they might appeare to agree with Scripture; otherwise Elders, as Elders, may bind the conscience, let the decree bee never so wicked. But to your reasons:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>For else</hi> (say you) <hi>Paul and Barnabas being Apostles themselves, might have decided that controversie at Antioch, without sending to Ierusalem. Answ.</hi> 1. By your favour, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Barnabas</hi> was not (to speak properly) an <hi>Apostle,</hi> though an <hi>Apostolicall man.</hi> 2. They argued with those Legalists at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, sufficiently to convince them; but they comming from Judea, and pretending the use of circumcision, and <hi>Moses</hi> Law, to be still in force in the Church at Jerusalem, and the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie being between two great parties, the Christian Jews, and Christian Gentiles; hereupon the <hi>Church at Antioch</hi> thought it requisite, for the fuller satisfaction to all parties, to send <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the <hi>Apostles and Elders</hi> at Jerusalem. And 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> are thus sent, doth it follow, that they were not sufficient (yea <hi>Paul</hi> alone, as an Apostle infallibly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy Ghost) to have decided the question at Antioch? As no doubt sufficiently they did, though not so satisfactorily to all. And 4. that they are thus by the Church at Antioch sent to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53107:36"/>
the Apostles and Church at Jerusalem: here is a good example for the use of communion of Churches, as in doubtfull cases to consult one with another.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Else</hi> (say you) <hi>the Church at Antioch would have sent to none, to resolve their doubts, but to the Apostles onely, and not to the Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: In that they sent to the Elders also, it shewes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that one Church should have to another. 2. Those Elders were men endowed with the gifts of the holy Ghost. 3. Though they had not infallibility, as the Apostles had, yet their assent to the determination, was a witnesse-bearing to the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Else</hi> (say you) <hi>Paul and Barnabas would have put the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Apostles onely, not to the Elders and Church, as well as to them,</hi> vers. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>This is answered in the former.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Else the Apostles would not have called all the Elders and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to consult,</hi> v. 6. <hi>when themselves might have done it alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: 1. Though the Apostles might have done it alone, yet they would not, but called together the Elders and Brethren, yea, and the whole Church at Jerusalem (vers. 4, 22.) hereby to give a precedent to all Presbyters, or <hi>Elders of Churches,</hi> that in cases of difference arising, they call the whole <hi>Church</hi> together, for assistance and counsell therein. 2. In so doing, the Apostles diminished nothing of that Judicial power and authority which Christ left with them for deciding of controversies, being infallibly guided by the holy Ghost, while they thought it not fit to doe such things in a corner, which concerned the whole Church.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Peter and Iames</hi> (say you) <hi>would not have argued the case so largely, and proved it by Arguments and Scriptures, as they did, one after another, but have peremptorily resolved it without dispute, had they sate and determined it by their extraordinary infallible power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: This followes no more then the former. For the Arguments they used, with the conclusion, were by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghost. And 2. The holy Ghost is not so perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but will have his truths examined by the Scriptures, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended by the holy Ghost for examining <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon by the Scripture, though hee were an Apostle, and spake by the holy Ghost. And 3. the Churches assent was taken in for a witnesse <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53107:37"/>6. <hi>The finall resolution</hi> (say you) <hi>Letters and Canons of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, had run onely in the Apostles names, had they proceeded onely by their Apostolicall infallible authority, and not in the names of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and brethren too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: There is as little reason in this, as in all the rest of your reasons: for then by this reason sundry of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, which were all dictated by the holy Ghost, did not proceed from that infallibility of Spirit alone wherewith the Apostle was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because we find others, not Apostles, joyned with him. As (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1.) <hi>Paul, called to be an Apostle of Iesus Christ, and Softhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a brother, to the Church of God &amp;c.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of Iesus Christ, and Timothy a brother, to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an Apostle, &amp;c. and all the brethren that are with me, to the Churche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timotheus, to the Church, &amp;c.</hi> In all which places, though there was but one Apostle, guided with infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the holy Ghost to write the Scriptures, yet many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are joyned in the salutation of the Churches; and yet <hi>Paul,</hi> as Apostle, did write those Epistles, and not simply as a brother, or fellow-servant with them of Jesus Christ. Neither are those brethren (so named) accounted the Pen-men of the Scripture, as <hi>Paul</hi> of right is. Thus you see, brother, there was no necessity, that either the Apostles names should be put alone, because they only were guided by the Spirits infallibility: or that the names of the <hi>Elders and Brethren</hi> should not be put, without a necessary conclusion deduced thence, that <hi>the Decree there was</hi> therefore <hi>binding,</hi> as being the <hi>Decree of a Synod, and so exemplary for all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, Councels, Synods, to make the like binding Decrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (good brother) for all your punctuall quotations of that Scripture, you doe not all this while tell us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which is the main of all) that which we find in the 28. verse of that chapter, IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST AND VS, TO LAY VPON YOU NO GREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER BVRTHEN, THEN THESE NECESSARY THINGS. Now, brother, we chalenge you to shew us any <hi>Parliament, Councell, Synod,</hi> ever since the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that could or can say thus, IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST AND VS, <hi>to determine controversies of religion, to</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53107:37"/>
                  <hi>make and impose Canons to bind all men, &amp;c.</hi> Shew this to us, at this time, and we will obey. But if you cannot, as you never can, never let any man presse upon us that <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Synod,</hi> which hath no parallel in the whole world, and so is no precedent, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, for any <hi>Councell, Synod, Parliaments.</hi>

                  <hi>Chamierus,</hi> that grand Antagonist of <hi>Bellarmins. Bellarmine</hi> upon the same Scripture you alledge (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) (as also our late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have usually done) would deduce the same conclusion, that you doe, for humane authority in binding mens consciences. To which <hi>Chamierus</hi> thus answereth: that this <hi>consequence holds not: Quia non eadem sit authoritas Apostolorum, &amp; reliquorum Ecclesiae Pastorum: Because there is not the same authoritie of the Apostles, and of other Pastors of the Church. For with those the Holy Ghost was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily present: so as what they propounded, did simply proceed of God. But other Pastors have no such extraordinary assistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and therefore their Decrees are not to be paralleld with the Apostles Decrees. Which is a speciall difference in binding of the conscience, which hath it selfe for witnesse, and God for the onely Iudge: therefore, when it hath any thing commanded of God, it must needs stand bound.</hi> Where (<hi>inter caetera</hi>) is to be noted, That <hi>God is the onely Iudge</hi> and binder of the Conscience. The great question in controversie at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will here object, That although (as before you say of Priests) a <hi>Councel,</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> have not this authority to make and impose binding decrees, yet a Parliament hath; and you deduce it from this Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Now truly, brother, by your favour, this doth no way hold proportion, that that which you call a Synod (as a patterne for binding Decrees) should not qualifie a Synod of Divines with the like power, and yet transmit it over to a Parliament for binding authority over the consciences of a whole Nation: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Apostolike Assembly, or Church meeting, was neither a Parliament, nor Diet, nor Senate, nor any such thing, that you should build any such power of Parliaments upon it, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of binding Decrees over the consciences of men. Therefore, good brother, be not so peremptory, but take in your top-sail, too high to bear up against so stiffe a gale, both of Scripture and Reason. But I come to your twelfth and last Interrogatory.</p>

               <head>The twelfth Interrogatory.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Interrogatory</hi> is concerning the <hi>lawfull coercive power of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrates in suppressing Heresies, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>setters up of new forms of Ecclesiasticall Government, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For answer hereunto, Wee do acknowledge and submit unto the lawfull coercive power of civill Magistrates, according to the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. But brother, however, you must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between mens consciences and their practices. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science simply considered in it self, is for God, the Lord of the conscience, alone to judge, as before. But for a mans practices, (of which alone, man can take cognizance of) if they be against any of Gods Commandments of the first, or second Table; that appertains to the civill Magistrate to punish, who is for this cause called, <hi>Custos utrius<expan>

Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? DO that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for hee is the Minister of God to thee for good; but if thou DO that which is evill, be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vain; for hee is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that DOTH evill.</hi> So as we see here, what is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Civill power, to wit; <hi>actions, good,</hi> or <hi>bad.</hi> Not bare opinions, not thoughts, not conscience, but <hi>actions.</hi> And your self <hi>exempts the preaching of the Gospel and truth of God, from being restrained by the civill Magistrate.</hi> But now brother, the time hath been, and somewhere is, and will be, that the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Thes. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>truth of God</hi> hath been <hi>with-holden in unrighteousnesse,</hi> and by the civill Magistrate punished with death, being condemned for heresie. And you see in these dayes, great diversities of mens opinions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: one judging thus, another so; you think my way erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and I may do as much for you. But do you or I, <hi>DO</hi> that which is evill, in actually breaking of any of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or any just lawes of the land? then we lie open to course of civill justice; but so long as wee differ only in opinion, which of us shall be punished first? or which of us is in the error? you write books, I write against them; yet <hi>sub judice lis est,</hi> who shall be Judge? you? or I? surely neither. Among other things, you would have <hi>the civill Magistrate to suppresse, restrain, imprison,</hi>

                  <hi>confine, banish the setters up of new forms of Ecclesiasticall government without lawfull authority.</hi> It may be you will involve me in the number. But what if I prove that which you call <hi>a new form,</hi> to be the <hi>old form:</hi> and the lawfull authority of setting it up, to be of Christ? Must I therefore undergo all these your terrible cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, because you so judge? What if your judgement herein be altogether erroneous? What punishment then is due to him that condemnes the innocent? you may be a civill Judge one day; remember then, brother, that if I come before you, you meddle not with my conscience, nor with mee for it. If I shall offend any of your just lawes, punish mee and spare not. But if you should make a law like to that of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that who so shall confesse Christ to be the Son of God, and the only Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, Lord, King, Governour over Consciences, Churches, and not man, not Assemblies, not Councels, or Senates, though <hi>after much Fasting, Prayers, Disputes,</hi> (as you say) I confesse, I shall be apt to transgresse that law; but yet take you heed how you pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me for that trangression, with an <hi>Ense recidendum,</hi> or I wot not what club-law. So ends your Book, and so my Answer.</p>
               <p>Now brother, you have since published a third Book, partly in answer to your first Answerer, and partly touching M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Joh. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win;</hi> I leave the parties interessed to acquit themselves; Only your stating the Question in the conclusion of the Book, I could not omit. You sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it thus: <hi>Whether a whole representative Church and State, hath not as great, or greater Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction over the whole Realm &amp; Churches, with all the members, then any one Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Minister or Congregation challenge over their members.</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I answer, if you can prove your Jurisdiction good, we will easily grant it to be greater. But if the Jurisdiction of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches you call <hi>Independent</hi> be good, as having Christ for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and owner of it, as we have cleerly proved, then certainly, it will prove the greater: For, <hi>magna est veritas, &amp; praevalet:</hi> for Christs kingdome shall stand up, when all opposite earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, like earthen vessels, shall with his iron rod be dashed in pieces: This for the Clause.</p>
               <p>Another passage in the same Book, is touching my person: where you say, <hi>That none of us three-brethren-Sufferers, suffered for opposing Bishops legall authority, or any Ceremonies by act of Parliament established:</hi> Here brother, give me leave to answer for my self:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53107:39"/>
First, for all manner of <hi>Ceremonies of humane ordinance,</hi> imposed upon the conscience in the worship of God, I openly, for the space almost of a twelvemoneth, immediately before my troubles, preached against them, every Lords day, out of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. from the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse to the end of the Chapter; so as when I was summoned into the High Commission Court, the Articles read against mee, were not only for my two Sermons, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, but also for those other Sermons against the <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> so as this might challeng to be one ingredient in my censure in <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and no lesse then a pillory matter.</p>
               <p>And concerning my opposing of Bishops themselves, not only their extravagancies (for which I also was censured, and suffered) you may remember one passage in that Book, <hi>For God &amp; the King,</hi> affixed to the <hi>information; Were there a law in</hi> England, <hi>as once among the</hi> Locrians, <hi>that who should come to propound a new law, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And do you not think, brother, that this helped to put the Hang-mans knife (though not the halter) so close to the very root of mine ears, that it opened the wider sluces for the blood to stream out (with yours my dear Fellow-sufferers) to fill the Whores cup, and make her drunk and spue, and fall, and rise up no more? Although the more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous and self-wise, or discreet any of us (but especially my self) then was, to avoid the fear of men, or force of law, certainly now, brother, it abates so much the more of the honour of that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the lesse honour, the more <hi>shame.</hi> But take we the shame to our selves, and give we all the honour to whom it is due; and brother, wherein we then came short, let us now make it up, by being zealous for our Christ, in labouring to advance the throne of his kingly government in all our souls, and over all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Saints, and with those four and twenty Elders, cast our selves and crowns before him that sitteth on the throne, saying. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power, for</hi>
