            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of a Protestant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AND are you indeed
got into the onely
Catholick Church?
And are you sure
the Men you have lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
have not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, as you fancy we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44977:3"/>
have done? (for tho you
may be so Charitable, as to
think, that we have not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
couzened you, yet
since you cannot suppose Us
to be both in the Right, you
must necessarily conclude,
that we have at least igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
abused and imposed
upon you) and did you ever
rightly consider what a truely
Catholick Church does mean?
Men of Sense and Reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
believed, that a Church
which hold's the truely Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith is a true and
sound Member of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and dares
malice it self say, that we do
not hold the Apostles, the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi>
and <hi>Athanasius's</hi> Creed!
The Church of <hi>ROME</hi> her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44977:3"/>
self confesses, that these Creed's
contain the truely Catholick
Faith: And most certainly
when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel was
celebrated, and in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s
time that Church was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a sound Member of the
Catholick Church, that held
that Catholick Faith, which
is expressed in those Creeds;
and do we not hold that
Faith? do we not stand up at
it to express our readiness to
defend it? and what have
we done, that we must not
be counted a Catholick
Church? Is it because we
will not receive things which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
since added to the Catholick
Faith? Is it because we will
not admit of the Doctrines
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44977:4"/>
which that Church was first
induced to believe by the
darkness and ignorance of
the Ages it lived in, and at
last loath to part withal for
fear they should be thought
to have been so long in an
Error? Is it because we will
not yield to things which we
apprehend to be directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Word of God and
destructive to that Catholick
Faith the Christian World
hath professed in all Ages?
Is it because we will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the People of the Cup in
the Blessed Sacrament, which
Christ intended as a mighty
comfort to them? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we will not believe the
Miracle of Transubstantiation
against four of our Senses and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44977:4"/>
Reason, and Scripture to boot.
Is it because we will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Worship of God, or
that which is very like it to
be given to Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the very appearance
of the evil of Idollatry, which
we are commanded to shun,
as much as Idollatry it self?
Is it because we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Purgatory fire, which
cleanseth little, but peoples
Purses of their money? Is it
because we will not indulge
the Pride and Arrogance of a
Man at <hi>Rome,</hi> who having first
wheadled the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of their means and
Power, hath at last made that
Power and Riches hereditary
to his Successors, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Legacy from Christ?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44977:5"/>
Is it because we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
contrary to the Apostles
Rule, that publick Prayers
which are intended for the
benefit are understanding of
the Multitude, must be said
in a Tongue unknown to
the People? These must
certainly be the reasons, why
we cannot now passe with
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi> for
members of the Catholick
Church? That these things
were not in the Ancient
Catholick Creeds, I hope,
you are convinced, for you
have read them over, and
found none of all these
Additions in them: And
now I beg of you, in the
name and by the mercy of that
Jesus in whom you beleive,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44977:5"/>
to judge, which is most likely
to be the truly Catholick
Church, our's or their's? our's
that keeps to the truly antient
Catholick Faith, or their's that
hath added things contrary
to Scripture and reason and
antiquity? And dare you
continue in a Church where
your very Communion with
it, is an approbation of
their Actions which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Christ? can there be
any thing more contrary to
it than their denying the Cup
to the Laity? And when
you receive the Sacrament
but in one kind, contrary to
Christs command, do not you
Sin and allow of the Sin
of that Church you are in? Is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44977:6"/>
not your disobedience to
Christs Command a Sin, or
can you imagine that you are
more obliged to Obey men
than Christ himself? You
confess you dare not live
in any one Sin; But how
dare you live in this Sin? You
talk of the benefit of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and absolution, when that
very Priest to whom you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and who absolves you,
lives in that Sin you are guilty
of, and neither absolves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
nor you from it, and
you both continue in it, as if
the Blind had a mind to lead
the Blind? How dare you
act thus against your Reason
and Conscience? Are you not
affraid when you are going to
confesse, that God will laugh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44977:6"/>
at your Mock Confession,
since you neither confesse
that Sin of living contrary to
Christs Command about the
Cup, nor are willing to part
with it? Tell me not here
that you drink the blood
of Christ in eating his Flesh,
if so, to what purpose doth
the Priest Consecrate Wine
for himselfe, if he drinks
the blood of Christ in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Flesh; But suppose
the Bread were transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into the Flesh and
Blood of Christ, you know
that the not giving the
Cup of Blessing to those
that come to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
is contrary to Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
who distinctly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
the Cup, and gave that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44977:7"/>
to his Disciples, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives
of all Believers,
as well as the Bread, and
peremptorily commanded,
<hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> and I
hope you do not call eating
the consecrated Wafer drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wafer. But let Us
grant you your strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that you do participate
of the Blood of Christ in eating
the Consecrated Wafer, who
gave your Church Authority
to alter Christ's Institution?
How can Men dispense with
an express Law of God? Can
they annull what God would
have Established, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to the Worlds end? And
can you consent to so great
a Sacriledge? Doth not some
horrour seize on you, when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44977:7"/>
you seriously think that you
approve of the Priests sinning
against so notorious a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and which he that runs
may read? And pray Madam,
wherein have you bettered
your self in going over to the
Roman Church? Is this your
proficiency in Religion to
forsake a Church, where you
felt the lively Oracles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
coming warm upon your
Soul, and to joyn your self
to a Church, where you hear
nothing but Latine Prayers,
and where the Priest, if he be
not a good man, may as well
Curse you as Bless you, for
any thing you understand of
his Language or Devotion?
Is this Your proficiency in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to leave a Church
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44977:8"/>
where you were taught to
Worship God in Spirit and in
Truth, and now to cleave to
one where they teach your
Prayers to go upon Crutches
of Crucifixes, Beads, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages?
Doth this look
like that Noble Religion
which Christ taught the
World, and whose design was
to advance our Rational
Souls by Contemplation and
Meditation? O Madam, you
are too Young to know the
Tricks of that Church you
live in; they are more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Heads than yours is,
that had the contriving of it.
Bold Men, that had Learnt
not to Blush at a Lye, and
then thought it their interest
to Hector the World into a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44977:8"/>
belief of it. We that can
Read Books as well as they,
and know the History of the
Church as well as they, can
see through all these devices,
which they perceiving are
angry with Us for discovering
the Cheat. What was it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that you wanted in our
Church to carry you to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Did you want that which
the Apostles and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
I mean did you want
more Articles of Faith than
they subscribed and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
If you wanted that, we
Confess we could not supply
you, for we dare say nothing
and believe nothing with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith, but what <hi>Moses,</hi>
and the Prophets, and Christ
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44977:9"/>
and his Apostles have taught
us. If the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all things necessary to
Salvation, then we teach
all that. If the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> knows more Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
than Christ or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
knew of; we will
admire her insolence, but
cannot satisfie her unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
desire. Did you want
strictness of Life in our
Church? If all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Gospel can make
you Holy, We teach them
all, and press them upon the
People, and I presume you
do not aim to be Holier
than Christ and his Apostles
would have you to be. Hath
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel to teach, you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44977:9"/>
than we did instruct you in?
if they have, much good it
may do them, We are not
sond of the Apostle's Curse,
<hi>Should an Angel from Heaven
bring another Gospel to you
let him be accursed,</hi> I know
your common Plea that We
Protestants cannot rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the Scripture, because
We pretend to no infallibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And do you blame Us
for not being so impudent as
the Church of <hi>ROME?</hi>
There is no Protestant but
would be glad there were an
infallible Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
instituted by God and
recommended to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But where shall we find
him? Who is it that God
hath imparted this Honour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44977:10"/>
to? If you say the Fathers,
you know not what you
say, for the Fathers differ
many times as much in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Scripture,
and are as contrary to one
another as any Men. If you
say the Church that's a hard
Word; if you mean Christs
Universal Church, dispersed
all the World over, you must
tell us where it is that this
Church hath left an infallible
Comment upon the Bible,
and how it is possible for a
man that will be resolved in
a point to go to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
People in the World; If
you say the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
you must first shew Us her
commission for this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
interpretation. Secondly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44977:10"/>
you must prove She hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
interpreted the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that those inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
are infallible in all
places. Thirdly you must agree
among your selves what part
of your Church is infallible,
whether the Pope, or an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Councel, or all Christian
People, or whether all these
together. To say that this
Infallibility lies in the Church,
though you know not where,
is to say a Needle lies in a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Hay, and he hath good
luck that finds it. Nay I
think the Church of <hi>ROME</hi>
hath been so modest, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to infallibility, She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath dared to obtrude a
comment on the Bible as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44977:11"/>
nor did I ever see any
Interpretation of the Bible
made either by Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
which hath pretended to
Infallibility. If that Church
be infallible why do not their
own Divines agree in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Scripture? if
there be an infallible Sense of
the Scriptures in that Church,
then the Members of that
Church are mad not to keep to
that infallible Sense, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if they know where to
fetch it, and they offer great
injuries and affronts to their
Church in differing so much
about interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when their Church
can give them an Infallible
sense of it. For that Church
having as they pretend the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44977:11"/>
Holy Ghost to guide them in
all things, I suppose that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
assists her in Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one place of Scripture as
well as in another: if they
say it doth infallibly assist
them in some places and not
in all, they destroy their own
Principle, and how shall a
man be sure, that just in
those Points that are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between Us and them,
they are Infallible? Is the
Spirit divided? Or is he not
alwaies the same? Or doth
not he exert his power upon
all occasions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> who so blind as those
that will not see? Who sees not
that the pretence of Infallibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is nothing but a juggle,
a device to maintain a triple
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44977:12"/>
Crown, and an Engine to
carry on a temporal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
God indeed hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that his Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
through the World,
shall last to the World's end,
and that the Gates of Hell
shall not prevail against her,
but that promise differs very
much from a promise of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and suppose it did infer
an Infallibility, how comes
the particular Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> to ingross it to her
self, that is at the best but a
Member, and a very unsound
one, of Christ's Universal
Church? It is one thing to
be secured against being
destroyed, and another to be
free from all possibility of
Errour. There is no doubt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44977:12"/>
but a sober rational man, that
prays earnestly for illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and reads the Scripture
much, and considers the
Circumstances, the Holy
Writers were in, when they
writ, and the Occasions of
their writing, and hath the
advantage of Learning, of
Languages, and History, may
give a very true Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Scriptures, such an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
as no man can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
contradict, though
he hath not recourse to a
Visible infallible guide, and
though himself be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.
Things may be
very certain, though they
are not infallibly so, and
he that can make things
cut so, that a prudent man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44977:13"/>
cannot but give consent to
them, and hath no just cause
to doubt of their truth, may
justly challenge beleif from
other men. But I will not
insist upon this point because
I never heard you speak
much of it. I will come
a little closer to those reasons,
that moved you to goe
over to the Roman Church,
whereof the principal was
this, that you were troubled
in mind upon the account of
your Sins, and could get no
satisfaction in Our Church,
though you sought it like <hi>Esau</hi>
with teares; whereas you did
no sooner confess to a Roman
Priest, and receive absolution
but you presently found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44977:13"/>
And are you sure Madam,
that the peace and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you found in that Church
was not delusion? you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at that word; But lets
consider the Nature of your
peace. When you were in
our Church, either you did
truly repent of all your Sins,
or you did not. If you did
not, most certainly you could
have no solid peace, but if you
did truly repent, as you say
you did, what could hinder
you from applying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made to penitent Sinners
to your self, which are the true
grounds of comfort and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?
may be you wanted a
Voice from heaven to confirm
the promise of the Gospel, but
have you since heard such a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44977:14"/>
Voice from heaven in the
Church of <hi>ROME?</hi> I think
not; if you truly repented
in our Church, then certainly
by the word of God you
were assured that your Sins
were pardoned, and if they
were pardoned, why should
you not comfort your self
with that pardon? That
which makes you rejoyce now,
is because you believe your
Sins are pardoned, but
if when you were of our
Church, you verily believed;
you truly repented, you could
not but believe that your
Sins were pardoned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
you might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as much comfort, as you
do now. But the Ministers
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44977:14"/>
say, gave me no absolution,
which the Roman Priest did.
Why, Madam, did any of our
Ministers deny you absolution,
when you could assure them
that your Repentance was
sincere? did you ever ask ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and were you refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Nay I appeal to your
Conscience, did not those
Ministers you conversed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
assure you over and over,
that you need not doubt of
the pardon of your Sins so
long as you did detest and
abhor them, and watch, and
strive, and pray against them,
and were sincerly resolved
to commit them no more,
and did avoyd the very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of Evill? and what
was this but absolution, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44977:15"/>
however you might have had
performed with greater Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
if you had had a mind to
it. It is no very hard matter
to guesse at the rise and
progress of your peace and
satisfaction in the Roman
Church. All new things
please, and provided they have
but a good face, allure our
fancy, and this being pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Its very natural to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them, and having once
defended them, our Love to
them advances, and by degrees
we think our honour and
Credit is too far engaged
to part with them. We see
how Children are quieted with
new trifles (pardon the
uncourtly comparison, I know
not how to shun it) and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44977:15"/>
new object, they never saw
before, surprizes and charmes
them, makes them fix their
Eyes upon it and cry, if they
cannot have it. In the nature
of Children we see our own,
and embraceing new objects,
which our sickly fancy is
roving after, is but the Scene
of Childrens longing for
new play things, changed;
the Novelty of the thing you
were venturing upon, the
new Church (new indeed,
new to you, and new to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God) which you
were to joyn your self to,
the Stool of Confession in
the Church, and the Priests
new habit, and mortified face
(which perhaps he owes more
to his Country, than to his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44977:16"/>
Vertue) and affected gravity,
and assuring of you that
their absolution had a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Vertue and efficacy,
all these together surprized
you, and raised your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and struck some
kind of reverence into you.
Your mind being thus pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with the Idea's of
these new thing's you never
tried before, and working
upon your affections, and
moving your will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to this man of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
you naturally fell into
a fancy, that so much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
and Ceremony diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that you had been
used to in our Church,
had more charmes in it,
than our plain and honest
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44977:16"/>
way, and then laid the
stress of your pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the new Priests absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that formal manner
wherewith your fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impregnated, it soon
diffused a cheereful air in
your countenance, and rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some gladness in your
heart, because you had now
done something more than
ordinary, as an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your Sin. And from
hence arose your pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
peace and satisfaction,
or delusion rather, because
you layd the stress of your
pardon upon the absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Roman Priest,
and not upon the sincerity
of your repentance. If a
Priest could forgive Sinn's
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44977:17"/>
whether men Repent or no,
Then indeed you might have
layd the stress of your pardon
on that forgiveness of the
Priest, but since by your own
confession, that absolution of
the Priest signifies nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
people truly repent, for
you to build your comfort on
that absolution, when it should
have been founded upon your
sincere repentance, cannot but
be a false fire and a conterfeit
comfort, if you say; you did
not fetch your peace from that
absolution, but from the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of your repentance, you
catch your self, for if your true
repentance must be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of it, then you might
have taken the same comfort
in our Church: if you still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44977:17"/>
you could not, you only
mean, you would not, for
true repentance is true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in any Church, and if
true repentance causes true
comfort, it would have caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
true comfort in our Church,
as well as in the Roman, and
therefore there must be some
cheat in this comfort.</p>
            <p>The fancy you have since
taken up, that the reason, why
you found comfort in the
Church of <hi>ROME</hi> upon your
confession and absolution, and
none in ours, must needes be,
because the Priests of that
Church are true Priests and
those of ours are not, is
as solid as your peace. If we
have no true Priests in the
Church of England, then most
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44977:18"/>
certainly the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> hath none. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
which in the beginning
of our reformation did ordain
Bishops, Priests and Deacons
among us, were ordained
by Bishops of that Church,
and if the Character of Orders
by their own confession be
indeleble, then it was not all
the thunders and Lightenings
of Excommunication at
<hi>ROME</hi> could annul it. It's
true your ghostly Father very
confidently tells you (a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
incident to that sort of
men) That our first Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Bishops never received
Orders from Bishops of the
Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> but one
would admire what Spirit
doth possess these men, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44977:18"/>
they dare contradict all the
publick authentick Records
we have of their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
by Bishops of the
Church of <hi>ROME;</hi> they
might as well deny, that
there were no such Kings
of England, as <hi>Henry</hi> 7th.
and <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. (for we
have nothing but publick
Records to shew for it)
as deny that the Bishops of
the Reformation were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consecrated by Bishops
of the Roman perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I am perswaded that
if any Papist should come
into trouble about the title
of an Estate, he hath, and
did but know that the
name of his Ancestors, the
manner of the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44977:19"/>
and his just title
were in some publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or Register, he would
soon make use of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it as a sufficient proof,
and thank God for preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Record, that is so
much for his advantage.
I know not, what can be
a better testimony in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fact next to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
than publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and Registers, and we
dare venture our reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it, that in the
Authentick Registers of the
respective Arch-Bishops of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> where fear
of being counted Knaves,
and Fools, for putting in
things contrary to what was
publickly known, may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44977:19"/>
justly be supposed, to have
kept the publick Notaries
from asserting things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
false. In these
Registers I say it will be
found, what succession our
first Protestant Bishops had,
how Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> the
first Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
under Queen <hi>Elizbeth</hi> (to go
no higher) was consecrated
<hi>December.</hi> 17. 1559 by four
persons then actually Bishops,
and who had formerly been
Ordained by Bishops of the
Church of <hi>ROME (Viz.)
William Barlow</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th. dayes Bishop of St.
<hi>Davids,</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the
6th. Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and
<hi>Wells,</hi> under Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
driven into <hi>Exile</hi> and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44977:20"/>
under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,
John Scory</hi> formerly Bishop
of <hi>Chichester, Miles Coverdale</hi>
formerly Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
and <hi>John Hodgkins</hi> Bishop
Suffragan of <hi>Bedford,</hi> not to
mention that the Queens Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents (in case any of
the other should be sick or
forced to be absent) were
directed to three Bishops
more, that had formerly been
Popish Bishops and were
turned Protestants <hi>(Viz.)
Anthony</hi> Bishop of <hi>Landaff,
John</hi> Bishop Suffragan of
<hi>Thedford</hi> and <hi>John Bale</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Ossery</hi> But all this hath
been so clearly demonstrated
out of the Publick Records,
first by Mr. <hi>Mason,</hi> and since by
Arch-Bishop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44977:20"/>
that writes of it can onely
transcribe out of them, and
those that deny these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
must be men of strange
Foreheads, and of thegreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
disingenuity. From these
men that had their Priesthood
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> our
Priesthood is lineally derived,
so that if our Priesthood be
not valid, theirs cannot be, and
if Heresie doth not make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
office void, nor disable
a man from conferring Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
order on other men (as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Nice,</hi> with your Church
an Oecumenical Counsel,
which received Bishop <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
tho consecrated by <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
a Heretical Bishop (if I say
Heresie doth not make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44977:21"/>
order void, then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
We were Hereticks our
Priesthood which is derived
from Popish Bishop, that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Protestants must be a true
Priesthood still, and to this
purpose I remember one of
your Church said lately, once
a Priest, for ever a Priest.</p>
            <p>Madam, if your desire to
know the truth, be honest
and sincere, you should Act
like a person that hath a mind
to be satisfied, and search the
Publick Records, and till
then believe not every Tale
that's told you; the Common
Plea of your Priests, that our
Records are sophisticated,
and that we have put in what
we please, argues only bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and ignorance, when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44977:21"/>
they can shew neither where,
nor when, nor by whom they
they were corrupted. Those
that talk so, seem neither to
understand what a publick
solemne thing the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of a Bishop is in
<hi>England,</hi> nor to reflect, how
difficult it is to fill a publick
Register with falsities as to
matters of fact, when there
are so many hundered men,
that know what is done at
such a time, and View
the Records, and would most
certainly speak of it, if they
found a flaw in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But if we should deal
thus with the Church of
<hi>ROME,</hi> question all their
Registers in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and
say, which we might do
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44977:22"/>
with far greater reason, that
they are things packed and
invented by men, that have a
mind to keep up a faction, I
know what Language we
should meet withal. But
will you boast, say you, of
having derived your orders
from the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
when you believe the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> to be an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church; Madam, It is not
the Office of a Bishop in your
Church we find fault withal,
but the abuses of it. A Church
thats guilty of very great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
both in Doctrine and
manners, may have something
thats good and allowable,
and he that retains that, is not
therefore guilty of her corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor espouses her Errours.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44977:22"/>
Your Idolatry is one thing,
and your Orders are another.
The Jews did take many
good things from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and the Christians ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
commendable things from
the Jewes, but that neither
made the Jewes approve of
the Heathenish Worship, nor
the Christians allow of the
Jewish Errours. We are not
so disingenious, as to make
the breach between you and
Us wider then needs. So
far as you go with Scripture
and true Antiquity we hold
with you, where you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
both, We cannot with
a safe Conscience bear you
Company. He that sees a
Pearl lye among a great deal
of Trash, if he take the Pearl,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44977:23"/>
is not therefore obliged to
take the Rubbish too, and if
we have derived our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from you, that inferrs
no necessity, that we must
therefore consent to your
Notorious depravations of
the ancient simplicity of the
Gospel. The Christians here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
that approved of the
Baptism of the Donatists, did
not therefore presently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the truth of their
opinions, and he that should
take a good custome from
the Turks, cannot be therefore
said to approve of all things
that are in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> there is nothing
more easie than to cavil
at the most prudent Action
in the World, especially
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44977:23"/>
where People take a slight
survey of things, and do not
with seriousness and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
weigh the circumstances
of the fact, and do not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the inside as well as the
outside, and I must confess
upon the best examination
of your actions and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in this Revolt to the
Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
took the Right way to be
satisfied, for instead of pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Our departure from
the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> and
of the reasons we alledge for
our Church and Doctrine;
you made it your chief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
to read their Books,
and believed what they said
to be Oracles, for no other
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44977:24"/>
reason but because they talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with greater arrogance and
confidence. If you say, that
you could not judge of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
having never been
bred a Schollar, I would but
ask you how you durst change
your Religion then? Did you
change it without reason and
without ground? and if you
are not able to Weigh the
strength of Arguments, how
can you be sure that you are
in the true Church at this
time? It is not talk, but
Arguments that must demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the truth of a Religion,
and if you have not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weighed the Arguments of
both sides, It is a thousand to
one, you may still be in the
wrong way, and you know
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44977:24"/>
not but you may be as much
out now, as you were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
Madam, so great a
thing, as the change of your
Religion, upon which no
less then Eternity depends,
might justly have challenged
some years study, before
you had resolved upon it.
To do a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon so slight a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
Consider whether it
doth not argue rashness, and
weakness, rather than Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Devotion. To leave
a Religion you have been
bred and born in, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
founded upon the Word
of GOD, and which you
had Liberty to Examine by
the Scripture, upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Popish Book or two,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44977:25"/>
without diving to the Bottom
of the several controversies,
without reflecting on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the points in
question, without studying a
considerable time which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
comes nearest to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which goes far thest
off, is such an Argument of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
that you only seem
to have yeilded to a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
temptation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
If the Controversies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi>
and us, are so intricate, as you
say, and above your capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to dive into them, you
have then run over to that
Church in the dark, and have
as little reason to be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with your proceedings,
as you believe you have with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44977:25"/>
our way of Worship. You
plead, that you have been sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up whole nights, and
weeping and praying, that
God would discover to you,
which is the true way to
Salvation, and from that time
forward you found inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to go over to that
Church; and is this a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
argument to justifie your
forwardness? when you had
already begun to doubt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Church were a true
Church or no, because you
found not that satisfaction
in it, your sickly desires
wanted, it was then an easie
matter to give ear to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
People, that magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and peremptorily assured
you, that you would find
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44977:26"/>
satisfaction in their Church,
and being fed with this
hope, your inclinations to
that Church grew stronger
every day, as Our Mother
<hi>Eve,</hi> the hopes of being like
GOD, suggested to her by
the Serpent, did egg and spur
her on to eat of the fatal
Tree.</p>
            <p>We do not forbid people
to pray to GOD to lead
or direct them into the right
way: (though sometimes it
may be a perfect tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of GOD, when People
are in the right way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
GOD to discover to
to them, by a Sign of their
own choice, whether they are
in it or no.) But then, if we
pray to GOD to direct us,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44977:26"/>
we must not neglect the
means, GOD hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in order to our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but must compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Scripture, and
Books with Books, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
with Arguments,
and search, which Religion
agrees most with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practices of Christ
and his Apostles, and as the
noble Berrheans did, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all the Doctrines, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
to our belief, by the
Scripture; and doing thus,
and continuing this search,
and these prayers together,
no doubt but GOD, in
his own good time, will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
us and Direct us. But
to pray to GOD to direct
Us, and not to use the means,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44977:27"/>
in the use of which he hath
promised to direct Us, We
do in a manner mock him, or
desire him to work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
for Us, or to vouchsafe
Us some extroardinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
when we have <hi>Moses</hi>
and the Prophets, and may
hear them. And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
had you joyned this way
with your Prayer, examined
the Doctrines of the Church
of <hi>ROME,</hi> and compared
them with the Gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ, seen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any thing like
it in the Bible, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether Christ and his
Apostles ever taught such
Doctrines, and done all this,
not slightly, but seriously
and solidly, Its impossible,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44977:27"/>
you could ever have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Papist, for if our Gospel
be true, that Religion can
never be true, for there is
nothing in the World can
run more counter to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
than the Doctrines of
that Church, wherein we
differ from them, and they
had need put the Bible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
prohibited Books, for
should the people have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
freely to peruse it, the
Church of <hi>ROME</hi> would
grow very thin and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
            <p>I am sensible your Priests
find fault with our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bible, and Cry
out, that there are great
defects in it, but when they
talk so, they had need talk to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44977:28"/>
Women, not to men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that understand
Greek and Hebrew, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
in which the Word was
Originally written. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of our Translators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
sufficiently from hence,
because, if any sentence in the
Bible be capable of a double
sense, they express the one in
the Text, and the other in the
Margin, and where they
do but in the least, vary from
the Original, they either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it by the Italick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
or give you notice of
it in the Margin, then which
there can be nothing more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
And let any Papist of
you all shew Us, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in our Bibles is ill
Translated out of malice or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44977:28"/>
design, or expressed in words,
which the Original will not
bear.</p>
            <p>If We examine Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Original, then
sure I am, there is few transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
go further from it,
than the Vulgar Latine, or
the Rhemist Testament, as
were an easie matter to prove,
if I intended more than a
Letter.</p>
            <p>You are much taken with
their Mortifications and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which, you say, we
have not in our Church; But
it's a signe, Madam, you did
not rightly understand our
Religion; We are so far from
condemning Mortification
and severity of life, that we
do commend it, provided it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44977:29"/>
be in order to subdue the
body of Sin, and to raise our
selves to a greater pitch of
Vertue, Provided these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
be separated from all
opinion of merit, and from
an opinion of their being
satisfactory, and expiatory,
and used only as helps, to
work in us a perfect detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sin. And I will
assure you there are more in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
use severities in this humble
holy way, than you are aware
of.</p>
            <p>We indeed do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
inflict them on all
persons, because we know not
their constitution, nor what
their nature will bear, nor
have we any command for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44977:29"/>
it in the word of GOD,
but these things we leave
to every mans discretion,
Urging, that where Sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
stronger remedies, there
men ought to make use of
them, and if their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will not be gone by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
and Arguments, that
there they must inflict mulcts
and penalties on themselves
to drive the Unclean Spirit
out. Though I must say still,
that Religious severities and
austerities are not certain
signs of a true Religion, for
Heathens do use them, as
much as Christians, nay more
than Christians, Witness the
<hi>Brahmanes</hi> in the Indies, and
the religious <hi>Pagans</hi> dispersed
through all the Eastern parts,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44977:30"/>
and if you conclude, that
therefore the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> must be in the right,
because they inflict great
pennances, and severities and
make daily use of them, I
am afraid, you only forbear
turning Turk or Heathen,
because you never saw their
far greater severities in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
than the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> can boast of: But
still the Protestant Church
hath not the real Body and
Blood of Christ in the Holy
Sacrament, which the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> hath; And are
you sure the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> hath it? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
you did never tast
it, nor see it, nor feel it, nor
Smell it, and how do you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44977:30"/>
know it? what? because the
Priests of that Church do
tell you so? No, say you,
It is, because Christ saith in
express termes, <hi>this is my
Body.</hi> And here, I confess, I
stand amazed, that men, with
learning and reason about
them, can sink into an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so contradictory, that, if
all the consequences of it be
considered, there is nothing
in nature can be more absurd,
or irrational, and the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> had need oblige
men to deny both their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and senses to beleive a
transubstantiation. Here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Faith is neeessary,
strong enough to remove
mountaines, and though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Miracles were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44977:31"/>
wrought, but were wrought
on purpose to convince our
senses, yet here we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one which neither sence
nor reason can discover.
When Christ gave the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Disciples, saith the
Apostle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 24,
<hi>He brake the bread, and said,
take eat, this is my body, which
is broken for you.</hi> It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
thing, that the word
<hi>is,</hi> in the first Sentence, <hi>this
is my Body,</hi> should have a
litteral sense, and in the very
next sentence, pronounced
with the same breath, cannot
admit of a Litteral sense; for
the word <hi>is,</hi> in the second
sentence must necessarily stand
for <hi>shall be,</hi> because Christs
Body, when he gave the Bread,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44977:31"/>
was not yet broken: If it
will not admit of a Litteral
Sense in the very next sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
because of the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that would follow, that
Christ was Crucified, before
he was Crucified, why should
we understand it in the first
sentence litterally, when the
absurdity is far greater; Nay
that the word <hi>is</hi> should not
be capable of being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
litterally in the second
essential part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
This cup <hi>is</hi> the New
Testament, that here I say it
should import, and can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
nothing else, but <hi>signifies</hi>
or <hi>is a sign of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and yet must not be
understood so, in the first part
of the Sacrament, is a thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44977:32"/>
we cannot comprehend: And
when the Apostle, speaking
of the Lords Supper or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. The
Cup of blessing which we
bless, <hi>is it not the Communion
of the Blood of</hi> Christ, and the
Bread which we break, <hi>is it
not the Communion, of the
Body of Christ;</hi> Let the rigidest
Papist, that hath not quite
banished his reason, tell me,
how he will make sense of
the word <hi>is</hi> here, except he
understand it figuratively;
most certainly it cannot be
understood literally; for the
Cup is not that Communion,
but is a sign of it: One would
admire, how men can be so
obstinate in a thing as clear
as the Sun, and you might as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44977:32"/>
well conclude, that Christ is
a Door made of boards and
nailes, because the Scripture
sayth, he is a Door, and
that he is a real Vine with
green Leaves and Grapes
about him, because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith he <hi>is</hi> a Vine. But
suppose the word <hi>is</hi> in these
words, This <hi>is</hi> my body,
must be understood literally,
how doth this make for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation?
Are the words
<hi>is</hi> and <hi>is transubstantiated</hi>
all one? A thing may be said
to <hi>be</hi> a thousand ways, and yet
without transubstantiation,
so that, if by the word <hi>is</hi> you
understand transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you your selves must go
from the literal sense, and
assume a sense, which is not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44977:33"/>
expressed in that saying. All
the Jews are so well versed
in the sense of Sacramental
expressions, that by the word
<hi>is</hi> they understand nothing
but <hi>signifies</hi> or <hi>represents,</hi> and
therefore its a horrid shame,
that Christians, meerly for
fear of being laughed at, for
departing from an absurd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and losing the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of a pretended infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
should make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ignorant in that,
which the meanest Jew, even
before the Gospel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
without a Teacher;
for we may confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,
that no Jew, before
<hi>Christs</hi> time, was so sottish to
think, when it's said, <hi>the flesh
is the Passeover, Exod.</hi> 12. 11.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44977:33"/>
that the flesh or blood was
really the Passeover, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a sign and representation
of it, or a token to them,
as <hi>Moses</hi> calls it, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
I will not here put you in
mind of the strange absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that must follow from
this Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Christ, when
he did eat and drink in this
Sacrament, must have eaten
his own flesh, and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
must have eaten his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
while he was at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with them, and before it
was Crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could
tell you, that this Doctrine
is against the great Article of
our Faith, that Christ is ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Heaven, and there
sitteth at the Right Hand of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44977:34"/>
GOD until the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That it is against the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a real Body to be in a
thousand places at once. And
that from hence it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the Body and Blood
of Christ is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
devoured by Vermine;
capable of being poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and instead of giving
life may be so order'd, that
it shall kill and murther;
witness <hi>Victor</hi> the third,
Pope of <hi>ROME,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>VIIth.</hi> Emperour, who
were poisoned in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to mention a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more of such Monstrous
consequences: But since, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
you do insist so much
upon that place of Scripture,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44977:34"/>
               <hi>John 6. 53. Except you eat
my flesh and drink my blood
you have no life in you.</hi> Ile
but breifly shew you, how
ill a Logician you are, either
to believe that this is spoke
of the Sacrament, or that
these words infer a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
manducation of Christs
real Body and blood, if they
be meant of the Eucharist,
it will necessarily follow,
that Christ oblig'd the Jews,
and his hearers to come to
the Sacrament at the time he
spake these words, for he
speakes of their present eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking, (<hi>Except ye
eat, &amp;c.</hi>) But this he could
not possibly do, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of his body and blood
was not instituted till at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44977:35"/>
least a whole twelve months
after, nor did any of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
at that time, dream of
any such thing, as his dying,
and being crucified, nor doth
Christ speak the least word of
it in the whole Chapter, which
he must necessarily have done,
if he had intended the Sacr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by it, which is all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
founded in his crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.
For this Sermon of
Christ, concerning eating
and drinking his flesh and
blood, was delivered just a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Feast of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>ver.</hi> 4. After which feast,
as it is said, <hi>John.</hi> 7. 1. 2. the
Jews celebrated the feast of
Tabernacles, and after this
they kept another feast of
the Passeover, the last,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44977:35"/>
which Christ was at, which
was no less than a twelve
month after, <hi>John.</hi> 11. 55.
<hi>John.</hi> 12. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. So that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Christs Body and
blood, not being instituted
before the last Passover, as
all the Evangelists agree, it
was not possible, that either
the believing Jews, or the
Apostles could understand it
of the Sacrament (and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Christ intended to be
understood) because there
was no such thing as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted.
Besides, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that it can be understood
of the Sacramental eating and
drinking of the Body and
Blood of Christ, for without
this eating and drinking there
is no Salvation to be had, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44977:36"/>
it is said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53, 54.
and if it were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the Eucharist, we
must exclude all Christians
from Salvation, that are not
in a capacity, nor in a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of receiving it, which,
I am sure, your own Church
will not do.</p>
            <p>And that these words of
Christ cannot possibly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of a Corporal eating
Christs flesh, and drinking his
blood, but must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a Spiritual eating and
drinking, that is, believing in
him, and obeying him, and
hoping for pardon through
his death, which is the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
food of the Soul, is evident
from the <hi>54th.</hi> and <hi>56th.</hi>
Verse, where every one that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44977:36"/>
eats of his flesh, and drinks of
his blood, is said to have
actually eternal life in him,
and Christ dwelling in him,
and he dwelling in Christ.
That is, Christ loves him with
a love of complacency, he is a
Child of GOD, and beloved
of him, and an heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
But since Wicked men
come to the Sacrament,
not only in our Church, but
even in the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
it would follow, if a corporal
eating were understood, that
Wicked men, eating Christs
body, and drinking his blood,
have Eternal life in them, and
that Christ dwels in them, and
are true Children of GOD,
and heires of Heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the unanimous consent
of the Holy Prophets and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44977:37"/>
Apostles, who call Wicked
men Children of the Devil,
and blinded by the Devil, the
GOD of the World, and
Heirs of damnation. And
indeed it is strange, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should contend for this
corporal and sensual eating
of Christs flesh, and drinking
his blood, when Christ himself
saith, <hi>v.</hi> 63. That the flesh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing, and that this eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
spiritually, <hi>i.e.</hi> of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
eating and drinking, which
is believing, as it is said, <hi>v.</hi> 64.</p>
            <p>You see, Madam, what it is
not to make use of your own
reason, but to enslave it to the
Faith of a Church, which loves
to act in the Dark, and would
have her Children <hi>Colliers,</hi> and
believe what the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44977:37"/>
and know little more
than the great Mystery of an
<hi>Ave Maria,</hi> or a Rosary.</p>
            <p>Time was, when you were
pleased to tell our Ministers
that though you were gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
yet you had liberty not to pray
to Saints, nor to fall down
before Images, for that was
not thought necessary by the
Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> which only
recommends praying to Saints,
and Veneration of Relicks, and
Images, as a thing useful, and
which men have received
much benefit by. And indeed
I remember, I was told, you
thought, that praying to Saints
was a kind of Idolatry, and
therfore were glad they would
excuse you from that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44977:38"/>
but since, I hear, that
you are grown as devout a
Worshipper of Saints, and
peculiarly of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and do prostrate your self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, as much as the most
tractable Papist in the World.
I confefs, I did smell a Rat at
first, when your Priests assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, that Invocation of
Saints was not a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
but recommended as
useful, and was then confident
that before a year came to
an end, for all these soft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and dispensations
with your omission of this
worship, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to that worship,
which then you thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
My prophecy is come
to pass, and the Pill, which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44977:38"/>
seemed very bitter at first,
is swallowed, and become
sweeter than hony, and look'd
upon as an excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
And this, I must needs
say, is more than you could
have in our Church. But
this is our Comfort, that the
more ingenuous men of the
Church of <hi>ROME</hi> confess,
that this praying to Saints or
Angels was not heard of, or
used in the Christian Church,
for the first three hundred
years after Christ: and if the
Christian Church, for the first
300 years, did not think it use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at all, it is a strange dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
from their principles,
to press it now as useful:
Certainly, if GOD had
thought this invocation so
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44977:39"/>
useful, as your Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
it is., He would not
have so peremtorily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Call upon me in the
day of trouble; I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.
Psalm.</hi> 50. 15. and it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
the Apostles, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
so many useful things
of far less concern, would not
have left us in the dark as to
the mighty usefullness of this
invocation; especially, when
they had occasion to mention
the spirits of men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and did so often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with Angels. The
Angel, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 8. 9. thought
it a very useless thing, and
would not admit of so much
as a Religious prostration
of the Evangelist before him,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44977:39"/>
because it look'd like Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and robbing GOD of
his due.</p>
            <p>But since your Church in
this adoration takes pattern
so much by the Courts of
Princes, give me leave to
suggest to you, how you
think, a Soveraign Prince
would take it, if a Subject
should give any of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the title of Majesty,
or any other title, which
properly belongs to him.
There are few titles, that
GOD hath, and inspired
men have given to him, but
you give them to the Blessed
Virgin, and though, when
you are charg'd with it, you
fall to distinctions, and turn,
and wind your selves to get
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44977:40"/>
out, yet that shews only a
bad cause, because it requires
so much artifice and cunning
to defend it: but, alas! it
must be Children, that are
perswaded and coaxed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> onely counts it use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not necessary, when it is
well known, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pray to Saints more than
to GOD (which in the
Scripture phrase is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the creature more than
the Creator) and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave that person, that
goes over to them, till they
have brought him to that
Worship of Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>Its pretty to hear these
Men talk, that it is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44977:40"/>
as useful, when
the Bishops and Preachers of
that: Church are injoyned, and
take their oath upon't, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this invocation to the
People, as profitable; and the
People are obliged to hearken
to their Priests in all things; so
that though a Man at first may
think this Invocation not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
upon the account of
its being onely useful, yet from
that other obligation he hath,
to obey the Priest in all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, it becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
But from this scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
we are delivered, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
by the Confession of
Faith, which the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme
doth prescribe, for
there it is, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
useful, but that we ought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44977:41"/>
to pray unto Saints, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
should any man live
in that Communion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, he would soon be
looked upon as prophane,
and but a half Convert to
their Church; they would
soon let him know their
displeasure, and either fright
or flatter him into confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
And is this the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Madam, which Christ
and his Apostles have injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the World? Are not
you afraid of doing things,
that do so nearly border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
robbing God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory? Idolatry
is a frightful word, and you
do not love to hear it, and
therefore I will trouble you
with it as little as I can. But
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44977:41"/>
when God hath commanded
you to come to him directly,
without mentioning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
how dares your Church
of her own head, bring in a
Worship so dangerous? who
should prescribe the way how
God is to be worshipped, but
God himself? And if God
requires you to address your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him without any other
Mediator, but Christ Jesus,
Have not you just reason to
be afraid, that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
your Prayers, which are
addiressed to Saints, as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators,
contrary to his order
and injunction? What Kings
suffer here on Earth, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Subjects address
themselves by their Servants
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44977:42"/>
to them, can be no example
here, for God, as he intends
not to regulate his Court by
the Court of Princes, so we
know it is against his Order,
to go to his Servants, when
we are commanded to come
directly to him, and it is such
a voluntary humility as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
us of our reward, as
the Apostles expresly tells us.
<hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 18. God knew well
enough if men addressed
themselves to his Servants, to
have access to him, something
of the Worship due to him
would stick by the way, and
rest upon his Servants to his
dishonour and disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
nothing of this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
address. Its true we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44977:42"/>
our neighbours here on
Earth to pray for us, but for
that we have a command; for
the invocation of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
we have none, and in
vain do they worship me
(saith God) teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
the Commandements of
men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9. But besides,
when you desire your living
Neighbours to pray for you,
I hope you do not fall down
upon your knees to them,
nor use the same zeal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to them, as you do to
God, and for whole hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as you do to Saints
departed. But why will you
blind your self in a thing
which your own practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
you in, you know
you do not onely pray to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44977:43"/>
Saints departed to pray for
you, but you do many times,
without making any mention
of their Prayers for you, beg
of them, with the same reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and prostrations you
use to God, to deliver you
from all evil, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you beg the same Blessings
of them you beg of God.
And it is but a weak excuse
to say, that you intend by
those Prayers nothing else,
but that by their intercession
they may get those blessings
for you, for you go contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the nature of things,
and whereas words ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are interpreters of the mind,
you make your minds inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of your words and
actions, which is a strange
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44977:43"/>
evasion, and if such a thing be
intended, why do you lay a
snare before the Common
sort of People? who, being
ordered to pray to Saints for
such and such blessings, know
nothing to the contrary, but
that they are able to dispense
those Blessings to them, and
thus commit Idollatry by your
willful connivance, whose
blood will certainly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at your Churchmens
hands one day. Examine but
your Prayers to the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> in your own Manuals,
when you have prayed to
her, and begged of her all
that you can pray of GOD,
you add a word or two of
her intercession, which in
good truth is nothing but a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44977:44"/>
blind, that you may not be
said to commit down right
Idolatry. You know those
Prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
which in the Latine, and I think
in the English Manual too, are
ordered to be said to the Virgin
Morning and Evening, the one,
<hi>O my Lady, Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my self, my Soul and Body
to thy blessed care and singular
custody, and to the bosome of thy
mercy this day, and every day,
and in the hour of my going
out of the World. All my
hope, and all my comfort, all
my afflictions and miseries,
my life, my end I commit
unto thee</hi> (speak seriously
what can you say more to
GOD) <hi>that by thy most
holy Intercession, and by thy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44977:44"/>
merits, all my words and
actions may be directed and
disposed according to thine,
and thy Sons Will, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where it's worth noting,
that first you do put as much
trust in the Virgin as you do
in GOD, and then afterwards,
to make these harsh expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
softer, you desire her to
interceed for you, that your
works may be directed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Christs Will, nay
and her own, as if she were a
Law giver too? Then follows
<hi>Maria Mater Gratiae &amp;c. O
Mary, Mother of Grace, Mother
of Mercy, Protect us from the
Enemy, and receive us in the
hour of Death,</hi> which St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> thought was fitter to
be said to Christ, when he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44977:45"/>
Cryed, Lord <hi>Jesu receive my
Spirit.</hi> Then followes the
Evening Prayer to the Virgin
Mary. <hi>O Mary, Mother</hi> of
GOD, and gratious Virgin,
the true Comforter of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Creatures that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee (this Epithete by the
way the Scripture gives to
the Holy Ghost) by that great
joy whereby thou wast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
when thou didst know
that Jesus Christ was risen
the third day from the Dead
impassible, be thou the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of my Soul, and by
the same, who is thine and
GODS only Son in the last
day, when with body and
Soul I shall rise again, and
give an account of all my
actions, do thou Vouchsafe to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44977:45"/>
help me, that I may escape the
Sentence of perpetual Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by thee Pious Mother
and Virgin, and may come
happily with all the Elect
of GOD to Eternal joyes,
<hi>Amen.</hi> Then follows, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy protection we flee,
Holy Mother of GOD,
despise not our prayer in
our necessities, but deliver
us from all dangers alwayes,
O glorious and blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gln.
Not to mention any
more prayers of this nature,
whereof there is a vast number.</p>
            <p>If GOD be a GOD
jealous of his Glory, how
can he like and approve of
such doings? It's true the
Honour done to his Servants
is done to him, but then it must
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44977:46"/>
be such Honour, as they are
capable to receive; so to
Honour them, as to give them
the Epithetes and titles
which the Scripture gives to
none but GOD, so to
Honour them, as to use in
your prayers to them the same
outward prostrations, that
you use to GOD, when you
pray to him, so to Honour
them, as to spend more time
in your addresses to them
than you do in supplications
to GOD, as is evident from
your Rosary; so to Honour
them, as to say more prayers
to them than to Christ, so to
Honour them, as to joyn
their merits with Christs
merits: This is an Honour
which, I believe, will oblige
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44977:46"/>
GOD to say one day, who
hath required these things
at your hands? And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Worship of the true
GOD is that Veneration
you express to the Images and
Pictures of Saints, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks?
How unlike that plain
and Simple Worship which
the Gospel enjoynes.? One
would think it should a little
startle you, to see, that your
Church is afraid to let the
second Commandement be
known to the people, you
know they leave it out in their
Primmers and Catechismes, or
if they mention it, they do
so mince it, that one sees plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are afraid the People
should see the contrariety of
the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Worship to the express
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44977:47"/>
word of GOD. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Reformation,
the very sight of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
made people run
away from the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> as much as any thing;
indeed to consider the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
termes GOD uses there,
<hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self
any graven Image, &amp;c.</hi> Thou
shalt not only not <hi>Worship
them</hi> but <hi>not so much as fall
down before them,</hi> would
make a person, that is not
taken more with the Golden
Legends, than with Scripture,
afraid of prostrations before
Images, upon the account of
devotion; it is not all your
plea, that you do not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
your worship on the
Image, but on the person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44977:47"/>
by the Image, that
will excuse you at the great
tribunal, for not to mention,
that in the same manner the
Heathen used to defend their
grossest Idolatry, and that
you are forced to borrow
their very Arguments, your
own Authors do confesse,
that the common people
are apt to pay adoration,
and do pay adoration to the
Images themselves, and
why will you lay such a
Stumbling block before the
people?</p>
            <p>Much might be said of the
adoration you pay to the
consecrated Hoste; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that the worship you
give to it, is the same wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
you give to God; What
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44977:48"/>
if that Wafer should not be
turned into the Body and
Blood of Christ? what if it
should remain as very a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
as it was before conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration?
what if it should
not be God, as you have all
the demonstration that sense
or reason can give you, that
it is not changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
substance? what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Idolatry would this
be? Ay, but we believe it
to be GOD; why, Madam,
doth your belief, that such
a thing is God, or Christ,
excuse you from Idolatry?
should you believe a Stone
to be GOD, and adore it,
might not you justly be
charged with Idolatry? you
look upon the Heathens as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44977:48"/>
Idolaters, because they adore
the Sun; Ay, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Sun to be God,
and how then, according to
your plea, can they be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters?
If there be such a
Transubstantiation in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
as you fancy, and
an Adoration of the Hoste so
very necessary, what's the
reason, the Apostles of our
Lord, that saw Christ before
their eyes, (only could not
believe that there were two
Christs, one sitting at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the other reached out to
them;) What's the reason, I
say, that they sate still and
paid no Adoration to the
Bread, which according to
you was Transubstantiated
into Christ? If they did not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44977:49"/>
adore it, what a presumption
is it in you to give the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Worship to the consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bread upon a pretence,
that that bread is God under
the accidents of Bread? But
of this I have said enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and could you but find
time to read what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have written upon this
subject, it could be nothing
but hardness of heart, and
resolution to be blind, could
keep you in a Church, that
fills your head with Doctrines,
contrary to the nature of a
Sacrament, contrary to all
that <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
nay and all sound <hi>Philosophers</hi>
have said.</p>
            <p>I will not say any thing
here of your strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44977:49"/>
Sacrifice of the Mass,
a thing unheard of in the
purer Ages of Christianity,
and which the Scripture is
so great a stranger to, that one
would wonder how Mankind
came to light upon the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Nor of your Doctrine
of Merits, because, I find your
Priests have two strings to
their Bow, and tell the
people one thing, and their
adversaries, when they dispute
with them, another; affirme
and deny it as they see occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and necessity requires On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyone
thing I must needs take
notice of before I take my
leave, and that is the Gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Argument, that some of
your Gentlemen boast of,
and which strikes all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44977:50"/>
dead at the first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. If there be any
thing true, this must be true,
that there is a GOD, if there
be a GOD, there must be a
true Religion, if there be a
true Religion, there must be
a true revealed Religion, if
there be a true revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon,
the Christian Religion
must be that true revealed
Religion, and if the Christian
Religion be true, then the
Religion of the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> must be true, for
the Argument, that proves the
Christian Religion to be true
proves the Religion of the
Church of <hi>ROME</hi> to be true,
which is this, Either the
Christian Religion was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44977:50"/>
without miracles or
by miracles, if by miracles
then it must be divine, if
without miracles, then it is the
greatest miracle, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
so contrary to flesh
and blood, should prevail with
sensual men. The same, say
they, is true of the Religion
of the Church of <hi>ROME.</hi>
For if it be propagated by
Miracles, it must be divine,
if without Miracles, it must
be so much more, because
it prescribes things contrary
to Flesh and blood, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
Austerities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
thousands of People do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. I will not make my
self merry here in a thing so
serious, else I could have told
you, that I have hard of an
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44977:51"/>
Argument, when I was at
School, somewhat like this,
He that drinks well, sleeps
well, he that sleeps well, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no Sin, He that commits
no Sin will be saved; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that drinks well will
be saved. But I forbear;
And as to the aforesaid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby one of your
Priests, that hath printed it,
thinks to end all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
I will say no more
but this. First, that as there
is no Christian, but must
readily confess, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
Christ and his Apostles
wrought, were a Confirmation
of the Divinity of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
so there is no man of
any brains, can admit of the
other part of the <hi>dilemma</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:44977:51"/>
as Universally true, that a
Religion that goes against
Flesh and blood, if propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without Miracles, must
therefore be necessarily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> that so far
as the Religion of the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> agrees with the
truly Christian Religion, so
far it is undoubtedly true,
and it will naturally follow,
that if the Christian Religion
be true, the Religion of the
Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> so far as
it agrees with the Christian
Religion, must needs be true.
And the same may be said of
the Protestant Religion, but
that the Roman Religion
must therefore be true, where
it goes away and differs from
the truly Christian Religion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44977:52"/>
revealed to us in the Gospel,
is a consequence, which none
but Children can approve of.
Thirdly with this Argument,
a man might prove the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of almost any Religion in
the World. He that is no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to History, must needs
know, what severities, what
austerities of life the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
or the Heathen <hi>Friers</hi>
in the <hi>Indies</hi> do both pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe,
and practise, and what
Proselites they make, and how
full the Kingdom of the great
<hi>Mogol</hi> is of them, how some
Wallow in ashes day and
night, how others go charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with heavy Iron Chaines
all their dayes, how others
stand upright upon their
Leggs for whole weekes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44977:52"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How in <hi>Japan</hi>
and other places of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
the Priests perswade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to fast themselves to death,
to go long Pilgrimages, to
give all they have to the
Priests, to throw themselves
down from steep rocks, and
break their necks, and all to
arrive the sooner to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of another World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I think there cannot be things<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
contrary to flesh and
blood, than these, and yet we
see these Doctrines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogated
daily without any
force of Armes, only by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and perswasion, to be
sure without any Miracle,
but, I hope, that doth not
prove their Religion to be
divine. It's a Dictate of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44977:53"/>
light of Nature, that the way
to Heaven is strait, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
people, that are religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined, are easily won o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to those men whom they
see exercise such severities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Madam, when
all is done, what the true
Church is, must be tryed by
the Writings of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and Apostles. We see,
that even in the Apostles
dayes, corruptions crept into
the Church, Witness the
Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi>
and <hi>Colosse,</hi> &amp;c. and the
simplicity of the Gospel began
even then to be perverted
and mingled with idle and
foolish opinions and practises,
and therefore we must needs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44977:53"/>
think, that after the Apostles,
decease, the Church of Christ
was subject to the same fate,
so that if there be any stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
or touch stone left, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the truth and sincerity of
a Church can be tried (and
we must needs think so well
of GODS providence that he
would not leave his Church
without some rule to rectifie
their Errors by, in case she
should be infected with any)
it must be the Primitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and that Church, as I
said before, which teaches
things, that approach nearest
to that primitive institution,
must be the true Church.</p>
            <p>And, Madam, do but once
more for your Souls sake, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44977:54"/>
for your Salvations sake,
compare the Doctrines and
practises of the Church of
<hi>ROME,</hi> with the Doctrines
and practises of the Gospel,
the Fountain of Christianity,
and try whether you can find
there, the Doctrines of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
under one kind,</hi> of
<hi>publick prayers in a tongue
unknown to the people,</hi> of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
of <hi>the Mass,</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantation,</hi>
of <hi>the Church
of Rome's</hi> supremacy <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
of <hi>Worshipping and
adoring the Virgin Mary, and
praying to Saints,</hi> of <hi>Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Relicks and Images,</hi> of
<hi>adoration of the Hoste, &amp;c.</hi>
Do not force any places of
Scripture, and try whether
you can make sense of any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44977:54"/>
of these Doctrines by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
View the Stream of the
Gospel, and search whether
there be any thing like these
Doctrines in it? why will you
make your reason a Slave to
your Priests magisterial Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences?
How can you answer
it to GOD, that you did not
improve your reason more?
What have you your reason
for, but to judge what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the Word of
GOD, and what is not? Is
not this acting like a Creature
void of reason, to be guided
altogether by what a few
blind guides say to you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enquiring at <hi>the Law and
Testimony,</hi> whether things are
so as they say or no? Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
stnpidity! I stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44977:55"/>
at it. It is not all the
seeming Holiness of those
Priests you converse withal,
that make the Church you
are in, a true Church. There
is no Sect in the World, but
when they are under a Cloud,
necessity and the discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they are under, and their
desire to make Proselytes,
makes them outwardly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.
There may be, and
no doubt are Zealous and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
pious men in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
in the World, but
that doth not make every
Religion true, and divine.
An outward shew of Piety is
the only way of propagating
any Religion. The Devil
himself could not propagate
Heathenisme and Idolatry, but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44977:55"/>
by the pretened Zeal, and
Piety, and Abstinence, and
Mortification of <hi>Apollonius
Tyaneus,</hi> who yet by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the whole Christian
world, was no better then a
Wizard and Conjurer; I make
no application to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Priest in the Church of
<hi>ROME;</hi> I do not deny, but
men may be in great Errors,
and be very Zealous for their
errours, and seemingly very
pious in their Zeal, and when
their Errors are not very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and destroy not the true
Worship of GOD, for ought
I know, they may find mercy
in the day of our Lord. I
grant there is a great shew of
outward Piety in the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> very dazeling and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44977:56"/>
very moving, but the great
danger lyes here, that the
Worship they give to GOD
with one hand, they strike and
pull down with the other: I
know too well the practise of
their Churches, and a Heathen
that should come into their
Temples beyond Sea, would
verily believe, that they
Worship a Multiplicity of
Gods as well as he, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their pretentions may be
to the contrary; It is not
what people say, so much as
what they do, that GOD
takes notice of, and though
you should Ten Thousand
times protest, that you Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and adore GOD alone,
yet while GOD sees you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the Virgin Mary, with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44977:56"/>
as great Zeal and reverence,
as you do him, pray to her
oftener then you do to him,
make as many bowes to her,
and other Saints, as you do
to him, and other things of
that nature, how can he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you? Religion is a thing
that will not bear jests and
Hypocrisy, GOD will not be
put off with contradictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
speeches and Practises.</p>
            <p>Madam, I do from my heart
Pitty you, and as it might be
the weakness of your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that might lead you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Erroneous Church, so I
beseech you, for Christs sake,
to return to the Church,
you have rashly left, where
you cannot run a hazard
if you will but follow the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44977:57"/>
plain Doctrines of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
besides which, we preach
nothing, and enjoyn nothing
as necessary to Salvation.
Should these entreaties and
beseechings be alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you in the last day, as
things which you have, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to reason, refused and
slighted, how dreadful would
your condition be? I have
discharged my Duty, and
given you warning, I would
not have your Guilt lye at
my Door, and therefore
have let you know my real
thoughts and Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your condition,
and the Church you are in.
The Great GOD of Heaven
open your eyes, that you
may see and fear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:44977:57"/>
Time was when you would
have believed us as much as
you do now the Priests of
the Church of <hi>ROME.</hi> It's
strange, that now they should
speak nothing but truths,
and we nothing but falshood.
Do you think, we do not
understand the Scriptures,
and Fathers, and Antiquity,
as well as they? And can we
all be so besotted with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and passion that none of
us should yied to the dictates
of their Church, if we could
prevail with our sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that the things
wherein they differ from us
were agreeable to the Gospel?
sure we have a great many
men among us that are great
Lovers of Peace, and would
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44977:58"/>
be glad that the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world were agreed, and
would these men stand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that union, if it could
be done with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Certainly we have men
as learned among us, as ever
the Sun did shine upon, nay
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi> hath
at this day few men to equal
ours for Learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And would all our
Learned men be so stubborne
and obstinate, as not to agree
with the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
if they did not see plainly,
that <hi>there is Death in that
Pot,</hi> and that the Errours in
that Church cannot be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to without hazarding
the welfare of their Souls? I
will but use your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44977:58"/>
when you went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
and were perswaded by the
earnestness of her Priests to
yeild to their reasonings, what
pleasure can we take in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
your Damnation?
What can be our interest in
deceiving you? You used that
Argument on their side, why
will you not use it on our
side, Judge you, whither we,
that have the Gospel on our
side for what we teach, are
not in a safer way, than that
Church, which for all the
new Doctrines they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Old Creedes, are
forced to run to the broken
Cisterns of Tradition, and
I know not what Fathers,
whose writings they know
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44977:59"/>
not whether they be genuine
or no? As you are now,
you live in willful opposition
to the Doctrine and Precepts
of the Gospel, And O Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth say
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8. That the
<hi>Lord Jesus will ere long come
down from Heaven with all his
Holy Angels to take Vengeance
on those who have disobeyed
the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</hi> Once more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I charge you before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
GOD, and our Lord
Jesus Christ, to repent of your
Errours, and to return to the
bosome of that Church,
in which you received
your life, and being, and the
Principles of Religion and
Christianity. But if all this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44977:59"/>
seem to you no more but
Bugbears, I have delivered
my own Soul, and should
be sorry that this discourse
should stand as a Witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you in the Last day,
which GOD knows was
only intended as a motive
to draw you back to that
Fold from which you have
Wandered and gone astray.</p>

            <p>AS in the publishing of this
Letter I had no other
design, but to prevent the
fall of others into the like
dangers, so I have particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insisted on those motives,
which have of late tempted
some persons to go over to
the Roman Church, and
though I have represented
these motives as yours, yet
in this I have been so far
from doing any thing against
the laws of private discourse,
or friendship, or acquaintance,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44977:60"/>
that I have only touch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the common stumbling-blocks,
which make unwary
people joyne themselves to
that Church; blocks, which
might easily be removed, if
men or Women would but
give themselves leave to
think, and would prefer
the solid dictates of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
before the suggestions of
their soft, and sickly passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
One thing I had almost
forgot, and which indeed is
the great bug-bear, whereby
your Church-men fright their
people from running over
to us, and that is, that our
Church began but about
an hundred and fifty years
ago, that <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Zwinglius</hi> were the Authors
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44977:61"/>
of it, and that we had no
Church before; pittiful shifts
indeed to keep people from
seeing the Sun at noon; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our Religion did but
begin then, why, must peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be alwayes in an Errour?
must they never reform when
they have done amiss? if
there were Monstrous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>
which the aforesaid persons
saw would be the death
of Christianity, and which
they could not subscribe to
without debauching their
reason, or wronging both their
own and other mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
was it not rational,
they should protest against
such things, to give their
fellow Christians warning?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44977:61"/>
when the House is on fire,
would you have no body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
to alarm the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to look to themselves?
Did they see so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men ready to be
drown'd, and would you
have had them hold their
tongues, and barbarously
suffered them all to be
drown'd? Did they see the
Christian Religion like to be
swallowed up by darkness
and Ignorance, and was it
not time to rouze the slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
world? But however,
that these men were the first
broachers of our Religion,
is Notoriously false; First,
because long before them,
there were men that lived in
the External communion of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44977:62"/>
the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> but
dislik'd the Errours, as they
crept in, and grew dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and though they were
overaw'd and silenc'd many
times by the higher powers
of the Roman Court, yet
they both detested those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and as they had
opportunity, protested against
them, as were an easy matter
to prove from age to age,
if it had not been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
over and over by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of our Church, so that
though these men, that
lived long before <hi>Luther,</hi> and
whom GOD still rais'd to
vindicate his truth as it grew
more, and more polluted,
were not call'd Protestants
by the People, yet in effect
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44977:62"/>
they were so, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there were Protestants
many years before <hi>Luther</hi>
and <hi>Zwinglius;</hi> And though
they were not suffered by the
Ignorant, and imperious
Ecclestiastical powers to meet
and assemble themselves in
publick, yet they made a
Church, as much as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Holy <hi>Athanasius</hi>
did, when the whole world
was turned <hi>Arrian,</hi> as much
as <hi>Elijah,</hi> and those seven
thousand, the Oracle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
made a Church, when
the Whole Country was
over run with Idolaters.
These seven thousand we
read lay hid, and durst not
appear in publick, being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
by the Idolatrous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44977:63"/>
powers, that sat at the stern,
and thought there was no
good fishing but in troubled
waters. And indeed in this
manner our Church was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
long before <hi>Luther,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the greater multitude
of the followers of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Roman Church, as a
hand-ful of wheat lies scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
in a bushel of Chaff,
and though it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Pomp and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
yet that external splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
is not essential to the
truth of a Church, your
own men may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the aforementioned
examples.</p>
            <p>Secondly; if your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
speak strictly of the
Religion, which we profess
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44977:63"/>
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
they are under a mistake,
when they make <hi>Luther</hi> or
<hi>Zwinglius</hi> the Authors of it,
for our Reformation began
some time after, and was
both begun, and carried on
with great deliberation and
consideration under <hi>Edward</hi>
the 6. by publick authority,
whose proper province it is
to take notice of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
in a Kingdom or Comm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wealth, whether it be in
Church or State, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and mend it. It's no
great matter, when a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
begins, so the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
be but just; and if
such a Reformation had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
but yesterday, that
would not have made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44977:64"/>
and that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was just and necessary
hath been prov'd by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
beyond all reasonable
contradiction, and how could
it but be just, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of the Church of <hi>ROME</hi>
control'd the Word of the
Living GOD, and vyed
with the Oracles of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
How and when the
several Errours crept into
that Church, is not Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to determine, it's enough
we found them there, and
it was GODS mercy not
to give all the learned men
of that age over to beleive
a lye. But it's pretty to hear
your Church-men talk of the
novelty of our Religion,
when it is evident to all the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44977:64"/>
understanding world, that
our first Reformers began no
new Religion, but desired
only to keep to the Old.
All their endeavour was to
keep to the Religion of the
Bible, and to cut off all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
and things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to Salvation, and was
there any hurt in that? They
saw, that many things then
in use in the Church of <hi>ROME</hi>
were diametrally opposite to
the Doctrines and practises of
the Primitive Church, and
they justly thought it their
duty to reduce the Church to
the antient pattern; the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Clergy of the Roman
Church would not yield to
it, but would have all their
new fangles, and all their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44977:65"/>
additions to the Antient
Symbols received as articles of
Faith, though all perish'd,
and the coat of Christ were
rent into a thousand pieces;
the more humble, and more
moderate of the Clergy, saw
the pride and insolence of
the other, and trembled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
thus we and they parted, we
kept to the old Religion,
and your men chose the new,
and much good it may do
you with it, and pray Judge
by this, which is the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Church, we or they?
we that would have healed
<hi>Israel,</hi> or they that would
not be healed; so that it is
not our Religion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
so lately as 150 years
ago, about <hi>Luthers</hi> time, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44977:65"/>
it's yours that commenced
then; for you then embraced
the new additions to the
antient Catholick creeds with
greater greadiness, and were
resolv'd to maintain that by
bravado's, which you were
not able to defend with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
Its a very ordinary
thing for people, who once
incline to the Communion of
the Roman Church to demand
of us, before they go over,
whither a person may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that Church. The
Charity and moderation our
Divines usually express in
their answer to this query,
I am sensible hath done our
Church some harm, whereas
the Roman Priests, being
bold in their uncharitabl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44977:66"/>
and damning all that
are out of their communion,
make some weak people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they must be in
the right, because they are
more daring in their asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations.
We have far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reason to be peremtory
in excluding the members of
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi> from
Salvation, than they have to
exclude us, for if that Church
be guilty of Idolatry (as I
see, your Divines find it a
very hard task to answer the
Arguments of our Learned
men, that prove it) Those
hat are guilty of this crime
may soon be resolved by the
Apostle what their lot is
like to be in another world;
for <hi>No Idolater,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:44977:66"/>
meaning one that lives, and
dies so, <hi>shall inherit the
Kingdom of God. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9
yet we are modest, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the principles of that
Church may lead men to, we
hope, there may be many in
that Church, that either,
while they live in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of that Church, have
an aversion from the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and Idolatrous practices
of it, or sometimes before
they die do heartily repent
of the absurd, and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrines, and worship,
they have too long asserted,
and complied with, and of
such we cannot but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a very favourable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and indeed I could
name you some very famous
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44977:67"/>
men both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
who, though they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Communion of
that Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> have not
joyn'd themselves to any
particular publick Protestant
Church, yet have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of such things in the
Roman Church, as manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obstruct mens Salvation,
and though like <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
they have not dared openly
to avow their dislike of such
Errous, for fear of danger,
yet in their hearts they have
abhorr'd them, and declared
so much to their Friends, and
intimate acquaintance. And
though their seeming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with a Church so
Erroneous, cannot be totally
excused, because it looks
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44977:67"/>
like a tacite approbation of
her Errours, yet since we
read of <hi>Joseph,</hi> that he was
a Disciple of Christ secretly,
and notwithstanding his not
confessing Christ publickly,
accepted of GOD, we
hope such mens continuing
in the external communion of
the Roman Church is not a
willful Errour, but rather
a pardonable infirmity, a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morousness
which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of malice in it, and
therefore will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from Salvation.
We know not what mercy
GOD may shew to many
poor people in that Church,
who are invincibly Ignorant,
and never saw a Bible, from
whence they might rectify
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44977:68"/>
their mistakes, and do live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
in this present world;
but we must withal confess,
that the Servant, who hath
known his Masters will, and
hath not done it, shall be
beaten with many stripes,
and whether those that have
been enlightened in our
Church, and have tasted the
good Word of GOD, and
cannot but see our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Gospel, and
after all this embrace the
Errors of the Roman Church,
whether these will be excus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at the last day, we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doubt of; To live in
great Errours is to live in
Sin, but where that living
in Errours is joyn'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of great light, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44977:68"/>
knowledge, there the Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all crimson, which
was but of a faint red be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
And if this be the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Christs Friends to
do whatsoever he commands
us, then the inference is very
easy, that those cannot be
Christ's Friends, nor reign
with him in Heaven, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
leave undone, what
they know he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and set up a new Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which he hath no where
commanded: Madam, had you
never seen such a thing as
the Scriptnre, your going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to that Church might have
deserved some apollogy, but
when you were surrounded
with the beams of that light
which shines in darkness,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44977:69"/>
as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the word,
with all those rayes about you,
to shut your eyes, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
to venture upon a
Church, which enjoines men
to live against some of Gods
laws, as against <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5, 6.
and <hi>Matth. 26. 27. &amp;c.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
obliges them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for GODS displeasure,
this, I confess, is an action,
which, as it favours of great
willfulness, so I question, if
you dye in't without serious
repentance, whether the joys
you hope for, will ever fall
to your share. If your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do mean honestly, and
do truly aim at the peace of
Christendom, and in good
earnest design the Union of
of men that profess the name
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44977:69"/>
of Christ, why will not they
part with those Doctrines that
are so great an offence, not
only to all Protestants, but
to Jews and Mahometans too?
if that worshipping of Saints
and Images be not necessary,
but only useful, why will not
they quit that Worship,
which by their own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is needless, especially
when they might do so much
good by it; if the Cup was
formerly given to the Laity,
why will not they to effect
the aforesaid Union restore it
to the Laity? If the substance
of the Sacrament, and the
comfort arising from it may
remaine entire, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
men to beleive a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
or Adoration
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44977:70"/>
of the consecrated Wafer,
why will not they for peace
sake lay aside such Doctrines,
which neither themselves,
nor any creature understands?
If Heaven and Hell are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
motives to a Holy life,
why will not they for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake renounce their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of purgatory, which by
their own confession hath no
ground in Scripture?</p>
            <p>Madam, I have that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
opinion of you, that
if you had but taken a view
of the Worship of the Church
of <hi>ROME,</hi> as it is practic'd
beyond Sea in places, where
there is no fear of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from any Hereticks,
where they may freely and
securely act according to their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44977:70"/>
principles, had you seen the
mode of Worshipping the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>ROME,</hi> or
in <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> the sight
of it would have certainly
discourag'd you from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
that Religion, which
now you seem to be mainly
delighted with, for indeed
the Religion of the Church
of <hi>ROME</hi> at this time, if a
man were to guess from that,
which hath the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Veneration, is little
else, then a Worship of the
Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The very
beggers beyond-Sea in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of alms, beg more for
the Virgin <hi>Marie's</hi> sake, then
for Christ's sake. This, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I know to be true, who
am no stranger to forreign
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44977:71"/>
parts, and I will assure you,
that in those Cities or Towns,
where both Papists, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Religion, you
shall live Twenty years in a
Town, before you hear that
any Protestant is turned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
(so few charms are there
in the Exercise of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
beyond Sea) but you
shall not be above a year or
two in such a Town, before
you hear that several Papists
are turn'd Protestants (such
a force hath truth;) The
Religion of the Church of
<hi>ROME,</hi> as it is practis'd in
<hi>England,</hi> lookes harmless.
Now and then upon some
great festival they shew you
a Picture of the Virgin Mary,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44977:71"/>
or of some other Saint, and
the honest Priest qualifies
every Doctrine, makes the
Errours soft, and plausible,
and they dare not, living in
a Protestant Country, serve
the Host of Heaven, I mean
Saints and Angels with all
their appertenances as they
do in places, where there are
no Protestants to watch them.</p>
            <p>Here their Religion seems
to be without a sting, and is
clad in the fleece of Sheep,
but if you could but make
a Voyage into <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi>
I doubt not but you would
see the Venome of it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it, and the only way
not to be of the Church of
<hi>ROME</hi> would be to go to
<hi>ROME,</hi> provided you do
not go without your Bible.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44977:72"/>
In good truth that Church
hath turn'd Christianity into
a meer outward pomp and
splendor, which ravishes the
eye, but can never content
a mans reason. The gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Gold in their Temples,
the curious Images of Saints
and Angels, the numerons
and Stately Altars, the mighty
Silver Statues, the rich, and
glorious vestments you see up
and down in their Churches,
strike the senses into a kind
of ectasie, and it must be sense
only, for a considerate mind,
that searches the inside of
things as well as the outside,
cannot be so easily gull'd and
deceiv'd; and this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pomp they make not
the least sign of the truth
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44977:72"/>
of their Church, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
that if this be a good
signe, the Idolatrous people in
<hi>Japan,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> whose
Temples are infinitely more
shining, and glorious, will
have a better Title to the true
Church than they; I must
confess, that in policy, and
worldly craft, and cunning
the Church of <hi>ROME</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
ours, for they have not
only turn'd the Spiritual
Worship of the Gospel, into
a sensual service, into outward
Religious formalities, a thing
strangely pleasing to flesh and
blood, but they have shooes
that will fit all sorts of feet,
great and small, and have
remedies for all distempers,
and you may go to Heaven
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44977:73"/>
in that Church either through
the straight way, or through
the broad, which you please,
they can fit the Melancholly
person, and the Jovial, they
have Monasteries, and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,
and severities to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the one, and know
how to allow greater liberty
to the other; they can either
send a man to happiness
through a tedious task
of mortification, if he likes
that method best, or
help him thither by a quicker
dispatch, by confession, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and absolution upon
a death bed, when the man can
hold Sin and the world no
longer: Live, or die, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do amiss in that Church,
for living you may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44977:73"/>
and after Death you
may be pray'd out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
sooner or later, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as you will spend
mony upon Masses, for gold
doth strangely quicken these
supplications.</p>
            <p>Such a Church, Madam, you
have espoused, and divorced
your self from one that prefers
the Wisdom of GOD, and
of the Gospel before the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the flesh, and glories
in dealing plainly and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
with all men, that keeps
close to the Scriptures, and
yet is not against those Pious
customes of antiquity, which
are not contradictory to the
Scriptures, that generously
maintains the prerogative
of GOD, and gives no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44977:74"/>
Honour to Saints and
Angels, but what may consist
with the glory of her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
that hath made no new
Articles of Faith, but keeps
to the old, and thinks it
Rebellion against GOD, to
enjoyn things as necessary
to Salvation, which GOD
never made so; that urges
the strictest life, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
nothing, but what may
promote true piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
that hath no more
Ceremonies, but what are
decent, and labours to free
Religion at once from sloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and superstition, that
secures the Right of Soveraign
Princes, and Teaches her
Children to live like good
subjects and good Christians,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44977:74"/>
and though it be her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that too many of her
pretended members live like
Enemies of Christianity, yet
that's not long of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Constitutions, but
long of the stubborness of
men, who will not be reform'd
by her Precepts; As no man
blames Christ or his Apostles,
because <hi>Judas</hi> was a Hypocrite
or because <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
their Religion, so they
betray great Ignorance and
simplicity, that for the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
impieties of many,
that profess themselves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our Assemblies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and slight our Church,
which in her principles is
most averse from all such
practices, a Church, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44977:75"/>
as, for mine own particular I
have deliberately and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditately
embraced, and
chosen, so, I hope, I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be so much forsaken of
GOD or of my reason, as
to quit it to become a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.
I have not been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a careless observer of
the several Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
dispers'd through the
world. Desire of mine own
Salvation hath made me take
particular notice, what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
there is in them, and
what affinity they have with
the Primitive Professors of
Christianity; And I must free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess upon a serious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the Scripture,
and the Fathers of the three
first Centuries after Christ,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44977:75"/>
that from my heart I think,
there is no Church this day
in all the Christian world, be
it Eastern, or Western, that
in her principles and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
bears so much of the
Image of the truly Primitive
Church, or comes so near it,
as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a
Church, which as your fore-Fathers
had courage to burn
for so I verily beleive, that
he understands not her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
designes, and excellent
rules, that dares not dy a
Martyr in her cause.</p>
