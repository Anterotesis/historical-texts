            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> foretold, who by <hi>signs and wonders</hi> did prove himself to be of God, but you thrust him from you, and <hi>resist the Holy Ghost as your Fathers did.</hi> And your refusing of <hi>Iesus</hi> is no more argument against his doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, then their refusing of <hi>Moses,</hi> was an Argument against his.

            <p>Unto this strong defence of <hi>Stephen,</hi> neither the <hi>Iudges</hi> nor his <hi>Accusers</hi> make any reply by way of Argument; but though he professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be at that time an <hi>eye Witness</hi> of the truth of Jesus his being in glory, yet in a rage and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry they <hi>cast him out of the City and stoned him.</hi> The stronger were his Arguments for the truth, the more excessive was their malice against him for it.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text are a branch of the second <hi>Argument,</hi> drawn from the testimony of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the historical narration touching him: and they contain the fruit which followed upon the <hi>noble education,</hi> which he received from the hand and care of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter; he so prospered under it, that he <hi>became learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,</hi> and was a mighty man both for

for want of culture; so is it with good wits, which being neglected do usually become more vitious then those of less hope and pregnancy. The <hi>foundations of an honorable</hi> and comfortable <hi>Age</hi> are laid in the minority of children; if the <hi>plant be</hi> not kept strait at first, the tree will be crooked incurably at the last. No doubt but <hi>David</hi> had special care of the education of <hi>Solomon</hi>; for quickness of parts, without special culture would hardly have arrived at so great a pitch of Learning, especially in a disposition, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent proved, by nature sensual enough, and therefore he maketh mention both of <hi>his Fathers and his Mothers</hi> teaching him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1.31.1.

            <p>First, All good <hi>Learning</hi> and wisdom is <hi>per se,</hi> and in its own nature <hi>desireable,</hi> as an <hi>ornament</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> to the mind, as a part of that Truth whereof God is the Author. There is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God <hi>natural</hi> in and <hi>by his works</hi>: and a knowledge <hi>supernatural</hi> by revelation out of the Word; and though this be the principal, yet the other is not to be undervalued. <hi>For the works of God are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

verity. <hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>Mathematical Learning,</hi> the knowledge of his <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation. Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> and <hi>Political Learning,</hi> the knowledge of his <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Providence. Moral</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> and <hi>Civil Learning,</hi> the knowledge of those remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> which are left in the minds of men, for their direction and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Grammatical, Rhetorical</hi> and <hi>Logical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the knowledge of the use of that <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> which God giveth us for imparting our minds, and evidencing our conceptions unto one another. So then all <hi>true Learning</hi> being a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>works of God,</hi> and of that <hi>Truth</hi> which he, who is the supreme verity, hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them, must needs be such as the <hi>works</hi> of God themselves are, <hi>honorable</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> and so <hi>per se</hi> desireable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All true Learning is desireable, for the <hi>uses</hi> whereunto it may be applied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We will consider these Uses.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of <hi>evil men,</hi> many of whom are great Schollars, and eminent for various learning.</p>
            <p>First, It serves to <hi>beautifie</hi> even them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, as learned men, great <hi>ornaments</hi> to their generation; as many <hi>harmful herbs</hi> do bear <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flowers,</hi> and are upon that account special or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to the Gardens were they grow. Goodly <hi>Statues</hi> of Gold or Silver, though <hi>dead,</hi> though <hi>hollow,</hi> and without heart or vital parts, are yet of great value, and special honor to the places where erected. Such are even <hi>prophane Learned men,</hi> in regard of their Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51940:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly, It is useful unto them to <hi>convince</hi> them of <hi>Gods glory</hi> and <hi>greatness,</hi> of his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; and so if it be not <hi>praeexerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamentum,</hi> as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> calleth it, unto the more comfortable knowledge of him out of his <hi>Word,</hi> namely, to kindle in them a desire to know more of so great a God from thence, it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them without excuse for abusing the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is by accident useful another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by honest and assiduous labours in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Learning, to keep them from the <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of divers lusts, which by a loose and an idle life would be more ready to assault them. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had been at his <hi>study,</hi> when he was on his <hi>house top,</hi> he had not been tempted unto Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It makes them thus adorned <hi>service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to humane Society.</hi> Singular use have all Ages had of the learned labors of prophane Historians, Philosophers, Poets, Orators, Mathematicians, Physitians, Artists in divers kinds. And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is a comfort to any man to live to some <hi>good purpose,</hi> and to be serviceable to his own and future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They are hereby useful to the Church of God: That God who can make use of the <hi>sins</hi> of men to do his people good by them, as of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> Brethren, to make way, by s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

hands of those that did themselves perish in the <hi>Flood,</hi> were imploied in building the <hi>Ark</hi> for <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family. It is true, very often wicked men do use their learning against God, as they do all other his good blessings. Learned wickedness is <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hermog. c.</hi> 8. <hi>Apol. c</hi> 47,</note> such learning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into Pride, Arrogance, Scorn, Atheism, Heresie, contempt of godliness, (as <hi>Philosophers</hi> are called by the Fathers, <hi>Haereticorum patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chae,</hi> but all this is <hi>accidental,</hi> and the fruit of <hi>lust.</hi>) Yet, as a <hi>malignant Planet,</hi> when in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with a <hi>good</hi> one may have a benign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; so it doth often fall out that they who are by <hi>sin enemies,</hi> may by <hi>learning</hi> be <hi>useful</hi> to the Church. The Jews are bitter enemies to Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Aug. de civ. Dei l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 46. <hi>&amp; in Psal.</hi> 58.</note> yet God hath by their care preserved the old Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures from danger of corruption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of <hi>Holy men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Though Learning be much inferior to <hi>Holiness</hi>; There are <hi>learned</hi> Devils, there cannot be <hi>holy</hi> Devils (for Holiness is the character of celestial not of infernal Angels, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2.) yet in Holy men <hi>Learning</hi> is a rare <hi>Ornament and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> as the golden Ring to the Gem which is in it. Like the marriage of an <hi>holy David</hi> to a <hi>beautiful Abigail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It enableth them to do the more <hi>service</hi> unto the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and the Truths of Religion. Every <hi>good gift sanctified</hi> is in such a way useful to the Church, as the proper nature and excellency of the gift doth admit. Sanctified <hi>Wit beautifies</hi> Religion, sanctified <hi>Reason</hi> defends
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51940:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, sanctified <hi>power</hi> protects it, sanctified <hi>Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> perswades others to the love of it. As <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent gifts</hi> of the people, did with a different va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue serve the Tabernacle, the <hi>stones of the Ephod,</hi> more pretious then the <hi>Badgers skins</hi>; so though every good man is ready to offer willingly to the service of the Church, yet great difference between the <hi>learning</hi> of a <hi>Paul,</hi> or the <hi>elequence</hi> of an <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the <hi>power</hi> of a <hi>Constantine,</hi> or the <hi>acuteness</hi> of an <hi>Austin,</hi> or the <hi>courage</hi> of an <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the ordinary qualifications of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior good men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It enableth them to procure more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor</hi> and to bring more <hi>reputation</hi> unto <hi>Religion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the greatness of parts wherein they may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise serviceable unto them, with whom it concerneth Religion to have the honour thereof preserved. God is pleased in his holy providence to make <hi>other interests,</hi> sometimes a preservative unto <hi>Religion,</hi> where it self is not immediately and <hi>per se</hi> regarded. <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> was <hi>amorous</hi> and <hi>uxorious,</hi> and that induced him to favour the Jews, whose worship he cared not for. Thus it is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in regard of holy men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of the <hi>Church</hi> and truth of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; It is useful as an <hi>Handmaid,</hi> in a way of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi> thereupon, and subserviency thereunto several ways.</p>
            <p>First, Hereby the <hi>antient Fathers</hi> of the Church were furnished to confute the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous worship</hi> of the Heathens out of their own Writers,<note place="margin">

               </note> as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Idolatry of <hi>Athens</hi> by

As <hi>David</hi> killed <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own <hi>Sword,</hi> as a tree is cut down by an Axe, the helve whereof was made out of a bough of the same tree; this course <hi>Origin, Clem. Alex. Iustin, Eusebius, Tertullian, Minutius Felix,</hi>

                  <hi>Terul. de testim Animae cap.</hi> 1.</note> and many others of the Antients have taken, as likewise to shew that many doctrines of the <hi>Scripture</hi> have been owned even by <hi>prophane Writers; One God</hi> by <hi>Plato,</hi> one <hi>first Cause</hi> by <hi>Aristotle, Divine Providence</hi> by <hi>Cicero,</hi> the <hi>last conflagration</hi> by the <hi>Stoicks, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Hereby we shame <hi>Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.14.</note> when out of prophane Writers we let them understand of the continency, justice, temperance, meekness, clemency, and other amiable moral Vertues of <hi>Heathen</hi> men, which they having abundantly more means, come so exceeding short of; and that <hi>Fabritius, Aristides, Antoninus, Epictetus,</hi> and many other vertuous Heathens shall rise up in judgement against them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Scriptures have much of <hi>Poetry, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, Mathematicks, Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they refer, many expressions in the <hi>New Testament</hi> best explicable out of the <hi>Roman Laws</hi> and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. Many passages <hi>exquisitely parallel'd</hi> in humane Authors, and receiving much light from them,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The knowledge of <hi>Times</hi> by the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads,</hi> the <hi>fasti Consulares,</hi> and other standing ways of <hi>computation</hi> are exceeding necessary to the the exact distinguishing and digesting of <hi>sacred Chronology,</hi> and of the occurrences of Scripture to their <hi>proper times,</hi>

            <p>When I consider all these things I cannot but beleeve that the more learned men are (having <hi>gracious hearts</hi> as well as <hi>learned heads</hi>) the more sensible they are of their <hi>insufficiency,</hi> for so tremendous an imployment as the sound, solid, and judicious <hi>preaching</hi> of the word of God; and are more dismaid at the sense of their own wants for so weighty and arduous a service, then they do wonder at the boldness of illiterate men, who therefore venture with more confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, because they know not that variety of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as of spiritual wisdom and grace, which is requisite unto such an able discharge of it, as whereby a man may appear to be a <hi>workman who needeth not to be ashamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Word of truth.</hi>

To know the whole <hi>Creation,</hi> and to be ignorant of the <hi>Creator</hi>; to know all <hi>Histories</hi> and Antiquities, and to be unacquainted with our own hearts; to be good <hi>Logicians</hi> to other purposes, and in the mean time to be cheated by Satan with <hi>Paralogisms</hi> in the business of our own <hi>Salvation</hi>; To be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Orators</hi> with <hi>Men,</hi> and never to prevail with <hi>God</hi>; To know the constellations, motions, and influences of <hi>heavenly Bodies,</hi> and have still <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavenly Souls</hi>; To know exactly the <hi>Laws of men,</hi> and be ignorant and rebellious against the <hi>Laws of God</hi>; To abound with <hi>worldly Wisdom,</hi> and

be destitute of the <hi>fear of God,</hi> which makes wise to salvation, is all but a better kinde of <hi>refined misery</hi>; the Devils have much more then all this comes to, and yet are damned.

            <p>First, Our dear Brother was a <hi>Learned man,</hi> Learned in the whole Body of Learning; not onely an excellent <hi>Linguist</hi> and <hi>Grammarian, Historian, Cosmographer, Artist,</hi> but a most ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Divine,</hi> and a great <hi>Antiquary</hi> in the most memorable things of this Nation. Into whatsoever parts of the Land he travelled, he was able to refresh and to instruct his Fellow-travellers in the most remarkable particulars of every Country. <hi>Pausanias</hi> was not more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the description of <hi>Greece,</hi> then he of <hi>England.</hi> And I have heard, that he had it sometimes in his thoughts to have published some thing in this kind. He was a man of a <hi>solid Iudgement</hi>; he always spake <hi>è sulco pectoris,</hi> and I have, not without very great satisfaction, heard him give his Notions upon difficult places of Scripture, and Arguments of Divinity in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary discourse, as if he had elaborately studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He was <hi>mighty in Word,</hi> able out of a <hi>full Treasury,</hi> and Store-house of Learning, to bring forth both <hi>new and old.</hi> I never knew
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51940:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any learned subject spoken of in his company, wherein he was not able most dexterously to deliver his opinion. He was a man of a <hi>copious Discourse,</hi> but withal so <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> as did ever <hi>delight</hi> his auditors, never <hi>weary</hi> them. As <hi>Livie</hi> said of <hi>Cato, Natum ad id diceres quodcunque ageret,</hi> we may say of him, <hi>Doctum in hoc uno crederes, quodcun<expan>

                  </expan> diceret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He was as <hi>Moses, a Worker</hi> as well as <hi>a Speaker,</hi> he was not a barren Fig-tree, that had leaves without fruit; nor a <hi>tinckling Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bale,</hi> noise without love; he taught by his <hi>Life</hi> as well as by his <hi>Learning. Verbis tantum philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phari non est doctoris sed histrionis,</hi> as he said; and <hi>dicta factis deficientibus erubescunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul. de pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia c.</hi> 1.</note> saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi> And indeed he was a man of <hi>fixed and resolved honesty,</hi> and wondered in his sickness what men did learn <hi>Christianity</hi> for, if it were not in every condition to practice it, and adorn the profession of it. Time was, when fearing whether his <hi>conscience</hi> and his <hi>Imployment</hi> would consist together, he put himself to much pain and trouble to resign the place, which he then held in the City of <hi>Glocester.</hi> For the times were then such, that many durst not take his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, till at last he met with a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who feared no mans displeasure in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he knew was his duty.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He was as <hi>Moses,</hi> a <hi>patient man</hi>; patient in his <hi>Business, Moses</hi> was patient in his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51940:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from morning to evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.13. and he <hi>patient</hi> in his <hi>School</hi> in like manner. Patient in his <hi>sufferings,</hi> willingly with Moses <hi>bearing the reproach of Christ,</hi> and not fearing the wrath of any man in comparison of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence he did bear to his own Conscience. Patient in <hi>sickness,</hi> composing himself with as an unshaken confidence to dye, as in time of health he would have gone about any other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He was as <hi>Moses,</hi> a <hi>faithful man, Heb.</hi> 3.5. most exactly answerable to the <hi>Trust</hi> of his place: <hi>Opprimi potius onere officii maluit, quàm illud deponere,</hi> as once <hi>Tully</hi> spake. It was hardly possible for any friend by any importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to draw him from a most punctual obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of timely attendance upon the duties of his place. And so tenderly <hi>fearfull</hi> was he of miscarriage herein, and so <hi>sensible</hi> of any the least defect, that in a former sickness he desired, if he should then have died, to have been buried at the <hi>School door,</hi> in regard he had in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration there come short of the duties which he owed unto the School. And this we shall ever find true, the <hi>more active,</hi> able, conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, faithful, any are in discharge of duty, the more <hi>humble,</hi> the more <hi>jealous,</hi> the more <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> they are of their coming short of it. <hi>The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and best ears of corn</hi> hang lowest towards the ground; and so those men that are fullest of worth, are most humble, and apprehensive of their own failings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51940:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sixthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was as Moses, <hi>a constant,</hi> resolved, steady man. <hi>Moses</hi> would not bate <hi>Pharoah</hi> an <hi>Hoof,</hi> kept close to <hi>every tittle</hi> of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 10.9, 26. So was he punctual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable from <hi>honest principles. Vir Rigidae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentiae,</hi> as <hi>Livy</hi> said of <hi>Cato.</hi> He was of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemo</hi> his judgment in this point, <hi>Debere, inesse quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly, He was as <hi>Moses, a wise man; Moses</hi> was often put to the use of his <hi>wisdom</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the distempers of a froward people; and a masculine <hi>Prudence</hi> is requisite to tame and calm the wilde and unswaied humors of young children.

Of <hi>Moses</hi> his care in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar we read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.15, 16, 17. And this good man the evening before he died with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness commended it to the Company, by a member thereof, who came to visit him, that they should use their uttermost wisdom and care
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51940:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to chuse an able, learned, religious, and orthodox man into the place, naming one <hi>of whose fitness,</hi> both he, and the Company, and School had had before great experience. And so much were they pleased to honor the judgment and integrity of this worthy man, that presently after his death they pitched upon an excellent learned man whom he had so providently commended unto them.</p>
            <p>I might add one parallel more, in the death of this good man to <hi>Moses.</hi> The Lord <hi>bid Moses go up to the Mount and dye, Deut.</hi> 32.49, 50. and he did so, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.1.5. This worthy Friend of mine, the Friday and Saturday before his own Fit, was pleased to visit me, lying at that time under a sore fit of the Stone. It pleased the Lord the Monday following to bring a like Fit upon him, and sending to enquire of his condition, he sent me word how it was with him, and that he looked on this Fit as a <hi>Messenger of death</hi> from God unto him. And accordingly though in <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to Gods appointment, he made use of <hi>means,</hi> yet he still insisted upon it, that his time of <hi>dissolution</hi> was now come, and accordingly, with great composedness and resolvedness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, waited for death as a man doth for a loving friend whom he is willing to embrace. I assure my self that he had with <hi>Moses a sight of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which made him so undauntedly look death in the face.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with that Exhortation, Let us <hi>go up to the Mount,</hi> and by faith <hi>look into our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51940:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heavenly Country</hi>; let us have our eyes fastened upon Christ our Salvation, and then we may with old <hi>Simeon sing</hi> our <hi>Nunc Dimittis</hi>; with the <hi>Apostle</hi> be willing to <hi>depart and to be with Christ, which is best of all</hi>; and with <hi>Moses</hi> die not onely <hi>patiently</hi> but <hi>obediently,</hi> as knowing that we have a <hi>City which hath foundations made without hands, eternal in the Heavens, whose Builder and Maker is God.</hi>
