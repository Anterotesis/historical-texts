            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Vintners Answer
TO
Some scandalous Phamphlets
Published,
(as is supposed)
By
<hi>Richard Kilvert;</hi> And abetted in some points, by his Brother
<hi>Roger,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Abel.</hi> Wherein the Vintners vindicate
their owne Reputations to the world, for
satisfaction of all such as know not the said
<hi>Kilverts</hi>
Wretched and lewd conversation, or have
credited his foule impudent defamations
suggested against them.</p>

            <head>Kilvert charges the Vintners of
three things:</head>
            <p>1. THat they were Projectors, and contrivers of that
Imposition of 40<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>per<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> Tun, which the King set
upon Wines imported in 1637.</p>
            <p>2. That they were also actors, and prosecutors of the same, to
the grievance of the Subject, by Farming the same, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
1 d. and 2 d. <hi>per</hi> quart, upon the consumtion of Wines
above the due price, by obtaining other illegall things, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. That in all these things they had a covetous desire of inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves, and that by these means they have greatly
inriched themselves.</p>
            <p>But it is to be noted, that in these points of Accusation, <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi>
is himself a Delinquent, and was first accused; and yet
though he act but the part of a Recriminator against the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
he takes upon him to be a competent Accuser, and takes
advantage against them, to take away the validity of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
as being by him pronounced guilty.</p>
            <p>It is apparent also, that both <hi>Kilvert</hi> and Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> do
recriminate the more confidently, because the Vintners are a
confiderable body, and supposed able to make great restitution
to the Common-wealth, if they can any way taint their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and lay them open for Delinquents; yet both are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
equally furious.</p>
            <p>The substance of that which Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> says, is; That
that this Project was first contrived at Court, and for divers
yeers urged upon the Vintners, and yet ever repulsed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consented too, till 1637. And then he being Master of the
Vintners Company, (divers of them being then prosecuted in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64241:3"/>
Star-chamber) was requested by them, to redeem them from
ruine. And thereupon, whatsoever he undertook, was meerly
to preserve his Company, and for no other ends; and that he had
no benefit by it, nor aimed at any, nor did effect any thing, but
with the consent, and by the authority of the generality of
Vintners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kilvert</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> man indued  with more boldnesse, makes no
scruple to alleage further, That it appears by the Acts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their own Court, that they were the plotters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of that Imposition. He instances in the Act of 6 <hi>Nov.</hi>
1637. and the 22 of the same, when the Company consented to
treat of, and to admit the Imposition; and he says, That from
thenceforth the whole Project was managed by the Company
in open Court at their Hall, and the major part of Vintners
were present at those Courts, and did consent by holding up of
hands. He instances in the 7 of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1637. when the Company
appointed ten Contractors to seal to the King; and in the 13 of
<hi>Febr.</hi> when <hi>Griffith</hi> by Letter gave instructions how to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
He says he was no Patentee, nor issued money in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
nor was at the Vintners Hall, till the Project was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and petition'd for.</p>
            <p>The substance of that which the Vintners reply hereunto, is;
That the Imposition cannot be said to be contrived, or plotted
in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1637. or after <hi>Nov.</hi> which was in being long before,
much lesse can the Vintners be supposed to be the contrivers and
plotters of that, which for divers yeers before they had opposed
and withstood at their own great perill and prejudice.</p>
            <p>That whosoever the contrivers and plotters were in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
yet if the Midwifery and Nurcery of <hi>Kilvert</hi> and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Abel</hi> had not given it birth, and growth afterwards in
the world, it must needs have proved Abortive.</p>
            <p>That in 1632. an Imposition of 4 l. <hi>per</hi> Tun was solicited
by some of the Kings Ministers; and in 1633. my Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<hi>Weston</hi> was urgent to bring the same to passe; but the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
not submitting thereto, an extra judiciall Decree in Star-chamber
was procured, prohibiting Vintners to dresse meat, and
restraining them from divers benefits of their Trade; and this
was prepared as a lash to over-awe them, and either to abate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64241:3"/>
their courage in opposing, or to diminish their power.</p>
            <p>That my Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and some other Lords did inforce
the same Imposition; and that my Lord of <hi>Dorset</hi> pitying their
condition, and thinking them not sufficiently knowing of their
own state, was so open and plain, as to tell them, It was folly
in Travellers, to deny their purses to Robbers upon the way,
and to draw harm upon themselves thereby, when they had no
sufficient force, either to defend their purses, or their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
And having so told them, he applyed it further, and swore
it was their own case.</p>
            <p>That this Decree being so formidable in those injurious
times, and so many great men so intentive to make use of it, in
1634. The Vintners did furnish for the Kings use, 6000 l. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a promise to be secured from the Decree, and to have their
due Priviledges confirmed in Dec: following, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Warrant from the Councell-Table to that effect; and
some of them being not fully satisfied with that dilatory War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
my Lord of <hi>Arundels</hi> words were, Will you not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the word of a King?</p>
            <p>That till Dec: aforesaid, the Company remained quiet and
unmolested, but then seeking the promised assurance, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the Lords was, That the King wanted more money,
which if they would supply, more then had bin promised should
be performed, and the Imposition was again pressed.</p>
            <p>That the Vintners not yet yeelding to the Imposition, the
force of the Decree was inculcated, and the promised assurance
was denyed, the 6000 l. lent was detained, and used onely as a
bait to draw them further on, and to intice them into the
Project.</p>
            <p>That other great suits then hanging in Star-chamber to be
solicited by <hi>Kilvert,</hi> the Vintners injoyed some rest till 1636.
and then divers of them were vexed upon the Decree; and in
<hi>April</hi> following <hi>Kilvert</hi> made his open boast, that the Bishop of
<hi>Lincolns</hi> case being once ended, he would immediately set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to prosecute the Vintners upon the Decree.</p>
            <p>The Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> being Sheriffe Elect of <hi>London</hi> before
Midsummer, 1636. by right whereof, according to the City cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
he was to be chosen Master of the Vintners, he refused
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64241:4"/>
it, pretending that he should be better able to serve the Vintners
after the expiration of his Shrievalty.</p>
            <p>That at Midsummer, 1637. Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> took upon him
to be Master of the Company, his Shrievalty expiring at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas
following, the Bishop of <hi>Lincolns</hi> triall being
end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d about the same time, both he and <hi>Kilvert</hi> had good
leasure to joyn, and to combine about the businesse of
Vintners.</p>
            <p>That from <hi>Feb.</hi> and <hi>Hil.</hi> Term next, before the Vintners ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been examined upon oath in Star-chamber, and confessed
the dressing of Meat, &amp;c. contrary to the Decree, there was
neverthelesse no further proceeding in Easter, or Trin. Term
against them; but in <hi>Sept.</hi> following, both <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
being at leasure, they had meetings and conferences, as
themselves confesse, and then at the Aldermans house <hi>Kilvert</hi>
imparted it, that he had Warrant from the King, to solicite
against all Vintners, as well those that had given over their
Trade, as others, for breach of the Decree; and that <hi>Marq. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
had power from the King, to treat with some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
touching His Majesties pleasure therein.</p>
            <p>That upon the 25 of <hi>Octob.</hi> following, at a Court of Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> made this Overture known, and with
great passion set forth the danger of the whole Company, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
some were selected to make their addresse to M. <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
and to negotiate that affair.</p>
            <p>That upon 31 <hi>Octob.</hi> they which had attended M. <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
reported to the Assistants, that it was communicated to them
from the Marq. that the King expected an Imposition but to be
agreed upon by Committees, indifferently to be appointed
both by the King and Vintners; and that in respect of the same
Imposition, the Vintners should re-tail Wines dearer by espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace, and withall obtain confirmation of former Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and a grant of further benefits.</p>
            <p>That the Marq. did impart his private advice for their yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herein, because though the Delinquents Fines were given
him, yet he confidering that the ruine of divers private men,
would not so much inrich the Kings coffers, was willing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Kings favour in some other suit, so that the Imposition
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64241:4"/>
might be condiscended to, for the Kings greater profit, and the
Vintners better safety.</p>
            <p>That hereupon a generall Courts was called on <hi>Nov.</hi> 6. 1637.
wherein much was laboured by <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Alderman,
both by fair promises and sharp threats, to induce to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
It was promised, that the King would pardon all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
delinquencies, that the Vintners should have His Majesties
especiall favour, and by the same injoy not onely former immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
but further Priviledges also, and for ever be made a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Company; That they should dresse and sell Victuals, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
Beer, Sugar, &amp;c. That they should be free from Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and have power to restrain the incroachments of the
Coopers. On the other side, as Benefit was the bait, so Terror
was the hook, and Destruction in the next place was laid before
them; In case they did reject the Imposition, it was menaced,
that they should be prosecuted upon the Decree, perplexed with
Informers, disabled for their Trade, that the King was unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
resolved to have this Imposition, whether they assented, or
no; That if the Vintners were rich, the King would not be
poor; That he would as soon lose his Crown land, as this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
that Wines being a forein Commodity, the Law allowed
the King to impose upon it at pleasure; that it was also in the
Kings power to suppresse all but 40 Vintners in <hi>London,</hi> and
that good Councell had so resolved it; And the Aldermans
Conclusion was, Shall I see my Company digg'd up by the
roots, my Brethren ruin'd ith' Star-chamber, and the cankerly
Cooper between the bark and the tree eat up all?</p>
            <p>That these things being so represented to the Generality in
those times of violence, the main body voted rather to comply
with the King by furnishing another present summe, then by
this Imposition, and 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. was nominated; but both <hi>Kilvert</hi>
and the Alderman called some of them out, and upbraided them
as beggars, not able to pay what had been formerly levied for
the King, and at last concluded, That the King expected, and
would have more yeerly then such a summe. And so the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
at last being put after long contestation, Whether they
would stand out any longer against the Imposition, upon such
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rms, or comply with the King, in chusing and authorising a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64241:5"/>
Committee to treat of the manner of an Imposition; the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
did chuse to comply so far, and to appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
            <p>That this Act of Court were not so main an Evidence for
<hi>Kilvert,</hi> and fit to be so often insisted upon, if it were not mis-alleaged,
and mis-applyed; for if the <hi>major</hi> part of Vintners
did appear, and consent, yet they were perswaded, threatned,
intreated, but did neither perswade, threaten, nor intreat; and
they consented to comply with the King, and did not use means
that the King might comply with them, as <hi>Kilvert</hi> most mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
inverts it; and their compliance was in appointing
Committees to treat of an Imposition, but not absolutely to
submit to it; and if they had absolutely yeelded, yet all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
considered, it ought not to be held a voluntary
yeelding, but such a violent one, as the Sea-mans is in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
when he submits to the weather, and chuses rather to cast
away all his wares, then himself, and ship, and all.</p>
            <p>That on 22 <hi>Nov.</hi> following at another generall Court the
Committees reported what the Kings demands were, and the
Generalities assent being questioned, it was assented that the
Committees might yeeld to 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Tun, provided that they
might be assured to have from His Majestie the immunities and
benefits proposed and expressed, and that all this were just and
good in Law; (but indeed these words concerning legality are
not entred in the Hall-book.)</p>
            <p>That this Act of Court, if it be taken most strongly against
the Vintners, though it be <hi>Kilverts</hi> prime engine, yet it evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
no more, but that they submitted to the Kings <hi>demands</hi> urged
upon them, as hath been said; and since they had no power to
hold out against it any longer, they provided for some helps to
inable them to bear it, and those also no other, but such as had
been <hi>proposed,</hi> and <hi>expressed</hi> to them; not such as they had gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
gaped after; the Book it self will justifie in that, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the benefits and immunities were inconsiderable to the
Vintners, such as had no great reality in them, nor had they
any beleef in the obtruders of them, nay they know they were
obtruded rather to make them guilty, then to make them
gainers; setting aside exemption from the rigor of Star-chamber,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64241:5"/>
they would willingly have forgone all promised priviledges, and
given great sums of money besides, to be delivered from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>That it is extreme malice and falshood in <hi>Kilvert</hi> so to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
and mis-recite this Act, as if it had no relation to former
violence and constraint; or as if it amounted to a meer request,
nay to a Project in the Vintner; as if his end had been to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the Cooper, and to Monopolize the retayling of Wines
thorow the whole Kingdom; or as if the words did testifie of
the Vintners demands, and propositions, and requests, and not
the direct contrary.</p>
            <p>That the Vintners are not destitute of further answers also;
For first, the major part, and better sort of drawing Vintners
were not that day present at the Hall, the businesse was so farre
disaffected, and they in opposing it had been so farre wearied
out and worried (as it were) by <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Alderman, that
they did forbear any longer to appear, nothing being there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
but checks, affronts, and disgracefull usage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the most part which appeared that day, was of Suburbian
retaylers, poor men, and such as dealt in Rundlets, and such as
faction had drawn in for a good number of them. Secondly, of
such as did then appear the more loud and turbulent part, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, rather than the major part of able and modest men. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Those of the better sort which did give their consent, did it
not with any true liking to the project, but meerly to avoid
ruine in the Starre-chamber. For the shipwrack of the Sope-boylers,
and others, was then fresh, and in view, and that Court
had then gotten them the same repute, as a <hi>Timariots</hi> horse has
in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where they say no grasse ever grows, after the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his fatall hoof. Fourthly, the entry of that dayes Act
is much to be suspected, as well as many others, for many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
then intervened, to which the world is not now privy: for
first, All Courts of generality were called by the Beadle, in the
Kings name, a form of summons never before used, and had
now been uselesse, if the generality, out of distaste to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
had not been unwilling to appear; and if the Alderman
and <hi>Kilvert</hi> had not been very eager in obtruding upon the
Company against their liking. Secondly, Divers other Courts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64241:6"/>
were called both before and after the 6 and the 22 of <hi>Nov.</hi>
wherein the generality dissenting and disavowing the Project<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and alleaging many reasons of illegality, &amp; inconvenience in it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
no entrance is remaining therof, nor memory of any such Courts
held; and yet if any such remembrances were now extant, they
would testifie for the Vintners against the Projectors, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover who they were that pursued, and who that rejected
the designe. Thirdly, <hi>Kilvert</hi> has no regard at all to the true
reciting of such acts as are remaining in the Clerks Book, but to
the perverting of justice, satisfies in all his allegations. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Acts themselves were not alwayes rightly entred.
Sometimes the Clerk was checkt and over-awed, sometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were made contrary to his liking, and without his privity,
some things being omitted, and some inserted, and some wrested,
and mis-sensed; so that indeed the acts are more properly <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi>
than the Companies. The Book sayes alwayes, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of Vintners did alwayes appear, and the major part of
the Apparence consent, but this was seldom so. And the major
part did never consent, but with this Proviso, That the thing
consented too was legall, and warranted by Counsell; but this
was never entred. And upon the 25 of <hi>Oct.</hi> 1637. Committees
were appointed to treat with Marquesse <hi>Hamilton;</hi> but the
Book adds, Concerning the advance of the prices of Wines,
and this is meerly suppositious. Fifthly, Many of the Vintners
were practised and tampered withall, especially the meaner
sort, and many of the better sort were over-powred, and born
down by might and threats, and singled out from the rest. For
example, <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mason</hi> being opposers of
the Imposition, were not onely controlled in publike, as obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
men, and ill-willers to the Kings servic, but it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be entred in the Hall Book, as a great delinquence,
and there is still remains registred: and this being not sufficient,
the same men were the same day sent for by the Beadle, to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Tavern in <hi>Pater-noster</hi> Row, where <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
dined, to receive further rebuke and insolent usage: and
this was for example to disanimate the rest. For Alderman
<hi>Abel,</hi> as he was an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> and Master of the
Company of Vintners, and assisted with <hi>Kilverts</hi> infinite wiles
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64241:6"/>
and impostures, and as he had to do with a distracted body of
men of severall mindes and qualities, holding no perfect intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
one with another; and as he was at that time of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected
faith, and in their good opinion, and as he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of those projecting times, and influence from some
great persons of honour, and above all, the Kings name to
make use of in all his pretences, had strange advantages to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
his brethren, and bring about his own purposes. Sixthly,
besides disadvantages common to other Tradesmen, the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were divers other wayes also liable to the lash, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to injuries; for by the Statute, the Lords had a power
to set the re-tailing prices of Wines so, as that they might undo
the Vintners at pleasure, if they would not submit to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
and they did lay hold of this power to this purpose,
causing them to sell cheaper then they could well afford, and
that yeer when the Imposition was first consented too, fearing
lest the Vintners should recede and retract, they set the prices
lower, and raised them after, but not till all things were made
sure. Moreover, to affright the Vintners further, it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them, that by the Law the King might suppresse all
but 40 Taverns; that he had right to impose upon forein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and that dressing of Meat, selling Tobacco, &amp;c. were
not undoubtedly belonging to their Trade, so that their case
would be more desperate then the Sope-boilers, or the Irish
planters, and these yet in Star-chamber had faln without mercie.
Seventhly, all these indirect passages notwithstanding, there is
scarce above one generall Court, wherein the Imposition was
consented to, most of the other passages of preparing, ripening
and perfecting the Project, were translated by Courts of Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and at such Courts it is sufficient if 12 besides the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
be present, and the <hi>major</hi> part of those 12 sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
the whole Company. And it is to be noted, that it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happened at those Courts, that there were present above
five or six drawing Vintners, and of those also, some were the
Aldermans creatures: For Example, on 27 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1637. a draught
of a Petition was presented, there were then 15 Assistants, of
those there were onely five drawing Vintners, all the rest had
given over their Trades, or were of other Trades, though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64241:7"/>
free of the Company, and many of them were liable to many
other exceptions, and yet these referred that weighty businesse
to be proceeded in by any three of the Committees, the Master
being one, so that if the Alderman could procure any two to
joyn with him, that <hi>junto</hi> was sufficient to dispatch all; and by
this means the Aldermans house was the place, and the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
himself, with some of his privadoes, was the man, where,
and by whom divers important matters were expedited. And
at some times the Alderman alone was sufficient, for 1000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.
was given to <hi>Kilvert,</hi> and 3000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. to Marq. <hi>Hamilton</hi> out of the
Companies purse; but there is no Act of Court remaining, to
shew by what authority these moneys were disposed, nor does
the Generality understand any thing thereof, but that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermans
authority was solely effectuall in that businesse.
Eightly, <hi>Kilvert,</hi> the most fatall of all false-Informers, the most
mischievous of all Projectors, the most impudent of all Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
was introduced to sit at the Vintners Hall in Court, there
to act the Lyons and Foxes part, and when that grew odious
to many, he was by an adoption of meer formality, made free of
the Company, that he might insult and insinuate the more, and
by his Mercuriall trumperies prove more fruitfull in mischief.
And though he denies to have been at <hi>Vintners</hi> Hall till the
creation of the Proiect, yet he was there often, and that before,
at, and after the 22 of <hi>Nov.</hi> for that very day it was that he so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rogers</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mason</hi> at the Hall, and dining after
in <hi>Pater-noster Row,</hi> exprest himself in more insolent, and taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
language. Ninthly, when the Generality was drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Kings command, they were caused ever to attend
below divers hours till the Alderman and his party had framed
and debated the businesse, the Generality had no share in the
discussion of matters, it was sufficient for them to authorize and
own what the privadoes had before discussed; and if any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man complained hereat, or took upon him to debate any
thing by them resolved, he was singled out, and treated as an
enemy to the King and his service; for example, <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> was so
treated in open Court, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rowland Wilson</hi> was convented
also before the Marquesse, and by him terrified, and taxed as
the Kings opposite. Tenthly, when the Company did not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64241:7"/>
appear in so full a body as was thought fit by <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Kilvert,</hi>
the businesse it self not being more displeasing, then the carriage
of it, notice was taken thereof especially about <hi>Nov.</hi> 1637. and
that the absent might be known, the names of such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
were taken upon command; and this manifests how many
wished ill to the Proiect, and how few were active in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating
of it. Eleventhly, as <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Alderman had
too much influence in entring acts, so they had the like in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
and taking away all such papers and Notes, as might
arm and inable the <hi>Vintners</hi> for a fuller and clearer defence.
For example, a Petition, and a Schedule of divers unlawfull
demands annexed in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1637. is charged upon the <hi>Vintners;</hi>
whereas there is no copie of either remaining in the Hall-book,
or in the Clerks hands, <hi>Kilvert</hi> must be the onely Register in
this case against his Adversaries, and though they can prove,
that they never fully agreed upon any Petition, and that which
was presented to them, was by him altred in matters of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
contrary to the liking of the <hi>Vintners,</hi> yet he still char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
them upon his own papers, by himself penned, and by
himself preserved. Twelfthly, to give instances, what slavery
and treachery the Vintners lived under, two onely shall serve:
There was 6000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. to be repayd to the Company; out of this
the Alderman would deduct 2000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. issued for the use of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Kilvert,</hi> and so there was two thirds due to
the Company; but they could never receive above 12<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. in the
pound, whieh is not a full thirds; the Aldermans pleasure was
sufficient to discharge them of the rest, and against that they
were utterly remedilesse. And next, the Alderman being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to see Counsell about the legality of the Imposition and
the Farm, he pretended to be assured by Counsell, of the legali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of both beyond all doubt, and yet he had contrary counsell
given him.</p>
            <p>All this almost which has been hitherto related, <hi>Kilvert</hi> passes
over, and as if the Imposition had never bin thought on till <hi>Nov.</hi>
1637. there he findes out the source of it, and then he makes
the Vintners the first seekers and plotters of it. But because in
<hi>Nov.</hi> the 6, and 22. there is no pregnant proof that the Vintners
solicited for the Project, nor no mention is of any Petition, till
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64241:8"/>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 27. there he layes his principall charge; for to that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he annexes a Schedule, containing 11 immunities; and these
he entitles, The humble desires of the retaylers of Wines: and
these are (as his words expresse) the very Project it self.</p>
            <p>The Vintners hereunto answer:</p>
            <p>That as the Imposition was before violently inforced till
they did submit, so the Petition was now as subtilly obtruded,
that they might seem to do more then submit.</p>
            <p>That the Vintners at the first proposing of a Petition, did
cry out against it, both as unnecessary, and unreasonable; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
because without any Petition, the King might in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
justice, and conscience, without any Petition grant, what
he had voluntarily offered for his own profit; and if he would
not, the matter to them was of little importance: Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because they should now seem greedy of that, which they
had so long withstood, and knew to be destructive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and would yet, if they might be permitted, at any rate
possible, ransome themselves from.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Kilvert</hi> hereupon assured them, that the Petition could
not ingage them in any guilt, or besmear them in any crime, that
it was onely framed as best beseeming the Majestie of a Prince,
to whom no other addresse could seem congeable, and in that
form wherein it was then presented, it did intimate the 40<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi>. <hi>per</hi>
Tun, demanded by the King, and the other immunities offered
to the Vintners without any seeking, or solicitation on their
part; and the Kings promise was the ground of its prayer.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Kilvert</hi> intending, as it seems, to pull out the hot Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut
out of the fire with the Monkeys paw, rather then his own,
as the crafty beast did in the Fable, did neverthelesse alter the
Petition to the inverting of the sense of it, and that contrary
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Shaws</hi> advice, and did new transcribe it in contrary
words, leaving no Act thereof in the Clerks book, to testifie the
effect of it; nor do the Vintners yet know whether it was ever
presented to the King or no, or what reference it had, or how far
that reference was pursued.</p>
            <p>That this Petition therefore, and its appendant Schedule,
ought not to be esteemed as the act of the Vintners, but as <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi>
nay as <hi>Kilvert</hi> criminous act, being no lesse then Forgery,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64241:8"/>
and that of a mischievous nature; the Vintners thereby being
not onely drawn into damage, but crime also.</p>
            <p>Another thing alleaged against the Vintners, to make them
guilty of projecting this Imposition, is <hi>Griffiths</hi> Letter in <hi>Feb.</hi>
following.</p>
            <p>But to this the Vintners answer:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Griffiths</hi> Letter giving instructions how to manage the
Farm, could be no contrivance or projection of the Imposition;
for <hi>Kilvert</hi> himself says, that he was not at Vintners Hall before
the Project was petition'd for, and concluded; and it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that he was at the Hall in <hi>Nov.</hi> before, and therefore this
is a meer contradiction, wherein he confounds times far distant,
that he may thereby confound things as farre different. That
which had been the laborious businesse of so many yeers before,
and the task of so many great Councellors of State, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of so rare an Engineer as <hi>Kilvert,</hi> and had been brought
to such maturation before <hi>Feb.</hi> cannot now be attributed to
<hi>Griffiths</hi> Letter, dated in <hi>Feb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But <hi>Kilvert</hi> sayes, That the Vintners were not onely the
inventers and projectors of the Imposition, but in the second
place, they were also many wayes actors and prosecutors of the
same, <hi>viz.</hi> by Farming it, by sealing the <hi>Quad:</hi> Indenture, by
taking 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Quart, above the just prices, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Vintners answer; and first, as to the Farm:</p>
            <p>That the Farm of the Imposition for 8 yeers, was obtruded
upon the Vintners, nor for that it was likely to prove benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to them, but for that they were the fittest men to bring in
the Kings Rent, and could collect it with the least noyse and
disturbance in the world, and with least opposition and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
amongst the Vintners: for if the Kings Rent had been to
be demanded and exacted by his own immediate Officers, or by
any other Tenants and Farmors of any other Trade, the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Cellars must have been searched by strangers, and many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of tumult and strife must have happened, whereby great
clamours and troubles might have been raised in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
to the greater scandall of Projects. And the same was
then apparent in the Sope-boylers case; for whilst that Project
was managed by strangers, and the old Sope-boylers would not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64241:9"/>
comply, the whole State almost was shaken with the out-cries
and distresses of many undone Families, and the Projectors
gained lesse, and vexed the subiect more.</p>
            <p>That as the example of the Sope-boylers case thriving so ill
till the old Company did submit, was a motive in <hi>Kilvert,</hi> to
presse, and by force to drive the Vintner the more to a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so the example of the Sope-boylers case, the old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
suffering so much, and groning so long under such grievous
things till it did yeeld, was a motive to the Company of Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to make them yeeld the sooner: and therefore, upon the 7
of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1637. after some contestation notwithstanding; and after
it had been opened, that Sir <hi>Abraham Daws</hi> had offered above
40000 <hi>l.</hi> for it, the question being put to the Generality, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would farm the Imposition at 30000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> they
did consent thereto; and for the Kings further satisfaction, since
he would not contract with the Generality, they did agree to
nominate 10 Contractors.</p>
            <p>That they were first advertised, notwithstanding that the
meer renting of the Kings Imposition was not contrary to
Law, nor could they imagine, that since the State would be lesse
grieved and perturbed, if they rented it rather then any other
men, it could be held any disservice, either to the Subject, or
the King.</p>
            <p>That if any miscarriage were in the manage of the Farm,
that is wholly to be ascribed to Alderman <hi>Abel,</hi> and some few
of his privadoes, who did ingrosse the whole power therein, and
benefit thereof to his sole use, and admitting some Farmors or
sub-farmors to bear the name thereof, yet they had, nor enioyed
nothing else but the meer name; and if they were admitted for
any purpose at all, it was to bear losse and blame, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the Aldermans tyranny, or to be responsible for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
to this purpose they were more than nominall, titular
Farmors, but to all purposes of benefit they were shadows, cl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and meer empty Names.</p>
            <p>That the Vintners expected no benefit from the beginning
to arise to them out of the Farm, nor could hope for any other
dealing from the Alderman, then what they found; for they
knew well, that if Sir <hi>Abraham Daws</hi> had offered more then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64241:9"/>
40000 <hi>l.</hi> and was refused, it was not out of any favour to them,
but out of some other end upon them. And they had some cause
to fear, that if it proved a bargain of profit to the Farmors,
the Rent being once setled by their compliance, the King might
avoid his grant, and if it proved a bargain of losse, then their
own deed should be strongly urged against themselves: and
howsoever it proved, they knew the Alderman would have
the shuffling, cutting and dealing, all in his own hands; and that
they should have, nor Law, nor right, nor remedy, besides his
meer pleasure and discretion.</p>
            <p>That the Aldermans trains and traps from the beginning,
were very grosse, and rank, and obvious to the dullest capacities;
for though the Patent of the Farm were not sealed by the King,
nor did commence till Midsummer after, yet he had chosen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Treasurer, and taken a house, and setled Officers, and salla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and removed his habitation before Lady-day. And though
this businesse of the Farm was no such adventure as did require
any stock at all, or bank of money, yet for other sinister ends, he
demanded no less then 30000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. to be undertaken for by the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
and a good considerable part thereof he did gather in, and
receive into his own hands, and divers men being therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to come in as undertakers, he used extremities to draw
them in: For example, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Leechland</hi> being fearfull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to undertake, he was forced and hunted in by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman,
and that place which he held under the King, was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be taken away; and he had not undertaken any thing in
the Farm, had it not been for fear of losing his place: And for
another Example, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rowland Wilson</hi> was as much solicited to
come in for an adventure, but refused, and could never be won
by any means whatsoever to joyn in the Farm.</p>
            <p>That the 7 Allegations set down in the Aldermans paper,
whereby he would prove the 10 Farmors, and the 27 Sub-farmors
equally interessed in the Farm with himself, are not
sufficient to prove the same.</p>
            <p>For first, the Act of 29 March, 1638. does not prove, that
his office of being Treasurer, and his stipend of 500<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>per annum</hi>
was setled by the Company of Vintners, when it is evident, that
he had taken a house for that purpose, and removed from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64241:10"/>
               <hi>Billeter</hi>-lane, and setled all things before Lady-day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the bringing in of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for every undertaker,
when the adventure required no such supply, can manifest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Aldermans tyrannie and treachery: and for the
30000 <hi>l.</hi> he subscribed mens names as he pleased, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did neither condition to be ingaged for such sums, nor
did they underwrite to such conditions, and the truth is, that
money which was gleaned from the 37. though it was intended
by the Alderman, as a hook to hold them in, and ingage them
the faster; yet nothing was pretended, but a meer loan, and
therefore the Alderman paid them Interest according to their
severall proportions, although he gave no Obligations for
the same.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>major</hi> part of Undertakers were not present,
or consenting to the choise of Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> for Treasurer, and
they which were present, and consenting (besides some of his
own privadoes) were but lookers on, and did but onely agree
to that, which they had no power to frustrate.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, those of the Adventurers, which did ride about to
settle the Imposition in the Country, and in the Out-ports, did
it in obedience to Warrants from the Lords of the Councell,
and to the Aldermans commands; and though they were specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
or assistants, yet they did but execute the Aldermans and
<hi>Kilverts</hi> Instructions, and were as meerly instrumentall to
them, as they seemed to be to the King; for Example, <hi>Kilvert</hi>
rode to <hi>Bristow,</hi> and other Western parts, and though he went
attended with some others of the Undertakers, yet he, as from
the Kings own mouth, took the boldnesse to treat with all men,
and that in very imperious terms; and when all his intimations
from the King would not prevail to make <hi>Bristow</hi> men, &amp;c. sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
he at last threatned them with the Star-chamber, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
them of false Measures, and so as a meer Informer, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them in the end to subjection.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, those Acquittances which some of the Adventurers
signed, have words in them inserted by the Alderman, meerly
to confesse a Partnership, and an equall interest in the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without which, the Alderman would not restore them their
sums adventured, do signifie nothing but the Aldermans craft
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64241:10"/>
and injury; for it was after a Parliament summoned, and as he
drew the Acquittances for his own safety, so some of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
perceived his aim, and would not sign the same, but
chose rather to leave their money still deposited in his hands.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, those 34 Farmors which did consent to the buying
in of the Wine-licenses on 15 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1639. were drawn in, and
cozned by the Alderman, for he had bought them before, and
found losse in them, and now by his uncontrolable power he
would force them upon his pretended Partners; and at the same
time he arrogated a right to himself, of turning out all such as
would not joyn therein, and did use threats to the same
purpose.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that Petition which was drawn upon the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Parliament, and signed by 28 of the Undertakers,
for the discharging and rendring up of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>arm, was framed
chiefly for the Aldermans impunity, and he was the Author,
and Solicitor in it to draw in others; and by his means it was
also moved at the Hall to the whole Company, that they would
concur in the same, and it was to this intent, that they might
seem as much interested in it as he, and he as little guilty
as they.</p>
            <p>That all these shifts and wiles of the Alderman and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
make it very cleer, that the ten Farmors, and their under
Farmors were not so in truth, but meerly Nominall, that they
might suffer for and with the Alderman, if any hazard or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
were; for the Alderman made a great benefit of it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indebted, and of weak estate before, by this Farm he hath
got a great estate, and enabled himself for one purchase of
17000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. whereas the Farmors and sub-Farmors, never received
one penny benefit, nor had any account given them in so long
a time for it, nor had any assurance in Law, under hand or Seal,
whereby to call him to account, or to recover, or claim any
thing upon account. And as the Alderman did in Law keep all
the power in his own hands, so in fact also he did exercise that
power after an arbitrary unlimited way; at some times he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told them, that they had no right nor interest in the Farm,
but at his meer discretion and pleasure, and that he could turn
out, or take in, as he listed; and at other times he did, upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64241:11"/>
private displeasures, put out, and lessen some in their shares, and,
upon fancy, put in, and raise others; and all these things were
transacted at his own house, by his own authority; and that was
so unquestionable, and uncontrolable, that no man thought fit
to stir, or move any thing against it.</p>
            <p>That as all this and more may be maintained in defence of the
Farmors, so more yet may be maintained in the behalf of the 27
sub-Farmors; for the 10 Farmors did some things without the
knowledge of the 27, and have since exhibited a Bill against the
27, to make them liable to some moneyes disbursed by them, but
they are over-ruled, and left remedilesse in the case; and the 10
were first drawn in and workt upon by the Aldermans craft;
and they being the richest men of the Company, the Alderman
could not so easily have effected his ends, nor deceived others, if
he had not first deceived them.</p>
            <p>The next thing pressed against the Vintners, to make them
guilty of the Imposition, is the sealing of the <hi>Quadri:</hi> Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and agreeing to the unlawfull covenants thereof.</p>
            <p>The Vintners answer hereunto, is;</p>
            <p>That they having with great reluctance yielded their backs to
the sore pressure of the Imposition in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1637. conceived<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
That a sufficient consummation of that affair, and hoping that
the King would thereupon provide for their delivery out of
Starre-chamber, and an open liberty of their trading, did not
see cause to seek for any further Deeds or Covenants to be
drawn, from them to the King, or from the King to them, much
lesse from either to the French and Spanish Merchants.</p>
            <p>That it was the onely policy of <hi>Kilvert</hi> and the Alderman, to
have recourse to Petitions or Indentures; for as they had taken
order for their own benefit before, in drawing the Vintners to
an unvoluntary submission in <hi>Nov.</hi> so now they would take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for their impunity, by drawing further acts of more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
submissions, in shew from the Vintners; before they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
onely their tongues, now they would engage their hands
and Seals, and leave them no retreit: before they had made them
stoop to the Kings ends, now they should seem to intend onely
their own; for it was now represented, that their grant to the
King was sure and perfect, but the Kings grant to them must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64241:11"/>
further ceremony in Law, and supplication besides. And
by this means the Vintners were to be made, not onely losers,
but culpable also, and the Projectors having first taken the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
bread, to put it into their own mouthes, now take out the
thorn also out of their own hands, to thrust it into the
Vintners.</p>
            <p>That upon 15 <hi>March,</hi> 1637. when the Covenants concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Merchants were first proposed to the Vintners, they
were cryed down as unjust, and prayed against, and were not
till the 21 of <hi>Mar:</hi> setled, and that by the interposition of the
Lord Treasurer, Marquesse <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Atturney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>That notwithstanding the unapproved settlement, no
draught of the <hi>Quad:</hi> Indentures were shewed at the Hall to be
examined and scanned till long after, neither was the Company
ever fully satisfied therein, or knew if any true copy thereof
was produced, or how it was after altered; nor did they agree,
till the 16 of <hi>June</hi> following, that their common Seal should be
taken forth, and set thereto; nor do they know whether it was
set thereto, or by whom, or when.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Quad:</hi> Deed, bearing date the 19 of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1638. was
not sealed by any particular Members of the Company, till
<hi>Sept.</hi> following, and then those which did seal it with their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Seals, were drawn ignorantly to the Atturneys chamber
for that purpose, and perswaded to it by the Alderman, as a
thing of meer form, and of no dangerous consequence at all:
and since it had commenced, and taken effect before, they do not
yet know what vigor their seals superadded to it, or to what
purpose their seals were required, except it were to make them
criminous, contrary to the Aldermans fearfull oathes.</p>
            <p>That since the <hi>Quad:</hi> Indenture did not occasion or precede
the Imposition, but was occasioned, and preceded by the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and since it was in part compulsive, and an effect of those
calamitous, irregular times; and since the Aldermans fraud was
so notorious in it, hee putting in the names of whom hee
pleased, and some of those also having yet never sealed, and he
having the common seal of the Company in his sole custody, and
kept the same a long time after Midsummer, when another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64241:12"/>
was chosen in his place; The Vintners hope to be excused,
it not <hi>a Toto,</hi> yet <hi>a Tanto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That since the same Indentures were drawn also by the Kings
Councell, in whose judgement and responsibility, the Vintners
had reason to confide; and since they were urged upon the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for the Kings advantage, or the Merchants, and not sought
for by the Vintners for their behoof: and since the Vintners
grant to the King, could not entitle him to any undue thing, or
prejudiciall to any but themselves: and since the Kings grant to
them, as to any unjust purpose, might be avoyded at pleasure,
and was known to be voydable: and since there was no aim in
the Vintners, to obtain any thing from the King but due impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and liberty of Trading: and whatsoever was thrust in
further, was onely to make them guilty, and plotted and acted
meerly by the Projectors: and since the Vintners never did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
more than a free Trade, and exemption from ruine in Starre-Chamber,
but were rather hindered in their Trade, and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
after: and since it is manifest, That the Projectors in
all those inserted illegall Covenants, had never any respect to
the good of the Vinters, or intnent that they should enjoy them;
They humbly, yet cheerfully, submit herein their Case to the
censure of all good men.</p>
            <p>The next thing objected by <hi>Kilvert,</hi> as an execution and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of the Proiect, is, The taking of 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi>
quart by the Vintner, upon the consumption of Wines:
and this is charged as an exaction, and iniurious to the
Subject.</p>
            <p>For answer hereunto, the Vintners say,</p>
            <p>First, That the necessity of those times was so irresistable,
that without taking 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart, they could not Trade;
and without Trading they could not subsist, for the Imposition
was exacted at the Custome-house; and without paying it, they
could get no wine, though they would have resisted it; and the
question was onely, whether they would take the advance in the
retayl, or starve themselves and their families. And the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
can make it appear, That the Shipscot was not drawn on
with more violence and subtilty, nor no proiect, then this; and
yet if all delinquents in all such violent and subtill proiects,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64241:12"/>
were now questioned, it would shake the foundations of the
State, and disturb the common peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they never took for their Wines, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the prices set by the Lords, and that such taking is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
by the Statute; for if any injury thus was done, it was
done by the Lords, in setting the prices contrary to the meaning
of the Statute; and to do this, the Lords were not solicited by
the Vintners, nor can they conceive it to be, by so inconsiderable
a Company, or to have any respect to the benefit of such a poor
Incorporation. But it is manifest, that they respected the Kings
benefit, and were officious therein, and that much against the
Vintners will, and that thereby they had a great power to
effect their ends, and did thereupon strain their power to
effect the same.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Vintners were not so far favoured by the Lords,
though the Imposition was submitted too, but that they suffred
hindrance, and losse notwithstanding, and the prices of Wines
were set, as if there had been no Imposition laid upon the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but this point falls in with the third branch of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
Charge, and therefore is to be more fully opened, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in the next place.</p>
            <p>3. In the third place therefore, whereas <hi>Kilverts</hi> charge is, That
the Vintners did project, and seek the Imposition for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and profit, and did reap great profit and advantage
by it.</p>
            <p>The Vintners make answer:</p>
            <p>That many things reckon'd up by <hi>Kilvert</hi> as immunities, and
benefits of the Vintners purchased by this Project, were their
Birth-rights, and legall Interests, and had been due to them
without any Imposition: For Example, the Coopers incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by fraudulent brokerly Offices betwixt Merchant and Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and Ivie-like sucking juice out of both, without any root
of their own, were to be restrained of common right. So the
dressing of Meat, selling of Tobacco, exemption from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudiciall
Decree of Star-chamber, the restitution of 6000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.
lent to the King, &amp;c. were appertaining to their Trade, and
due by the Law of the land; and if no Imposition had been, they
ought to have been injoy'd without question or molestation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64241:13"/>
That the taking of the Farm, the restraining Merchants to
sell to any except Vintners, the dealing in Wine-licenses, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Imposition of 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Tun, &amp;c. which <hi>Kilvert</hi> recites,
and priviledges and benefits sued for by the Vintners, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no way beneficiall, nor sued for, nor at all obtained by the
Vintners, though the contrary was pretended in all.</p>
            <p>That whereas <hi>Kilvert</hi> affirms, that the Vintners have gained
by the Project above 200000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. arising to them three severall
wayes; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By beating down the Merchants prices. 2. By
the advance of 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart, retailed. 3. By selling
Malagoes and Sherries for Canaries. To each of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and first, as to the first they reply:</p>
            <p>That the Vintners (to give a true relation of things) being
much incited, and forced to submit to the Imposition, amongst
many other Objections used this as one.</p>
            <p>That they being loaded with the Imposition, could not sell
so cheap as others, and by that means all Noblemen, Gentlemen,
and others, would buy of Merchants and Coopers, and not of
them, as formerly; and so a great part of their Trade and gain
would fall away. To salve this, the Kings Agents answered,
The Merchants and Coopers shall be bound up, and shall fell to
none but you. But as this was offred to the Vintners, that
without utter ruine they might submit to the Kings benefit,
and not desired by the Vintners out of any covetous desire to
Inrich themselves by other mens losse, so it was but onely offred,
and never intended, or faithfully performed. Howsoever, the
Merchants (by the advice of <hi>Roger Kilvert,</hi> Brother to our main
Proiector) were so politick, as to pretend, that this restraint,
or rather umbrage of restraint, was unequall to them; and
therefore to ease them in this particular, a remedy was invented
by obtruding a <hi>medium</hi> of 5000 Tun French Wine, and 4000
Tun Spanish yearly, upon the Vintner at such high rates set
in favour of the Merchant, to the great disadvantage of the
Vintner.</p>
            <p>That on the 15 of <hi>March,</hi> 1637. at a generall Court this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
Project was proposed; but the out-cry of the Vintners
was, that it could not take place without generall discontent,
inconvenience, confusion, difficulty, and disturbance of Trade,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64241:13"/>
and therefore they humbly prayed against it, as in the Hall-book
is <hi>verbatim</hi> registred.</p>
            <p>That the Proiect being hereupon much indangered after so
fair a progression of it, upon the 20 of <hi>March</hi> the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
Marq. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Sir <hi>I. Banks</hi> then Atturney generall,
convented some of the Merchants and Vintners before them, and
then regulated the Vintners, to admit of the <hi>Medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That upon the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> the same was discovered to the
Generality, and their consent was obtained, although their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
thereof was nothing altred, for being so snafled and muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled
as they now were, it had little booted them to reject so
potent an Order. And the Merchants could not conceal what
advantage they had hereby over the Vintners: For Example,
<hi>Roger Kilvert</hi> in derision to the Vintners complaints, answered;
The Vintners are free from the Star-chamber, and are now the
Kings white-boyes, and shall the Merchants inioy nothing?</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Medium</hi> in it self was a great, and violent pressure,
but as it was abused by craft, it grew intollerable. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of it self, were;</p>
            <p>First, that it necessitated the Vintners to buy too great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Wines from the French and Spanish Companies: for
by this means the Vintners, whose Primitive undoubted right
it was, to trade as Merchants, and had been in suit about the
same, were now defeated of that Trade, they being now scarce
able to vend, and retail so much as their <hi>Medium</hi> proportion
extended to.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it iniured the Vintners in the prices and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Wines, for the Merchants before were allowed to sell
at such rates, but the Vintners might bargain at pleasure, they
had an open and free market, and commonly they bought under
the prices set, and they pleased themselves with a free choice;
whereas now, the Vintner is confined to a <hi>Medium</hi> price, as
well as a <hi>Medium</hi> proportion; and as the Merchant is allowed
to sell, so he is constrained to buy; nay if the Merchant will
needs require more, the Vintner must needs rise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>That the cozenages and abuses of the <hi>Medium,</hi> were yet
worse then the <hi>Medium</hi> it self; for under colour thereof, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64241:14"/>
Vintners were deceived in the quantities of Wine: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
sometimes having bought of a <hi>Medium</hi> Merchant so many
Tuns, and hoping thereby to be discharged of their <hi>Medium</hi>
proportion, the Merchant would neverthelesse pretend, that
the Wines were none of his, that he was but intrusted to sell
them as a Factor for another, and so this was no discharge for
the <hi>Medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, other Merchants which were not of the <hi>Medium</hi>
contract, would get the <hi>Mediu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               </hi> Merchants to patronize and sell
their Wines, and so under that pretext, the Vintners were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take off small Wines at the <hi>Medium</hi> price, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they might have bought cheaper.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by this means there was no end of the <hi>Medium</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
for whatsoever quantities the Vintner took from the
Merchant, the Merchant still complained that his proportion
was not taken off, and the Vintners for want of true intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and correspondence amongst themselves, were not able
to evince the contrary.</p>
            <p>In the next place also, in the qualities of Wines, the Vintners
were further damnified by this <hi>Medium</hi> contract; for no vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
merchantable Wines might be refused from the Merchant
by the vertue of the contract, and all Wines almost were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
good according to the contract: Whereupon it happened,
that the Vintner was forced to take too great stores of course
Wines to satisfie the Merchant at excessive rates, and yet in the
mean time to satisfie customers with richer Wines (Wine being
a matter of meer pleasure) he was of necessity to provide other
store, of better Wines at an extraordinary rate.</p>
            <p>And in the last place, though this burthen of the <hi>Medium</hi>
was introduced to gratifie the Merchant for his restraint, and to
ballance in the Vintner the priviledge of suppressing the Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and some other priviledges; yet neither was the Merchant
restrained, nor the Cooper suppressed, nor any other promise
intirely performed; so that the very pretences of ease, proved in
the end burthens; and the promises of help, troubles; for the
greater load being once laid on, the staff presently which should
have made it the more supportable, was taken away, or denyed.
The Merchants did sell, nay (as they were able) did under-sell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64241:14"/>
to Noblemen, Country Vintners, &amp;c. more commonly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Coopers got Tickets from Alderman <hi>Abel,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
passed for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>etty Merchants; and having gotten Tickets for
once, they made the same serve for many times, and sometimes
without Tickets at all they sold Wines by stealth, and they did
not alwayes deal by whole-sale, but sometimes in Rundlets, and
serve Funerals: and all this after the Vintners had taken off a
great quantity of ill Wines at a great losse from their hands, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an agreement that they should relinquish that Trade for
the future. And at all this Alderman <hi>Abel</hi> did connive, and as
is probable, made a great advantage by it; being in that respect
more inexcusable then <hi>Kilvert,</hi> who having a Brother of the
Merchants Company, and not being himself a Vintner, as the
Alderman had been, may be held lesse blameable. But
to shut up this point, <hi>Kilverts</hi> own words are in print; when
the <hi>Medium</hi> seemed grievous to the Vintners, he himself took
a journey to <hi>Barwick</hi> for them, and there obtained order and
direction from His Majestie to the Lords, to ease and discharge
the Vintners of it, which was done accordingly: and hence it
seems, the Vintners, if they had gotten 60000 <hi>l.</hi> in three yeers,
by beating down the prices of the Merchant (as he before sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested)
or had had any advantage against the Merchant, they had
been very inconsiderate, in sending him to <hi>Barwick,</hi> and giving
him 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to deliver them from such a profit.</p>
            <p>The second gain of the Vintners (as is suggested by <hi>Kilvert</hi>)
is in retailing at 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart, dearer then the usuall
price of Wines, and by this advance upon the consumtion of
of them since Midsummer, 1638. when the Vintner first retailed
at 7<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 14<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. he sayes the Vintner has gain'd above 130000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vintners answer hereunto contains five things very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
but our stumbling block had need be first removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kilvert</hi> in all his accounts, speaks of so many Tuns of French,
and so many of Spanish, and yet the Vintners buy Spanish
Wines by the Butt and Pipe, which are but half a Tun; so that a
Pipe of Spanish Wine is equivalent to a Tun of French, and is
commonly as long in drawing, and as much stock is imploid in
the one as in the other, and setting aside that a Butt or Pipe
takes not up so much room in the Cellar as a Tun, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64241:15"/>
difference to be observed: and therefore the Vintners gain
ought to be alike in both, and <hi>Kilvert</hi> ought not to pretend, as
if the Vintner bought of Tuns alike.</p>
            <p>This being premised, the Vintners first answer is;</p>
            <p>That <hi>Kilvert</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>es most untruly compute from all Wines
bought in by the Vintner, to all uttered by them, for the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
sells not by the quart above two parts of three commonly of
Wines bought in grosse, and a full third he sells to the Country
Vintners, and others, as he buyes in grosse, and sometimes his
benefit is small, and sometimes none.</p>
            <p>The second answer is, That the Charge of retailing Vintners,
is far greater then of other Tradesmen, for in the retailing of
1000 <hi>l.</hi> or 1200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> there is necessarily required at
least 300 <hi>l.</hi> charge, and yet other Trades will retail more with
half the charge. And experience in this, is a demonstration suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
convincing; for if there be in <hi>London</hi> 500 Vintners,
there are not above 40 of them rich men, the greatest part by
far is poor and indigent, and the Merchants themselves have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testated
this before the Lords of the Councell, and the Honorable
Committee; witnesse Capt. <hi>Royden,</hi> &amp;c. This is an Argument,
wherein no errour can be, and which will admit of no answer.</p>
            <p>The third answer is, That drawing Vintners are subject to
many casualties and misadventures in their Trade, many times
Wines decay upon their hands, and leak away, so that sometimes
they sell to Vineger-men and Distillers, and sometimes retail
at losse.</p>
            <p>The fourth answer is, that Retailers are often constrained to
give more for Wines, then the prices set by the Lords; and of
late yeers they have given more for French Wines, by 3. 4. 5. 6 <hi>l.
per</hi> Tun, then the rates set; and for Spanish, 10. 20. 30<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. a peece
extraordinary.</p>
            <p>The fifth answer is, That since the Imposition, as the retailing
price has been advanced for the Vintners benefit, so the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
price in grosse has been advanced also to the Vintners
hindrance as much: so that since the Imposition, the Vintners
condition has not been bettered: For Example, in 1636. and
before that yeer the Vintner bought Canary at 17<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Pipe, and
sold at 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. he bought Sacks at 15 <hi>l. per</hi> Butt, and retail'd at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64241:15"/>
10<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. but in 1637, 1638, &amp;c. he bought Canary at 19 <hi>l.</hi> and Sacks
at 17 <hi>l.</hi> so that if no Imposition had been then levied, yet the
retailing price ought to have been advanced. French Wines also
have been of late more scarce and dear; and therefore in 1634,
1635, 1636, &amp;c. the Vintner bought the best Gascoin Wine at
18 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, and smaller Wines at 15 <hi>l.</hi> and then the selling
price was 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart; but the buying price now for the best
Wines, is 19 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, and for the smallest 17 <hi>l.</hi> and yet the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
price is but 7<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. So the set rates have been, and yet the
Merchants have often sold above those rates also: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wilcox</hi> has boughe Canaries of <hi>Roger Kilvert</hi> himself
(the supposed Projector of the <hi>Medium</hi>) at above 20 <hi>l. per</hi> peece,
and was fain to pay down the money required above the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
as a fine before hand; and many the like Examples might
be given. And whereas it is reckon'd by <hi>Kilvert,</hi> that 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi>
quart is answerable to 4 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, this is most untrue; for by
reason of want of Gage, Lees, Leakage, and other misfortunes
(admitting that Wines do not change, or sour) the Vintners
cannot draw above 220 gallons; so that in respect thereof, no
lesse then 1 penny in 4 can be allowed the Vintner. For note,
that in a Tun of French Wine there ought to be 252 gallons.
And note, that though Sherries are commonly full gage, yet
Malagoes and Canarries are under gage, and every Pipe wants
8 gallons of full gage, besides as much Lees, and besides the
damage of Leakage, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Note also, That though some rich French Wines want not
of gage, yet the smaller Wines want 20 Gallons; and high
Countrey Wines, which are the richest of all, want so much of
gage, that a Tun is not above five Hogsheads. In this therefore
Capt: <hi>Langham</hi> did ill to abet <hi>Kilvert,</hi> and he is most easily to be
disproved: and all these losses also to the Vintner mentioned,
are such as come along with his Wines when he first buyes them,
and are over and above casualty at home in his own Celler. So
then supposing 3 <hi>l.</hi> answerable in the Tun to every 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. raised in
the quart, and to give account of that 3 <hi>l.</hi> The Vintners say, that
there was 1 <hi>l.</hi> new Imposition taken by the King at the Custome-house,
before the srme which Sir <hi>Abraham Daws</hi> farmed; and
that by this new Proiect since 1637. 2 <hi>l.</hi> more also has been taken
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64241:16"/>
by the King, besides what the Merchants have advanced in their
price, partly by reason of Impositions set in <hi>Spain,</hi> and partly by
the dearth of Wines in <hi>France;</hi> and so for divers yeers last past,
the Vintner in very truth, has been but a meer drudge to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectors,
employing himself, his servants, and estate, to supply the
Common-wealth, either for losse, or no considerable profit.</p>
            <p>The third way of gain to the Vintner, which <hi>Kilvert</hi> calls a
super-project, is, By selling of Sacks and Malagoes at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Canaries, the gain whereof is 12<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Tun extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and this way since <hi>Feb.</hi> 1637. The Vintner, as <hi>Kilvert</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
has gotten 30000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and his brother <hi>Roger</hi> in this, is his
faithfull abettor.</p>
            <p>The Vintners, in the first place, refer themselves for answer
hereunto, to the competent proofs of their accusers, desiring only,
That the same kennell which was once produced, and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before the Committee, may no more be admitted.</p>
            <p>And in the second place, if proofs fail on the other side, they
shall make it appear on their side, That few Vintners in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
vent any considerable quantities of Sherries or Malagoes by
retayl. A great number of them may safely depose, That they
scarce draw 4 Butts of Sacks in a yeer.</p>
            <p>In the third place also they say, That those Vintners which do
deal in any considerable quantity of Malagoes, and Sherries, do
for the most part, buy them for the Countrey Trade, and utter
them again in grosse, at a very small encrease of profit.</p>
            <p>And fourthly they say, That such as drive a Country Trade,
do not usually send down their Sacks in Butts, as they buy them,
but in Graves Hogsheads; and it is very certain, That 2 Butts,
<hi>viz.</hi> of Canary or Malago, will but little more than fill 3 Hogs-heads,
being Rackt; and after this account, the price of a Butt of
Sack, set at 17<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and a Hogshead being sold at a 11<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Two Butts
are bought at 34<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. yet in three Hogsheads yeeld but 33 <hi>l.</hi> so that
were it not for some bargain sometimes under the prices set, the
Vintners might sell at losse. For example; <hi>Tho. Dudly</hi> justifies,
That from 1637. till 1640. he has sold in grosse to Countrey
Vintners 250 Tun of French Wine, at 5<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart, and under;
and 180 Tun Spanish, Canaries, not above 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and Sacks, not
above 11<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> quart, besides many losses by trust, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64241:16"/>
this, his Books of yeerly Accounts, will be sufficient evidence.
And many more like examples may be alleadged.</p>
            <p>And here let it now not be omitted, That <hi>Kilvert</hi> has divers
other generall wayes of blinding and puzzling such as are not
knowing in the Vintners mysteries; for first, he charges all
Wines imported at the Custome-house by Merchants, as
bought by Vintners, although he cannot be ignorant that Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Merchants for other Countreyes, <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> men, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others, do vent and buy at least a moity of Wines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
the Vintners scarce compassing the other moity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He allows and deducts 15 <hi>per cent.</hi> for leaking at
Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he conceals the great quantities of Lees, which, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, the Merchant pours out of one leaky vessell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and sells for neat to the Vintner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He makes no allowance for leakage, or other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
incident to Vintners in their own Cellars.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He passes over want of gage, as a thing scarce worth
mentioning, thinkingit sufficient to say, That the richest French
Wines are commonly full-gage: but the fallacy of this hath
been discovered.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He insists upon the late cheapnesse of Spanish
Wines, and yet they were scarce ever dearer before the Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in the mean time passes over the great dearth of French
Wines; for the truth is, Spanish Wines have not been so cheap
as to make the Vintner whole for the dearth of <hi>France,</hi> but the
dearth of <hi>France</hi> has been so great, as to devour all profit by
<hi>Spain,</hi> and more.</p>
            <p>And here it may be noted, That the old rates was about the
beginning of K. <hi>Char:</hi> that the retayling price of French
Wines were set at 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>per</hi> quart, when the Merchants prices were
no higher than now, or of late, since the Imposition.</p>
            <p>To draw now to a conclusion; since the Vintners can make
it so visible to all that their Company (excepting some few of
them) is poor and necessitous; and that this Project for these
3 or 4 yeers last past, has impoverisht and impayr'd them more
than formerly; and since they have so satisfied the Honourable
Committee therein, that <hi>Master Green</hi> has confest it to be the
opinion of the whole Committee, they desire that it may be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64241:17"/>
weighed, for the Vintners have not onely suffred much by this
Project, but they knew long before that it could bring nothing
but losse and hazard upon them, and that was one cause why
they opposed it so long; for if it had been meerly illegall, and
not very detrimentall also, it cannot be imagined that they
should with so much stoutnesse and constancy, and hard endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
have stood out aginst the violence of it so many yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
They desire also that their Case may be warily severed
and unfolded; if they have been delinquents, let them be fined
as delinquents, according to the just weight of their severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencies:
if they have been gayners by the Proiect, let them
make restitution according to their severall gains: but when
they are not prosecuted as delinquents, nor believed to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
let not <hi>Kilvert,</hi> without assigning what third way he will
require it, challenge from them 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in grosse. Let it also
be considered, That it is impossible in nature for any humane
judgement exactly to descry, amongst all the Vintners, who
were the greatest delinquents or gainers: and their Cases being
different in both, no one indifferent sentence can justly involve
all alike in both: if they have been delinquents, it shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that they may be punisht, though they are no gainers; and
if they are gainers, restitution may be demanded, though they
prove no delinquents: but let not both those tearms be blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as if in this case they were inseparable. Howsoever, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and force, and fraud so extraordinary shall not excuse the
Vintners, as it does almost all the Kingdom in the Shipscot, and
other late projects, if the calamity of those times shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
them which consented to the Imposition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all did
not consent alike. Some were more active, some more passive:
a great part was not at the Hall, but had iust cause of absence,
when any illegall thing was proposed; and a great part being
present, were concluded by the maiority of other men votes,
and a great part of Voters did most unwillingly vote for fear of
ruine; and yet all these are not equally culpable, nor yet now
possibly severable. So also if the Proiect be held gainfull, yet
it could not be gainfull to all alike, for all Vintners do not
trade in the same quantities; nor do all, trading in the same
quantities, finde the same gains coming in by their Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64241:17"/>
nor the same blessing of God prospering them in both:
and yet in this case, justice ought to proceed with equall respect
had, aswell to Geometricall, as to Arithmeticall proportion. And
as for the second part of the Accusation; it cannot be doubted,
but that the chiefest authors, are to be accounted the chiefest
actors also in the businesse. It is not so difficult to bring a horse
to any obedience, and to the endurance of any load after he is
once thorowly broken, as it is at first to break him: and this
<hi>Kilvert, &amp;c.</hi> found trne in the Vintners; for after he had once
prevailed, that they should not resist the Imposition any longer,
by the same power (and lesse) after, he might make them beg for
it, and seem desirous of it; nay, in shew, contend for it: yet still
this shews them the more servile and oppressed, and him the
more tyrannous and uniust.</p>
            <p>This might suffice for the three branches of <hi>Kilverts</hi> Charge:
but it is evident, That he is not an Accuser onely, but a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator
also. He speaks of divers arts, whereby the Vintners sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate,
and adulterate Wines; he mentions Saw-dust of Deal,
Bilberries, and the like, as used by the Vintners, to corrupt and
falsifie Wines, or to put off Wines corrupted and falsified: if
this be true, he ought in iustice to the Common-wealth, he
ought out of iustice to Justice it self (whose eyes he now seeks
to blinde) to reveal the same; and the persons offending, and
the times, and certainties of each offence: but if it be not true,
he ought to confesse himself, to be himself; that is, a professed
perverter of Justice, and enemy of Truth. Whilst the High-Commission
tyrannized, there was no fitter Blood-hound than
<hi>Kilvert</hi> to be officious in that Court, yet even in that Court he
was found too corrupt, too libidinous, too treacherous; many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were exhibited against him, and at last he was reiected, as a
person infamous, and scandalous to Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction.
His next Scene that he entred upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, was the Star-chamber; and for
a good season, he playd there the part of a rare artist; and having
given admirable proof to the world of his exquisite skill in
producing Deponents, and managing of Oathes; he left it at last,
uncertain, Whether that Court contributed more to his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or he that Courts ruine: but the wonder of all is, that he
dares yet appear in Parliament with any confidence, or in a time
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64241:18"/>
of Reformation, publish such accusations as he does, wherein
there is no one entire, solid truth; nay, nor scarce any parcell of
truth, which materially tends to his own iustification, or to the
Vintners confutation. Since the depending of this Case, some
witnesses have been produced by <hi>Kilvert,</hi> or his brother <hi>Roger<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
or both, to depose against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and many other Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that they sold all their Sherries and Malagoes at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Canaries. These were disproved before the Committee,
and indeed by their deposition, they must have known that in the
Vintners Cellars, which the Vintners themselves could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
know. In one Pamphlet also <hi>Kilvert</hi> moving the House
to retact their Votes concerning his guilt; He is bold to move
them to it the rather, because of the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which he hopes
to recover out of the Vintners, as if this could be any motive to
such iust Judges: and at another time he is not ashamed to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up his good services, and merits to the State. But sure,
though the man forgets where he is, or to whom he speaks, his
Judges cannot forget who he is, and what he alleadges. Of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Kilvert</hi> nothing need to be said, but that betwixt him and his
brother <hi>Richard</hi> there is a true resemblance, and lively naturall
stamp of Brother-hood; and in the <hi>Medium</hi> Project, that his
brain was the more pregnant of the two. Of Alderman <hi>Abel,</hi>
sufficient is related in the story of <hi>Kilvert;</hi> he was as fit an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
for <hi>Kilvert,</hi> as <hi>Kilvert</hi> was for those rigorous, projecting
times.</p>
            <p>Sathans two great attributes are, that he is a Lyer, that he is a
Murtherer: lying is his means, murder is his end, when he tempts
into sin, and when he accuses for sin, he is false in both, but his
falshood in both ever tends to destruction. The Vintners
have found both these Sathanicall attributes very eminent of
late in their adversaries. The same men which first assayled
them to draw them into the Project, are now their greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
for the Proiect; and there was not more deceit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Proiect legall then, then now in making it so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and it is hard to say, Whether greater ruine was contrived
to them when they were to submit to it, or now, when they are
to be punisht for it.</p>
