            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Q. 1. <hi>WHat doth God require of us in our dependance on him, that he may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by us, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>That we</hi> (a) Worship <hi>him</hi> (b) <hi>in and by the wayes of his own appointment. (a)</hi> Matth. 4.10. Rev. 14.7. Deut. 6.13. chap. 10.20. (<hi>b</hi>) Lev. 10.1, 2, 3. Exod. 24.3. Gen. 18.19. Joshua 23.6, 8. Zach. 14.16.</p>
            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>By the <hi>Worship</hi> of God inquired after, not that which is <hi>naturall on morall,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59624:3"/>
which is required in the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is intended. Such is our faith and confidence in him, our fear of him, our subjection of soul and conscience unto him, as the great Soveraign Lord, first cause, last end, Judge and Rewarder of all men; the Law whereof was originally written in the heart of Man, and hath been variously improved and directed by new Revelations and Institutions. And this Worship is called <hi>naturall,</hi> upon a double Account.</p>
               <p>First, Because it depends on the <hi>nature</hi> of God, a due perception and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, makes all this Worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly necessary: for none can <hi>know</hi> God, but it is his duty <hi>to glorifie him as God,</hi> that is, to believe in him, love him, trust him, and call upon him, which all are therefore <hi>cursed</hi> that do not, <hi>Psalm</hi> 79.6. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, Because it was in the principle of it concreated with the <hi>nature</hi> of man, as that which suited, directed, and enabled him to answer the Law of his Creation, requiring this obedience of him in his dependance on God. And this Worship is <hi>invariable</hi>: but it concerneth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59624:3"/>
those <hi>outward wayes</hi> and means whereby God hath appointed that faith, and love, and fear of him to be exercised and expressed unto his glory. And this kind of <hi>Worship</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it depend not upon the <hi>nature of God,</hi> but upon his free and arbitrary disposal, and so was of old liable unto alterations; yet God did ever strictly require in the several states and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that his Church hath gone through in the World. And this is that, which most commonly in the Scripture is called by the name of <hi>the worship of God</hi>; as that whereby all the acceptable actings of the souls of men towards him are expressed, and the only way of owning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him in the World, as also of entertaining a visible intercourse with him. This therefore he calls for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires indispensibly of all that draw nigh to him, and that because he is <hi>the Lord our God, Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12, 13. For his observance hereof, doth he so approve of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. And sets it down as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Law unto all others, that in a holy observation thereof, <hi>he will be sanctified in all that draw nigh unto him, Lev.</hi> 10.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59624:4"/>
1, 2, 3. his commands also concerning it, are multiplyed in the Scripture, with the approbation of all those that attend unto them. We may not think to find acceptance with God, or to inherit the promises, if supposing our selves to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto him in Worship <hi>internall</hi> and <hi>naturall,</hi> we neglect that which is <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and of his free appointment: for besides, that we renounce thereby our inward dependance on him also, in not observing his commands, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in transgressing an <hi>Institution,</hi> we become wholly useless unto all the ends of his Glory in the World, which is not the way to come to an enjoyment of him. Neither, do we only express and profess our inward <hi>morall naturall worship</hi> of God hereby, by which means it becomes the principall way and instrument of faith and trust exerting themselves in our obedience, but also it is a most effectual <hi>help</hi> and assistance unto the principle of that natural worship, strengthening the <hi>habit</hi> of it, and <hi>exciting</hi> it unto all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>actings,</hi> unto its increase and growth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>That God is to be worshipped, and that according to his own will and appointment, is a</hi> (a) <hi>principall branch of the Law of our creation, written in our hearts; the</hi> (b) <hi>sense whereof is renewed in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; but the wayes and means of that worship, depend meerly on Gods</hi> (c) <hi>Soveraign pleasure and Institution.

            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>These two things all men see by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>First, That God, however they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in their apprehensions of him, would be and was to be worshipped with some <hi>outward solemn</hi> worship. So that although some are reported to have even cast off all knowledge and sense of <hi>a divine being,</hi> yet never any were heard of, that came
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59624:5"/>
to an acknowledgement of any God, true or false, but they all consented, that he was constantly and solemnly to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. And that not only by <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall Persons,</hi> but by <hi>Societies</hi> together, that so they might own and honour him whom they took for their God. And thus far outward worship is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the first Commandment; namely, that the inward be exercised and expressed. When we take God for our God, we take him to worship him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12, 13. Other thoughts, namely of <hi>inward</hi> worship, without <hi>outward</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at all, or any time, or in any way, are but a covert unto <hi>Atheism.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, This also they are lead to an apprehension of, by the same light whereby they are <hi>a Law unto themselves, Rom.</hi> 2.14. that God would be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the <hi>way,</hi> and by the <hi>means</hi> that he himself appointed and approved, whence none among the <hi>Heathen</hi> themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to appoint wayes and <hi>Ceromo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of Worship, but still they pretended to derive the knowledge of them from the <hi>Gods themselves,</hi> of whom they reckoned that every one would be worshipped in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59624:5"/>
his own way. And because notwitstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this pretence, being left of God, and deluded of <hi>Satan,</hi> they did invent false and foolish wayes of worship, not only not appointed of God, but such as were unsuited unto those <hi>inbred notions</hi> which they had of his nature and excellencie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the Apostle convinces and disproves them, as men acting against the <hi>light of nature,</hi> and principles of reason, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. they might have seen, <hi>that,</hi> in their Idolatry they answered not their own inbred conceptions of the <hi>Divine power and Godhead,</hi> so as to glorifie him as God. And in the like manner doth he argue at large, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, the <hi>inbred light of nature</hi> could not conduct any of the Sons of Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This alone is contained in the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that God was to be worshipped they knew, and that he was to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by wayes and means of his own appointment they knew; but what those wayes and means were, they knew not. These alwayes depended on Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign will and pleasure, and he made them known to whom he pleased, <hi>Psalm</hi> 147.19, 20. And although some of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59624:6"/>
wayes which he doth appoint, may seem to have a great compliance in them unto the <hi>light of nature,</hi> yet in his worship he accepts them not on that account; but meerly on that of his own institution; and this as he hath declared his will about in the second Commandment; so he hath severely forbidden the <hi>addition</hi> of our own inventions unto what he hath appointed: sending us for instruction unto him alone, whom he hath endowed with <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> to reveal his will, and ordain his worship, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.13.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>In and by the written word only; which contains a full and perfect Revelation of the will of God; as to his whole worship, and all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it:</hi> John 5.39. Isa. 8.20. Luke 16.19. 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17. 1 Pet. 1.19. Deut. 4.2. chap. 12.32. Joshua 1.7. Prov. 30.6. Rev. 22.20. Isaiah 29.13.</p>

               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>The <hi>End</hi> wherefore God granted his word unto the Church, was, that thereby it might be instructed in his mind and will, as to what concerns the worship and obedience that he requireth of us, and which is accepted with him. This the whole Scripture it self every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares and speaks out unto all that do receive it; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. with the residue of the testimonies above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited do declare. It supposeth, it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that of our selves we are ignorant how God is, how he ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. Moreover it manifests him to be a jealous God, exercising that holy property of his nature in an especial manner about his worship; rejecting and despising every thing that is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, that is not of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4, 5.</p>
               <p>That we may know what is so, he hath made a Revelation of his mind and will in his <hi>written word,</hi> that is, the <hi>Scripture</hi>; and to the end that we might expect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from thence alone in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and act therein accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59624:7"/>
                  <hi>First, he sends us and directs us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> expresly for that purpose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and not once intimates in the least, any other way or means of instruction unto the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He frequently affirms, that it is sufficient, able, and perfect to guide us therein, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Psalm</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. and whereas he hath expresly given it unto us for that end, if there be any want or defect therein, it must arise from hence, that either God would not, or could not give unto us a perfect Revelation of his will; neither of which can be imagined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He hath commanded us to observe all whatsoever he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therein, and not to make any addition thereunto, <hi>Joshua</hi> 1.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.20. And,</p>

               <p>The <hi>externall</hi> worship whereof we speak, being as was shewed before, not <hi>naturall</hi> or moral, arising necessarily from the dependance of the rationall creature on God, as its first Cause, chiefest Good, last End, and Soveraign Lord, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the meer will and pleasure of God, determining how he will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and glorified in the world, was alwayes <hi>alterable</hi> by him, by whom it was appointed. And whereas ever since the entrance of sin into the World, God had alwayes respect unto the promise of the Lord Christ, and his mediation, in whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59624:8"/>
alone he will be glorified, and faith in whom he aimed to begin and increase in all his worship, he hath suited his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the means thereof, to that dispensation of Light and knowledge of him, which he was pleased at any time to grant. Thus immediately after the giving of the <hi>promise,</hi> he appointed <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> for the great means of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; as to glorifie himself expresly by Mens off ring unto him of the principal good things which he had given them, so to instruct them in the faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the expectation of the <hi>great sacrifice</hi> for sin that was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the promised seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. These were the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worship of God in the World after the entrance of sin. Hereunto he nextly added <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as an express sign of the Covenant, with the grace of it, which he called <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed unto by Jesus Christ, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. And to the same general end and purpose, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards superadded the <hi>Passeover</hi> with its attendant institutions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.23, 24. And then the whole Law of institutions contained in Ordinances, by the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59624:8"/>
of Angels on Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod</hi> 20. So by sundry degrees, he built up that fabrick of his <hi>outward worship,</hi> which was suited in his infinite wisdom, unto his own glory, and the edification of his Church, untill the exhibition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seed, or the coming of Christ in the flesh, and the accomplishment of the work of his mediation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that season were those Ordinances to serve, and no longer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 11, 12. And then were they removed by the same authority whereby they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and appointed, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 18, 19, 20. So that though God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow, that Men, upon what pretence soever should make any alteration in the worship appointed by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by adding unto it, any thing of their own, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ought that he had commanded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matter or manner, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he knew that it was to abide but for a season, but commanded all men straitly to attend to the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it whilest it was by him continued in force, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. yet he alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unto himself the Soveraign power of altering, changing, or utterly abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it at his own pleasure: which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he exerted in the Gospel as to all the meer Institutions of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>It was shewed before, that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Old Testament had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the coming of Christ in the flesh, who was the <hi>end of the Law, Rom.</hi> 10.4. and thereupon they were subject to <hi>alteration</hi> or <hi>abolition</hi> upon a twofold account.</p>
               <p>First, Because that which they were appointed principally to instruct the Church in, and to direct it unto the expectation of, was upon his coming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished and fulfilled, so that their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59624:10"/>
end was absolutely taken away; and they could no more truly teach the mind and will of God: for they would still direct unto that which was to come, after it was past and accomplished. And this is that which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously proves, and fully confirms in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> especially in the 7, 8, 9. and 10. Chapters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord Christ during their continuance, was to come as the Lord over his whole house, with more full and ample authority, then <hi>any</hi> of those, whom God had employed in the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his Ordinances of old, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted withall, Heb. 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>He spake in former dayes by the Prophets, but now by the Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all,</hi> Chap. 3.5, 6. <hi>Christ as a Son over his own house, whose house are we.</hi> And therefore they are all to be at his disposall, to confirm or remove, as he saw reason and occasion. And this he did <hi>virtually</hi> in the sacrifice of himself, or the blood of his Cross, fulfilling and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of them all, John 19.30. <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the middle wall of partition, abolishing in his flesh the enmity, even the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59624:10"/>
Law of Commandments contained in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinances, he took it out of the way, nayling it to his Cross,</hi> Eph. 2.15. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> by his Spirit in the Apostles, and the doctrine of the Gospel preached by them, Acts 15.10, 11. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoak upon the neck of the Disciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear, but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they,</hi> Gal. 3.24, 25. <hi>Wherefore the Law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer render a Schoolmaster,</hi> Chap. 5.2, 3, 4. and <hi>eventually</hi> or providentially, when he caused <hi>sacrifice and offering to cease, by the Prince of the people, that came with an Army making desolate, to destroy both City and Sanctuary,</hi> Dan. 9.26, 27. according to his prediction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.2. But now under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the worship that is appointed in the Gospel, is founded in, and built upon what is already past and accomplished, namely
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59624:11"/>
the death and life of Jesus Christ with the sacrifice and atonement for sin made thereby, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25, 26. which can never be again performed; neither is there any thing else to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, either <hi>needfull</hi> or possible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. So that there is not any ground left for any new institution of worship, or any alteration in those that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy instituted. Nor,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Can any one be expected to come from God with a greater and more full authority for the Revelation of his mind, than that wherewith his only Son was accompanied; which yet must be, if any alterations were to be made in the appointments of worship that he hath instituted in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>For no Inferior, nor an equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can abolish or alter that which is already appointed, so as to give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto the consciences of men in obedience unto such alterations. And therefore because there arose not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like unto <hi>Moses</hi> under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, there could be no alteration made in his institutions, but the Church was bound severely to observe them all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59624:11"/>
untill the coming of Christ, Mal. 4.4. <hi>Remember ye the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>my servant, which I commanded unto him in</hi> Horeb, <hi>for all</hi> Israel <hi>with his Statutes and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; and that because there <hi>arose not a Prophet afterwards in</hi> Israel <hi>like unto</hi> Moses, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face, Deut.</hi> 34.10. And our Apostle to prove the right of Christ to alter the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Law, layes his foundation in manifesting that he was <hi>above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Heb. 1.4. <hi>being made so much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Angels, as he hath by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance obtained a more excellent name than they,</hi> and that because the Law was given by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of Angels, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.2. and so also that he was greater than <hi>Moses,</hi> chap. 3.3. <hi>For this man was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of more glory than</hi> Moses, <hi>in as much as he who hath builded the house, hath more honour than the house</hi>; Moses <hi>verily was faithfull in all his house, as a servant, but Christ as a Son over his own house</hi>: Because <hi>Moses</hi> was the Law-giver, and the Mediator between God and Man in the giving of the Law. Now if this be the sole foundation and warrant of the alteration made of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59624:12"/>
Ordinances by Christ, namely that he was greater and exalted above all those whose <hi>Ministry</hi> was used in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the Law, unless some can be thought to be greater, and exalted in authority above the Son of God, there can be no alteration expected in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Gospel.</p>

               <p>All our faith, all our obedience in this life, what ever may be obtained, or attained unto therein, it all belongs unto our walking with God in the Covenant of Grace, wherein God dwells with Men, and they are his people, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is with them to be their God. Other wayes of communion with him, of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him, of enjoyment of him on this side Heaven and Glory, he hath not appointed nor revealed. Now this is the Covenant that God hath made with his people; <hi>That he will put his Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and will be to them a God, and they shall be to him a people, and he will be mercifull to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will he remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8.9, 10, 11, 12. And what ever Men attain unto, it is by vertue of the grace of that Covenant, nor is there any Grace promised in the Covenant to lead men in this <hi>life,</hi> or to give them up unto a state of perfection short of glory.

               <p>This is the first thing that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to attend unto, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Ordinances of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; namely, that we therein <hi>sanctifie his name,</hi> the greatest duty that we are called unto in this world. This he layes down as the generall rule of all we do herein Levit. 10.3. <hi>I will,</hi> saith he, <hi>be sanctified in them that come nigh unto me, and before all the people I will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> Whatever we do in his worship, we must do it that he may be sanctified, or whatever we do is an abomination to him. Now the principall wayes how we may herein sanctifie the name of God are expressed. As,</p>
               <p>First, When in every Ordinance, we consider his appointment of it, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our souls and consciences unto his <hi>authority</hi> therein which if we observe any thing in his worship but what he hath appointed, we cannot do it. Not formality, not custome, not the precepts of Men, not any thing but the <hi>authority</hi> and command of God, is to be respected
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59624:15"/>
in this obedience. This is the First thing that Faith regards in Divine Worship; it rests not in any thing, closeth nor with any thing, but what It discerns that God hath commanded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it eyes his Authority as he requireth it, Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine honour? if I be Master, where is my fear?</hi> Rom. 14.11. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then unto the authority of God appointing his worship, is a principal means of sanctifying the name of God therein. This was the solemn sanction of all his institutions of old, Deut. 6.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6, 7. <hi>Hear O</hi> Israel, <hi>the Lord our God is one Lord, and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might; and these words which I command thee this Day, shall be in thy heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children.</hi> And the observation of them he presseth on this account, that the people might fear that <hi>glorious and dreadfull name, the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 28.58. which name he had so often engaged in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59624:16"/>
commands, saying thou shalt do it, <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> And in the New Testament, our Lord Jesus Christ proposeth his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the foundation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and our observation of all the institutions of the Gospel, Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Jesus came and spake unto them saying, all power is given me in heaven and earth, go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi> And he is to be considered in all our obedience, as the great and only Law-giver of his Church, as <hi>the one Law-giver who is able to save and to destroy,</hi> James 4.12. the Soveraign <hi>Lord over his house,</hi> Heb. 3.4, 5, 6. unto whom every <hi>knee is to bow,</hi> and every conscience to be in subjection; and he who <hi>heareth not his voice,</hi> is to be cut off from the people of God, Acts 3.23. <hi>It shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his <hi>speciall presence</hi> in and with

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59624:17"/>
midst of them,</hi> Mat. 8.18, 20. And this promised presence of God, or Christ, consisteth, 1. In the power and efficacy which he by his Spirit implants upon his Ordinances to communicate his Grace and mercy unto his Church; it being his Covenant, that his Spirit shall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his word for ever unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. 2. In the special bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which he gives his people in those duties, both in the acceptance of them and testifying his good will unto them. Exod. 29.42, 43, 45. <hi>At the Tabernacle of the Congregation will I meet with the People, saith the Lord, there will I meet with the children of</hi> Israel. <hi>And the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle shall be sanctified by my glory, and I will dwell amongst the children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and will be their God,</hi> Zech. 2.10, 11. Ezek. 20.40, 41. <hi>I will accept you with your sweet savour,</hi> Ezek. 43.27. in both giving them intimate communion with himself by Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.3. By all these, he gives that <hi>special presence</hi> which he requires an especiall reverence and regard of faith unto, whereby his name is yet farther sanctified. 3. God hath given <hi>special promises,</hi> or promises of his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59624:17"/>
speciall grace unto them that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his worship in a due manner, and hereunto also belongs that sacred Relation, which by vertue of <hi>divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is between the <hi>sacramentall</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the especial Graces of the Covenant which they exhibit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; and the mixing of these promises with faith, according as they are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated unto any particular institution, belongs also to the right sanctification of the name of God. So also, 4. doth our <hi>delight</hi> in them: now this <hi>delight</hi> in the worship of God so much commended in the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proposed unto our example, consists not in any carnall self-pleasing, or satisfaction in the outward modes or manner of the performance of Divine Worship, but it is an holy soul-refreshing contemplation on the will Wisdom, Grace and Condescention of God; in that he is pleased of his own Soveraign meer will and grace, so to manifest himself unto such poor sinfull creatures as we are; so to condescend unto out weakness, so to communicate himself unto us, so to excite and draw forth our souls unto himself, and to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59624:18"/>
give us such pledges of his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with us by Jesus Christ: by the contemplation of these things is the soul drawn forth to delight in God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whereas great <hi>opposition</hi> lyes oftentimes against the Churches obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God in this matter, and much <hi>persecution</hi> befalls it on that account, great <hi>weariness</hi> also being apt from the remainders of unbelief, carnall wisdom, indwelling sin, weakness of the flesh, in Believers themselves to arise in the course thereof, and many temptations also beset them on every hand, to turn them aside from the way of truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, constancy and perseverance in the due and orderly celebration of all the Ordinances of the Gospel belongs unto this duty. And this <hi>perseverance</hi> respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth both the things themselves, and the manner of their performance, both which are of the highest concernment for us diligently to attend unto.</p>
               <p>First, As to the <hi>things themselves</hi>; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do we principally glorifie God, and give due honour unto Jesus Christ, when we abide in our professed subjection unto him, and observance of his commands,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59624:18"/>
against difficulties, oppositions and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. This he taketh notice of, Rev. 2.13. <hi>Thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denyed my faith, even in those dayes wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>was my faithfull Martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth.</hi> And this he requireth of us indispensably if we will be his Disciples, or ever hope to obtain the reward, Mat. 10.38, 39. <hi>He that taketh not his Cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me</hi>; and it is he who endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto the end, that shall be saved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.13. And unto them who are faithfull unto the death, and them alone doth he give the Crown of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. giving us caution not to lose those things which we have wrought, that we may receive a full reward, 2 <hi>John</hi> 8. And as to the manner of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, two things are to be regarded in this duty of perseverance, and the sanctification of the name of God therein.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>inward principle</hi> of our obedience, our faith and love which are to be preserved from decay, Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 4, 5. <hi>I have somewhat against thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>outward manner</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance which is to be kept entire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the primitive institution of Christ, 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you,</hi> not admitting of any corruptions in it to avoid the greatest trouble, Gal. 5.11. <hi>And I Brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?</hi>

               <p>The ground and reason of this Duty is evident.

of one and the self same Spirit, which dwelleth in them, as they are the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> and the Spirit of God dwelleth in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. as also in all the fruits of that one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and in that <hi>one faith</hi> and hope whereunto they are called; Eph. 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>endeavouring to keep the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit in the bond of peace, there is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> And that love which is not built on these principles and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, is not <hi>Evangelical,</hi> whatever other ground it may have, or occasion it may pretend unto. Communion of Saints consists in their mutuall love duly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised according to rule; and all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is an effect of Union.

               <p>This was in part spoken to before on the <hi>third Question,</hi> where it was shewed that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the only way and means, whereby God hath revealed what that worship is, which he will accept in and of the Church. Here, moreover, as to the duty of the Church in this matter, three things are asserted.</p>
               <p>First, That we are to observe and <hi>do all whatsoever</hi> the Lord Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to observe. This lyes plain in the command, Mat. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi> And we are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto it in the injunction given us from Heaven, to <hi>hear,</hi> that is obey him
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59624:24"/>
in all things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. he being the <hi>Prophet</hi> to whose teachings and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we owe obedience on pain of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from among the people of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. Whatever he hath appointed, commanded, revealed as the will of God to be observed in or about the worship of God, that is to be kept and observed by the Church invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably. For if we are his Friends and Disciples, we will keep his commandments. No <hi>disuse</hi> of what continuance soever, can discharge us from the observation of institutions. After the Feast of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles</hi> had been <hi>disused</hi> from the times of <hi>Joshua,</hi> unto the return from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, the restoration of it was required of God and accepted with him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.17. No <hi>abuse</hi> of how high a nature soever can absolve us from obedience unto an institution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. After the great abuse of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in that Church, the Apostle recalls them again unto the observation of it, according to the institution of Christ. And after the defilement of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel, under the Anti-Christian apostacy, yet the Temple and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59624:24"/>
the Altar are to be measured again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. and the Tabernacle of God was again to be raised amongst men. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. No opposition, no persecution, can give the Church a dispensation wholly to omit, and lay aside the use of any thing that the Lord Christ hath commanded to be observed in the worship of God, whilest we are under the obligation of that great rule, Acts 4.19. <hi>Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</hi> It is true in the observation of positive instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may have regard unto rules and prescriptions of prudence, as to times, places, and seasons; that by no inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency or miscarriage of ours, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage taken by the adversaries of the truth, the edification of the Church be hindred. So the Disciples met with <hi>the doors shut</hi> for fear of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> John 20.19. and <hi>Paul</hi> met with the Disciples in the night, in <hi>an upper chamber,</hi> for the celebration of all the Ordinances of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7, 8. yet as to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto their observation, it indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably binds us, and that alwayes, and that as to all the institutions of Christ
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59624:25"/>
whatever, Heb. 10.25. <hi>Not forsaking the assembling of our selves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</hi> To dispence with Christs commands practically is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; much more doctrinally; most of all <hi>authoritatively</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> takes on himself to do. This then is the Churches duty, to search out all the commands of Christ recorded in the Gospel, and to yield obedience unto them. We are not in this matter, to take up meerly with what we find in practice amongst others, no, though they be men good or holy. The duty of the Church, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of every member of it in his place and station, is to search the Scriptures, to inquire into the mind of Christ, and to find out whatever is appointed by him, or required of his Disciples; and that with hearts and minds prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a due observation of whatever shall be discovered to be his will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatever belongs unto the worship of God in the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> whereby any of the Ordinances of Christ is to be performed, comes also under
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59624:25"/>
the command of Christ which is duly to be attended unto, and observed. Indeed whatever is of this nature appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed by Christ, it doth therefore belong to the worship of God. And what is not so appointed, neither doth, nor can be any part thereof. Of this nature are the celebration of all other Ordinances with prayer; for <hi>every thing is sanctified by the word of God and prayer,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.5. of some of them indispensably in the assemblies of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. Chap. 11.20, 24, 25, 33. With care, in the observation of the general rules of love, modesty, condescention and prudence, <hi>doing all things decently and in order,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.33. Chap. 14.40. <hi>Gestures</hi> in some sacred actions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.20, 26. John 13.23. All which the Church is diligently to inquire into, as things that belong to the pattern of the house of God, the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, the forms thereof, and the Ordinances thereof, with the Laws thereof, promised to be shewed unto it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11. to attend carefully to their observation is its duty, being left at liberty as to all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59624:26"/>
which no authority of man can give any real relation to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God unto. Therein lyes the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that Spirit of wisdom, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the knowledge of the mysterie of the Gospel, which is given unto the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.17, 18. It was the <hi>wisdom</hi> of the antient Church to do and observe all that God appointed in the way and manner that he had prescribed for their observance, Deut. 4.5, 6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have taught you statutes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even as the Lord my God commanded me; keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and understanding.</hi> And herein is the command of Christ kept inviolate and unblameable. The perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some, that the Lord hath not prescribed all things wherein his worship is concerned, seems to proceed from a negligence in inquiring after what he hath so prescribed: and when once that perswasion is entertained, all farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is superseded, and despised. For to what end should any one seek after that which he is satisfied cannot be found? as that which is not cannot be. But this mistake will be elsewhere more fully discovered.</p>

In its care, faithfulness and watchfulness herein, consists the principal part of its <hi>loyalty</hi> unto the Lord Jesus as the Head, King and Law-giver of his Church; and which to stir us up unto, he hath left so many severe interdictions and prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his word against all <hi>additions</hi> to his commands upon any pretence whatever; of which afterwards.</p>

               <p>Mention is made in the Scriptures of sundry things practised by the Lord Christ and his Apostles, which being then in <hi>common use</hi> amongst men, were occasionally made by them <hi>Symbolical</hi> instructions in moral duties. Such were <hi>washing of feet</hi> by one another, the <hi>holy kiss,</hi> and the like; but there being no more in them, but a sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59624:27"/>
nor appointed any continuance of them, being peculiarly suited unto the state of things and Persons in those Countries; as John 13.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>After he had washed their feet, and had taken his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was set down again, he said unto them, know ye what I have done to ye, ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am; if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers feet, for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.</hi> 'Tis evident that it is the moral duty of brotherly love, in condescention, and mutual help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to be expressed in all necessary offices as occasion doth require, that is the thing which Jesus Christ here enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Disciples, and leads them to by his own example in an office of love then in use in those parts. The same is to be said of the <hi>holy kiss,</hi> Rom. 16.16. which was a temporary occasional token of entire love; which may in answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, be expressed by any sober usage of salutation amongst men to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But the things themselves were not instituted for any continuance, nor
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59624:28"/>
do represent any special grace of the New Covenant, which is inseperable from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry institution of Gospel worship proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called. Common usages or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises therefore, directed to be used in a due manner, and unto a proper end, where they are used, make them not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of worship. Neither have they in them as so commanded or directed, any one thing that concurs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Gospel-Ordinance: for neither had they their rise in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ, nor is any continuance of them enjoyned, nor any promise annexed unto them, nor any grace of the New Covenant represented or exhibited in them.</p>
               <p>Besides, there were in the first Churches continued for a while certain <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> that had their effects visibly on the outward senses of men, and tended not immediately unto the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church in their faith, but unto the conviction of others, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the authority of them by whom the Gospel was Preached and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated. Such was that <hi>gift of healing</hi> the sick, which being an especial effect
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59624:28"/>
of the Holy-Ghost for the advantage of the Church in those dayes, in some places it was accompanied by <hi>anointing with Oyle</hi>; but this being no universal pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctice, and used only in the exercise of a gift extraordinary, whose use and being are long since ceased, it never was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed nor intended to be of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Church, which is not tyed by the Lord Christ to the empty signs and shadows of things whose substance is not enjoyed: besides, no spiritual grace of the Covenant was ever inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, sealed, or exhibited by that usage of <hi>anointing with Oyle.</hi> The first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.13. where its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is reckoned among the effects of that <hi>extraordinary power</hi> which the Lord Christ committed unto his <hi>twelve Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> on their first sending out, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the same <hi>series of miracles</hi> which they wrought in pursuit, and by vertue thereof, <hi>they cast out many Devils, and anointed with Oyle many that were sick, and healed them.</hi> And by what is there recorded, the subsequent mention of it, <hi>James</hi> 5.14. is to be regulated, but now unto a reall <hi>evangelical</hi> institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Three things are usually pleaded in the Justification of the observance of such <hi>rites</hi> and ceremonies in the worship of God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59624:30"/>(1.) That they tend unto the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>devotion</hi> of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That they render the Worship it self <hi>comely</hi> and beautiful.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That they are the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of <hi>order</hi> in the celebration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore on these accounts they may be instituted, or appointed by some, and observed by all. But things are indeed quite otherwise, <hi>God is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and will be worshiped in spirit and in truth,</hi> John 4.24. And no devotion is acceptable unto him, but what proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from, and is an effect of faith, for <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. and faith in all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the commands and authority of God; for, saith he, <hi>in vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me, who teach for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> Matth. 15.9. and he rejecteth all that honour which is given him by those, whose fear towards him, or worship of him, is <hi>taught by the precepts of men,</hi> Isa. 29.13. These things therefore being utterly destitute of divine Authority, they can no way farther or promote the <hi>devotion</hi> of the Worshipers.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59624:30"/>
What natural, or carnal affections may be excited by them, as men may inflame themselves with Idols, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.5. or what <hi>outward,</hi> outside devotion they may direct unto or excite, is uncertain; but that they are no means of stirring up the <hi>grace of God</hi> in the hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or of the increase or strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their faith, which things alone God accepts in Gospel Worship, seeing they are not appointed by him for any such purpose, is most certain: for to say that any thing will effectually stir up devotion, that is, excite, strengthen or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease grace in the heart towards God, that is not of his own appointment, is on the one hand, to reflect on his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and care towards his Church, as if he had been wanting towards it in things so necessary, which he declares against,
Isa. 5.4. <hi>what,</hi> saith he, <hi>could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> so on the other, it extolls the wisdom of men above what is meet to ascribe unto it. Shall men find out that, which God would not, or could not, in matters of so great importance unto his glory, and the souls of them
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59624:31"/>
that obey him? yea, and it cannot be but that attendance unto them, and their effects must needs divert the mind from those proper spiritual actings of faith and grace, which is its duty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto. And this is evidently seen in them who indulging to themselves in their observation in multiplyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have changed the whole spiritual worship of the Church, into a <hi>Theatrical</hi> pompeous shew of carnal devotion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>comelyness</hi> and beauty of Gospel worship, doth not in the least depend upon them, nor their observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Apostle doth in sundry places expresly compare the spiritual worship of the Gosple, with that of the Law, whilest the Church had a <hi>worldly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> and carnal Ordinances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. and although it be most evident, that the worship of the Old Testament, did for the glory and ornaments of outward ceremonies, and the splendour of their observation, far exceed and excell that worship which God commands now, as suitable unto the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel, yet doth the Apostle prefer <hi>this</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59624:31"/>
for glory, comelyness and beauty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably above the other; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests that these things can have no respect unto outward Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, wherein the chief admirers of them can no way <hi>vye</hi> for glory with the old worship of the Temple. So the Apostle, 2 Cor. 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>if the ministration of death, written and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of</hi> Moses, <hi>for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away, how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious; for if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness exceed in glory: for even that which was made glorious had no glory, in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth; for if that which was done away is glorious, much more that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is glorious.</hi> He compareth the two ministrations, and the several wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> preferring <hi>this</hi> unspeakably above the other; suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifesting, that the <hi>glory</hi> of it consisteth not in any pompeous obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59624:32"/>
of outward Ceremonies. And elsewhere He declareth, that indeed it doth consist in its relation to God in Christ, with the liberty and boldness of the worshipers to enter into the holy place, unto the Throne of Grace under the Ministry of their merciful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful High-Priest, being enabled thereunto by the spirit of adoption, and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for therein, <hi>through Christ we have an access in one spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Eph. 2.18. as it is expressed, Heb. 10.19, 20, 21. <hi>having therefore boldness to enter into the holyest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an High-Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</hi> This is the glory of Gospel worship, and the <hi>beauty</hi> of it; whose consideration whilest the minds of men are diverted from, to look for beauty in the outward prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ceremonies, they lose the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge purchased for Believers by the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59624:32"/>
blood of Christ. Instead then of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>comeliness</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel worship, they are apt to lead men into a dangerous errour and mistake, namely that the beauty and excellency of it consists in such things, as upon a due consideration will appear to be mean and carnal, and far beneath those ceremonies and ordinances of the Old Testament which yet in comparison of the Worship of the Gospel, are called <hi>Worldly, carnal, beggarly,</hi> and are said to have no glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They do not in the least tend unto the preservation of due <hi>order</hi> in the celebration of divine Worship. All <hi>order</hi> consists in the due observation of <hi>rule.</hi> The rules of actions are either <hi>natural,</hi> or of his special appointment. Both these take place in religious worship; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions or commands of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the substance thereof, in their observation principally consists the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it. Whatever is of circumstance in the manner of its performance, not capable of especial determination, as emerging or arising only <hi>occasionally</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doing of that which is appointed, at this, or that time, in this, or that place,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59624:33"/>
and the like, is left unto the rule of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prudence,</hi> in whose observation their <hi>order</hi> doth consist. But the <hi>super-addition</hi> of ceremonies, necessarily belonging nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the institutions of worship, nor unto those circumstances whose disposal falls under the rule of moral prudence, neither doth nor can add any thing unto the <hi>due order</hi> of Gospel Worship. So that they are altogether needless, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in the Worship of God. Neither is this the whole of the inconvenience wherewith their observance is attended; for although they are not in particular, and expresly in the Scripture <hi>forbidden,</hi> for it was simply impossible that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherein the wit of man might exercise its invention in such things, should be reckoned up and condemned, yet they fall directly under those severe <hi>prohibitions</hi> which God hath recorded to secure his worship from all such <hi>additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> unto it, of what sort soever. Yea the main design of the <hi>second precept</hi> is to forbid <hi>all making unto our selves,</hi> any such things in the worship of God, to add unto what he hath appointed, whereof an instance is given in that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59624:33"/>
of <hi>making and worshiping Images,</hi> the most common way that the sons of men were then prone to trangess by, against the institutions of God. And this sense and understanding of the <hi>commandment</hi> is secured by those ensuing prohibitions against the adding any thing at all unto the commands of God in his worship, Deut. 4.2. <hi>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God,</hi> Chap. 12.32. <hi>what things soever I command you, observe to do it, thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it,</hi> Chap. 17.3. to the same purpose were the places before mentioned, <hi>Matth,</hi> 15.9. as also is that severe rule applyed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour unto the additions of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> Verse 13. <hi>Every plant, which my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father hath not planted, shall be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is yet farther evidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto this intention of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, from those places where such evils and corruptions, as were particularly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the worship of God, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, not on the special account of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59624:34"/>
their being so forbidden, but on that more general, of being introduced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any warrant from Gods Institutions or commands, Jer. 7.31. <hi>they have built the high places of</hi> Tophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> say indeed, that all <hi>additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons corrupting</hi> the worship of God are forbidden; but such as farther, adorn, and <hi>preserve</hi> it, are not so; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on; for whereas every <hi>addition</hi> is principally a <hi>corruption</hi> because it is an <hi>addition,</hi> under which notion it is forbidden, (and that in the worship of God which is forbidden is a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59624:34"/>
corruption of it) there can be no such preserving, adorning addition, unless we will allow a preserving and adorning corruption. Neither is it of more force which is pleaded by them, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which they make, belong not unto the <hi>substance</hi> of the worship of God, but unto the <hi>circumstances</hi> of it; for every circumstance observed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously, or to be observed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, is of the substance of it; as were all those <hi>ceremonious observances</hi> of the Law which had the same respect in the prohibitions of adding, with the most weighty things whatsoever.</p>

               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>For the most part, the instituted worship of God is neglected and dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the World. Some are utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless of it, supposing that if they attend, after their manner, unto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obedience, that neither God nor themselves are much concerned in this matter, of his worship. Others think the disposal and ordering of it to be so left unto men, that as to the <hi>manner</hi> of its performance, they may do with it as it seems right in their own eyes, And some follow them therein as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly walking after their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without any respect unto the will or authority of God. But the whole Scripture gives us utterly another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter. The <hi>honour</hi> of God in this world, the <hi>tryal</hi> of our faith and obedience, the <hi>order</hi> and beauty of the Church, the <hi>exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Christ in his professed subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, and the <hi>saving of our souls</hi> in the wayes of his appointment, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in laid upon the due and right observance of instituted worship, and they who
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59624:36"/>
are negligent about these things, what ever they pretend, have no real respect unto any thing that is called Religion. First therefore, in every state and condition of the Church, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Ordinances of worship, as the <hi>touchstone</hi> and tryal of its faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, so that they by whom they are neglected, do openly refuse to come unto Gods tryal. In the state of innocency, the tryal of <hi>Adams</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to the law of nature, was in and by the institution of the trees of life, and of the knowledge of good and evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>And the Lord God commanded the Man saying, of every tree of the garden thou maist freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou, shalt surely die.</hi> This was the first institution of God, and it was given unto the Church, in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and purity. And in our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents neglect of attending thereunto, did they transgress the whole law of their creation, as failing in their duty in that which was appointment for their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59624:36"/>
                  <hi>tryal</hi> in the whole; Chap. 3.11. <hi>Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee that thou shouldest not eat?</hi> &amp;c. And the Church in his family after the fall, built upon the promise, was <hi>tryed</hi> also in the matter of instituted worship. Nor was there any discovery of the wickedness of <hi>Cain,</hi> or approbation of the faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> until they came to be proved in their <hi>sacrifices,</hi> a new part of Gods instituted worship, the first in the state and condition of sin and the fall whereinto it was brought. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. <hi>In process of time, it came to pass Cain brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord, and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering, but unto Cain, and his offering he had not respect.</hi> The ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle declares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts.</hi> In the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of that first institution given to the Church in the state of the fall,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59624:37"/>
did <hi>Abel</hi> receive a testimony of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified and accepted with God. Afterwards when <hi>Abraham</hi> was called, and peculiarly separated to bare forth the name of God in the world, and to become the spring of the Church for future ages, he had the institution of <hi>circumcision</hi> given him for the tryal of his obedience; the Law and condition whereof was, that he who observed it not should be esteemed an alien from the covenant of God, and be cut off from his People. Gen. 17.9, 10, 11. <hi>God said unto Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee, every man-child among you shall be circumcised,</hi> Verse the (14) <hi>and the uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And in like manner so soon as ever his posterity were to be collected into a new Church state and order, God gave them the Ordinance of the <hi>Passover,</hi> Exod. 12.24. <hi>Ye shall observe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59624:37"/>
this thing for an Ordinance to thee and to thy Sons for ever</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that upon the same penalty with that of circumcision; to these he added many more on mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 20. all as the tryals of their faith and obedience unto succeeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: How he hath dealt with his Church under the <hi>new Testament,</hi> we shall afterwards declare. In no state or condition then of the Church, did God ever accept of <hi>moral Obedience</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the observation of some instituted worship accommodated in his wisdome unto its various states and conditions. And not only so, but as we have seen, he hath made the observation of them according unto his mind and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the means of the tryal of Mens whole obedience, and the rule of the acceptance or rejection of them. And so it continues at this day, what ever be the thoughts of men about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which at present he requires.</p>
               <p>Besides, God hath appointed that his Ordinances of worship shall be as <hi>effectual means</hi> as to instruct us in the mysteries of his will and mind, so of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his love, mercy, and grace
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59624:38"/>
unto us; as also of that communion, or intercourse with his holy Majesty, which he hath graciously granted unto us by Jesus Christ. And this as it is sufficiently manifested in the Scriptures quoted in answer unto this question, so it is at large declared in the writings of those holy and good men, who have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nature of gospel Ordinances, and therefore in particular we need not here insist much in the farther proof of it. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was instructed in the nature of the covenant of grace by <hi>circumcision, Gen.</hi> 17.10. which is often explained in the old Testament, by applying it in particular to the grace of <hi>conversion,</hi> called the <hi>circumcision of the heart, Deut,</hi> 10.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. as also in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.11. And by the <hi>Passover,</hi> where the people taught, not only the mercy of their present deliverance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.23, 24. but also to look for the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> who was to take away the sin of the world, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. the true <hi>Passover</hi> of the people of God which was sacrificed for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. how our incision or implanting into
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59624:38"/>
Christ, is represented and signified by our <hi>Baptism,</hi> the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. as also our communion with him in his death, by the Supper of the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. and all these graces which they teach, they also <hi>exhibit,</hi> and are the means of the communication of them unto Beleivers. Moreover the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Beleivers, who have conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously waited upon God in their due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance, may be produced in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it. The instruction, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, consolation, Spiritual strength, courage, and resolution, which they have received in and by them, hath been witnessed unto in their lives, and ends; and they to whom these things are not of the greatest importance, do but in vain pretend a regard unto God in any thing whatever.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, God hath appointed our duty in the observation of his instituted worship, to be the means of our <hi>glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him in the world. Nor can we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise give glory to God, but as we own his authority over us, and yield obedience to what he requires at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59624:39"/>
our hands. And what we do herein, is principally evident in those duties which lye under the eye and observation of Men. Some duties of obedience there are, which the world neither doth, nor can discern in Believers. Such are their faith, inward holiness, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, heavenly mindedness, sincere mortification of indwelling sin, some whose performance ought to be hid from them, as personal prayer, and almes. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Some there are, which are very liable to misconstruction amongst Men, as <hi>Zeal</hi> in many of the actings of it. But this conscientious observation of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted worship, and therein avowing our subjection unto the authority of God in Christ, is that which the World may see, and take notice of, and that, which unless in case of persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought not to be hid from them; and that which they can have no pretence of scandal at. And therefore hath God appointed that by this means and way, we shall honour and glorifie him in the World, which if we neglect, we do evidently cast off all regard unto his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59624:39"/>
concernments in this World. Herein it is, that we manifest our selves not to be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, of him and his words, which he so indispensably requireth at our hands, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinfull generation, of him also shall the son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</hi> Hereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do we keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ, as <hi>his freinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John</hi> 13.35. for these peculiarly are <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> and if we suffer for them, then we do most properly suffer as <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which is our <hi>glory,</hi> that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you, on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified, but let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59624:40"/>
thing it is, to suffer for the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the special commands of Christ.</p>
               <p>Farther, to encourage us in our duty, the holy faithful God hath given us many great and precious promises, that he will graciously afford unto us his especial sanctifying blessing presence, in our attendance on his worship accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his appointment. For as he promised of old that he would make glorious the <hi>place of his feet,</hi> or abode amongst his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.13. that he would meet them in <hi>his sanctuary,</hi> the place of his worship, and there dwell amongst them, and bless them, and be their God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42, 43, 44, 45. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.24. so the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ hath promised his presence to the same ends and purposes, unto all them that assemble together in his name, for the observation of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which in the Gospel he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> And therein is the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of God, his gracious dwelling place, with Men. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. Now when God offereth unto
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59624:40"/>
us his presence, his gracious blessing, sanctifying, and saving presence, and that in and by promises which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail, what unspeakable guilt must we needs contract upon our own souls, if we neglect or despise the tenders of such grace?</p>
               <p>But because we are apt to be sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and are slow of heart in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due sense of spiritual things that fall not in with the light and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of nature, to stir us up unto a diligence in our attendance unto the will of God in this matter, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he looks upon our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence herein as our <hi>whole loyalty</hi> unto him in that <hi>conjugal covenant</hi> which he is pleased in Christ Jesus to take Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into with himself, Jer. 3.14. <hi>turn O backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am marryed unto you, and will take you one of a City, and two of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and will bring ye unto Sion, and I will give you Pastors according unto mine heart, which shall feed ye with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and understanding.</hi> Coming unto <hi>Sion,</hi> in the worship of God, under the leading and conduct of Pastors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59624:41"/>
to the heart of God, is our answering the relation wherein we stand unto him as he is <hi>marryed</hi> unto us, and thereupon he teacheth us that as an <hi>Husband,</hi> he is <hi>jealous</hi> of our discharge of our duty in this matter, accounting our neglect of his worship, or profanation of it by inventions and additions of our own, to be <hi>spiritual disloyalty, whoredome</hi> and adultery, which his soul abhorreth, for which he will cast off any Church, or people, and that for ever, See <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Jos.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. whatever he will bear withal in his Church, he will not bear with that which his <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi> is exercised about. If it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress therein, he will give it a bill of divorce; which repudiated condition, is the state of many Churches in the World, however they please, and boast themselves in their <hi>meritricious</hi> orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and practices.</p>
               <p>To give yet farther strength unto all these considerations, that we may not only have rules and precepts, but examples also for our instruction, God hath given many signal instances of his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59624:41"/>
                  <hi>severity</hi> against Persons who by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, neglect, or regardlesness, have miscarried in not observing exactly his will and appointment in and about his worship.

               <p>That there is an Apostacy of the Church foretold in the book of the Revelations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is acknowledged by all who with sincerity have inquired into the minde of God therein. The state of things at this day, and for many ages past in the World, sufficiently confirm that perswasion. And herein sundry things in general, are obvious unto every sober consideration thereof.</p>
               <p>First the horrible evils, troubles and confusions that are to be brought into, and upon the World thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the high guilt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God, that is contained in it, and doth accompany it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the dreadful vengeance that God in his appointed time will take upon all the promoters and obstinate maintainers of it. These things are at large all of them foretold in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and therein also the Apostacy it self is set forth as the cause of all the plagues and destructions that by the righteous judgement of God, are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59624:43"/>
to be brought upon the World in these latter dayes. Now as God doth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly call upon all that fear him, not to intermeddle, nor partake in the sins of the <hi>Apostates,</hi> lest they should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so partake in their judgements, Chap. 18.4. <hi>(I heard a voice from Heaven, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.)</hi> So he doth plainly declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the apostacy and sin it self should principally consist, and that is in the corrupting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating of the Ordinances of his worship, or the introduction of false worship joyned with the persecution of them who refused to submit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For this cause, is the sin it self, set out under the name of <hi>fornication,</hi> and <hi>whoredome</hi>; and the Church that maintains it, is called the <hi>Mother of Harlots, Chap.</hi> 17.5. That by fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whoredome, in the Church, the adulterating of the worship of God, and the admission of false self-invented worship in the room thereof, whereof God is jealous, is intended, the Scripture every where declares.

               <p>The principal thing we are to aim at in the whole worship of God, is the discharge of that duty which we owe to Jesus Christ the King and head of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb. 3.6. <hi>Christ as a Son over his own house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose house are we,</hi> 1 Tim.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59624:45"/>
3.15. <hi>That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thy self in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God.</hi> This we cannot do unless we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his authority as the formal reason and cause of our observance of all that we do therein. If we perform any thing in the worship of God on any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is no part of our obedience unto him; and so we can neither expect his grace to assist us, nor have we his promise to accept us therein; for that he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto our doing and observing whatever he hath commanded, and that because he hath commanded us, Matth. 28 20. <hi>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and loe, I am with you alwayes, even unto the end of the World.</hi> This promised pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence respects only the observance of his commands. Some men are apt to look on this authority of Christ as that which hath the least influence into what they do. If in any of his institutions they find any thing that is suited or agreeable unto the light of nature, as Ecclesiastical societies, government of the Church, and the like they say are,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59624:45"/>
they suppose and contend, that that is the ground on which they are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto, and so are to be regulated accordingly. The interposition of his authority they will allow only in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> which have no light in reason or nature; so desirous are some to have as little to do with Christ as they can, even in the things that concern the worship of God. But it would be somewhat strange, that if what the Lord Christ hath appointed in his Church to be observed in particular, in an especial manner, for especial ends of his own, hath in the general nature of it an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with what in like cases the light of nature seems to direct unto, that therefore his authority is not to be considered, as the sole immediate reason of our performance of it; But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</p>
               <p>First, That our Lord Jesus Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King and Head of his Church, the Lord over the house of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be done therein but with respect unto his authority, Matth. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him</hi>; Ephes. 4.15.

                  <hi>Speaking the truth in love, grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of it self in love</hi>

               <p>Secondly, And that therefore, the suitableness of any thing to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or the light of nature, is no ground for a Church observation of it, unless it be also appointed and commanded in especial by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That being so appointed and commanded, it becomes an especial <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of his, and as such, is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that in all things that are done, or to be done with respect unto the worship of God in the Church, the

               <p>The Church, whose nature is here inquired after, is not the <hi>Catholick</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59624:47"/>
Church of elect Believers of all ages and seasons from the beginning of the World unto the end thereof, nor of any one age, nor the <hi>universality</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> of the Gospel; but a <hi>particular</hi> Church wherein by the appointment of Christ, all the Ordinances of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God are to be observed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto according to his Will. For although it be required of them, of whom a <hi>particular</hi> Church is <hi>constituted,</hi> that they be true Believers, seeing that unless a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and so on that account they be members of the Church <hi>Catholick</hi>; as also that they make <hi>visible profession</hi> of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Jesus Christ, yet moreover it is the will, command and appointment of Christ, that they should be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in particular societies, or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for the due observation of the Ordinances of the Gospel, which can alone be done in such Assemblies. For as the members of the Catholick Church, are not known unto one another meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of that faith and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ which makes them so,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59624:47"/>
whence the whole society of them is, <hi>as such, invisible</hi> to the World and themselves, <hi>visible</hi> only on the account of their profession, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meerly as such, observe the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel, which observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is their profession; so the <hi>visible Professors</hi> that are in the World in any age, cannot at any time <hi>assemble</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which from the nature of the thing it self, and the institution of Christ, is indispensably necessary for the celebration of sundry parts of that worship which he requires in his Church; and therefore particular Churches are themselves an Ordinance of the New Testament, as the <hi>National Church</hi> of the Jews, was of old. For when God of old erected his Worship, and enjoyned the solemn observation of it, he also appointed a <hi>Church</hi> as his institution for the due celebration of it. That was, the people of <hi>Israel</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly taken into a Church relation with him by covenant, wherein they took upon themselves to observe all the laws, and ordinances, and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his worship, Exod. 20.19. <hi>Speak
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59624:48"/>
thou with us, and we will hear,</hi> Exod. 24.3. <hi>And Moses came, and told the People all the words of the Lord, and all the judgements, and all the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with one voice, and said, all the words which the Lord hath said, we will do,</hi> Deut. 5.27. <hi>All that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee, we will hear it and do it.</hi> And God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly appointed them Ordinances to be observed by the whole congregation of them together at the same time, in the same place. Exod. 23.17. <hi>Three times in the year all thy Males shall appear before the Lord thy God.</hi> Deut. 16.16. <hi>Three times in a year all thy Males shall appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither would God allow any strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, any one not of the Church so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by him, to celebrate any part of his instituted worship, untill he was solemnly admitted into that Church as a member thereof. Exod. 12.47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48. <hi>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it, and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his Males be circumcised and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59624:48"/>
then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as one that is born in the Land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the same end and purpose, when the knowledge of God was to be diffused all the World over by the preaching of the Gospel, and Believers of all nations under Heaven were to be admitted unto the priviledge of his worship, Eph. 2.15, 16, 17, 18. the national Church of the Jewes with all the Ordinances of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed and taken away, the Lord Christ hath appointed <hi>particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> or united Assemblies of Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst and by whom he will have all his holy Ordinances of worship celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this institution of his, at the First preaching of the Gospel, was invariably and inviolably observed by all that took on them to be his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, without any one instance of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning it to the contrary in the whole World, or of the celebration of any Ordinances of his worship amongst any Persons, but only in such societies or particular Churches. And there is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence and warranty of this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59624:49"/>
institution given us in the Scripture: For,</p>
               <p>First they are appointed and <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by Christ. Matth. 18.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>If thy Brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone, if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established; and if he shall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to hear, then tell it unto the Church, but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican; verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed also in Heaven; again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven; for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such</hi> a Church he supposeth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth, as his Disciples had relation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59624:49"/>
unto, and as any one of them could have recourse unto as a Brother, in obedience to his commands and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This could not be the <hi>Church</hi> of the Jews neither in its whole body, nor in any of its Judicatories. For as at that time there was a solemn decree of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> against all and every one that should profess his Name; John 9.22. <hi>The Jews had already agreed that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the Synagogue</hi>; which was executed accordingly upon the man that was born blind, <hi>Verse</hi> the 34. which utterly disabled them from making any use of this direction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Institution of his for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; So afterwards the chief business of the Rulers of those Assemblies from the highest court of their <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to the meanest Judicatory in their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi> was to persecute them, and bring them unto death. Math. 10.17. <hi>They will deliver ye up to the Councills and they will scourge you in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. John</hi> 15.21. And it is not likely that the Lord Christ would send his Disciples for direction and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59624:50"/>
in the weighty matters of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him, and mutual love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, unto them with whom they neither had, nor could, nor ought to have any thing to do withal; and if they were intended, they were all already made as heathens and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, being cast out by them for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to hear them in their blasphemies and persecutions of Christ himself. Such a society also is plainly intended, as whereunto Christ promiseth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by his spirit, and whose righteous sentences he takes upon himself to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and confirm in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Moreover such a Church doth he direct unto, as wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h which his Disciples were to have familiar Brotherly constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and communion, with whom they were so to be joyned in society, as to be owned or rejected by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their judgement, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the practice enjoyned unto them; and without relation, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no duty here appointed could be performed. As therefore the very name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and nature of the thing, bespeaks a society, so it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59624:50"/>
that no society but that of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of the Gospel can be here intended.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these Churches he calls his <hi>Candlesticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rev.</hi> 1.20. In allusion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Candlesticks</hi> of the Temple, which being an institution of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth directly declare these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be so under the New. And this he speakes in reference unto those <hi>seven principal Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> every one of which, was a Candlestick, or an institution of his own.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In pursuit of this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, and by his authority, the Apostles so soon as any were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto the faith at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the old National Church state of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was yet continued, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them into a <hi>Church</hi> or society for celebration of the ordinances of the Gospel. Acts. 2.41, 42. <hi>they that gladly received the word, were baptised, and they continued stedfastly together in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and in prayers.</hi> verse (47) <hi>the Lord adding unto this Church dayly such as should be saved.</hi> And this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59624:51"/>
company is expresly called the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem. Acts.</hi> 8.1. This Church thus called and collected out of the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was the rule and pattern of the disposing of all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ into <hi>Church societyes</hi> in obedience unto his command through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23, 27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they took care for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, compleating and establishing them in <hi>order</hi> according to his will, under the rule of them, given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and granted unto them by himself for that purpose, all in a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ddy pursuit of the commands of Christ. Acts 14.23. <hi>they ordained them Elders in every Church.</hi> Titus 1.5. <hi>For this cause left I thee in Creet that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. Ephe. 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they do every where in the Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and authority of Christ, give unto these Churches rules, directions, and precepts for the due ordering of all things relating to the worship of God, according to his minde as we shall see af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59624:51"/>First, there is no charge given unto the Officers, Ministers, Guides, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers that he hath appointed, but it is in reference unto the discharge of their duty in such Churches. That Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Officers are of Christs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is expresly declared. Ephes. 4.11.12. <hi>He gave some Apostles, some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>God hath set in his Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets thirdly Teachers. These</hi> are of Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but to what end? why, as they were ordained in every Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. So their whole charge is limited to the <hi>Churches,</hi> Acts 20.17. <hi>He sent to</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and called the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and said to them</hi>; Verse the 28. <hi>take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the flock over which the Holy-Ghost hath made you Overseers, to feed the Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his own blood,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. <hi>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, feed the flock of God, which is among
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59624:52"/>
you taking the oversight thereof,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. Colos. 4.17. <hi>And say to</hi> Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus <hi>take heed to the Ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it.</hi> They were the Churches of Christ wherein they ministred, which Christ appointing them to take care of, manifests to be his own institution and appointment. And this is fully declared, <hi>Rev. chap.</hi> 2.3. where all the dealings of Christ with his <hi>Angels,</hi> or Ministers, are about their behaviour and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among his <hi>Candlesticks,</hi> each of them, the Candlestick whereunto he was related, or the particular Churches that they had care of, and presided in; the Candlesticks being no less of the institution of Christ, than the Angels. And they were distinct particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which had their distinct particular Officers, whom he treateth distinctly withall about his institutions and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; especially about that of the state of the Churches themselves, and their constitution according to his mind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no instruction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation or reproof given unto any of the Disciples of Christ after his ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59624:52"/>
in any of the books of the New Testament, but as they were collected into, and were members of such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches. This will be evidenced in the many instances of those duties that shall afterwards be insisted on. And the Lord Christ hath not left that as a matter of liberty, choice or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, which he hath made the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the due manner of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all those duties whereby his Disciples yield obedience unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to his glory in the World.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The principal writings of the Apostles are <hi>expresly</hi> directed unto such Churches, and all of them intentionally, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.1. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. or unto parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, giving directions for their behaviour and duty in such Churches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. So that the great care of the Apostles was about these Churches, as the principal institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, and that whereon the due observance of all his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands doth depend. Of what nature
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59624:53"/>
or sort these Churches were, shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards evinced; we here only mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their institution by the authority of Christ.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Much of the writings of the Apostles in those Epistles directed to those Churches, consists in rules, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, instructions, and exhortations for the guidance and preservation of them in purity, and order, with their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in a condition of due obedience unto the Lord Christ. To this end do they so fully and largely acquaint the Rulers and Members of them with their mutual duty in that especial relation wherein they stand to each other, as also of all persons in particular in what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them by vertue of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership in any particular society; as may be seen at large in sundry of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. And to give more strength hereunto, our Lord Jesus Christ in the revelation that he made of his mind and will perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally after his ascension into Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted principally about the condition, order and preservation of particular Churches; not taking notice of any of his Disciples not belonging to them, or

joyned with them. These he warns, reproves, instructs, threatens, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, all in order unto their walking before him in the condition of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and (3.) at large.</p>
               <p>Besides, As he hath appointed them to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Churches as the Apostle discourseth at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. verses. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. It is manifest then that no Ordinance of Christ is appointed to be observed by his Disciples, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the gifts of the Holy-Ghost is promised to them, no especial duty is required of them, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto these Churches of his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>In the Answer to this Question, four things are declared tending to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the nature of a particular Church or Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>subject matter</hi> of them, or the persons whereof such a Church doth or ought to consist. (2.) The <hi>means</hi> whereby they are brought into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion capable of such an estate, or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for it. (3.) The <hi>general ends</hi> of their calling. (4.) The <hi>especial means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are constituted a Church; which last will be spoken unto in the next Question.</p>
               <p>For the first, All men are by nature the children of wrath, and do belong unto the World, which is the Kingdom
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59624:54"/>
of Satan, and are under the power of darkness as the Scripture every where declares. In this state, men are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdom of Christ, nor meet to become members of his Church. Out of this condition, they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themselves. They have neither will unto it, nor power for it, but they are <hi>called</hi> out of it: this <hi>calling</hi> is that which effectually delivers them from the Kingdom of Satan, and translates them into the Kingdom of Christ. And this work or effect the Scripture on several accounts variously expresseth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Regeneration, or a new birth, sometimes by <hi>conversion</hi> or turning unto God; sometimes by <hi>vivification,</hi> or quickening from the dead; sometimes by <hi>illumination</hi> or opening of the eyes of the blind; all which are carryed on by <hi>sanctification</hi> in holiness, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Justification and adoption; And as these are all distinct in themselves, having several formal reasons of them, so they all concur to compleat that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall vocation or calling that is required to constitute persons members of the Church. For besides that this is signified by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59624:55"/>
the typical holiness of the Church of old, into the room whereof reall holiness was to succeed under the new Testament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 24, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Isa.</hi> 35.8, 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 60.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ hath laid it down as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting rule, that unless a man be <hi>born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3. requiring regeneration as an indispensable condition in a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Church, a subject of his Kingdom. For his Temple, is now to be built of living stones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spiritually and savingly quickened from their death in sin and by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost, whereof they are partakers, made a meet habitation for God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. which receiving vital supplyes from Christ its head, increaseth in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, edifying it self in love, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15, 16. And as the Apostles in their writings, do ascribe unto all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Members of them a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in this <hi>effectual</hi> vocation, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are <hi>Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, justified</hi> and accepted with God in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59624:55"/>
Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. Heb. 3.1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. So, many of the duties that are required of them, in that relation and condition, are such, as none can perform unto the glory of God, their own benefit, and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, (the ends of all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) unless they are partakers of this effectual calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that these Churches and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them, are not only commanded to separate themselves as to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, from the World, that is men in their worldly state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are also required when any amongst them trasgress against the rules and laws of this <hi>holy calling</hi> above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, to cast them out of their society and communion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. from all which it appears, who are the subject matter of these Churches of Christ; as also secondly, the means whereby they come to be so, namely the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit and word of Christ; and Thirdly, the general ends of their calling, which are all spoken to in this answer.</p>

            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>That the Lord Christ hath constituted such a Church-state as that which we enquire about, hath been proved alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Unto a Church so constituted, he hath also by his word and promise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed all those priviledges and powers, which we find a Church to be entrusted
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59624:56"/>
withall. This he hath done by the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unalterable Law of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which is the Charter of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual society and incorporation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can any persons be inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in the rights of a Church any otherwise, but by virtue of this Law and constitution. This therefore is first to be laid down, that the sole <hi>moral</hi> foundation of that Church-state which we enquire after, is laid in the Word, Law, and appointment of Christ. He alone hath authority to erect such a society, he is the builder of this house, as well as the Lord over it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.3, 6. neither without it, can all the authority of men in the World appoint such a state, or erect a Church, and all acceptable actings of men herein, are no other but acts of pure obedience unto Christ.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, We have declared that the Lord Christ by the dispensation of his word and spirit, doth prepare and fit men to be subjects of his Kingdom, Members of his Church; the work of sending forth the means of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the souls of men, of translating
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59624:57"/>
them from the power of darkness into light, he hath taken upon himself, and doth effectually accomplish it in every generation. And by this means he <hi>builds his Church,</hi> Matth. 18.20. For unto all persons so called, he gives command that they shall do and observe whatever he hath appointed them to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. in particular, that they profess their subjection to him, and their obedience, in joyning themselves in that state wherein they may be enabled to observe all his other laws and institutions, with the whole worship of God required therein. Being converted unto God by his Word and Spirit, they are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how they may now obey the Lord Christ in all things. Amongst his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, this of joyning themselves in Church societies wherein he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his presence with them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. that is to dwell amongst them by his word and spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. is the very first. This by virtue of that command and promise of his they are warranted and enabled to do, nor do they need any other warrant. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Christ is sufficient to beare
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59624:57"/>
men out in the discharge of their duty to him. Being then made willing and ready in the day of his power, <hi>Psalm</hi> 110.3. they <hi>consent,</hi> choose, and <hi>agree</hi> to walk together in the observation of all his commands. And hereby do they become a Church. For their becoming a Church, is an act of their willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Christ. This obedience is an act of their wills, guided by rule; for this also is necessary that they proceed herein according to the rules of his appointment afterwards to be unfolded. And herein, upon their obedience unto the commands of Christ, and faith in his promises, do Believers by virtue of his Law, and constitution, become a Gospel Church, and are really and truly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in all the power, rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, that are granted unto any Church of Christ. For in this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they do these two things which alone he requires in any persons for the obtaining of an interest in these privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. First, They <hi>confess</hi> him, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, his authority, his law, his grace Secondly, They take upon themselves the <hi>observance</hi> of all his commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59624:58"/>Thus did God take the children of <hi>Israel</hi> into a Church-state of old. He proposed unto them the Church obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he required of them, and they voluntarily and freely took upon themselves the performance of it, Exod. 24.3. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>came and told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the words of the Lord, and all the judgements, and all the people answered with one voice, and said, all the words which the Lord hath said, will we do.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.7. and hereby they had their solemn admission into their Church-state, and relation unto God. And the like course they took when ever there was need of renewing their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Josh. 24.18, 21, 22. <hi>And the people said we will serve the Lord, for he is our God; and</hi> Joshua <hi>said unto the people ye are witnesses against your selves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him, and they said we are witnesses.</hi> This was the <hi>covenant,</hi> that was between God and that people which was solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, so often as the Church was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently reformed. Now although the outward solemnity and ceremonies of this covenant were peculiar unto that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59624:58"/>
people, yet as to the substance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it in a sacred consent for the performance of all those duties towards God and one another which the nature and edification of a Church do require, it belongs to every Church as such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under the Gosple.</p>
               <p>And this is the way whereby Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or the Disciples of Christ, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this state, the formal consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting cause of any Church. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count doth the Apostle give of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>And this they did, not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the performance of other duties, and in order thereunto, they first gave themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, or took upon themselves the observance of his commands and institutions, which is the intendment of that expression. Among these commands one was that they should give up themselves to the Apostles doctrine, Rule and government in the order by Christ prescribed, that is in Church order. This therefore they did <hi>by the will of God,</hi> according to his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59624:59"/>
will, and appointment. This descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth the Apostle give of the way whereby the Believers of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were brought into Churches. It was by their own obedience unto the will of God, consenting, agreeing, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themselves the observation of all the commands and institutions of Christ, according to the direction and guidance of the Apostles. So did the Believers at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. Being converted by the word, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profession of that conversion in their Baptism, they gave up themselves to a stedfast continuance in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all other Ordinances of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Besides the Church is an house, a Temple, the <hi>house of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. The <hi>house</hi> of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. The Temple of God; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.21, 22. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers singly considered are <hi>stones,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving stones; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.5. Now how shall these <hi>living stones</hi> come to be an house, a Temple? can it be by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal occurrences, civil cohabitation in political precincts, usage or custome of assembling for some parts of worship
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59624:59"/>
in any place? these things will never frame them into a house or Temple. This can be no otherwise done but by-their own voluntary consent and dispo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition. Ephe. 2.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Ye are fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy Temple, in the Lord; in whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.</hi> Chap. 4.16. <hi>From whom the whole body fitly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and compacted by that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joynt supplyeth, according to the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of it self in love.</hi> From these and sundry other places, it is manifest, that the way and means of Believers coalition into a Church-state, is their own obedience of faith, acting it self in a joynt voluntary consent to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an holy observation of the commands of Christ, whence the being and union of a particular Church is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>That the Church is a <hi>Spiritual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,</hi> attended with rule and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is evident from the nature of the thing it self and testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Only as the Kingdome of Christ is not of this World, or Worldly, so this rule and government of the Church is not mearly external, and secular, but spiritual. Neither doth this rule at all belong unto it, merely as <hi>materially</hi> considered, in men yielding obedience unto the call which is the foundation of the Church, nor <hi>absolutely</hi> as it is formally constituted a Church by the consent and agreement described, but moreover it is required that it be <hi>orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically</hi> compleat with Officers or rulers; now to the constitution of such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or corporation there is required.</p>
               <p>First, that the persons whereof it is constituted do <hi>consent</hi> together into it for the attaining of the ends which they design. Without this no society of any kind can exist. This is the form of mens coalescencie into societyes. And
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59624:61"/>
that there is in the Church such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and agreement hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there be Rules or Laws for the guidance and direction of all the Members of the society, in order to their pursuit of the proper ends of it. That such Rules or Lawes are given and prescribed by the Lord Christ unto the Church, will afterwards appear in our consideration of them in particular; so that the Church is a society of men walking according unto Rule or Law for the attaining of the ends of the society.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that there be Authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for to see to the due Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Rules and Lawes of the society, which consists in this; (1) That some be appointed to <hi>Rule</hi> and Govern in the Church. (2) Others, to <hi>Obey</hi> and be Ruled or Governed; both according to the Laws of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and not otherwise. And both these are eminently found in this Church-state as we shall see in the ensuing Question with their Answers and Explications.</p>
               <p>Now that these Officers, or Rulers, should be of two sorts, both the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59624:61"/>
of the thing it self required, and so hath our Lord Jesus Christ appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For when the Church was first to be called, gathered, and erected, it was necessary that <hi>some Persons</hi> should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Titus 1.5. Sometimes <hi>Elders,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.1. 1 Tim. 5.17. Act. 14.23. Act. 20.17. Sometimes <hi>Guides,</hi> Heb. 13.7, 17. By all which names, and sundry others where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are expressed, the same sort, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and degree of persons is intended. Nor is any one of these names applyed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59624:62"/>
or accommodated unto any, but all the rest are also in like manner; so that he who is a <hi>Pastor</hi> or a Teacher, is also a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Overseer,</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder,</hi> a <hi>Guide</hi> or <hi>Ruler,</hi> a <hi>Minister,</hi> a servant of the Church for the Lords sake. And of all other names assigned to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church, that of <hi>Bishop,</hi> can least of all be thought to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed any special order or degree of preheminence amongst them. For whereas it is but four times, or in four places used in the New Testament as denoting any officers of the Church, in each of them it is manifest, that those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the other names of Elders and Ministers are intended. So <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. the <hi>Bishops</hi> are the <hi>Elders</hi> of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> verse the 17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. there were <hi>many Bishops</hi> in that one particular Church, who had only <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> joyned with them; that is they were the Elders of it. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8. the <hi>Bishops</hi> were the <hi>Elders</hi> to be ordained <hi>vers.</hi> the 5. which persons are also directly intended, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. as is evident from the coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence of the directions given by the Apostle about them, and the immediate
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59624:63"/>
adjoyning of <hi>Deacons</hi> unto them <hi>vers.</hi> 8. So that no name could be fixed on with less probability to assert from it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial supream order or degree of men in Ministry, than this of Bishops. Neither is there any mention in any place of Scripture, of any such preheminence of one sort of these Church-Officers or Ministers over another; not in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in those places where the Officers of the Church are in an especial manner enumerated, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8. Nor is there any mention of any special <hi>office</hi> that should be peculiar unto such Officers, or of any gifts or qualifications that should be required in them; or of any special way of calling or setting apart to their office; nor of any kind of Church that they should relate unto, different from the Churches that other Elders or Pastors do Minister in; nor of any special rule or direction for their tryal; nor any command for obedience unto them, but what are common to all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Churches of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

either Elders or Ministers to obey them; or directions how to respect them; nor unto them how to behave themselves towards them; but all these things are spoken and delivered promiscuously and equally concerning all Ministers of the Gospel.

               <p>Five things are here said to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the due and solemn constitution of a Minister, Guide, Elder, Pastor, or Teacher of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as they do not all equally belong unto the <hi>essence</hi> of the call, so they are all indispensably necessary unto him that would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have taken that office upon him according to the mind of Christ, and they are plainly expressed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The First is, that they be furnished with <hi>the gifts</hi> of the Holy-Ghost, for the discharge of the Ministry. The communication of the <hi>gifts</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost, is the foundation of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, as the Apostle declares, Ephes. 4.7, 8, 11, 12, 13. <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59624:65"/>
of the gift of Christ, wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto Men, and he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man.</hi> And if this were not continued, if the Lord Christ did not continue to give <hi>gifts</hi> unto men for that end, the ministry must and would cease in the Church; and all Church order and administrations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The exercise also of the gifts, is required in all them that are called unto sacred office, 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>Neglect nor the gift that is in thee.</hi> Hence persons destitute of these gifts of the spirit, as they cannot in a due manner discharge any one duty of the Ministry, so wanting an interest in that which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Office, are not esteemed of God as Ministers at all, whatever their outward call may be, Hosea 4.6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast rejected knowledge, I will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59624:66"/>
also reject thee, that thou shalt be no Priest to Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Their unblameableness and holiness of conversation is previously required in them that are to be set apart unto the Ministry. This the Apostle expresly declares, and layes down many particular instances whereby it is to be tryed, Tit. 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>For a Bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to Wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre, but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate, holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainsayers,</hi> 1 Tim. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>A Bishop must be blameless, the husband of one Wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient, not a brawler, nor covetous, one that ruleth well his own house, having his Children in subjection with all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of God? not a Novice, lest
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59624:66"/>
being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil; moreover he must have a good report of them which are without, least he fall into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the snare of the Devil.</hi> Not that the particulars here mentioned by the Apostle are only to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the conversation of the person to be called to the Ministry, but that in an universal holy conversation these things he requires that he should be eminent in amongst Believers, as those which have an especial respect to his work and office. And a failure in any of them, is a just cause or reason to debar any person from obtaining a part and lot in this matter. For whereas the especial end of the Ministry, is to promote and farther faith and holiness in the Church, by the edification of it, how unreasonable a thing would it be, if men should be admitted unto the work of it, who in their own Persons were strangers both unto faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. And herein are the Elders of the Churches seriously to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto God, that they may be an example unto the flock, in an universal
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59624:67"/>
labouring after conformity in their lives unto the great Bishop and Pastour of the Church, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is required that such a Person have a <hi>willing mind</hi> to give up himself unto God in this work, 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. <hi>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being Ensamples to the flock.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness and readiness of mind, are the things here required as a previous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification unto any mans susception of this Office; and two things doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> declare to be contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>First, The undertaking of it by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,</hi> which compriseth every antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent external impression upon the mind of the undertaker; such are personal outward necessities, compulsions of Friends, and relations, want of other wayes of subsistance in the World; all which and the like are condemned by the Apostle as bring some <hi>constraint</hi> on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59624:67"/>
the mind, which on other accounts oughty to be free and willing; as also all <hi>tergiversation</hi> and backwardness in persons duly qualified and called, on the consideration of difficulties, temptations, streights, persecutions, is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an eye and regard unto <hi>filthy lucre</hi> or profit in the World, is proposed as opposite unto the <hi>readiness of mind</hi> which is required in them that are called to this work. An aim in this employment for men by it to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage themselves in the outward things of this world, without which, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the whole work and Office would lye neglected by the most of them who now would be accounted partakers of it, is openly here condemned by the Apostle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Election</hi> by the suffrage and consent of the Church is required unto the calling of a Pastor or Teacher, so that without it formally, or virtually given or obtained, the call however otherwise carryed on or solemnized, is irregular and defective. There are but two places in the New Testament where
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59624:68"/>
there is mention of the <hi>manner</hi> whereby any are called in an <hi>ordinary</hi> way unto any ministery in the Church; and in both of them there is mention of their <hi>election</hi> by the community of the Church; and in both of them the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves presided with a fulness of Church power, and yet would not deprive the Churches of that which was their liberty and priviledge. The first of these is <hi>Acts</hi> the 6. where all the Apostles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to give a rule unto the future proceeding of all Churches in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Officers amongst them, do appoint the <hi>multitude of the Disciples</hi> or community of the Church, to look out from among themselves, or to choose the persons that were to be set apart thereon unto their office, which they did accordingly, Verses 2, 3, and 5. <hi>Then the twelve called the multitude of the Disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve Tables; wherefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy-Ghost, and wisdom; and the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59624:68"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was done when only <hi>Deacons</hi> were to be ordained, in whom the interest and concernment of the Church is not to be compared with that which it hath in its <hi>Pastors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> The same is mentioned again, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> are said to ordain Elders in the Churches by their election and suffrage, For the word there used, will admit of no other sence, however it be ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously expressed in our translation. Neither can any instance be given of the use of that word, applyed unto the communication of any office or power to any person or persons in an assembly wherein it denoteth any other action but the suffrage of the multitude; and this it doth constantly in all writers in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue. And hence it was that this right and priviledge of the Church, in choosing of those who are to be set over them in the work of the Lord, was a long time preserved inviolate in the primitive Churches, as the ancients do abundantly testifie. Yea the shew and appearance of it, could never be utterly thrust out of the World, but is still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59624:69"/>
in those Churches which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the thing it self. And this institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord Jesus Christ by his Apostles, is suited to the nature of the Church, and of the authority that he hath appointed to abide therein. For as we have shewed before, persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Church by their own voluntary consent. Christ makes his subjects wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not slaves: His rule over them is by his grace in their own wills, and he will have them every way free in their obedience. A Church-state is an estate of absolute liberty under Christ, not for men to do what they will, but for men to do their duty freely, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion. Now nothing is more contrary to this liberty, than to have their Guides, Rulers, and Overseers impose on them without their consent. Besides, the body of the Church is obliged to discharge its duty towards Christ in every institution of his, which herein they cannot, if they have not their free consent in the choice of their Pastors or Elders, but are considered as <hi>mute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> or brute creatures. Neither is there any other ordinary way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59624:69"/>
authority unto any in the Church, but by the voluntary submission and subjection of the Church it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For as all other imaginable wayes may fail and have done so, where they have been trusted unto, so they are irrational, and unscriptural, as to their being a means of the delegation of any power whatever.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Unto this election succeeds the solemn <hi>setting apart</hi> of them that are chosen by the Church unto this work and ministry, by fasting, prayer, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the hands of the <hi>Presbitery,</hi> before constituted in the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any person is so to be set apart.</p>

            <p>Answ. <hi>Neither of these have either warrant or President in the Scripture, nor is the first of them consistent with the authority of the Ministry, nor the latter with the duty thereof, nor either

            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>There are two parts of this Question and Answer, to be spoken unto severally. The First is concerning a person to be called or employed in any Church, in a part only of the office or work of the Ministry. As suppose a Man should be called or chosen by the Church to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Sacraments, but not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the work of Preaching; or unto the rule or guidance of the Church; or in like manner unto any other part or parcell of the work of the Ministry, with an exemption of other duties from his charge or care. If this be done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and agreement, for any time or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it is unwarrantable and disorderly; (what may be done <hi>occasionally</hi> upon an emergency, or in case of weakness or disability befalling any <hi>Elder</hi> as to the discharge of any part of his duty, is not here enquired after.) For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59624:70"/>First, If the Person so called or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed have received gifts fitting him for the whole work of the Ministry, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of them is not to be restrained by any consent or agreement; Seeing they are given for the edification of the Church to be traded withall, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. <hi>The manifestation of the spirit, is given to every man to profit withall</hi>; and this he which hath received such gifts, is bound to attend unto, and pursue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If he have not received such gifts as compleatly to enable him unto the discharge of the whole work of the Ministry in the Church wherein he is to administer, it is not lawful for the Church to call him unto that work wherein the Lord Christ hath not gone before them in qualifying him for it. Yea to do so, would be most irregular, for the whole power of the Church, consists in its attendance unto the rule given unto it. And therefore the office and work of the Ministry being consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Law of Christ, it is not in the power of the Church to enlarge or streighten the power or duty of any one that is called unto the office thereof.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59624:71"/>
Neither can or ought any person that is called unto the worke of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry to give his consent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the exercise of that gift that he hath received, in a due and orderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor to the abridgement of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the Lord Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>As it is incumbent upon them to take care to preserve their whole authority, and to discharge their whole duty, so that arbitrary constitutions of this nature are irregular, and would bring in confusion into Churches.</p>
               <p>The second part of the <hi>Question</hi> is, concerning the Relation of the same person to more Churches than one at the same time, and his undertaking to discharge the duty of his relation unto them, as an <hi>Elder</hi> or Minister. And this also is irregular and unwarrantable. Now a man may hold the relation of an <hi>Elder, Pastor,</hi> or Minister unto more Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than one two wayes; First, <hi>formally</hi> and directly, by all equal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal interest in them, undertaking the Pastoral charge equally and alike of them, being called alike to them and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59624:71"/>
accepting of such a relation. (2) vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; when by virtue of his relation unto one Church he puts forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or authority in Ministerial acts in, or towards another. The First way is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and destructive both of the Office and duty of a Pastor. For as <hi>Elders</hi> are ordained in, and unto the Churches respectively that they are to take care of; <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. And their office power consists in a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> unto the Church that they are set over, so they are commanded to attend unto the service of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wherein, and whereunto, they are so ordained. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2. And that with all diligence care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, as those that must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. which no man is able to do towards more Churches than one, the same duty being at all times to be performed towards all.

The latter way also of relation unto many Churches is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable; For (1) It hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scripture; no Law, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ, or his Apostles, can be produced to give it countenance; but Elders were ordained to their own Churches, and commanded to attend unto them. (2) No <hi>rule</hi> is given unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elders how they should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in reference unto more Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es than one, in the exercise of their ministerial power, as there are rules gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto every one for the discharge of that duty in the Church whereunto he is related. (3) There is no <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to give it countenance recorded in the Scripture. (4) The authority to be put forth hath no foundation. (1) Not in the <hi>gifts</hi> they have received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>ministerial power</hi> is not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute ability or faculty of doing what a man is able, but <hi>a right,</hi> whereby a

man hath power to do that <hi>rightly</hi> and <hi>lawfully,</hi> which before he could not do. This, gifts will not give to any; for if they did, they would do it to all that have received them. (2) Not in their <hi>election,</hi> for they are chosen in and by that Church whereunto they stand in especial relation, whose choice cannot give ministerial power over any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. (3) Not in their <hi>setting apart</hi> by fasting, prayer, and imposition of hands, for this is only unto that office, work, and power, whereunto they are chosen. They are not chosen for one end, and set apart for another. (4) Not from the Communion of Churches, for that gives no new power, but only a due exercise of that which was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>The answer unto this Question ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the <hi>power</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> of the Elders of the Church, from whom they do receive it, and how it is exercised by them; the right stating whereof is of great importance in the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here be farther explained: to this end we may consider,</p>
               <p>First, that all Church power is <hi>originally</hi> vested in Jesus Christ the sole head, and Monarch thereof. God the Father hath committed it unto him, and intrusted him with it for the accomplishment of his work of mediation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he doth communicate of this authority by way of trust, to be exercised by them in his name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to persons by him appointed, so much as is needful for the ordering and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of all things in his Churches, unto the blessed ends for which he hath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59624:74"/>
instituted and appointed them. For no man can have any power in his Church for any end whatever, but by <hi>delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from him. What is not received from him, is meer usurpation. And whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver takes upon himself the exercise of any Rule, or Authority, or power in the Church, not granted unto them by him, or not rightly derived from him, is an oppressor, a thief, and a Robber; this necessarily follows upon the absolute investiture of all power in him alone. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the means whereby the Lord Christ communicates this power unto men, is by his <hi>Law,</hi> and constitution, whereby he hath granted, ordained, and appointed, that such and such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers shall be exercised in his Church, and that by such and such persons, to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto them in such a way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; so that the word of the Gospel, or the Laws and constitutions of the Lord Christ therein, are the first recipient seat and subject <hi>morally</hi> of all Church pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whatever. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the way and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59624:75"/>
any persons come to a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this power regularly, according to the mind of Christ, is by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto, and due observation of his laws and commands, in them unto whom they are prescribed. As when an Office, with the power of it, is consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and limited by the law of the Land, there is no more required to invest any man in that office, or to give him that power, than the due observance of the means and way prescribed in the law to that end. The way then, whereby the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church do come to participate of the power and authority which Christ hath appointed to be exercised in his Church, is by their, and the Churches due observance of the Rules and Laws given by him for their election, and setting apart unto that office. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.24.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, on this account they receive their power from Christ himself alone, and that immediately; for the means used for their participation of it, are not <hi>recipient</hi> of the power it self <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> nor do authoritatively collate or conferr it, only the laws of Christ are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59624:75"/>
executed in a way of obedience. So that though they are chosen and set apart to their office by the <hi>Church,</hi> yet they are <hi>made Overseers by the holy-Ghost, Acts</hi> 20.28. Though they have their power by the Church, yet they have it not from the Church; nor was that power whereof they are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (as was said) <hi>formally resident</hi> in the body of the Church, before their participation of it; but <hi>really</hi> in Christ himself alone, and <hi>morally</hi> in his word or law. And thence is the rule and guidance of the Church committed unto them by Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this authority and power thus received from Christ, is that which they exert and put forth in all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial administrations, in all which they do as ministers in the house of God, either in his worship, or in the rule of the Church it self. They exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise that authority of Christ, which he hath in his law appointed to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in his Church; and from that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is due order given unto the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of all the ordinances of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59624:76"/>
worship; and an obligation unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to acts of rule doth thence also ensue; so that they which despise them, despise the authority of Christ.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, when as Elders they do, or declare any thing in the name of the Church, they do not, <hi>as such,</hi> put forth any authority committed unto them from and by the Church, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>consent</hi> and determination of the Church in the exercise of their own liberty and priviledge; but the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they act by, and which they put forth, is that which is committed to themselves <hi>as such</hi> by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, this authority is comprised in the Law and constitution of Christ which themselves exert only <hi>ministerially</hi>; and therefore when ever they act any thing <hi>authoritatively,</hi> which they are not enabled for, or warranted in by the word of the Gospel, or do any thing without, or contrary unto rule, all such actings as to any spiritual effect of the Gospel, or obligation on the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men, are <hi>Ipso facto null,</hi> and are no way ratified in Heaven, where all their orderly actings are made valid;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59624:76"/>
that is, by Christ himself in his Word.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The reason therefore why the <hi>consent</hi> of the Church is required unto the <hi>authoritative</hi> acting of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therein; is not because from thence any <hi>authority</hi> doth accrew unto them anew, which virtually and radically they had not before; but because by the rule of the Gospel this is required to the orderly acting of their power, which without it would be contrary to rule, and therefore ineffectual; as also it must needs be from the nature of the thing it self; for no act can take place in the Church without or against its own consent, whilest its obedience is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and of choice.</p>
               <p>But if it be asked, what then shall the Elders do, in case the Church refuse to consent unto such acts as are indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rule, and warranted by the institution of Christ? it is answered, that they are First diligently to <hi>instruct</hi> them from the word in their duty, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known the mind of Christ unto them in the matter under consideration. (2) To declare unto them the <hi>danger</hi> of their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59624:77"/>
dissent in obstructing the edification of the Body to the dishonour of the Lord Christ, and their own spiritual disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. (3) To <hi>wait patiently</hi> for the concurrence of the grace of God with their Ministry, in giving light and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the Church; and (4) In case of the Churches continuance in any failure of duty, to seek for advice and <hi>counsel</hi> from the Elders and Brethren of other Churches, all which particulars might be enlarged, would the nature of our present design and work permit it.</p>

            <div type="explication">

               <p>The <hi>Office</hi> of them that are to instruct the Church in the name and authority of Christ, is one and the same, as hath been shewed before. And there are many names that are equally accommodated unto all that are partakers of it, as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Bishops, Guides; They are all alike Elders, alike Bishops, alike Guides, have the one office in common amongst them, and every one the whole intire unto himself. But there are names also given unto them, whereby they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht, not as to Office, but as to their work and employment in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that office: such are <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> Ephes. 4.11. Which are placed as distinct persons in their work, partakers of the same Office. Now the foundation of this distinction and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lyes.</p>
               <p>First, In the different gifts that they have received; For although it be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them all, that they have received all
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59624:78"/>
those gifts, abilities, and qualifications which are necessary for the work of the Ministry, yet as to the degrees of their participation of their gifts, some may more excell in one, others in another, 1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 6. <hi>There are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit, and there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord: and there are diversities of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it is the same God which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in all. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit,</hi> &amp;c. and all these gifts are bestowed upon them to be exercised and laid out, for the profit and benefit of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Verse</hi> the 7. <hi>The manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> And therefore every one is in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, It lyes in the nature of the work of the Ministry in the Church, which in general may be referred unto two heads or ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59624:79"/>First, The <hi>instruction</hi> of it in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Christ, and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel, that it might grow in grace, wisdom, saving light, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>exhortation</hi> of it to walk answerable unto light received in holiness and universal obedience. Now though these several ends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry cannot be divided or separated, yet they may be distinguished, and so carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on distinctly, that in the one, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or light may be firstly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended, so as to lead unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; in the other, holiness may be firstly designed, as springing from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel light or knowledge. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Elders of the Church, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to attend unto that work or that end of the Ministry, which by the Holy-Ghost they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> most suited unto. And therefore the Church following the intimations of the Holy-Ghost, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his gifts in variety as he pleaseth, and attending their own edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, may and ought amongst those whom they choose to the Office of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Ministers, withall design them in

when those with whom they have to do, deny that distinction of the Church into the <hi>Clergy</hi> and Layity. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they allow the distribution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, into <hi>Officers,</hi> and the <hi>multitude of the Brethren,</hi> yet they maintain that the whole Church is <hi>Gods Clergy,</hi> his lot, and portion, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. Again, they affirm them to be <hi>Elders,</hi> and therein not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the members of the Church, but Officers set apart unto their Office ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rule, or the appointment of Christ. And if by <hi>Layity,</hi> the people distinct from the Officers of the Church are to be understood, the very term of a <hi>lay Elder</hi> implyes a contradiction, as designing one, who <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> a Church Officer. Besides, themselves do principally govern the Church by such whom they esteem <hi>Lay-men,</hi> as not in holy-Orders; to whom the principal part of its rule, at least in the execution of it is committed, which renders their objection to this sort of Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers unreasonable. Others also have given advantage by making this Office <hi>annual,</hi> or <hi>biennial,</hi> in them that are chosen unto it; which though they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59624:80"/>
plead the <hi>necessity</hi> of their Churches for, as not having Persons meet for this work and duty, who are willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in constantly during their lives, without such a contribution for their maintenance as they are not able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; yet the wisest of them do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an irregularity in what they do, and wish it remedied. But this hinders not, but that such Church-Officers are indeed designed in the Scripture, and of whom frequent mention is made in the ancient writers, and footsteps also, yet remain in most Churches of their institution, though wofully corrupted. For besides, that some light in this matter may be taken from the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> wherein the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> were joyned in Rule with the <hi>Priests,</hi> both in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and all lesser Assemblies; there is in the Gospel express mention of persons that were assigned peculiarly for Rule and Government in the Church, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. And it is in vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that those words, <hi>helps, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> do denote <hi>gifts</hi> only, seeing the Apostle expresly enumerates the <hi>persons</hi> in Office, or <hi>Officers,</hi> which the Lord
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59624:81"/>
Christ then used in the foundation, and Rule of the Churches as then planted. He that <hi>ruleth,</hi> also is distinguisht from him that <hi>teacheth,</hi> and him that <hi>exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Rom. 12.8. and is prescribed <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> as his principal qualification in the discharge of his duty. And the words of the Apostle to this purpose, are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> For the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly assign two sorts of Elders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some, only attend unto rule; others moreover labour in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Neither doth that word, as some would have it, <hi>labour in the Word,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any other labour but what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all the Pastors and Teachers of their Church as their constant duty; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12. Now can we suppose that the Apostle would affirm them to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour, whom comparing with others, he notes as <hi>remiss</hi> and <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> in their work. For it seems that others were more diligent in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that duty, which was no less
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59624:81"/>
theirs, if only one sort of Elders be here intended. The Scripture is not wont to <hi>commend</hi> such persons as worthy of <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour,</hi> but rather to propose them as meet for double shame and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. And they are unmindful of their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, who would have <hi>Bishops</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the rule of the Church, to be distinctly intended by the <hi>Elders that rule</hi> well; seeing the Apostle expresly preferreth before and above them, those that attend constantly to the Word and Doctrine. And besides what is thus expresly spoken concerning the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this sort of Elders in the Church, their <hi>usefulness</hi> in the necessity of their work, and employment, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For whereas a constant care in the Church, that the conversation of all the members of it be such as becometh the Gospel, that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be not evil spoken of, is of great concernment and importance, and the <hi>Pastors</hi> and Teachers, being to give up themselves continually unto <hi>prayer, and the ministry of the word,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attend unto the constant and daily
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59624:82"/>
oversight thereof, the usefulness of these Elders, whose proper and peculiar work it is to have regard unto the holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, must needs be manifest unto all. But whereas in most Churches, there is little or no regard unto the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal holiness</hi> of the members of them, it is no wonder that no account should be had of them who are ordained by the Lord Christ to look after it and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it.</p>
               <p>The qualifications of these <hi>Elders,</hi> with the way of their call and setting apart unto their Office, being the same with those of the <hi>Teaching Elders</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore insisted on, need not be here again repeated. Their authority also in the whole rule of the Church, is every way the same with that of the other sort of Elders, and they are to act in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it with equal respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard from the Church. Yea the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>rule,</hi> being peculiarly committed unto them, and they required to attend thereunto with <hi>diligence</hi> in an especial manner, the work thereof is principally theirs; as that of <hi>labouring in the word and doctrine</hi> doth especially belong unto
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59624:82"/>
the Pastors and Teachers of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And this institution is abused, when either unmeet persons are called to this Office, or those that are called, do not attend unto their duty with <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> or do act only in it by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Teaching Officers, without a sence of their own authority, or due respect from the Church.</p>

               <p>The Office of the <hi>Deacon,</hi> the nature, end, and use of it, the qualification of the persons to be admitted unto it, the way and manner of their Election and setting apart; are all of them plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Scripture, Acts 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>There arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were neglected in the daily ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then the twelve called the multitude of the Disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve Tables; wherefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy-Ghost, and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; and the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, &amp;c. <hi>whom they set before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Likewise must the Deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much Wine, not given to filthy lucre, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59624:83"/>
Conscience; and let these also first be proved, then let them use the Office of a Deacon, being found blameless; the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of one Wife, ruling their Children, and their own house well, for they that have used the Office of a Deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</hi> These things are thus plain and express in the Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pture. But whereas many have grown weary of the observation of the institutions of the Gospel, this Office hath for a long time been lost amongst the most of Christians. By some the name is retained, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to another work, duty, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than this to which it is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly appropriated in the Scripture. Their proper and original work of taking care for the poor, they say, is provided for by others; and therefore that <hi>office</hi> being needless, another, unto another purpose, under the same name, is erected. Such are Deacons that may <hi>read Service, Preach</hi> and Baptise, when they have license thereunto. But this choice, to rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct an Office of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Christ, under pretence of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59624:84"/>
provision made for the duties of it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and the erecting of one not appointed by him, seems not equall. But whereas it is our duty in all things to have regard to the authority of Christ and his appointments in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, if we claim the priviledge of being called after his name, some think that if what he hath appointed may be colourably performed another way without respect unto his institutions, that is far the best. But omitting the practice of other Men, the things that concern this Office in the Church, are as was said, clear in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>First, The persons called unto it are to be of <hi>honest report,</hi> furnished with the gifts of the Holy-Ghost, especially with <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Acts 6.3. And those other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments usefull in the discharge of their duty mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The way whereby they come to be made partakers of this Office, is by the choice or <hi>election</hi> of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3, 5. whereupon they are solemnly to be set apart by prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their work or duty consists
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59624:84"/>
in a daily ministration unto the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poor <hi>Saints,</hi> or Members of the Church, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To this end that they may be enabled so to do, it is ordained, that every <hi>first day</hi> the Members of the Church do contribute according as God enables them of their substance, for the supply of the wants of the poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. And also <hi>occasionally,</hi> as necessity shall require, or God move their hearts by his grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Hereunto is to be added whatever by the providence of God may be conferred upon the Church for its outward advantage, with reference unto the end mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34, 35.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, These supplyes of the Church being committed to the care and charge of the <hi>Deacons,</hi> they are from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59624:85"/>
which minister well in this office, may purchase to themselves a good degree, and boldness in the faith, and that in all, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified with praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p>It belongs therefore unto Persons called unto this Office,</p>
               <p>First, To acquaint themselves with the <hi>outward condition</hi> of those that appear to be poor and needy in the Church, whether by the addresses of such poor ones, who are bound to make known their wants, occasions, and necessities unto them, or by the information of others, or their own observation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to acquaint the Elders and the Church as occasion requireth with the necessities of the poor under their care, that those who are able may be stirred up by the Elders, to a free supply and contribution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To dispose what they are entrusted with <hi>faithfully,</hi> cheerfully, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, with <hi>partiality</hi> or preferring one before another, for any outward respect whatever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To keep and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59624:85"/>
unto the Church when called for, of what they have received, and how they have disposed of it, that so they may be known to have well discharged their Office; that is with care, wisdom, and tenderness, whereby they procure to themselves a good degree with boldness in the faith, and the Church is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to entrust them farther with this sacrifice of their almes, which is so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God.</p>

               <p>Besides the general duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity incumbent on all Believers, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ as such, there are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry especial duties required of them as <hi>gathered</hi> into Church societies, upon the account of an especial trust committed unto them in that state and condition; For,</p>
               <p>First, the Church being appointed as the <hi>seat</hi> and subject of all the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ, and ordinances of Gospel worship, it is its duty, that is, of the whole body and every member in his proper place, to use all care, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and diligence, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ be kept inviolate, and all his institutions observed, according to his mind and will. Thus those <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church, Acts</hi> 2.42. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Church, <hi>continued stedfastly (which</hi> argues care, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection and diligence) in <hi>the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayers</hi>; Which principal duties are enumerated, to express their respect
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59624:86"/>
towards all. This is their <hi>standing fast in the Lord,</hi> which was a matter of such joy to the Apostle when he found it in the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>; 1 Ephe. 3.8. <hi>For now we live if ye stand fast in the Lord.</hi> That <hi>order</hi> and stedfastness which he rejoyced over in the <hi>Colossians</hi>; Chap. 2.5. <hi>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and boholding your order and the stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your faith in Christ.</hi> And where this duty is despised, men contenting themselves with what is done by others, there is a great neglect of that <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> in obedience which the Church owes unto Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord Christ, and the doctrine of the Gospel to be manifested in, and by the power of an holy exemplary conversation, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Church and all the members of it. This is one end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Christ calls them out of the World, separates them to be a peculiar people unto himself, brings them forth unto a visible profession, and puts his name upon them, namely that in their walking, and conversation, he may shew
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59624:87"/>
forth the holiness of his doctrine, and power of his spirit, grace, and example to effect in them all holiness; godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, righteousness and honesty in the World. Hence are they earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto these things. Phil. 4.8.9. <hi>Brethren whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if their be any praise, think on these things</hi>; and that to this end, that the doctrine of the Gospel may be adorned and Christ glorified in all things; <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. And those who fail herein are said to be <hi>Enemies of the cross of Christ</hi>; Phil. 3.18; As hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the progress of the doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by representing it undesirable in their conversation. This also therefore, even the dutie of universal holiness, with an especial regard unto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ, and the Gospel which they are called and designed to testifie and express in the World, is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Church, and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it; namely as the Apostle speaks,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59624:87"/>
                  <hi>that they be blameless, and harmless, the sons of God, without rebukes in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom they are to shine as lights in the World,</hi> Phil. 2.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the care of <hi>declaring</hi> and manifesting the <hi>truth</hi> is also committed unto them. Christ hath made the Church to be the <hi>pillar and ground of truth.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. where the truth of the Gospel is so firmly <hi>seated,</hi> founded, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, established, and then <hi>lifted up</hi> in the wayes of Christs appointment to be seen, discerned, and known by others. And as this is done <hi>principally</hi> in the preaching of the Gospel by the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church, and in their contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the truth once delivered unto the saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. So it is also the duty of the whole Church, <hi>to hold forth the word of life,</hi> Phill. 2.16. by ministring of the gift that <hi>every man</hi> hath received; 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 4.10. In the way of Christs appointment. In these, and the like instances, doth our Lord Jesus require of his Church that they express in the World their subjection unto him, and his authority; and that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59624:88"/>
they abide therein unto the end, against all opposition whatever.</p>
               <p>The sinful neglect of Churches in the discharge of their duty herein, was one great means of that <hi>Apostacy</hi> from the rule of the Gospel which they generally of old fell into. When the members of them began to think that they had no advantage by their state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but only the outward partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of some Ordinance of worship, and no duty incumbent on them, but only to attend and follow the motions and actings of their Guides, the whole societies quickly became corrupt, and fit to be disposed of according to the carnal interest of those that had by their neglect and sin, gotten dominion over them. And at all times, as the <hi>people</hi> were negligent in their duty, the <hi>Leaders</hi> of them were apt to usurp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due authority. When the one sort will not do that which they ought, the other are ready to take upon them what they ought not. It is a circumspect performance of duty on all hands alone, that will keep all sorts of persons in the Church within those bounds, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59624:88"/>
limits, and up to those rights, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which Christ hath allotted and granted unto them. And herein alone doth the order, honour, and beauty of the Church consist. Church members therefore are to <hi>search</hi> and enquire after the particular duties, which <hi>as such,</hi> are incumbent on them; as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what influence their special state and condition as they are Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ought to have into all the duties of their obedience as they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For this priviledge is granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for their <hi>edification,</hi> that is their fartherance in their whole course of walking before God. And if this be neglected, if they content themselves with a <hi>name to live</hi> in this or that Church, to partake of the Ordinances that are stated and solemnly administred, only that which would have been to their advantage, may prove to be a snare and temptation unto them. What these especial duties are in the particular instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them, is of too large a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration here to be insisted on. Besides it is the great dutie of the Guides of the Church, to be inculcating of them
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59624:89"/>
into the minds of those committed to their charge. For the Churches due performance of its dutie, is their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Crown, and reward.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>It consists in the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eise of that authority and power which the Lord Christ in and by his Word hath granted unto the Church, for its continuance, increase, and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in purity, order, and holiness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his appointment,</hi> Matth. 16.19. Rom. 12.8. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5, 6. Rev. 2.2, 20.</p>
            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>Sundry things are to be considered about this discipline of the Church; as</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>foundation</hi> of it, which is a grant of power and authority made unto it by Jesus Christ, as Mediator, Head, King, and Law-giver of his Church. For all <hi>discipline</hi> being an act of power, and this being exercised in and about things internal, and spiritual, no men can of themselves, or by grant of any others, have any right or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59624:91"/>
to, or in the exercise thereof. Whoever hath any interest herein, or right hereunto, it must be granted unto him from above, by Jesus Christ, and that as Mediator and head of his Church. For as all Church power, is in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner by the authority and grant of the Father vested in him alone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23. So the <hi>nature</hi> of it which is <hi>spiritual,</hi> the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of it which are the Consciences and Gospel priviledges of Believers, with the <hi>ends</hi> of it, namely the glory of God in Christ, with the spiritual and eternal good of the souls of men, do all manifest that it can have no other right nor foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. This in the first place is to be fixed, that no authority can be exercised in the Church, but what is derived from Jesus Christ, as was spoken before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>means</hi> whereby the Lord Christ doth communicate this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority unto his Church, is his <hi>word</hi> or his <hi>law</hi> and constitution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it in the Gospel; so that it is exactly limited and bounded thereby. And no power or authority can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the Church, but what is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59624:92"/>
granted and conveyed unto it by the word; seeing that Christ communicates no power or authority any other wayes. What ever of that nature is beside it, or beyond it, is meer usurpation, and <hi>null</hi> in its exercise. Herein is the commission of the Guides and Rules of the Church expressed, which they are not to exceed in any thing. Herein are bounds and limits fixed to the actings of the whole Church, and of every part and member of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This power or authority, thus granted, and conveyed by Jesus Christ, is to be exercised as to the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the administration of discipline, with <hi>skill and diligence,</hi> Rom. 12.6. 1 Cor. 12. and the skill required here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is a gift, or an ability of mind bestowed by the Holy-Ghost upon men to put in execution the Laws of Christ, for the government of the Church, in the way and order by him appointed; or a <hi>spiritual wisdom</hi> whereby men know how to behave themselves in the house of God, in their several places, for its due edification in faith and love, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And this ability of mind to make a due
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59624:92"/>
application of the Laws of the Gospel unto persons, times, and actions with their circumstances, is such a gift of the Holy-Ghost, as whereof there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees answering to the distinct du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are incumbent on the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church on the one hand, and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> on the other. And where this skill and wisdome is wanting, there it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church, should be preserved or carryed on. Hereunto also diligence and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are to be added, without which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power will never obtain their proper end in a due manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>discipline</hi> is continuance, increase, and preservation of the Church, according to the rule of its first institution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. This power, hath Christ given his Church for its conservation, without which it must necessarily decay, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nor is it to be imagined that where any Church is called and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the mind of Christ, that he hath left it destitute of power and authority to preserve it self, in that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59624:93"/>
state and order which he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it. And that which was one principal cause of the decayes of the <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Churches, was the neglect of this <hi>Dicipline,</hi> the power and priviledge whereof, the Lord had left unto them and intrusted them withall, for their own preservation in order, purity and holiness. And therefore for the neglect thereof they were greatly blamed by him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.2. as is also the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, who attended unto the diligent exercise of it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.9. The disuse also of it, hath been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of all the defilements, abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confusions, that have spread themselves over many Churches in the World.</p>

            <p>Quest. 42. <hi>Vnto whom is the power and administration of this Discipline com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Jesus Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>As to the</hi> authority <hi>to be exerted in it in the things wherein the whole Church is concerned, unto the Elders; as unto</hi> tryall, <hi>judgement
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59624:93"/>
and consent in, and unto its exercise unto the whole Brotherhood; as unto</hi> love, <hi>care, and watchfuless in private and particular cases, to every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church.</hi> Matth. 24.45. Ephes. 4.13, 14. Acts 20.28. 1 Tim. 3.5. Chap. 5.17. Heb. 13.17. 1 Pet. 2.3. 1 Thes. 5.12. Gal. 6.1, 2. 1 Cor. 4.14. 1 Cor. 5.2, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 2.6, 7, 8. 2 Tim. 4.2.</p>
            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>It hath been shewed that this power is granted unto the Church by virtue of the <hi>Law</hi> and constitution of Christ. Now this Law assigns the means and way whereby any persons do obtain an interest therein; and makes the just allotments to all concerned in it. What this Law, Constitution or Word of Christ assigns unto any, <hi>as such,</hi> that they are the <hi>first seat</hi> and subject of, by what way or means soever they come to be intrusted therein. Thus that power or authority which is given unto the Elders of the Church, doth not first <hi>formally</hi> reside in the body of the Church unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59624:94"/>
or distinct from them, though they are called unto their Office by their suffrage and choice; but they are themselves as such, the first subject of Office power; For so is the Will of the Lord Christ. Nor is the interest of the whole Church in this power of discipline whatever it be, given unto it by the Elders, but is immediately grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it, by the will and Law of the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>First, In this way and manner the Authority above described, is given in the first place, as such, unto the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church. This Authority was before explained, in answer unto the 28th. question, as also was the <hi>way</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they receive it. And it is that power of office whereby they are enabled for the discharge of their whole duty, in the teaching, and ruling of the Church; called the <hi>power of the keyes,</hi> from <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. Which expression being <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical,</hi> and in general lyable unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interpretations, is to be understood according to the declaration made of it in those particular instances wherein it is expressed. Nor is it a two-fold
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59624:94"/>
power or Authority that the Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Church have committed unto them; one to teach and another to rule, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the power of order, and of jurisdiction; but it is <hi>one power of Office,</hi> the duties whereof are of several kinds, referred unto the two general heads, first of <hi>teaching</hi> by preaching the word and celebration of the Sacraments, and (2) Of <hi>rule</hi> or government. By virtue hereof, are they made <hi>Rulers</hi> over the house of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in his house, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Overseers</hi> of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.2. <hi>Guides</hi> unto the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. Not that they have a supream or <hi>auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratorical</hi> power committed unto them, to enable them to do what seems right and good in their own eyes, seeing they are expresly bound up unto the terms of their Commission, Matth. 28.19, 20. <hi>To teach men to do and observe all, and only what Christ hath commanded</hi>; nor have they by virtue of it, any domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in, or over the Church, that is, the laws, rules or priviledges of it, or the consciences of the Disciples of Christ, to alter, change, add, diminish, or bind by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59624:95"/>
their own authority, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.42, 43<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 44. But it is a power meerly <hi>ministerial,</hi> in whose exercise they are unto the Lord Christ accountable <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Heb. 13.17. Matth. 24.45. And Servants of the Church for Jesus sake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. This authority in the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church they exert and put forth by virtue of their Office; and not either as declaring of the power of the Church it self, or acting what is delegated unto them thereby, but as ministerially exercising the authority of Christ committed unto themselves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The body of the Church, or the multitude of the Brethren, (wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being excepted by especial prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12.) Is by the Law and constitution of Christ in the Gospel, interested in the administration of this power of discipline in the Church, so far as,</p>
               <p>First, To consider, try, and make a judgement, in and about all persons, things, and causes, in reference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is to be exercised. Thus the <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> joyned in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the observation of <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59624:95"/>
ceremonies</hi> with the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. And the <hi>multitude</hi> of them to whom letters were sent about it, likewise did the same, <hi>Verse</hi> the 30, 31, 32. And this they thought it their duty and concernment to do, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21, 22. And they are blamed, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed not themselves unto this duty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6. Thence are the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Churches to instruct them in their duties, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in Christ, and how they ought to behave themselves in the ordering of all things amongst them according to his mind. And these are directed unto the Churches themselves, either joyntly with their Elders, or distinctly from them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. And the whole preservation of Church-order, is on the account of this duty recommended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Neither can what they do in complyance with their Guides and Rulers, be any part of their obedience unto the Lord Christ, unless they make previously thereunto a rational consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and judgement by the rule, of what is to be done. Neither is the Church of Christ to be ruled without
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59624:96"/>
its knowledge, or against its will; nor in any thing is blind obedience accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church are intrusted with the priviledge of giving and testifying their consent unto all acts of Church power, which though it belong not <hi>formally</hi> unto the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them, it is necessary unto their validity and efficacy; and that so far forth, as that they are said to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>act</hi> what is done and effected thereby, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. And they who have this priviledge of <hi>consent</hi> which hath so great an influence into the action and validity of it, have also the liberty of dissent; when any thing is proposed to be done, the <hi>warrant</hi> whereof from the Word and the <hi>rule</hi> of its performance, is not evident unto them.</p>

               <p>First, what is previously required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and that is,</p>
               <p>First, that in all the members of the Church there ought to be <hi>love without dissimulation.</hi> They are to be kindly affectioned one to another with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9, 10. which as they are taught of God, so they are greatly exhorted thereunto; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1. This love is the bond of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most excellent way and means of preserving Church order, and farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the edification thereof. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Without which, well seated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the hearts and minds of Church members, no duty of their Relation can ever be performed in a due manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this love is to exert and put forth it self in tender care and watchfulness for the good of each other;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59624:98"/>
which are to work by mutual exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, informations, instructions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as opportunities do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as the necessities of any do seem to require. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this duty of admonishing offenders privately and personally, is common to the Elders with all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; neither doth it belong properly unto the Elders as such but as Brethren of the same society. And yet by virtue of their office the Elders are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do it with more Authority moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though office power properly be not exercised therein. By virtue also of their constant general watch over the whole flock in the discharge of their office, they are enabled to take notice of, and discern miscarriages in any of the members, soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than others. But as to the exercise of the discipline of the Church in this matter, this duty is equally incumbent on every member of it, according as the obligation on them to watch over one another, and to exercise especial love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other is equal: Whence it is distinguished from that private <hi>pastoral</hi> admonition, which is an act of the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

office and power, not directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the rule or government enquired after. But this admonition is an effect of love and where it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from thence, it is irregular, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16, 17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this duty is so incumbent on every member of the Church, that in case of the neglect thereof, he both sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against the institution of Christ, and makes himself partaker of the sin of the party offending, and is also guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his danger, and ruine thereby, with all that disadvantage which will accrue to the Church, by any of the members of it continuing in sin against the rule of the Gospel. They have not only <hi>liberty</hi> thus to admonish one another, but it is their express and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible duty so to do. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whereof is interpreted by God to be <hi>hatred of our Brother</hi>; such as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the love of God is inconsistent, <hi>Levit</hi> 19.17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, although this duty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally incumbent on every individual member of the Church, yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but if the sin of an offender
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59624:99"/>
be known to more than one at the same time, and they joyntly take offence thereat, they may together in the first instance admonish him, which yet still is but the first, and <hi>private</hi> admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is otherwise, when others are called into assistance, who are not themselves acquainted with the offence but only by information, and joyne in it, not upon the account of their own being offended, but of being desired ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto rule to give assistance to them that are so.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the way and manner of the discharge of this duty is, that it be done with prudence, tenderness, and due regard unto all circumstances; whence the Apostle supposeth a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>abilitie</hi> to be necessary for this work Rom. 15.14. Ye <hi>also are full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, filled with all knowledge, also able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish one another</hi>; especially four things are to be diligently heeded.</p>
               <p>First, that the whole duty be so managed, that the person <hi>offending</hi> may be convinced, that it is done out of <hi>love</hi> to him and affectionate conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious care over him, that he may take
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59624:100"/>
no occasion thereby for the exasperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Persons <hi>admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> others of their offence, do make it appear that what they do is in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto an institution of Christ, and therein to preserve their own souls from sin, as well as to benefit the offenders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the admonition be grounded on a rule, which alone gives it authority and efficacy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that there be a readiness ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by them, to receive satisfaction; either (1) In case that upon tryal, it appeareth the information they have had of the miscarriage whence the offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, was <hi>undue,</hi> or not well grounded; or (2) of acknowledgement and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The ends of this Ordinance and institution of Christ, are,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To keep up Love without dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation among all the members of the Church; for if <hi>offences</hi> should abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removed, love which is the bond of perfection, would not long continue in sincerity; which tends to the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole society.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59624:100"/>(2.) To gain the <hi>offender,</hi> by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the guilt of sin, that he may not lye under it, and procure the wrath of God against himself, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To preserve his person from <hi>dishonour</hi> and disreputation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to keep up his usefulness in the Church. To this end hath our Lord appointed the discharge of this duty in private, that the failings of men may not be unnecessarily divulged, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereby exposed unto tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) To preserve the Church from that <hi>scandal</hi> that might befall it, by the hasty opening of all the reall or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed faylings of its members. And</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) To prevent its <hi>trouble</hi> in the publick hearing of things that may be otherwise healed and removed.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In case these ends are obtained, either by the supposed offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons <hi>clearing of themselves,</hi> and manifesting themselves innocent of the crimes charged on them, as <hi>Joshua</hi> 22.22, 23, 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Or by their <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> repentance, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59624:101"/>
amendment, then this part of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church hath, through the grace of Christ obtained its appointed effect.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, In case the persons offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be not humbled nor reformed, nor do give satisfaction unto them by whom they are admonished, then hath our Lord ordained a second degree of this private exercise of discipline; that the persons who being offended, have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the foregoing duty themselves according unto rule, shall take unto them others, two or three, as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may seem to require, to joyn with them in the same work and duty, to be performed in the same manner for the same ends, with that before described, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18, 15, 16, 17. And it is the duty of these persons so called in for assistance;</p>
               <p>First, To judge of the crime, fault, or offence reported to them; and not to proceed unless they find it to consist in something expresly contrary to the rule of the Gospel, and attested in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with such evidence, as their mutual love doth require in them, with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59624:101"/>
respect unto their Brethren. And they are to judge of the testimony that is given concerning the truth of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence communicated unto them, that they may not seem either lightly to take up a report against their Brother, or to discredit the testimony of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In case they find the offence pretended not to be a reall offence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contrary to the rule of the Gospel, or that it is not aright grounded, as to the evidence of it, but taken up upon prejudice, or an over-easie credulity, contrary to the law of that love which is required amongst Church-members, described 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and commanded as the great means of the edification of the Church and preservation of its union, then to convince the <hi>brother offended</hi> of his mistake, and with him to satisfie the person pretended to be the offender, that no breach or <hi>schism</hi> may happen among the members of the same body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Being satisfied of the crime and testimony, they are to associate themselves with the offended Brother in the same work and duty, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59624:102"/>
had before discharged towards the offender.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Because there is no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination how often these <hi>private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> are to be used in case of offence, it is evident from the nature of the thing it self, that they are to be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; first the one, and then the other, whilest there is any ground of hope, that the ends of them may be obtained through the blessing of Christ, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gained, and the offence taken away. Neither of these then is to be deserted, or laid aside, on the first, or second at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as though it were performed only to make way for somewhat farther; but it is to be waited on with prayer and patience, as an ordinance of Christ appointed for attaining the end aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, In case there be not the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess aimed at obtained in these several degrees of private admonition, it is then the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the matter be reported unto the Church, that the offender may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly admonished thereby, and brought to repentance; wherein is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59624:102"/>First, That the persons who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in vain to reclaim their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Brother by private admonition, are to acquaint the Elders of the Church with the case and crime: as also what they have done according to rule, for the rectifying of it; who upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, are obliged to communicate the knowledge of the whole matter to the Church. This is to be done by the Elders, as to whom the preservation of order in the Church, and the rule of its proceeding do belong, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The report made to the Church by the Elders is to be, (1.) Of the <hi>crime,</hi> guilt, or offence (2.) Of the <hi>Testimony</hi> given unto the truth of it (3.) Of the <hi>means</hi> used to bring the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to acknowledgement and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (4.) Of his <hi>deportment</hi> under the private previous admonitions either as to his rejecting of them, or as to any satisfaction tendred; all in order, love, meekness, and tenderness.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Things being proposed unto the Church, and the offender heard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole of the offence, and former
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59624:103"/>
proceeding, the whole Church, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Brethren, are with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to consider the nature of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with the condition and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the offenders, with such a spirit of meekness as our Lord Jesus Christ in his own person set them an example of, in his dealing with sinners, and which is required in them as his Disciples, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Elders and Brethren are to judge of the offence, and the carriage of the offender according to rule, and if the offence be evident, and persisted in, then</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The offender is to be <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly admonished</hi> by the Elders, with the consent and concurrence of the Church, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16, 17. And this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consists of Five parts;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) A declaration of the <hi>crime</hi> or offence, as it is evidenced unto the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A conviction of the <hi>evil</hi> of it, from the rule or rules transgressed against.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) A declaration of the <hi>authority</hi> and duty of the Church in such cases.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59624:103"/>(4.) A rebuke of the offender in the name of Christ, answering the nature and circumstances of the offence.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) An Exhortation unto <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and repentance and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, In case the offender despise this admonition of the Church, and come not upon it unto repentance, it is the will and appointment of our Lord Jesus Christ that he be <hi>cut off</hi> from all the priviledges of the Church, and cast out from the society thereof, or be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> wherein consists the <hi>last act</hi> of the discipline of the Church for the correction of offenders; and herein may be considered,</p>
               <p>First, The nature of it, that it is an <hi>authoritative act</hi> and so principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the Elders of the Church, who therein exert the power that they have received from the Lord Christ, by and with the consent of the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his appointment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. And both these the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Eldership and the consent of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59624:104"/>
the Brethren, are necessary to the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the sentence, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the appointment of Christ, and the practice of the first Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>effect</hi> of it, which is the cutting off, or casting out of the person offending from the communion of the Church, in the priviledges of the Gospel, as consequently from that of all the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches of Christ in the earth by virtue of their communion one with another, whereby he is left unto the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible kingdom of Satan in the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 5, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>ends</hi> of it which are,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>gaining</hi> of the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by bringing him to repentance, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and acknowledgement of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>warning</hi> of others not to do so presumptuously.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>preserving</hi> of the Church in its purity and order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7. all to the glory of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>causes</hi> of it or the grounds and reasons on which the Church may proceed unto sentence
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59624:104"/>
against any offending persons. Now these are no other but such as they judge according to the Gospel, that the Lord Christ will proceed upon in his finall judgement at the last day. For the Church judgeth in the name and authority of Christ, and are to exclude none from its communion, but those whom they find by the rule, that he himself excludes from his Kingdom; and so that which they bind on earth, is bound by him in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. And their sentence herein is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as the declaration of the sentence which the Head of the Church, and Judge of all, will pronounce at the last day; only with this difference, that it is also made known, that this sentence of theirs, is not final or decretory, but in order to the prevention of that which will be so, unless the evil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of. Now although the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evils, sins, or offences, that may render a person obnoxious unto this censure and sentence, are not to be enumerated, by reason of the variety of circumstances which change the nature of actions, yet they may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59624:105"/>
in general be referred unto these heads.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Moral evils,</hi> contrary to the light of nature, and express commands or prohibitions of the moral law, direct rules of the Gospel, or of evil report in the world amongst men walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule and light of reason. And in cases of this nature, the Church may proceed unto the sentence whereof we speak, without previous admonition, in case the matter of fact be <hi>notorious,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and unquestionably known to be true, and no general rule (which is not to be impeached by particular instances) lye against their proceedure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Offences against that <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love</hi> which is the bond of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church if pertinaciously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>false doctrines</hi> against the fundamentals in faith or worship, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if maintained with contention, to the trouble and disturbance of the peace of the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59624:105"/>Fourthly, Blasphemy, or evil speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wayes and worship of God in the Church, especially if joyned with an intention to hinder the prosperity of the Church, or to expose it to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Desertion, or total causeless relinquishment of the society and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church; for such are self-condemned, having broken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the covenant of God, that they made at their entrance into the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The time or season of the putting forth the authority of Christ in the Church for this censure, is to be considered; and that is ordinarily after the admonition before described, and that with due waiting, to be regulated by a consideration of times, persons, temptations, and other circumstances. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Church in proceeding to this sentence, is to express the patience and long suffering of Christ towards offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not to put it forth without conviction of a present resolved impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:59624:106"/>(2.) The event and effect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Ordinance of <hi>admonition</hi> is to be expected; which though not at present evident, yet like the word it self in the preaching of it, may be blessed to a good issue after many dayes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The person offending, thus cut off, or cast out from the present actual communion of the Church, is still to be looked on and accounted as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because of the nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which is intended for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and recovery, 2 Thes. 3.15. <hi>Count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a Brother</hi>; unless he manifest his finall impenitency, by blasphemy and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 Tim. 1.20. <hi>Whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Church is therefore still to perform the duties of love, and care, towards such persons.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In <hi>praying</hi> for them, that they may be converted from the errour of their way, James 5.19, 20. 1 John 5.16. <hi>If any man see his Brother sin a sin, which is not unto death, he shall ask and he shall give him life; for them that sin not unto death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59624:106"/>(2.) In <hi>withdrawing</hi> from them even as to ordinary converse for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their state and condition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.14. <hi>With such a one no not to eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In <hi>admonishing</hi> of him, 2 Cor. 3.15. <hi>admonish him as a Brother,</hi> which may be done (1) <hi>Occasionally,</hi> by any Member of the Church (2) On <hi>set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> by the consent and appointment of the whole Church; which admonition is to contain,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) A <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssing of his sin</hi> from the rule on the Conscience of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A <hi>declaration</hi> of the nature of the censure, and punishment which he lyeth under.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) A manifestation of the danger of his impenitency, in his being either har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the deceitfulness of sin, or exposed unto new temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, In case the Lord Jesus be pleased to give a blessed effect unto this ordinance, in the repentance of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cut of, and cast out off the Church; he is,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:59624:107"/>First, To be <hi>forgiven</hi> both by those who in an especial manner were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him, and by him, and by the whole Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To be <hi>comforted</hi> under his sorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. And that by (1) The <hi>application</hi> of the promises of the Gospel unto his Conscience, (2) A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the readiness of the Church to receive him again into their love and communion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Restored</hi> (1) By a <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> or testification of the love of the Church unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. (2) A <hi>readmission</hi> unto the exercise and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his former priviledges in the fellowship of the Church; all with a spirit of meekness, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.</p>

               <p>The means appointed by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ for the continuance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Church, are either <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory</hi> unto it, or instrumentally effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of it.

And this is done either <hi>ordinarily</hi> in the Assemblies of the Church, towards such as come in unto them and attend to the Word dispensed according to the appointment of Christ amongst them, 1 Cor. 14.24, 25. <hi>If there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he he is judged of all, and thus are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his heart made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship

God; or</hi> occasionally amongst the <hi>Men</hi> of the World, Acts 8.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>instrumentally efficient</hi> cause is that which is expressed in the answer, namely the <hi>adding</hi> in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto it, such as being effectually called unto the obedience of the faith and profession of the Gospel, do <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi> out of conviction of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and resolution to walke in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the ordinances and commands of Christ, offer themselves to the society and fellowship thereof, whereby they may be laid in this spiritual building as the stones were in the Temple of old, which were hewed and fitted elsewhere.</p>

            <div type="explication">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>What in general is required unto the fitting of any persons to be members of a visible Church of Christ, was before declared, and that is, that, which the Lord Jesus hath made the indispensible condition of entring into his Kingdom, namely of being born again. <hi>John</hi> 3.33.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59624:109"/>
This worke being secret, hidden, and invisible, the Church cannot judge of directly and in its own form or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the means, effects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of it, which are to be testified unto it concerning them who are to be admitted unto its fellowship and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; it is required therefore of them,</p>
               <p>First, that they be of a conversation free from blame in the world; for whereas one end of the gathering of Churches is to hold forth, and express the holiness of the doctrine of Christ, and the power of his grace in turning Men from all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness unto sobriety, righteousness and honesty, it is required of them that are admitted into them, that they answer this end. And this the principle of grace which is communicated unto them that believe, will effect and produce. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth not follow that every one who hath attained an unblameable honesty in this World, is inwardly quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with a true principle of saving grace, yet it doth, that they who are indowed with that principle, will be so unblameable. And although they may on other accounts be evil spoken of,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59624:110"/>
yet their good conversation in Christ will justify it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, competent knowledge in the mysteries of the Gospel, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means whereby the great qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation inquired after is testified unto the Church. For as without this no <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the Gospel can be profitably made use of, nor any <hi>duty</hi> of it be rightly performed, so <hi>saving light</hi> is of the essence of conversion and doth inseparably accompany it, 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> Where this is wanting, it is impossible for any person to evidence that he is delivered from that blindness, darkness, and ignorance, which all men are under the power of in the state of nature. Such a measure then of light and knowledge, as whereby men are enabled to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend aright of the person and offices of Christ, of the nature of his mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the benefits thereof, and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he requires at the hands of his Disciples, is expected in them who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59624:110"/>
desire to be admitted into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereunto is to be added, <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the faith. For the <hi>unity of faith</hi> is the foundation of Love and all the duties thereof, which in an especiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are to be performed towards the Church, called therefore the <hi>house-hold of faith.</hi> There is among the members of the Church <hi>one faith</hi>; Ephes. 4.5. The common faith, the faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto the saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. Which is the <hi>sound doctrine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Which those that will not endure, must be turned from; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word</hi> that is to be held fast. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. And which we are to be <hi>sound</hi> in; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. Contained in a <hi>form of sound words,</hi> as to the profession of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. And this <hi>soundness</hi> in the unity of the faith, as it should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unto <hi>oneness of mind,</hi> and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of accord, in all the things of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. Though it may admit of some different apprehensions in some things, wherein some may have more clear and distinct discoveries of the mind and will of God than others, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59624:111"/>
not, but that all may walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the same rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. So it is principally to be regarded in the <hi>fundamentall truths</hi> of the Gospel, in and by the faith whereof the Church holdeth on the head Jesus Christ; <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.19. And in the <hi>fundamentall principles of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel worship,</hi> the joynt celebration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the next end of the gathering the Church, for without a consent of mind and accord herein, no duty can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto edification, nor the peace of the Church be preserved; and these principles are those which we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is required that these things be <hi>testified</hi> by them unto the Church, with the acknowledgement of the worke of Gods grace towards them, and their resolution through the power of the same grace to cleave unto the Lord Christ with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart, and to live in all holy obedience unto him. They come to the Church, as Disciples of Christ professing that they have learnt the truth as it is in <hi>Jesus,</hi> which what it infers the Apostle teacheth at large;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59624:111"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. See also <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.21, 22, 23. And this by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be testified unto the Church.</p>
               <p>First, that they may be received in love without dissimulation, as real par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in the same faith, hope and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with themselves, as living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>mystical</hi> body of Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That on all ensuing occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they may be minded of their own profession and engagements, to stir them up thereby unto faithfulness, stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and perseverance. Hereupon are the Elders of the Church to judge by the rule of truth in Love and meekness concerning their condition, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be laid as living stones in the house of God; so as that they may,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Reject false <hi>hypocritical</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders if in or by any means their <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie</hi> be discovered unto them. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.20, 23. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That they may direct, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage in the way, such as appear to be sincere, instructing them principally in the nature of the way whereinto they are engaging, the duties, dangers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:59624:112"/>(3.) To propose them, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their desires, their resolutions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church after their own expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, to be considered of in love and meekness, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26, 27. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that are approved, do give up themselves unto the Lord, to walk in the observation of all his commands and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to the Church for the Lords sake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. abiding in the fellowship thereof, whereunto they are admitted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42.</p>

         <div n="51" type="question">
            <p>Quest. 51. <hi>Wherein doth the especial form of a particular Church whereby it becomes such, and is distinguished as such from all others, consist?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>In the special consent and agréement of all the members of it, to walk together in the observation of the same Ordinances</hi> numerically; <hi>hence its constitution and distinction from other Churches doth procéed.</hi> Exod. 19.5, 8. Chap. 24.3, 7. Deut. 26.17. 2 Cor. 8.5. Acts 14.23. Acts 20.28. Heb. 13.17.</p>

               <p>It hath been before declared, what especial agreement or <hi>covenant</hi> there ought to be among all the members of the same Church, to walk together in a due subjection unto, and observance of all the institutions of the Lord Christ. And this is that which gives it its special <hi>form</hi> and distinction from all other Churches. In the general nature of a Church, all Churches do agree, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually partake. There is the same <hi>law</hi> of the constitution of them all; they have all the same <hi>rule</hi> of obedience; all the same <hi>Head,</hi> the same end; all carry it on by the observation of the same Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in <hi>kind.</hi> Now besides these things which belong unto the nature of a Church in general, and wherein they all equally participate, they must also have each one its proper <hi>difference,</hi> that which doth distinguish it from all other Churches; and this gives it its speciall form as such. Now this cannot consist in any thing that is accidental, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or extrinsical unto it, such as is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59624:113"/>
                  <hi>cohabitation,</hi> (which yet the Church may have respect unto, for conveniency, and farthering of its edification) nor in any civil or <hi>political</hi> disposal of its members into civil societies for civil ends, which is <hi>extrinsecal</hi> to all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments as a Church; nor doth it consist in the relation of the Church to its present Officers, which may be removed or taken away without the dissolution of the <hi>form</hi> or being of the Church, but it consisteth as was said in the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or covenant before mentioned; For</p>

               <p>Secondly, this gives them their <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relation</hi> unto their own Elders, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or Guides who watch over them as so associated by their own consent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the command of Christ. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From hence they have their mutual especial relation unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Churches being gathered and setled according to the mind of Christ, ought to preserve a mutual holy communion among themselves, and to exercise it, in the discharge of those duties whereby their mutuall good and edification may be promoted. For whereas they are all united under <hi>one Head</hi> the Lord Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22, 23. in the <hi>same faith</hi> and order, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.5. And do walk by the <hi>same rule,</hi> they stand in such a relation one to another, as is the ground of the communion spoken of. Now the principal wayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they exercise this communion, are the acts and <hi>duties</hi> enumerated in the answer unto this Question; as,</p>
               <p>First, Carefull walking so as to give no offence unto one another; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a <hi>moral duty</hi> in reference unto all, yet therein especial regard is to be had unto other Churches of Christ, that they be not in any thing grieved or tempted, 1 Cor. 10.32. <hi>Give none
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59624:114"/>
offence; neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In constant <hi>prayer</hi> for the peace, welfare, edification and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one of another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.18. And this because of the special concernment of the name and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, in their welfare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In communicating of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes for their relief according unto their ability, in case of the outward wants, straits, dangers, or necessities of any of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The receiving of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other Churches to communion, in the celebration of Church Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is another way whereby this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches is exercised, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1, 2.3 Ep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. For whereas the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal right of such persons unto the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Church, and their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly walking in the observation of the commands of Christ, are known by the testimony of the Church whereof they are members, they may without farther
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59624:115"/>
enquiry or satisfaction given, be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>pro tempore</hi> as members of the Church wherein they desire fellowship, and participation of the Ordinances of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In desiring or making use of the counsel and advice of one another, in such cases of doubt and difficulty, whether <hi>doctrinal,</hi> or <hi>practical,</hi> as may arise in any of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2, 6. And from hence it follows, that in case any Church either by errour in doctrine, or precipitation, or mistake in other admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, do give offence unto other Churches, those other Churches may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account from them, admonish them of their faults, and withhold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from them, in case they persist in the errour of their way; and that because <hi>in</hi> their difficulties, and <hi>before</hi> their miscarriages, they were bound to have desired the advice, counsel and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of those other Churches, which being neglected by them, the other are to recover the end of it unto their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ability, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6.11. And hence also it follows, that those that are <hi>rightly</hi> and <hi>justly</hi> censured in any
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59624:115"/>
Church, ought to be rejected by all Churches whatever; both because of their mutuall communion, and because it is, and ought to be presumed, untill the contrary be made to appear, that in case there had been any difficulty, or doubt in the proceedure of the Church, they would have taken the advice of those Churches, with whom they were obliged to consult.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whereas the Churches have all of them one <hi>common faith,</hi> and are all obliged to <hi>hold forth</hi> and declare it to all men as they have opportunity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. to testifie this their mutual communion, their interest in the same faith and hope, for the more open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and proposition of the truths of the Gospel which they profess, and for the vindication both of the truth, and themselves, from false charges and imputations, they may, and if God give opportunity, <hi>ought</hi> to joyn together in declaring and testifying their joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and fellowship in the same doctrine of faith, expressed in a <hi>form of sound words.</hi>
