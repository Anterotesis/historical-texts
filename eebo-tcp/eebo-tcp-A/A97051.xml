         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

think it ſtrange that a perſon
ſo wholly a ſtranger as I,
ſhould tender you ſuch a peece
as this: Yet will, I doubt not,
acquit me of rudeneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility
in ſo doing; when you
conſider, That the adverſe party, whom it
takes to taske, hath made his appeale hither;
and finding himſelfe foiled in Latine, hath
<pb facs="tcp:116063:3"/>
here put in his Engliſh Bill for ſome reliefe:
And it is but reaſon that Bill and Anſwer be
filed in the ſame Court. He had the confidence,
to tender his book firſt to another honorable
Perſon the <hi>Earle of Devonſhire,</hi> with this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That though things <hi>were not ſo fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
as to ſatisfie every Reader,</hi> yet 'twas good
enough to <hi>ſatisfie his Lordſhip, he did not doubt.</hi> Which
preſumption of his was then the more tolerable,
becauſe he then thought his demonſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good. But when he had been ſo fully convinced
what weake ſtuffe it was; that now the utmoſt
of his hopes is (for ſo I underſtand from his
friends) <hi>that though he be miſtaken in the Mathematicks,
yet he hopes to prove himſelfe an honeſt man,</hi> (which
yet is more I ſuppoſe than, by his principles, he
need to be:) To make the world believe, that
<hi>your Lordſhip doth approve of his Principles, Method, and
Manners in thoſe writing;</hi> and, that <hi>this is the only
cauſe of the favours you have expreſſed towards him;</hi> is
ſo high an affront, as had he not a great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of your Lorſhips Magnanimity, to deſpiſe
it, or Clemency, to pardon it, he would not
have offered to a perſon of ſo much honour and
worth.</p>
            <p>Since therefore he hath <hi>brought it before you as a
controverſy,</hi> wherein he <hi>deſires your Lordſhip to conſider</hi>
and judge, whether he have ſaid his <hi>ſix Leſſons</hi>
aright: I ſhall not at all demurre to the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the court; but as readily admit his
Umpar, as allow him the choiſe of his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
<pb facs="tcp:116063:3"/>
and ſo tender your Lordſhip an Engliſh
Anſwer to his Engliſh Appeale from my Latine
Confutation of his treatiſe in Latine: That
when in the judgement of this own Umpar, he
ſees himſelfe foiled at his own weapons; he may
hereafter make choiſe of French or Dutch, or
ſome other Language, which he may hope to be
more favourable to him, than Latine or Engliſh
hath yet been.</p>
            <p>He tells your Lordſhip, what great feates he
hath done in his book; and your Lordſhip knows
as well, by this and my former anſwer, how
they have been defeated.</p>
            <p>And then he reckons up certaine poſitions (ſome
of them abſurd enough) and would have you
believe them to be <hi>our Principles at Oxford:</hi> But
doth not tell your Lordſhip where they are to be
found in any writings of ours.</p>
            <p>Now, (that your Lordſhip may not ſeek them
there in vaine, where they are not to be found,)
I ſhall briefely ſhew where the riſe of all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
lye; in his own writings, not in ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, He had taught us Cap.</hi> 13. §. 16. Si ratio

aequales non multiplicari proprie, ſed ſubmultiplicari dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:

                  <am>

                  </am>
                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> quando additur primae rationi altera, ratio
primae quantitatis ad tertiam, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emiſſis eſt rationis primae
ad ſecundam. <hi>That is, in plaine Engliſh,</hi> If there be
any proportion aſſigned of a leſſe quantity to a greater, and
to that proportion be added another proportion equall
to it; that proportion that doth reſult by this addition,
<pb facs="tcp:116063:4"/>
is not the double, but the halfe of that aſſigned proportion.
<hi>Now, becauſe this is very abſurd, and I had told
him ſo; He would have your Lordſhip believe, that
it was I had ſaid (not he,) that</hi> Two equall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are not double to one of the ſame proportions. <hi>Which
is his firſt Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly; He had ſayd farther, in the ſame
place, Cap.</hi> 13. §. 16. Ratio 2 ad 1 vocatur dupla,
&amp; 3 ad 1 tripla, &amp;c. <hi>(and he ſaith true.) But then
(forgetting that theſe were his own words) he
would have it thought</hi> (Leſſ. 5. <hi>p.</hi> 42.) <hi>abſurd to
ſay that the</hi> proportion of two to one is double; <hi>and asks,</hi>
is not every double proportion, the double of ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<hi>And doth here intepret that phraſe (of his
own)</hi> the proportion of two to one is called double, <hi>to
be all one as to ſay, That a</hi> proportion is double,
triple &amp;c. of a number, but not of a proportion. <hi>Which is
his ſecond charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly he had <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. §. 13, 14. (without any
neceſſity) layd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he whole ſtreſſe of Geometry,
upon this ſuppoſition. That, <hi>It is not poſſible for the
ſame body to poſſeſſe at one time a greater, at another time
a leſſer place.</hi> (For, if this be poſſible, the ſame
body is, by his definition, at the ſame time equall
to a bigger, and to a leſſe body than it ſelfe: as
I there ſhewed by a conſequence ſo cleare that
he cannot himſelfe deny it.) Which he there firſt,
attempts to prove, (as ſimply as a man would
wiſh,) but then preſently flyes off againe, and
ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that a <hi>thing in it ſelfe ſo manifeſt needs no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>
But ſayd I, (without declaring my own
<pb facs="tcp:116063:4"/>
opinion in the caſe, which what it is he knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not) An aſſertion of ſuch huge conſequence to
his doctrine as this is, and being (as he well
knows) generally denyed (whatever he or I
think of it) by all thoſe who maintaine Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
&amp; Rarification in a proper ſenſe, (without
either <hi>vacuum,</hi> or the admiſſion and extruſion of a
forraigne body;) ought to be well proved, by
him that builds ſo much upon it, and not be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>gratis.</hi> Now becauſe of this it is, that he tells
you in his third charge, That 'tis one of our
principles, That the <hi>ſame body without adding to it,
or taking from it, is ſometimes greater and ſometimes leſſe.</hi>
So hainous a matter is it, to require a proofe from
him, of what he doth affirme though of never ſo
great conſequence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He tells us Cap. 14. §. 19. (and 'tis
true enough) that an <hi>Hyperbolick line, and its Aſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tote,
doe ſtill come nearer and nearer till they approach to a
diſtance leſſe then any aſſignable quantity:</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
if infinitely produced, muſt be ſuppoſed
to meet, or to have no diſtance at all; (and ſo
the diſtance of that hyperbola ſo produced, from
a line parallel to the Aſymptote, to be the ſame
with the diſtance of that Aſymptote from the
ſaid parallell; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>equall to a given quantity.)</hi>
And that this is a good inference, we are
taught <hi>Leſſ.</hi> 5. §. 43. as ſtanding on the ſame
ground with <hi>the demonſtrations of all ſuch Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians,
Ancient and Moderne, as have inferred any
thing in the manner following,</hi> [viz. <hi>If it be not greater
<pb facs="tcp:116063:5"/>
nor leſſe, then it is equall. But it is neither greater nor leſſe.
Therefore &amp;c. If it be greater, ſay by how much. By ſo
much. 'Tis not greater by ſo much: Therefore it is not
greater. If it be leſſe, ſay by now much &amp;c.] which, being
good demonſtrations are together with this overthrown,</hi> if
this inference be not good; that is, if things which
differ leſſe than any aſſignable quantity may not
be reputed equall, But now, to ſay thus, That
the diſtance of an Hyperbole, from a ſtreight line
drawn beyond its aſymptote and the parallell
thereunto, doth continually decreaſe, ſo as, if it
be ſuppoſed infinitely produced, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be at length the ſame with that of the
Aſymptote from the ſayd parallell, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater nor leſſe by any aſſignable quantity;
(which is but the reſult of his own aſſertion) is all
one as to ſay, <hi>That a quantity may grow leſſe and leſſe
eternally, ſo as at last to be equall to another quantity; or
which is all one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that there is a laſt in Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which is his fourth charge: and, what abſurdity
is in it, falls upon himſelfe. Juſt as, when having
told us Cap. 16. §. 20. <hi>Punctum inter quantitates
nihil eſt, ut inter numeros Cyphra:</hi> And Cap. 14. §. 16.
<hi>Punctum ad lineam neque rationem habet, neque quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
ullam:</hi> He railes upon me, twenty times over,
as if I had ſomewhere ſaid <hi>A point is nothing;</hi> only
becauſe I ſay with Euclide, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Fiftly 'tis his uſuall language, in deſigning an
angle, to ſay, it is contained or comprehended by
or between the two ſides: As for example <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.
<pb facs="tcp:116063:5"/>
§. 9. (three times in two lines) <hi>idem angulus eſt qui

And §. 16. <hi>angulus qui continetur inter AB &amp; eandem

But now, forgeting that it was himſelfe that ſayd
ſo, he delivers it as a principle of ours, That <hi>the
nature of an angle conſiſts in that which lies between the
lines which comprehend it; that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>An angle is
a ſuperficies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly; when he had ſaid (abſurdly enough,)
<hi>Cap.</hi> 11. § 5. <hi>Conſiſtit ratio antecedentis ad conſequens,

eo ſuperatur; ſive in majoris (dempto minore) Reſiduo,

EF, IG, conſiſtit in differentia GF,</hi> (and
the like elſewhere.) which is all one as to ſay,
that the nature of proportion conſiſts in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
a line, an abſolute quantity  (which how
abſurd it was I had let him know;) He hath then
the impudence to ſay (as though it had been I,
not hee, had ſo ſpoken) that, <hi>I make Proportion to be
a Quotient, a number, an Abſolute quantity, &amp;c.</hi> or, as
he here ſpeaks in his ſixth charge, that <hi>the Quotient
is the proportion of the Diviſion to the Dividend,</hi> (as
pure non-ſenſe as a body need to read;) Only
becauſe I affirm <hi>Rationis (Geometricae) aeſtimatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
eſſe,</hi> not <hi>penes reſiduum,</hi> but <hi>penes quotum:</hi> that
<hi>Geometricall proportion is to be eſtimated, not according to
<pb facs="tcp:116063:6"/>
the Remainder, but according to the Quotient</hi> (which
himſelfe now knows, though he did not then, to
be true enough; for he hath now learned to ſay
ſo too, <hi>Leſſ.</hi> 2. p. 16. <hi>As the Quotient gives us a
meaſure of the Proportion of the Dividend to the Diviſor
in Geometricall Proportion; ſo alſo the Remainder after
Subſtraction is the meaſure of Proportion Arithmeticall.)</hi>
And by theſe means he goes about to <hi>prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
an honest man:</hi> Juſt like the honeſt man, who
when he had cut a purſe, put it ſlyly into another
mans pocket (after he had taken out the mony)
that ſo this other might be hanged for it. And I
hope, by that time Your Lordſhip hath peruſed
the peece which I now tender, you will be able
to judge, whether <hi>M. Hobs</hi> be not as well a
<hi>good Mathematician,</hi> as an <hi>Honeſt Man;</hi> much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip hath now the caſe fair before
you; if you ſhall think it worth the while to take
cognizance of it. I ſhall leave it here, and permit
it to your Lordſhips judgement, whether to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe

               </gap> your Leſſon right.</p>
            <p>But, before we go further, I ſhould ask you; what moved
you to ſay your Leſſons in Engliſh, when as the Books, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which you doe chiefely intend them, were written in
Latine? But I foreſee a faire anſwer that you might poſſibly
make; (and therefore doe nor much wonder at it.) There
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116063:8"/>
be many grave and weighty reaſons that might move you
thereunto.</p>
            <p>As firſt, becauſe you doe preſume, that there may be found
divers perſons, who may underſtand <hi>rayling in Engliſh,</hi> that
yet doe not underſtand <hi>Mathematicks in Latin:</hi> and thoſe
being the perſons on whom you have greateſt hope of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, you ought to have a ſpeciall regard to them, and
apply your ſelfe to their capacities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe in caſe you ſhould have attempted an
Anſwer in Latin; you had loſt your labour as to the whole
deſign: For then thoſe who ſhould read your anſwer,
would be able alſo to read that againſt which you write:
and, comparing both together, would preſently ſee to how
little purpoſe all is that you have ſaid. Whereas now your
Engliſh Readers muſt be faine to take upon truſt what you
pleaſe to tell them. (Whereby you gain clearly, as to them,
the opportunity of miſrepreſenting at pleaſure what you ſee
good.) And for this Reaſon, if you ſhall think fit to make
any reply to this; I would adviſe you to doe it in Latin;
that ſo Forrainers, who underſtand not Engliſh, may take
upon truſt what you ſhall pleaſe to tell them.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, and principally (which is the reaſon of
greateſt weight) becauſe that when ever you have thought
it convenient to repaire to Billingſgate, to leane the art of
Well-ſpeaking, for the perfecting of your naturall Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;
you have not found that any of the Oiſter-women
could teach you to raile in Latin, and therefore it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to apply your ſelfe to ſuch lauguage as they could
teach you.</p>
            <p>But prithee tell me, in good earneſt, (for I cannot
think you ſo ſimple as you would ſeem to be,) Whether
you doe indeed believe (though you thought good to ſet
a good face upon it, and talk big,) that all that you have
ſaid is worth a ſtraw, either as to the <hi>defending of your Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
or the impairing of ours?</p>
            <p>As to the Rhetorick and good language of it, (with
which I ſhall firſt begin) that you can upon all occaſions,
or without occaſion, give the titles of <hi>Foole, Beaſt, Aſſe,

to be admirable in their kind; yet are they no better

(it ſeems it was but a ſhitten piece we had to deale with.)
That, what you like not, <hi>is worthy to be gilded, but you doe

That, <hi>your faults are not attended with ſhame,</hi> (It's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,

by D. Wallis,</hi> (And, if ſo, then doubtleſſe D. Wallis

He diſcerns preſently by your judgement of Algebra, what

he thinks your book may well be thrown aſide, or at leaſt

            <p>Beſide theſe, I ſhall, for the ſatisfaction of your Engliſh
Readers (who perhaps may not ſo well underſtand the
words of the Authors above mentioned,) adde an extract
of one Letter more; from a noble Gentleman, whom as
yet (to my knowledge) I never ſaw, nor had formerly any
the leſt intercourſe with him by letter or otherwiſe,
though I had before heard of his worth and skill, both in
Mathematicks and other learning: And which is more, he
is neither of the Clergy; nor any great Admirer of them,
beyond other perſons of equall worth and Learning. He
was pleaſed, though wholly a ſtranger to mee, upon view
of my <hi>Elenchus,</hi> to intimate to me by a Letter directed to a
third perſon, That D. <hi>Wallis had unhappily gueſſed, that thoſe
propoſitions which M. Hobs had concerning the meaſure of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laſters,
were not his own, but borrowed from ſome body elſe
without acknowledging his Author:</hi> and ſignified withall, that
<hi>they were to be found demonſtrated in an exercitation of</hi> Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius,
<hi>De uſu Indiviſibilium in Poteſtatibus Coſſicis;</hi> (a piece
which I then had never read:) And that M. <hi>Hobs, endeavouring
to demonſtrate them anew, had miſſed in it.</hi> For which civility
from a perſon of <hi>Quality,</hi> to mee a meer ſtranger, I could
doe no leſſe then returne him a civill anſwer of thanks for
that favour. In reply to which (having in the mean time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116063:11"/>
ſeen and peruſed my <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum)</hi> he was pleaſed
to honour me farther with this.</p>
            <p>I had not ſo long deferred &amp;c. but that &amp;c. And I beſeech
you receive it now from a Perſon, who much honours your emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Learning and Humanity, and would egerly imbrace an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to give you moſt ample teſtimony of the eſteem he hath for you.
I had not, (before &amp;c.) ſeen your <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum,</hi>
which alone, although your other labours were not taken in to
make up the value, may equall you with the beſt deſervers in the
Mathematicks. I was before acquainted with many excellent
Propoſitions therein by you demonſtrated (as you partly know,)
but admired them, there, as wholly new, not becauſe you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
them only another way, but by a generall method, ſo
little touched at by others, ſo in effect wholly new, and of ſo rare
conſequence for entring into the ſecrets and Soul of Geometry (if
my judgement may paſſe for any thing) as truly I believe the
Art may reckon it among the moſt confiderable advances given it.
Sir, I wiſh all proſperity to your deſervings, and humbly thank you
for the fair admittance you have given me to your acquaintance and
friendſhip, which I ſhall preſerve with a tenderneſſe due to a thing
ſo eſtimable; and believe, Sir, you have Power at your own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in <hi>Yours &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Engliſh, and therefore needs no expoſition; your
Engliſh Reader, whether Mathematician or not, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it without help. You ſee all are not of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning my <hi>ſcurvy book</hi> of <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble your patience with reciting more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
in this kind; (though, the truth is, very many
perſons of Honour and Worth, and eminent for their skill
in theſe ſtudies, have been forward of their own accord to
put more honour upon me in this kind, then were fit in
modeſty for me to own.) Theſe you have heard already,
are more, I preſume, then you take any great content in;
and the leſt of them, were abundantly ſufficient to outway
your <hi>verily believe;</hi> upon the ſtrength of which, you have the
confidence to utter all thoſe reproaches which in your ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
piece you endeavour to caſt upon us; but find them
to fall back, and foul your ſelf. And you ſee withall, both
how little reaſon we have to fear <hi>the opinion that men will
have beyond Sea, of the Geometry taught at Oxford;</hi> and with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116063:11"/>
how much vanity it is that you tel us according to your Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
that <hi>when you think, how dejected we will be for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and how the grief of ſo much time irrecoverably loſt, and
the conſideration of how much our friends will be aſhamed of us,
will accompany us for the reſt of our life, you have more compaſſion
for us then we have deſerved.</hi> No doubt Sir, but you are a
very <hi>pittifull</hi> man! (who have ſo much compaſſion for us:)
And we are much bound to behold you. But ſince your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of us, is not only more then you think we deſerve,
but, likewiſe, more then we think we ſtand in need of; we
are loath your good nature ſhould be injurious to your
ſelfe. And therefore, knowing how much your ſelfe at
preſent nay need compaſſion, we deſire you to ſuffer that
charity to begin at home, and not to be too laviſh of that
commodity upon us, of which at preſent we have ſo little
need and you ſo much. But, that there may be no love loſt
between us; know, that we have the like compaſſion for
you, upon the ſame account. You have but prevented us;
and taught us, by your extreme civility, what might have
better beſeemed us to ſay. You tell us ſomewhere, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the Ladies at Billingſgate, amongſt all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
have none readier then that of <hi>Whore,</hi> becauſe,
forſooth, <hi>when they remember themſelves, they think that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
to be true of others.</hi> And truly, we have reaſon to believe,
that the anguiſh of ſuch conſiderations as thoſe you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being ſo frequently preſent to your own thoughts,
makes you ſo apt to think that others may be tormented in
the like manner. (For who are more compaſſionate to
thoſe that feele the toothach, then thoſe that are moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with it themſelves?) For, as your words are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<hi>A man of a tender forehead, after ſo much inſolence, and
ſo much contumelious language</hi> as yours, <hi>grounded upon arrogance
and ignorance, would hardly endure to outlive it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for our ſelves; I do not find, that our friends do yet
diſowne us; or, that we need to feare, in this conteſt, the
fury of our foes. And, whatever diſeaſes you may believe
my <hi>Conick, Sections,</hi> and <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum,</hi> to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with: I do not ſee, that wiſer Phyſitians can yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
either the one to be troubled with the <hi>Scab,</hi> or the
other with the <hi>Scurvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you tell us, (and that may ſerve for anſwer to the
Teſtimonies but now recited) <hi>Though the Beaſts, that think
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116063:12"/>
our railing to he roaring, have for a time admired us; yet, now
that you have ſhewed them your eares, they will be leſſe affrighted.</hi>
Sir, thoſe Perſons (as they needed not the ſight of <hi>your
eares,</hi> but could tell by the <hi>voice</hi> what kind of creature
<hi>brayed</hi> in your books: ſo they) doe not deſerve ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
at your hands: And, you would not have ſaid it to
their faces. I know your Apology will be, that <hi>you ſay it
provoked;</hi> and that <hi>by</hi> Veſpaſians <hi>law, when a man is provoked,
it is not uncivill to give ill language.</hi> And that we may know
you have been <hi>provoked,</hi> you tell us, <hi>how hainous and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
a thing it is, to ſpeake againſt ſome ſorts of men, whether
that which is ſaid in diſgrace be true or falſe;</hi> And <hi>by all men
of underſtanding it is taken</hi> (not only for a <hi>provocation,</hi> but
<hi>for a defiance, and a challenge to open Warre.</hi> And truly, ſo far
as that may paſſe for Law, I cannot deny but that you have
been <hi>provoked;</hi> for ſure it is, that much hath been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, and that, as is ſuppoſed, to your <hi>diſgrace,</hi> and, I
believe, the provocation hath been the greater, becauſe
<hi>that which hath been ſaid, is true.</hi> But is this ſuch a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as may warrant you, by Veſpaſians Law, to rave at the
next man you meet with? and to revenge your ſelfe upon
him that comes next? Is it ſuch a provocation of M. <hi>Hobs,</hi>
for any man to admire us, that he may thenceforth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
incivility, be called a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or what you pleaſe? Is it
not enough for you to involve the two Profeſſors in the
ſame crime, <hi>and conſider us every where as one Author,</hi> and
therefore both reſponſible, joyntly and ſeverally, for what
is ſaid by either, <hi>becauſe</hi> forſooth, <hi>we approve,</hi> you ſay, <hi>of one
anothers doctrine:</hi> but muſt all that doe but <hi>admire us</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame condemnation? It's poſſible that ſome of
them may admire our folly; (you ſee, one of them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at my diſcretion, that I would foule my fingers with
you, or think you worth the Anſwering:) muſt they be
called <hi>Beaſts</hi> alſo? It ſeems 'tis a dangerous buſineſſe for a
man to admire any who do not admire you.</p>
            <p>But I have done with the Rhetorick and good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
We have had a taſt of it; and that's enough unleſſe
'twere better. They that deſire to have more of it, may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
read over your book, or goe to Billingſgate, whether
they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But when men ſhall heare you rant it after this rate, and
talk high; ſurely they muſt needs think, that you have very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116063:12"/>
good ground for it, muſt they not? A ſhallow foundation
would never bear a confidence of ſuch a towring hight.
One would hardly believe mee, if I ſhould ſay, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
theſe <hi>Braggadocian</hi> words, <hi>there is not any one
aſſertion of mine, that you have either overthrown or ſhaken; nor
any one of your own (which I charge to be falſe,) that you have
defended;</hi> Yet that's the caſe. A great cry, and a little
wooll! (as the man ſaid when he ſhore his hoggs.)</p>
            <p>

            <p>I Shall therefore next after the Rhetorick, conſider the

when a man deales with you; for you are not ſo accurate
in your own, that you need find fault with anothers.</p>
            <p>There be ſix or ſeven places (and, I think no more)
where you would play the Critick.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you tell me pag. 11. that <hi>[Punctum eſt Corpus, quod

[a Point is a body, which is not conſidered to be a body] Engliſh.</hi>
If you had ſaid, it had not been good ſenſe, I would have
agreed with you. But why not that, <hi>Latin?</hi> or this, <hi>Engliſh?</hi>
(Nay ſtay there; you are not to give a reaſon for what you

Very good! Bur Sir, It's one thing, to conſider a

is not this a worthy objection? But however, to ſatisfy you,
look again and you may ſee a</hi> quidem <hi>which anſwers directly

            </p>
            <p>But before I leave this, (to ſave my ſelfe that labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,)
I muſt let your Engliſh Reader ſee, how notoriouſly
you doe here abuſe him, <hi>(him,</hi> I ſay; for the abuſing of me
in it, is a matter of nothing) My words were theſe; <hi>In the</hi>
4th <hi>Article</hi> (of your 17 Chap.) <hi>you attempt the deſcribing of
thoſe curve lines by points,</hi> (that is, the finding out as many
points as a man pleaſeth, by which the ſaid curve lines are
to paſſe, through which, with a ſteady hand, thoſe lines
may be drawn, not Mathematically, but by aim,) <hi>which is a
matter of no great difficulty, and may be performed without ſo
much adoe as you make, and ſo much going about the buſh. As
for example, &amp;c.</hi> (and ſo I go on to ſhew how thoſe points
may be eaſily found Mathematically, by the Geometry of
Plains, that is, by the Rule and Compaſſe, or by ſtreight
lines and circles, without the uſe of Conick Sections, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more compounded lines. And, having ſhewed that,
I proceed thus) <hi>But you, as though this work</hi> (the finding of
thoſe points) <hi>could not be done by the Geometry of Plains,</hi> (as
I had ſhewed it might,) <hi>require preſently the finding of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mean proportionals as you pleaſe</hi> (viz. more or fewer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the nature of thoſe lines ſhall be;) <hi>between two
lines aſſigned:</hi> (which by the Geometry of Plains cannot be
done:) <hi>And ſo, of a Plain Probleme, you make a Solid and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Probleme. Which how unbeſeeming it is for a Geometrician to
doe, you may learne from thoſe words which your ſelfe cite out of
Pappus, pag.</hi> 181. (in the Engliſh, pag. 233.) Videtur autem
non parvum peccatum eſſe apud Geometras, cum Problema
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116063:13"/>
Planum per Conica aut Linearia ab aliquo invenitur. <hi>It's
judged by Geometers no ſmall fault, for the finding out of a Plain
Problem,</hi> (as this is,) <hi>to have recourſe</hi> (as you here) <hi>to Solid
or Lineary Problems.</hi> Now theſe words, one would think,
were plain enough for a man of a moderate capacity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
And is it not <hi>well owl'd of you,</hi> to perſwade your
Engliſh Reader that I had here taught, that <hi>a man may find
as many mean-proportionalls, as one will, by the Geometry of
Plaines?</hi> (where I ſaid only that the work before ſpoken
of, might be done by the Geometry of Plaines, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needed not the finding of ſuch Mean-proportionals?)
And then (becauſe you doe not know whether or no, as
many mean proportionals as one will, may be found by the
Geometry of Plains,) you tell us, that <hi>you never ſaid it was
impoſſible;</hi> (truly if you had ſaid ſo, I ſhould not have bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
you for it;) <hi>but that the way to doe it was not yet found,</hi>
(you might have added, nor ever will be,) <hi>and therefore it
might prove a Solid Problem for any thing I know.</hi> Nay truly,
Sir, I know very well (though it ſeems you doe not,) that
it is at leſt a <hi>Solid</hi> Probleme, or rather <hi>Lineary;</hi> and that
the way to doe it, Mathematically, by the Geometry of
Plains, is neither yet found, nor ever will be. For thoſe
Problems which depend upon the reſolution of a Cubick
or Superior Aequation, not reducible to a Quadratick,
(which is the caſe in hand) can never be reſolved by the
Geometry of Plains. Which, if, inſtead of ſcorning, you
had endeavoured to underſtand, the Analyticks, you might
have known too. But this by the way; to ſave my ſelfe the
labour anon. I returne to your Criticks again.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas it is ſaid c. 16. art. 18. <hi>Longitudine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> percurſam

let the Reader judge; for it is not worth contending
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116063:14"/>
for. All that you ſay in defence, is that <hi>Impetus</hi> is the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
of the <hi>Manner.</hi> What then? the queſtion remains, as
it was before, whether this <hi>Modus</hi> do not here import a

here ſpoken <hi>(that ſuch ſpace be diſpatched)</hi> doth equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon two cauſes; the one, that <hi>the motion be uniforme;</hi>
the other, that <hi>the Impetus be ſo great.</hi> And therefore (ſince
you pleaſe to inſiſt upon it, which I did but give a touch at
by the way, as in many other places where you take it Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,)
<hi>cum</hi> not proper in either place; but either an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
without a Prepoſition; or, if you would needs have a
prepoſition, <hi>per, prae, pro, propter, ob,</hi> or ſome other which do
import a Cauſality; not <hi>cum,</hi> which imports only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you ſay, pag. 61. That <hi>you think, I did miſtake

and doe ſtill <hi>take</hi> (not <hi>miſtake) for an Angliciſme</hi> And you
cannot deny but that it is ſo. Where is the <hi>miſtake</hi> then?
You ſay tis a fault in the Impreſſion. Yes that it is; and
that twice for failing. But was it not a fault in the Copy
firſt? you ſay it ſhould have been, <hi>praetendit ſe ſcire.</hi> That,
I confeſſe, helps the matter a little. But why was it not ſo?

theſe words; but the former extenuated, and the latter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht.
Yet ſome nibling there is at both.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe, (which I make the fifth in order)
is pag. 51. where you tell me, that <hi>Adducis malleum, ut occidas
muſcam,</hi> is not good Latin? But why? <hi>when we ſpeak of bodies
Animate, Ducere</hi> and <hi>Adducere,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are good.</hi> Tis very
true. Did any body deny it? But are they not good alſo, of
Bodies inanimate? or other things? (I exſpected, that in
order to the confutation of my phraſe you ſhould have told
us, in what caſes they had not been good, and that this was
one of thoſe; not, in what other caſes they are good, as well
as this; for that hurts not mee.) May they not be applied as
well to a <hi>Hammer,</hi> as to a <hi>Tree?</hi> Though this be Animate;
not that? You were, <hi>I</hi> heare, of opinion, when you firſt
made braggs of this notion, (or elſe your friends belye you)
that they were not to be uſed but of bodies Animate: But,
that being notoriouſly falſe, ſome body it ſeems had rectified
that miſtake, and informed you better, and therefore you
dare not ſay ſo now.</p>
            <p>But why, now, is not <hi>adducis malleum</hi> good Latin? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
forſooth, <hi>Ducere</hi> and <hi>Adducere,</hi> when uſed of bodies
<hi>Animate,</hi> ſignify <hi>to guide or lead;</hi> (and ſometimes they doe
ſo.) Now though <hi>a ninny may lead a ninny,</hi> yet <hi>not a hammer.</hi>
Very witty? But <hi>I</hi> am of opinion, that he who leads M.
<hi>Hobs,</hi> leads both. Or however, if a man may not <hi>lead</hi> a
hammer; yet, <hi>I</hi> hope, he that <hi>hits the naile at head</hi> (which
M. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſeldome doth) may be ſaid to <hi>guide</hi> his hammer:
may he not? The phraſe therefore is good, even by your
own law. But heark you, man; <hi>to lead,</hi> you told us, is the
ſignification of the word, <hi>when it is uſed of Animates;</hi> why
then do you talke of <hi>leading a hammer?</hi> do you take the
hammer to be <hi>animate?</hi> or would have us take you to be
the <hi>ninny?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther; they ſingify you ſay to <hi>guide</hi> or <hi>lead.</hi> What
then? did <hi>I</hi> ſay they do not? Prithee tell me, what they
do not ſignify; not, what they doe; if you meane to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw

alſo. And you care not, all along, how much you beſpatter
your ſelf, (for, you think, you cannot look much fouler
then you doe already,) if you have but hopes to be a little
revenged on us. And truly you have that good hap all the

you blame in us, but the ſame is to be found in your ſelfe

(though it had been one,) <hi>have taken notice of in an Engliſh

Yes; I thought, that was the matter. You had a mind to be
revenged. And ha'nt you done it handſomely? Was there
nothing elſe to faſten upon with more advantage then theſe
poor harmleſſe phraſes? 'Tis very well. It ſeems my Latine
(though as careleſſely written as need to be; for 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

did not much lye open to exception; for if it had, I

            <p>But you are offended, it ſeemes, that I ſhould offer to

not how to help it now. I muſt needs confeſſe, I did ſome
times (when I ſtumbled upon them, but never went out of

correct ſome phraſes, as I went along, (ſometime to make
ſenſe, where the ſentence was lame; ſometimes to make it
Latine, where the phraſe was incongruous or barbarous;)

            <p>There is yet a Seventh paſſage, p. 14. which may be referred
alſo to this place. The words <hi>Mathematicall definition</hi> do
not pleaſe you Thoſe termes or words, which do moſt
properly belong to Mathematicks, we commonly call
<hi>Mathematicall termes,</hi> and the definitions of ſuch termes, in
Mathematicks, <hi>Mathematicall definitions.</hi> And is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſo to do? No, you tell us. But why? Becauſe it doth
<hi>bewray another kind of Ignorance.</hi> What ignorance? <hi>An inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
ignorance.</hi> How doth it bewray it? <hi>It is a marke of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116063:19"/>
of what are the proper works of the ſeverall parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</hi>
And, I pray, why ſo? Becauſe <hi>it ſeems by this, that all
this while, I think it is a piece of the Geometry of Euclide, no
leſſe to make the Definitions he uſeth, then to inferre from them
the Theorems he demonſtrates.</hi> A great crime, doubtleſſe!
But how doth it appeare, that I think ſo? May not a man
recommend <hi>Hellebor</hi> to you, as a good <hi>Phyſicall drug,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>uſed in Phyſick,</hi> and proper for ſome diſeaſes,) unleſſe
he think, it is the Phyſitians work to <hi>make it,</hi> as well as to
<hi>make uſe of it?</hi> But ſuppoſe <hi>I</hi> do; what then? do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no body thinks ſo, but <hi>I?</hi> or do you believe, that any
body thinks otherwiſe but you? Is it not proper for words
of Art, <hi>(voces artis,)</hi> to be defined and explained in that
art to which they belong? is it not proper for a <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian</hi>
to define <hi>Gender, Number, Perſon, Caſe, Declenſion,
Coniugation &amp;c.</hi> in the ſenſe wherein they are uſed in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
And for a Logician to define <hi>Genus, Species, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,
Individuum, Argumentum, Syllogiſinus, &amp;c.</hi> in the
ſenſe wherein they are uſed in Logick? And may not thoſe
be called <hi>Grammaticall,</hi> and theſe <hi>Logicall</hi> definitions? And
for a <hi>Mathematitian,</hi> to define or tell what is a <hi>Triangle,</hi> a
<hi>Cone,</hi> a <hi>Parabolaſter,</hi> what is <hi>Multiplication, Diviſion, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of rootes,</hi> what is <hi>Binomium, Apotome, Potens duo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
&amp;c.</hi> And may not theſe definitions be called <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall?</hi>
No, by no means, you tell us, <hi>to call a Definition
Mathematicall, Phyſicall &amp;c. is a marke of ignorance, of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
ignorance.</hi> (And doe you not think then, that <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi>
was a wiſe man, to write a large Volumne in <hi>folio,</hi>
intituled <hi>Definitiones Medicae?)</hi> But why a <hi>marke of ignorance?</hi>
Becauſe a Mathematitian, in his definitions <hi>teach you but his
language</hi> (not his <hi>art) but teaching language is not Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
nor Logick, nor Phiſick, nor any other Science,</hi> (but
ſome Art perhaps, which men call <hi>Grammar.)</hi> ſome men
would have thought that <hi>to Define,</hi> had belonged to <hi>Logick;</hi>
but let it paſſe for <hi>Grammar</hi> at preſent. Do you think, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
is <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> wherein a man makes uſe of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar?</hi>
Can a man teach Mathematicks, in any language, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Grammer? (unleſſe, perhaps, in the <hi>Symbolick Language,</hi>
which is worſe then <hi>Welſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh.)</hi> But you ſay, <hi>He that

he can ſwim.) Well, But if not his Definitions, what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116063:20"/>
then is it, <hi>in</hi> Euclide, that is Mathematicall? it is, you tell us,
<hi>his inferring from them the Theorems he demonſtrats.</hi> (And why

And therefore, by the ſame reaſon for which you will
not allow the <hi>Definitions</hi> to be Mathematicall, becauſe to
<hi>teach a language</hi> is the work of Grammar, you muſt alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> becauſe to <hi>inferre</hi>
and <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> is the work of <hi>Logick.</hi> And ſo, nothing in
Euclide will be <hi>Mathematicall.</hi> 'Twill be Grammar and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,

you? Do not <hi>theſe wofull notions of yours, and the language that

            <p>WE have ſeen your <hi>Elegances</hi> already, in the firſt
Section, and then your <hi>Critsiciſmes</hi> in the ſecond.
It's time now to look upon your <hi>Geometry.</hi> And
I ſhould here begin with your firſt Leſſon; but that, by
what we heard even now, you will not allow me to call it
<hi>Geometricall,</hi> or <hi>any peece of Geometry,</hi> conſiſting, as it doth,
of <hi>Definitions.</hi> And yet, what ever the matter is, me thinks
you come pretty neer it: for you call them <hi>Principles of
Geometry.</hi> But you'l ſay, perhaps, they be <hi>Principles of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi>
but not <hi>Geometricall Principles,</hi> (for to call any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
<hi>Geometricall,</hi> were as bad as to call them <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi>
which were a <hi>marke of ignorance unexcuſable.)</hi> Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolved!</p>
            <p>But, whatever elſe they be, <hi>Principles</hi> they are without
doubt. For, as you define p. 4. <hi>A Principle, is, the beginning
of ſomething:</hi> And no man can deny, but that the firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is a <hi>beginning of ſomething:</hi> And therefore, a <hi>Principle.</hi>
Now <hi>contra principia,</hi> we know, <hi>non eſt diſputandum.</hi> I muſt
take heed therefore, what I ſay here.</p>
            <p>In this Leſſon, you take <hi>Euclide</hi> to task, and give him his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116063:20"/>
Iurry: (And when you have <hi>leſſon'd</hi> him, it is to be hoped,
wee will not think much to be <hi>leſſon'd by you:)</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

for his meaning is, that <hi>it hath parts,</hi> and that a good many.

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>which is a
marke with a hot iron, is Viſible; if viſible then it hath quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and conſequently may be divided into parts innumerable</hi> p. 5.
(A witty argument! 'Tis <hi>viſible,</hi> therefore 'tis <hi>diviſible,</hi>
But could you not as well have ſaid, That <hi>A Marke conſiſts
of two Nobles?</hi> For that is as much to the buſineſſe, <hi>as a
marke with a hot iron.)</hi> Nay more <hi>Euclids definition,</hi> you ſay
<hi>is the ſame with yours, which is, A point is that Body whoſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

Body, whoſe quantity is not conſidered.</hi> Juſt the ſame to a cow's
thumb. They begin both with the letter. As like, as an
Apple and a Oyſter.</p>
            <p>But by the way, how comes a <hi>Point</hi> on a ſuddaine to be
a <hi>Body?</hi> you told us juſt before, in the ſame page, p. 5. that

               </gap> may be made without a hot Iron, I

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
is a <hi>Point made with a Pen,</hi> quoth he (with a laſh) will you

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is <hi>a mark with a hot Iron,</hi>
(laſhing again,) think upon that too. Henceforth, quoth
he, (ſetting him down,) Remember the difference between

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond definition.</hi> A line is length which hath no
breadth; <hi>you would have to be candidly interpreted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>
If a man, <hi>you ſay,</hi> have any ingenuity, he will underſtand it
thus, A line is a body <hi>&amp;c. very likely!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth definition, is this, <hi>A ſtreight line is that which
lies evenly between its own points.</hi> p. 6. Well; how is this to
be underſtood? Nay, <hi>this definition is inexcuſable.</hi> Say you
ſo? let it paſſe then, and ſhift for its ſelfe as well as it can.
It hath made a pretty good ſhift hitherto; perhaps it may
outlive this brunt alſo. But, becauſe you are willing to lend
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116063:22"/>
it a helping hand, you ſay, <hi>He meant, perhaps, to call a ſtreight
line, that which is all the way from one extreme to another, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtant from any two or more ſuch lines, as being like and equall
have the ſame extremes.</hi> It may be ſo. Many ſtrange things
are poſſible. But it would have been a great while before <hi>I</hi>
ſhould have thought this to be the meaning of thoſe
words.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh definition, you ſay <hi>hath the ſame faults.</hi> Then
let that paſſe too; and anſwer for it ſelfe as well as it can.</p>
            <p>The eighth, is the <hi>Definition of a plain Angle.</hi> Againſt
which you object onely this of your own, That <hi>by this Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
two right angles taken together are no Angle.</hi> And 'tis
granted. Euclide did not intend to call <hi>an aggregate of two
right angles,</hi> by the name of an <hi>Angle:</hi> And therefore gave
ſuch a definition of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as would not take that in.
Where's the fault then?</p>
            <p>The thirteenth definit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, A Terme or Bound, is that which

               </gap> you ſay, <hi>is exact,</hi> (very good?)
But, <hi>that it makes againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> doctrine.</hi> What doctrine of mine?
viz. <hi>that a point is nothing.</hi> Who told you, that this is my
doctrine? I have ſaid, perhaps, that <hi>a Point hath no higneſſe;</hi>
or, <hi>that a Point hath no parts,</hi> (and ſo ſaid Euclide in his firſt
definition,) but when or where did I ſay, it is <hi>nothing?</hi> But
how do you prove hence, that a point hath parts? Becauſe,
you ſay, <hi>The extremes of a line are Points.</hi> True. What then?
<hi>A point therefore,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is a part.</hi> It doth not follow. How
prove you this conſequence, If an extreme, then a part? <hi>But,</hi>
ſay you, <hi>what in a line is the extreme, but the firſt or laſt part? I</hi>
anſwer; A Point, which is no part. Have you any more to
ſay?—If you have no more to ſay, then heare mee.
<hi>A point is the extreme of a line:</hi> Therefore <hi>it hath no parts. I</hi>
prove it thus; becauſe, if that point have parts; then, either
all its parts are extreme, and bound the line, or ſome one,
or more: Not all: For they cannot be all utmoſt; but one
muſt ſtand beyond another: if onely ſome, or one; then not
the <hi>Point,</hi> but <hi>ſome part of it,</hi> bounds the line, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the ſuppoſition. You ſee, therefore, the Definition
doth not make againſt my doctrine.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Definition of Euclide, you would have
abbreviated thus. <hi>A figure is quantity every way determined,</hi>
and then tell us, <hi>it is in your opinion as exact a definition of a
Figure as can poſſibly be given.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> am not of your opinion;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116063:22"/>
For by this Definition of yours, a <hi>ſtreight line</hi> (of a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
length) muſt as well be a Figure, as a <hi>circle.</hi> For ſuch
a line, having no other dimenſion but length, if its length
be determined, it is every way determined; that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all the dimenſions it hath. (If you object, that it
hath no determinate breadth; <hi>I</hi> anſwer, the <hi>breadth</hi> of a
ſtreight line is as much determined, as the <hi>thickneſſe</hi> of a
Circle, or other plain figure.) And, by the ſame reaſon, A
Pound, a Pint, a Hundred, an Hour, &amp;c. muſt be Figures,
becauſe they are Quantities every way determined, viz. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all the dimenſions that thoſe words import.
<hi>This Definition of Euclide,—</hi> (ſtay a while, the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

not how deſtructive your principles are to Theology.)
Your Definition, we (whether Theologers or Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians)
cannot admit; for the reaſon by us already aſſigned.
But it ſeems you have a farther reach in it: Lets hear what
it is. <hi>For this determination,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is the ſame thing with
circumſcription.</hi> A locall determination, intended by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide,
is ſo. But what then? <hi>And whatſoever is any where
(ubicunque) Definitivè, is there alſo Circumſcriptivé.</hi> How do
you prove this? or how doth this follow from the other?
—You cannot but know this is generally denyed. Have
you any thing to offer by way of proof?—Not a
word. Well; but what is it you drive at? You offer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of proofe, for what you affirme (by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion)
againſt all Divines, or as you call them Theologers.
But lets ſee what you would gather from it. <hi>By this means,</hi>
you ſay, <hi>the diſtinction is loſt, by which Theologers, when they
deny God to be in any place, ſave themſelves from being accuſed of
ſaying he is nowhere; for that which is nowhere is nothing.</hi> 'Tis
true, that Divines do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, (and I hope you'l ſay ſo too) that
<hi>God is not bounded, or circumſcribed, within the limits of any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116063:23"/>
place;</hi> becauſe they ſay, and do believe, <hi>there is no place where
he is not.</hi> And he that ſaies the latter, muſt needs ſay the
former. For to ſay that God, who is every where, &amp; fills all
places; is yet bounded within certain limits; were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
For, to be concluded within certain limits, is
to be excluded from all places without thoſe limits; And
therefore not to be every where. And if this be not your
opinion too, ſpeak out, if you can for ſhame, that the world
may ſee what you are. Do you believe, that what thing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is at all <hi>any where,</hi> (not excepting God himſelfe) muſt
needs be <hi>circumſcribed within ſome certain bounds,</hi> ſo as not
to be without or beyond them? And that whatſoever is not,
<hi>in any place ſo circumſcribed, is no where,</hi> and therefore <hi>nothing?</hi>
If ſo; then whether of the two do you affirme? That God is
ſo circumſcribed or concluded within certain limits, and
excluded from all others at the ſame time? Or, That he is
not ſo concluded, and therefore no where, and ſo nothing?
If you ſay the firſt, you deny God to be <hi>Infinite:</hi> If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
you deny him to <hi>bee.</hi> And, either way, you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injury be affirmed to maintain <hi>horrid opinions concerning
God.</hi> As for that diſtinction of <hi>Definitivè</hi> and <hi>Circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi>
with which you ſay the Theologers think to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
You are wholly out in the buſineſſe: Theologers uſe
not that diſtinction in this caſe. It's true, that, in the caſe
of Angells, and the Soules of men, there are that affirme
them to be <hi>in loco definitivè,</hi> but not <hi>circumſcriptivè:</hi> becauſe
though they be not bodies, and ſo locally extended <hi>per po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionem
partis extra partem;</hi> yet neither are they infinite, or
every where, but have a definite, determinate exiſtence, as
to be <hi>here,</hi> and not at the ſame time elſewhere. But as to
God, we neither affirme him to be <hi>circumſcribed,</hi> nor to be
<hi>confined</hi> within any bounds; but to be <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>every
where.</hi> And if any be ſo abſurd as to affirme that God is
determined within ſome place, ſo as not to be at the ſame
time without or beyond it, whether by <hi>Circumſcription</hi> or
<hi>Definition,</hi> we ſhall without ſcruple, (notwithſtanding that
<hi>we carry double,)</hi> reject the diſtinction ſo applied, and your
opinion with it, without fear of being <hi>caſt out from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of all Divines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean while, I wonder how this Definition of
Euclide comes to have any thing to doe with this buſineſſe.
<hi>A Figure,</hi> ſaith Euclide, <hi>is that which is incompaſſed within
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116063:23"/>
ſome bound or bounds.</hi> Well, what then? Will you aſſume
<hi>But God is a figure?</hi> and then conclude, That, <hi>if God be at all
any where, he muſt be ſo concluded within bounds?</hi> If you do,
you argue profanely enough, and deſerve as bad Epithites
as any have been yet beſtowed upon you. We ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
admitting Euclides definition, argue thus, <hi>A figure is
concluded within certain bounds; But God is not ſo concluded,</hi> (as
being infinite, and ſo without bounds;) <hi>Therefore God is not
a Figure:</hi> And be neither in danger of being <hi>caſt out of the
Mathematick Schooles,</hi> nor yet, <hi>from the Society of Schoole-Divines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fifteenth Definition, which is, of <hi>a Circle,</hi> you grant
to be true.</p>
            <p>And skip over the reſt to the five and twentieth, which
is, of <hi>Parallell ſtreight lines.</hi> This Definition you think to
be leſſe accurate, and think your own to be better: But of
this it will be time enough, if need be, to conſider in its
proper place.</p>
            <p>After this, you let all the Definitions paſſe untouched,
till the third of the Fift Book. Saving that you touch by
the way, on the Fourth of the Third Book, which you grant
to be true: and the firſt of the Fift Book, which, you ſay,
<hi>may paſſe for a Definition of an Aliquot part,</hi> as was by Euclide
intended.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>the Third Definition of the Fift Book</hi> (the Definition of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ratio,)</hi> you ſay, <hi>is intollerable.</hi> Yea <hi>'tis as bad as
any thing was ever ſaid in Geometry by D. Wallis.</hi> (Becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
you can make nothing of it, but this, that <hi>Proportion
is a what-ſhall-I call it asneſſe or ſoneſſe of two magnitudes</hi> &amp;c.)
Yet this definition hath hitherto been permitted to paſſe,
and may do ſtill. And when you underſtand it a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
perhaps you may think ſo too. But of this I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
more at large, in a peculiar Treatiſe againſt <hi>Meibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius:</hi>
and ſhall therefore forbear to examine it here.</p>
            <p>Againſt the fourth definition, you object nothing, but that
the ſixt might be ſpared.</p>
            <p>The Fourteenth, you ſay is good. And tell us farther,
that the <hi>compoſition</hi> here defined, is not <hi>the ſame compoſition
which he defineth in the fourth def. before the ſixth book.</hi> And
you ſay true; for this is a compoſition by Addition, and that
is compoſition by Multiplication. And therefore do not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116063:24"/>
think much if hereafter I ſhall ſay, that there be two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of proportion.</p>
            <p>To the reſt of his definitions you give a generall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
His Poſtulata you allow alſo: and ſo give over
<hi>Leſſoning</hi> of Euclide: But tell us before you part, that <hi>A man
may eaſily perceive, that Euclide did not intend, That a point
ſhould be (without parts,</hi> which you call) <hi>nothing; or a line,
without latitude; or a Superficies, without thickneſſe:</hi> though it
be evident that he hath defined them ſo to be. But why
muſt we not think, he meant as he ſaith? (Becauſe, ſay you,
<hi>Lines are not drawn but by Motion, and Motion is of Body only.</hi>

            <p>HAving dore Schooling of Euclide; in your ſecond
Leſſon you fall upon us.</p>
            <p>Four peeces of mine, you take to task. p. 10. (My

you'l blunder on, though you break your ſhinnes for
it. And you'd have it thought, that you <hi>have wholly and
clearly confuted them</hi> Ep. Ded. (for you uſe to make clear
work where you goe,) and <hi>that I have performed nothing in
any of my books.</hi> p. 10</p>
            <p>This is the charge. Let's ſee how you can make it good.</p>
            <p>Wee'l begin with that of the <hi>Angle of Contact;</hi> which you
undertake in your third Leſſon. p. 26.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of that treatiſe, is, a controverſy between
<hi>Clavius</hi> and <hi>Peletarius. Clavius</hi> is of opinion, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of a Semicircle EAC (Fig. 1.) is leſſe then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilineal
Right Angle PAC; becauſe that is but a part of
this; the other part EAP, the Angle of contact, (which
with that of the Semicircle makes the right Angle PAC,)
being, as he ſuppoſeth, an angle of ſome bigneſſe. <hi>Peletari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
is of opinion, that the Angle EAC, is equall to PAC;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116063:24"/>
and not a part of it, but the whole; the ſuppoſed Angle
PAE being, as he thinks, no Angle, or an angle of no
bigneſſe.</p>
            <p>This being the ſtate of the controverſy: I take Peleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
his part. And my firſt argument is from the nature of
a Plain angle, which Euclide defines to be <hi>the mutuall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two lines &amp;c.</hi> And therefore the lines EA, PA, in
the point of concurſe A, not being at all inclined each to
other; but in the ſame coincident poſition without incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
they do not contain an angle. The tendency of the
circumference EAN, before it comes at the point A, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the tangent PT; when it's paſt that point, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
is from it; but in the point A, it doth neither tend
toward it, nor from it, nor croſſe it; and therefore muſt be
either in parallell poſition, or coincident. And this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is managed in the 3 and 4 Chapters.</p>
            <p>You tell us to this, that <hi>Peletarius did not well—Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
did not well—Euclide did not well</hi>—That is,
You think ſo. And it's like, <hi>You think,</hi> I have done worſt
of all. But I doe not much ſtand upon your thoughts.</p>
            <p>You ſay particularly, p. 26. That <hi>I am more obſcure then
Euclide.</hi> (It may be ſo.) <hi>That I am contrary to him,</hi> (That
you are to prove.) That <hi>I make two lines when they ly upon
one another, to lye</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>without inclination:</hi> I do ſo. Shew
me if you can, where Euclide ſaith the contrary. Tell mee,
where lines, either in the ſame or in parallell poſitions, are
by Euclide ſaid to <hi>incline</hi> or be <hi>inclined</hi> each to other? to
thwart, or croſſe each other? <hi>According to Euclide,</hi> you ſay,
<hi>an angle equall to two right angles ſhould be the greateſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and ſo <hi>the greateſt angle,</hi> where as, <hi>by this</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>it ſhould be the leaſt that can be,</hi> or rather no angle. Shew me
where ever Euclide doth acknowledge any angle to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to two right angles? or, which is all one, that too
contiguous parts of the ſame right line, are by Euclide ſaid
to be <hi>inclined to each other,</hi> or to <hi>contain an angle?</hi> Nay he ſays
the quite contrary. For in his definition of a plain angle,
he makes it one qualification, that the lines containing it,
muſt be ſuch as are <hi>non indirectum poſitae.</hi> And therefore two
ſtreight lines <hi>in directum poſitae</hi> (ſuch as thoſe muſt needs
be, which are to contain your ſuppoſed angle equall to two
right angles) cannot, by Euclides definition, contain an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116063:25"/>
Angle. We do not therefore in this diſagree.</p>
            <p>You adde farther, (as giving this for loſt, <hi>Though it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
(as it muſt needs be) <hi>that there be no inclination of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
to the tangent</hi> (and conſequently no Angle; by
that definition of Euclide.) <hi>yet it doth not follow that they
forme no kind of Angle.</hi> And why doth it not follow? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſay you, <hi>Euclide there defines but one of the kinds of a plain
angle.</hi> That Euclide doth not there define, an <hi>angle</hi> in general
or all kinds of angles, is very true; for there be many other
both ſuperficiall and ſolid angles, which are not <hi>plain</hi> angles:
But that he doth there define a <hi>plain angle</hi> in generall, and
therefore all kinds of plain angles is evident fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his words.
For in the eighth Definition he defines a <hi>plain Angle,</hi> (as the
<hi>genus) A plain Angle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the mutuall inclination of
two lines, &amp;c.</hi> and then in the next definition, defines a
<hi>right lined plain angle,</hi> (as one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it) viz. <hi>when both
theſe lines be right lines.</hi> It's manifeſt therefore that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the former definition to define a plain angle in
generall; whether the lines containing it be ſtreight or
crooked. And therefore ſince the angle of contact falls not
within that definition, it is not to be reputed a plain angle.
And ſo my firſt Argument ſtands good.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is an Argument of Peletarius, drawn from
the firſt Propoſition of the tenth of Euclide; (and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
likewiſe by me, from the ſecond propoſition of the firſt
of Archimedes <hi>de ſphaera &amp; cylindro:)</hi> To which Clavius
rejoyns, that the propoſition is to be underſtood only of
<hi>Homogeneous quantities;</hi> &amp;; of ſuch, grants the argument to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
And you; ſuppoſing theſe to be <hi>Heterogeneous,</hi> ſay, it is
like <hi>as to ſeek for the Focus of the Parabola of Dives and Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
To your ſcoff at Scripture, I reply only this, that the
<hi>Focus</hi> of that <hi>Parabola</hi> is a bad place to be in, &amp; wiſh you to
take heed of it. With Clavius, we joyn iſſue; granting the
propoſitions cited not to be underſtood of <hi>Heterogeneous
quantities;</hi> and prove <hi>theſe not to be ſuch;</hi> by this argument:
<hi>If any thing make the angle of Contact PAE, to be heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to a rectilineal angle; it muſt be the crookedneſſe of the ſide
AE.</hi> (for if that ſide were ſtreight; the angle were recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineall;)
<hi>But that hinders not,</hi> (for I prove the angles
CAE, and SAE, notwithſtanding the ſame ſide
AE, are homogeneous to right lined angles; as you grant,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116063:25"/>
and Clavius could not deny:) <hi>Therefore nothing hinders.</hi> And
this is done in my fift Chapter.</p>
            <p>What Clavius had brought to prove the contrary, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in the ſixth Chapter. And if you had not thought
his arguments to be all anſwered, you ſhould have done
well to have undertaken the managing of ſome one of
them. That you mention, doth only, upon ſuppoſition that
it is a quantity, prove it to be heterogeneall; becauſe not
Homogeneall. Which is to beg the queſtion. For we, as well
as he, deny it to be a Homogeneall quantity; and therefore
conclude it to be no quantity; for heterogeneous it is not.
His argument amounts but to this, <hi>'Tis not a quantity Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous,</hi>
(by 5 d 5) <hi>therefore 'tis a quantity Heterogeneous.</hi> I
grant his Antecedent, but deny the Conſequence (which
proceeds only upon ſuppoſition that it is a Quantity, which
is the thing in queſtion.) He ſhould firſt have proved it to
be a Quantity; which Peletarius and I deny.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Chapter I prove, by other arguments, that
if the angle of Contact be an angle, it muſt be homogeneous
to rectilineal angles.</p>
            <p>1. That which may be added to, or ſubtracted from, a
right lined angle, is homogeneous to it: Becauſe Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
quantities are not capable of addition, or ſubduction.
(And this you grant.) But ſo here; For PAE if an angle,
may be added to the angle SAP, making the angle SAE;
(which therefore, ſaies Clavius, is bigger then SAP;) and
taken from the angle PAC, leaving the angle EAC,
(which therefore, ſaies Clavius, is leſſe then PAC;) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if an angle, it is homogeneous You grant the major;
and deny the minor: that is, you deny the only foundation
upon which Clavius builds his opinion; and ſo yeeld the
cauſe. For he doth upon no other ground maintain the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of the ſemicircle EAC, to be leſſe then the right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
PAC, but becauſe the angle of Contact PAE, is a
part of it, and therefore the other part EAC, muſt be leſſe
then the whole.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe which are to each other as Greater and Leſſe,
have proportion each to other; and are conſequently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous;
by the third def. of the fift of Euclide. (and
this you grant.) But, the angle of Contact PAE, is leſſe
then the angle SAP; by the 16 of the third of Euclide; (for
his words are, that it is leſſe then any right lined angle.)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116063:26"/>
And this Clavius would not deny, but oft affirmes it.
Therefore they be homogeneous. All that you have to ſay
is, that though Euclide ſay it is leſſe, yet <hi>(to your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
he doth not mean ſo.</hi> But doth he not, <hi>to your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
prove, that <hi>the leaſt right lined Angle is bigger th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n it?</hi>
and if ſo, ſuppoſing it to be angle, muſt it not be Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous?
even by your own conceſſion.</p>
            <p>To the third and fourth Arguments in that Chapter, You
object nothing; and therefore thoſe, I ſuppoſe, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to conclude what is contended for. <hi>viz.</hi> that the angle
of Contact is not Heterogeneous to other plain angles: and
therefore, this being the only exception, my firſt main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſtands good.</p>
            <p>The Eight Chapter you ſay, contains nothing but the
Authority of Sir <hi>Henry Savile.</hi> And you ſay true; for no
more was intended.</p>
            <p>The third main Argument is propoſed in the ninth
Chapter; Becauſe <hi>the Angles of ſemicircles</hi> (becauſe like ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
<hi>are equall.</hi> Whence Peletarius infers, that <hi>the Angle
of Contact is no quantity.</hi> Clavius grants the conſequence of
the Argument; but denies the Antecedent: affirming DAC
(fig. 2,) to be leſſe then EAC, though both angles of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircles,
this of the bigger, that of the leſſe. To this you
ſay, that <hi>in my 9 and 10 Chapters I prove with much adoe, that
the Angles of like ſegments are equall:</hi> (if I prove it, though
with much adoe, then I carry the cauſe; for that was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing denied by Clavius. But you adde) <hi>as if that might
not have been taken</hi> gratis <hi>by</hi> Peletarius, <hi>without demonſtration:</hi>
(Implying thereby, that I need not have proved it.) And
this is like your ſelfe, who care not how you abuſe your
Engliſh Reader. The caſe is thus. Peletarius had taken it
<hi>gratis,</hi> as a thing that in reaſon ſhould not have been deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. Yet 'tis denied by <hi>Clavius;</hi> and the whole iſſue of
the cauſe put upon it. Had I not reaſon then to prove it?
Yet I prove it thus; Firſt, that <hi>Peletarius</hi> had reaſon to take
it <hi>gratis,</hi> and that it was unreaſonable in <hi>Clavius</hi> to put him
upon the proofe; and this is done in the ninth Chapter.
But then, becauſe he had denyed it, how unreaſonable ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it were ſo to doe, and withall put the whole iſſue of the
cauſe upon it; therefore in the tenth Chapter I undertake
to prove it by argument. And you grant, I prove It. What
ſhould I doe more?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:116063:26"/>
The 11th Chapter clears the ſame argument from a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
difficulty. And you ſay nothing to it, but that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was of no moment, and needed no anſwer.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Arguments of the 12 and 13 Chapters,</hi> (and thoſe
are a pretty many, for in one of them are contained ſix,)
your anſwer is (and that's all) that <hi>they are grounded all on
this untruth, that an Angle, is that which is contained between the
lines that make it, that is to ſay, is a plain ſuperficies.</hi> Which is
(I will not ſay a <hi>lye,</hi> though that alſo be your language, but)
manifeſtly falſe; and you could not but know it ſo to bee.
For there is not, in thoſe whole Chapters any ſuch thing
aſſumed for proofe; nor doth any one of thoſe arguments
depend upon any ſuch notion; but let your notion of Angle
be what it can, my arguments will hold their weight. This
therefore is nothing but a notorious untruth, wherewith
(becauſe you had nothing to ſay to the Arguments) you
meant to abuſe your Engliſh Reader. But ſuppoſe I had ſaid,
(as it is like I may ſometimes) that an <hi>Angle is contained by,
or between the two ſides;</hi> is this any more then to ſay that
<hi>the two ſides contain the Angle?</hi> And doth not every body ſay
ſo as well as I? Are they not Euclide's own words, 9 <hi>d</hi> 1.
When the <hi>lines</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>containing or comprehending
the angle be right lines, the angle is called Rectilineall?</hi> Nay are
they not your own words, cap. 14. § 7. Anguli <hi>qui rectis
continentur lineis, rectilinei; qui curvis, anguli curvilinei ſunt;
qui recta &amp; curva continentur, miſti?</hi> What a doe then doe
you make for nothing? Perhaps the word <hi>between</hi> troubles
you. But is not <hi>by</hi> and <hi>between</hi> in this caſe all one? It is to
mee; and if you doe not like the one word take the other;
'tis all one to mee, (But, by the way, the phraſe, <hi>contain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,</hi>
is not ſo much as once uſed in either of thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
and therefore that cavill is to no purpoſe at all, but
to abuſe your Engliſh Reader, who cannot contradict you.)
And doth not Euclide's word <gap reason="foreign">

is contained between the lines that make it,</hi> is as much as to
ſay, that <hi>it is a plain ſuperficies.</hi> And was it ſo when you
wrote thoſe paſſages laſt cited? Were you then of opinion
that the <hi>Angle contained or comprehended between the lines</hi>
AB <hi>and</hi> AC, (as you there ſpeak,) was a <hi>plain ſuperficies?</hi>
Or, if thoſe words do not import ſo much when you ſpeak
them, why ſhould you think they doe when I ſpeak them?
But, it ſeems, having nothing elſe to cavill at, you thought
fit to tell your Engliſh Reader, who muſt take it upon truſt
from you, That <hi>I affirme a plain angle, to be a plain ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
becauſe, forſooth, I ſay (as Euclide and all others doe,
and your ſelfe among the reſt,) that <hi>it is contained between
two lines.</hi> You might, with much better Logick, have
concluded the contrary For though Euclide, as I doe, ſaid
that <hi>two ſtreight lines may comprehend an angle,</hi> 9 d 1. yet he
affirmes, that <hi>two ſtreight lines cannot comprehend a ſuperficies,</hi>
10 ax 1. And therefore, when I affirme that an angle may
be comprehended between two ſtreight lines, you might
(at leaſt a ſober-man might) have concluded, that I did
not take it for a ſuperficies, becauſe that cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by fewer ſtreight lines then three. But enough
of this. And, if this be all you have to ſay againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of the 12 and 13 Chapters, I hope they may paſſe
for current: and be judged to conclude the cauſe.</p>

You object nothing, but that <hi>I defend Vitellio without need</hi>

(as for example 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.) to find the proportion of
the Aggregate of them all, to the Aggregate of ſo many times the

what then? <hi>This</hi> you ſay, <hi>is to be done by multiplying
the greateſt into halfe the number of termes.</hi> What is to be done
thus? finding the proportion? No ſuch matter. That's the
way to find the ſumme, (upon ſuppoſition that the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is already known to be, as 1 to 2,) not to find out
what is the Proportion, (ſuppoſing it yet unknown,)
which the Lemma propoſeth to be inquired, and finds it
to be as 1 to 2. But 'tis well however that you can at
length tell how to gather the ſumme of ſuch a proportion
(after I had taught you in my Elenchus,) for you were, it
ſeems, of an other opinion, when you ſaid Cap. 16. parag. 20.

of <hi>Demonſtrating,</hi> when <hi>I</hi> propoſe the <hi>finding out;</hi> for, if you

            <p>You tell us next, that <hi>an Induction, without a Numeration
of all the particulars is not ſufficient to inferre a Concluſion.</hi> Yes,
Sir, if after the Enumeration of ſome particulars, there
comes a generall clauſe, <hi>and the like in other caſes,</hi> (as here it
doth) this may paſſe for a proofe, till there be a poſſiblity
of giving ſome inſtance to the contrary; which, here, you
will never be able to doe. And if ſuch an induction may
not paſſe for proofe, there is never a propoſition in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide

Yet <hi>I</hi> have not heard any man object, that the induction

            <p>You then aske, <hi>whether it be not alſo true in theſe numbers,</hi>

have thought it; when he ſees that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak in generall of

            <p>You ask then (very wiſely) <hi>whether it will hold in</hi>
0, 1, 3, 5, 7. <hi>I</hi> anſwer, no. (nor is any ſuch thing affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.)

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:116063:28"/>
And when you have done Catechizing us, you then
conclude, <hi>well, the Lemma is true:</hi> (in good time!) that
is as much as to ſay, you were willing to ſhew your teeth
though you cannot bite. What's next?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Theorem that I draw from it, is,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that a
Triangle to a Parallelogram of Equall baſe and Altitude, is as
one to two.</hi> Well; and what of this? <hi>The concluſion you ſay
is true.</hi> Very good, Then two of the five have ſcaped alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But you doe not like of the Demonſtration, becauſe
of the words <hi>as it were</hi> (and the like exception you took
before, at the word <hi>ſcarce,)</hi> which you ſay, <hi>is no phraſe of a
Geometrician.</hi> Yes Sir; a very good phraſe, if the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician
doe determine preciſely (as I have done) how
much by that <hi>quaſi</hi> he intends to limit the <hi>accuratè.</hi> For I
doe not ſuffer either the <hi>ſcarce,</hi> or the <hi>as it were,</hi> to runne
at randome without bounds. I tell you that by <hi>quaſi linea,</hi>
or <hi>vix aliud quam linea,</hi> I doe not meane preciſely a <hi>Line,</hi>
but a <hi>Parallologramme whoſe breadth is very ſmall,</hi> viz. <hi>an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot
part of the whole figures altitude, denominated by the number
of Parallelogramms.</hi> (Which is a determination Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
preciſe.) And by <hi>triangulum conſtat quaſi, &amp;c.</hi> I tell
you that <hi>I</hi> mean, that <hi>a Figure, conſiſting of ſuch Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramms,
inſcribed in a Triangle, whoſe difference in bigneſſe
from that Triangle is leſſe then any aſſignable quantity, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted.</hi>
As you may ſee preciſely determined in the place
to which this Demonſtration referres. The words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>vix</hi> and <hi>quaſi,</hi> being thus determined, are here very
good Geometricall words; and your cavills come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My fift Propoſition is,</hi> you ſay, <hi>The Spirall line is equall to half
the circle of the firſt Revolution.</hi> But, in ſaying ſo, you ſay
not true. For that is not my propoſition; but one of your
own, patched together, after your faſhion, out of my fift
and ſixth put together. And, as it ſtands, <hi>I</hi> cannot own it.
The words <hi>of the firſt revolution,</hi> ſhould have been adjoyned
to the <hi>Spirall line,</hi> not to the word <hi>circle:</hi> to ſhew how
much of the Spirall line is intended. And, inſtead of <hi>halfe
the circle,</hi> you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>halfe the circumference of the
firſt circle;</hi> for <hi>I</hi> did not compare the <hi>Spirall line</hi> with the
<hi>Circle</hi> (that is, a line, with a Figure,) but that <hi>Spirall
line</hi> with the <hi>circumference,</hi> (viz. as 1 to 2,) and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Figure,</hi> with the <hi>Circle,</hi> (viz. as 1 to 3) And the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116063:29"/>
you intend, is not by mee, or by Archimedes, called the
<hi>circle of the firſt revolution,</hi> but the <hi>firſt circle;</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
with the <hi>firſt revolution of that Spirall line.</hi> But if
you will needs have my fifth and ſixth Propoſitions put
together, pray let it be thus, That <hi>ſo much of the Spirall line,
in the ſenſe of the propoſition, as belongs to the firſt revolution,
is equall to halfe the circumference of the firſt circle.</hi> Now in
what ſenſe <hi>I</hi> take the words <hi>Spirall line,</hi> in theſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is ſo clearly defined in the <hi>Scholium</hi> of pag. 10. that it
is not poſſible for any man, unleſſe willfully, to miſtake
mee. viz. That <hi>I doe not intend the true ſpirall of Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
but the aggregate of the arches of infinite like Sectors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
a figure inſcribed within that Spirall of Archimedes.</hi>
And thus, both thoſe and the other Propoſitions are true.
Nor can you deny them.</p>
            <p>But now becauſe you have nothing to ſay againſt the
Propoſition in the true ſenſe of it: you will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
mee, (becauſe you know what <hi>I</hi> meant better then
my ſelfe.) that <hi>I</hi> did not ſo mean, nor would be underſtood,
ſo, as <hi>I</hi> ſaid, <hi>I</hi> meant and deſired to be underſtood; but
that <hi>I</hi> meant ſomewhat elſe. And you have this ground for
it; Becauſe in the ſenſe wherein <hi>I</hi> ſaid <hi>I</hi> would have it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
the propoſition is true; but you have a deſire
that it ſhould be falſe; and therefore it muſt be underſtood
in ſome other ſenſe. Let's ſee therefore what it is, that I
may at length know what it was I meant. <hi>What Spirall is
meant,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we ſhall underſtand by the conſtruction.</hi> Yes, if
you take in the whole conſtruction; but not by a peece of
it. My conſtruction begins thus, <hi>Let a ſtreight line MA,
turned about the center M, be ſuppoſed, by a uniforme motion,
to deſcribe, with its point A, the circumference AOA; whileſt
a point in the ſame line, ſo carried about, is ſuppoſed to deſcribe
a Spirall line MTA.</hi> This is the firſt part of the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
(and from hence I inferre, by the way, that <hi>the
ſtreight lines MT will be proportionall to the angles AMT,
and the Archs AO.) This therefore,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is the Spirall of
Archimedes.</hi> Very true: and it was intended ſo to be. But
let's goe on and heare the reſt of the conſtruction, (for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have had but a part of it.) Which if you may
be believed, is this; <hi>inſcribing in the Circle an infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Equall angles, and conſequently an infinite number of
Sectors, whoſe Archs will therefore be in Arithmeticall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116063:29"/>
(which,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is true;) and the aggregate of thoſe
archs equall to halfe the circumference</hi> AOA. <hi>Which,</hi> you ſay,
<hi>is true alſo.</hi> But, if I had ſaid ſo, I had lyed; for <hi>I</hi> know it
to be falſe: (in you it was only an Error, or, as you uſe to
call it, a Negligence; becauſe you thought it had been true.)
For this is neither my conſtruction, nor are thoſe things
true which you affirme. For, if in a circle, there be a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Sectors inſcribed (whether finite or infinite) both
thoſe Sectors, and the Archs of them, are proportionall to
their Angles; and therefore, the Angles being equall, the
Archs will be <hi>equall</hi> alſo, and not <hi>Arithmetically proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:</hi>
And the Aggregate of thoſe archs, will not be equall to
<hi>half the circumference</hi> AOA, but, to that <hi>whole circumference.</hi>
But my conſtruction was this; <hi>Within the Spirall line, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
as above, ſuppoſing an infinite multitude of Sectors conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
inſcribed on equall angles, their Radii</hi> AT <hi>will be Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically
proportionall,</hi> viz. <hi>as 0, 1, 2, 3, and conſequently their
archs will be ſo too.</hi> And this, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, is that which you
intended to grant as true; Being the reſult of the ſecond
part of my conſtruction. Then followes the third part of
the conſtruction (which hath the nature of a Definition;
which, till thus much of the conſtruction was paſt, could
not conveniently be expreſſed,) <hi>The Spirall line</hi> (intended
in the propoſition, not that of Archimedes) <hi>is ſuppoſed
therefore to be made up, of the archs of thoſe infinite Sectors,
arithmetically proportionall</hi> (for ſo they are already proved to
be) <hi>beginning with a point or o.</hi> (And then goes on the
Demonſtration.) <hi>But the circumference conſiſts of ſo many archs
equall to the biggeſt of them; as is evident. Therefore (by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Prop.) that to this, is as one to two. Which is the thing to
be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this, to ſome capacities, though not to M. <hi>Hobs,</hi>
would have been eaſy enough to underſtand. Yet that it
might not lye open to any cavill, or miſunderſtanding; <hi>I</hi>
thought fit in a particular <hi>Scholium,</hi> to expreſſe my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo fully, as that there might be no poſſibility of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
what <hi>I</hi> intended. (And, the truth is, <hi>I</hi> would have
had that <hi>Scholium</hi> Printed next after the Fifth Propoſition.
But finding, that, through ſome neglect, the Printer had
there left it out, <hi>I</hi> gave him order to put it in, at the next
convenient place; which was, in the next ſheet, at the end
of the 12 Propoſition: a place proper enough for it.) And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116063:30"/>
you cannot deny, but that my words there, be plain enough
to be underſtood, and not capable of any diſtortion to any
other ſenſe. And that the Propoſition in this ſenſe is true,
you cannot deny; and ſo much (<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe) you intended to
grant, when you ſaid, That <hi>the aggregate of thoſe archs is equall
to halfe the circumference</hi> AOA, <hi>is true alſo.</hi> Three there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the five are already found to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My 19. Prop.</hi> you ſay, <hi>is this</hi> Lemma. <hi>In a ſeries of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
beginning from a point or ciphar, and proceeding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order of ſquare numbers, (as for example</hi> 0, 1, 4, 9,
16, <hi>&amp;c.) to find what proportion the whole ſeries hath, to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the greateſt.</hi> 'Tis true; this is my 19 Propoſition.
What then? <hi>I conclude,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the proportion is that of 1 to</hi> 3.
No Sir, I do not conclude it to be ſo. I conclude it to <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then</hi> that of one to three. My words are theſe, <hi>Ratio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens
eſt ubique major quam ſubtripla Exceſſus autem perpetuo
decreſcit prout numerus terminorum augetur, &amp;c. ut ſit rationis
provenientis exceſſus ſupra ſubtriplam, ea quam habet unitas ad
ſextuplum numeri terminorum p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt o.</hi> That is in plain Engliſh
thus. <hi>The ſeries ſo increaſing, is alwaies more then a third part
of ſo many times the greateſt. For it containes evermore, a third
part thereof, and moreover, an aliquot part denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ſix times the number of termes following the o.</hi> And is
not this true? can you have the face to deny it? Wee'l try
if you pleaſe; take your own inſtances. Let the ſeries be
of three termes 0, 1, 4, the aggregate is 5: the greateſt ſo
many times taken, that is 3 times 4, is 12. I ſay 5 contains
of 12, a third part (viz. 4 = ⅓ × 12.) and moreover a
part denominated by 6 times 2, (for there are two termes
beſides o.) that is a twelfth part of the number 12. (viz.
1 = 1/12; × 12.) And is not this true? is not 5 = 4 × 1?
Again, let the termes be four, viz, 0, 1, 4, 9. = 14. and
the greateſt ſo many times taken 9, 9, 9, 9. = 36. I ſay
that 14 containes ⅓ of 36, (that is 12,) and moreover,
(becauſe 3 × 6 = 18) 1/18 of 36, (that is 2.) And is it
not true, that 14 is equall to 12 + 2? I think it is. Again,
let the termes be five, viz. 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, = 30. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo many times the greateſt is 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, = 80.
I ſay that 30 contains, ⅓ of 80, that is 26 2/1 &amp; moreover
2 ¼ of 80; (becauſe 4 × 6 = 24) that is 3 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And is it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:116063:30"/>
not ſo? is not 26 ⅔ + 3 ½ = 30? you may try it farther if
you pleaſe. My skill for yours, 'twill hold. (And thats fair
odds in a wager.) The Propoſition therefore is true thus
farre.</p>
            <p>Well but I ſaid farther; That though the Propoſition be
ſtill more then the ſubtriple; yet the exceſſe doth ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
Doe you not think that true too? if not, let's try.
if the termes be three, you ſee the proportion is as 5 to 12,
that is as ⅓ + 1 ½ to 1. if four, the proportion is as 14 to
36, that is ½ + 1 ½ to 1. if five, then as ⅓ + 1/24 to 1. &amp;c.
As we have ſeen already. But the proportion of ⅓ + 1 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to 1, is more then of ⅓ + 1 ½ to 1, and yet this more then
⅓ + 1/24 to 1. and ſo forward. But you forſooth would
faine perſwade us, that as the number of termes increaſe,
ſo the proportion increaſeth. As if the proportion of
⅓ + 1/24 to 1, were greater then that of ⅓ + 1/18 to one.
and yet would pretend to underſtand proportions, and tell
us what M. <hi>Oughtreds meaning is &amp;c.</hi> as if we did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
M. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> and his <hi>meaning</hi> too, better then you.
But, by the way, <hi>I</hi> wonder how you durſt touch M. <hi>Ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
for fear of catching the Scab. For, doubtleſſe, his book
is as much <hi>covered over with the Scah of Symbolls,</hi> as any of
mine. Which makes me think, you underſtand his and
mine much alike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> adde farther, (though not in this proportion,) that the
proportion doth ſo decreaſe, as that (though it be never
leſſe then a ſubtriple, yet) the exceſſe above the ſubtriple,
will by degrees vaniſh, as the number of termes increaſeth,
till it grow leſſe then any aſſignable quantity. and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thus: Becauſe the ſecond fraction, which with ⅓
makes up the antecedent of the proportion, whoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is 1; doth proportionally decreaſe, as the number
of termes doth increaſe. And therefore, as the number of
termes may increaſe beyond any aſſignable number: ſo may
the exceſſe decreaſe below any aſſignable quantity. And, if
the number of termes be ſuppoſed infinite, the proportion
will be infinitely near to the ſubtriple.</p>
            <p>But you tell us upon this, (and wittily doubtleſſe, as
you ſuppoſe, by a ſly tranſition from the phraſe <hi>infinitely
near,</hi> to that of <hi>eternally nearer,)</hi> you tell us, <hi>I</hi> ſay, that <hi>if the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116063:31"/>
proportions come eternally nearer and nearer to the ſubtriple,
(ſuppoſing them at firſt bigger then it,</hi> which you ſhould have
added, for elſe the caſe alters,) <hi>they muſt alſo come eternally
nearer and nearer to the ſubquadruple, and ſo to the ſubquintuple,
&amp;c.</hi> I grant it. But what then? it doth not follow, that
if it come <hi>eternally nearer</hi> to the ſubquadruple, then it will
come <hi>infinitely neare,</hi> or <hi>nearer then any aſſignable difference;</hi>
for it can never, upon that ſuppoſition, come nearer to it
then the ſubtriple. Like as the <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> doth <hi>eternally
come nearer and nearer</hi> to its <hi>Aſymptote,</hi> and conſequently,
will <hi>eternally come nearer</hi> alſo to a parallell that lyes beyond
it; but not <hi>infinitely near;</hi> for, ſince that it never paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es the
<hi>Aſymptote,</hi> though it doe <hi>eternally</hi> approach, yet it never
comes nearer to that Parallell, then the Aſymptote doth.
And indeed if it ſhould, it could not eternally approach to
the Aſymptote, but ſo ſoon as it is paſſed it, it would then
grow farther and farther from the Aſymptote, while it
doth approach to the parallell beyond it. And, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, this proportion which doth eternally approach,
and may come infinitely neer to the ſubtriple, doth indeed
eternally approach, but not come infinitely near, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadruple.
For it never comes nearer to it, then is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triple.
And I would not have you think us ſuch weak Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
or ſuch young birds, as to be caught with
ſuch chaffe, or not ſee through ſo weak a fallacy as that is.
And therefore when you inferre, that <hi>we may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thence, that the proportion, is as one to four, or one to five,
&amp;c.</hi> (ſuppoſing the number of termes infinite) <hi>as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
it is as one to three:</hi> We ſuppoſe that you would have
us think withall, either that you doe not ſpeak in good
earneſt, or elſe that you are not well in your wits: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
doubtleſſe you cannot be ſo ſimple as to believe
it.</p>
            <p>There is but one Propoſition more that you undertake
to deal with. Which is the 39, viz. this Lemma, <hi>In a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of quantities beginning with a point or cipher, and proceeding
according to the ſeries of Cubick Numbers, (as for example</hi>
0, 1, 8, 27, 64, <hi>&amp;c.) to find what proportion the whole ſeries
hath to ſo many times the greateſt.</hi> And you deal with this,
juſt as you did with the laſt. Firſt you miſ-recite it, and
then ſay 'tis falſe. <hi>I conclude,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that they have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of 1 to</hi> 4. Which is falſe, I do not ſo conclude; but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116063:31"/>
that it is <hi>more</hi> then ſo; viz. it contains a fourth part, and
moreover another aliquot part, denominable by four times
the number of termes following the cipher. That is, if the
termes be three, the proportion is as ¼ + 1/8 to 1. if four,
it is as ¼ + 1/12 to 1. if five, it is as ¼ + 1/16 to 1. And ſo
forward. And if you make triall, you ſhall find it ſo to be.
(For 0 + 1 + 8 = 9; and 8 + 8 + 8 = 24. Now
9 is equall to ¼ + 1/8 of 24, viz. to 6 + 3. So
0 + 1 + 8 + 27 = 36. and 27 + 27 + 27 + 27 =
108. Now 36 is equall to ¼ + 1/12 of 108, viz. to
27 + 9. So 0 + 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100; and 64 +
64 + 64 + 64 + 64 = 320. Now 100 is equall to
1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> + 1/16 of 320, viz. to 80 + 20. And ſo of the reſt.)
If you think it to be otherwiſe; ſhew, if you can, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to the contrary. The Propoſition therefore is true;
but you had not the honeſty to report it right. (or elſe
your witts were at wooll-gathering.) And ſo of all thoſe
five propoſitions which you have taken to taske, there is
not any one faulty.</p>
            <p>And I ſhould now have done with this buſineſſe, but
that I diſcern, upon theſe two laſt Propoſitions, your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why you are ſo much out of charity with the <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
tongue.</hi> 'Tis very hard, you have told us diverſe times;
yet here, it ſeems, you mean to try what you could doe at
it. And 'tis to be hoped, you may, in time, learne the
language; for you be come to great A already. (But <hi>truly
were it not that you muſt defend your reputation,</hi> you tell us, you
ſhould not have done ſo much.) But ſuch pittifull work
doſt thou make with poor <hi>great A,</hi> and to ſo little purpoſe,
that if there were no better uſe to be made of Symbols,
then ſo, it's pitty they ſhould ever be uſed at all. And
truly, were I <hi>great A,</hi> before I would be willing to be ſo
abuſed, I ſhould wiſh my ſelfe <hi>little</hi> a, an hundred times.
Yet thus much, I confeſſe you have done: You have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced me, that you have reaſon not to be much in
love with Symbols. For to what purpoſe? ſince you can
neither uſe, nor underſtand them. And truly, upon this
very account, I am apt to think, that much of your 13

A very fine way of confutation; and with much caſe.
<hi>You have not the patience to examine it,</hi> (that is, in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,

<hi>I</hi> make no uſe of any ſuch poſition, <hi>I</hi> give you leave either

            <p>But, mee thinks, it begins unluckyly. Before you fall to
work with <hi>Elenchus;</hi> you traverſe your ground, that you may
take it to the beſt advantage: and diſtinguiſh, between faults
of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and faults of <hi>Negligence,</hi> (pag. 9.) you tell us

you are very good at) are but <hi>faults of negligence and humane

(a buſineſſe of ill <hi>Omen</hi> in the beginning of a Combate;)
that when you ſhall be forced to quit your ground, you

            <p>My <hi>Elenchus,</hi> as I then told you, begins at firſt with
ſome lighter skirmiſhes, ſhewing how unhandſome ſome of
your Definitions and Diſtributions are, giving inſtance in
a few; which though faults had enough, yet are but ſmall
ones in compariſon of thoſe greater which follow, in falſe
Propoſitions and Demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>I begin with that of Chap. 8. § 12. Where you define a
<hi>line,</hi> a <hi>length,</hi> a <hi>point,</hi> in this manner. <hi>If when a Body is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
its magnitude (though it alwaies have ſome) be not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
the way it makes is called a</hi> Line, <hi>or one ſingle dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the ſpace through which it paſſeth is called</hi> Length; <hi>and the
Body it ſelfe a</hi> Point. But what if a Body be not moved?
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there then neither Point, nor Line, nor Length? A <hi>Point</hi>
there may be, which is not a <hi>Body,</hi> much leſſe <hi>A Body moved:</hi>
and a <hi>Line,</hi> or <hi>Length,</hi> through which no body paſſeth:
And therefore the definitions are not good, becauſe not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116063:33"/>
reciprocall. The Axis of the Earth, is a <hi>Line,</hi> and that line
hath its <hi>Length;</hi> yet doe I not believe that any Body doth,
or ever did, paſſe directly from the one to the other Pole,
to deſcribe that Line. The notion therefore of <hi>Motion</hi> or
<hi>Body moved,</hi> I then ſaid, was wholly extrinſecall and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
to the notion of <hi>Line,</hi> or <hi>Length,</hi> or of a <hi>Point;</hi> no
waies eſſentiall or neceſſary to it, or to the underſtanding
of it: and that therefore it was not convenient, to clog
the definitions of theſe, with the notion of that.</p>
            <p>To this you anſwer, (having waved firſt, what you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
as from the example of Euclide,) That, <hi>how ever it
may be to others, it was fit for you to define a Line by Motion.</hi>
And <hi>I</hi> doe acquieſſe in that Anſwer. For, though it would
not become any man elſe ſo to define it; yet it becomes M.
<hi>Hobs</hi> very well; as well agreeing with his accurateneſſe in
other things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſaid farther, That</hi> the diſtance of two points though resting,
was a Length, as well as the meaſure of a paſſage, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the notion of a body moved, not neceſſary to the definition of
Length.) <hi>To which you anſwer, that</hi> the diſtance of the two
ends of a thread wound up into a Clew, is not the length of the
thread. <hi>Much to the purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I asked, <hi>Whoever defined a Line to be a Body?</hi> And you tell
mee, <hi>you take it for an honour to be the firſt that doe ſo.</hi> And
you may, for ought I know, have alſo the honour to be the
laſt. And as to that long rant againſt Euclide; That if <hi>a
Point have no parts,</hi> and ſo <hi>no magnitude;</hi> A <hi>Line</hi> can <hi>have no
breadth,</hi> nor <hi>can be drawn</hi> (mechanically you mean;) and
<hi>then there is not in Euclide one Propoſition demonſtrated, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable.</hi>
We doe not think, that your aſſeveration a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
argument, more than we take a word of your mouth
to be a ſlander; but deſire ſome better proofe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
before we aſſent to it. You tell us elſe where, that
<hi>A Point is to Magnitude, as a ciphar is to Number</hi> (cap. 16
art. 20.) And yet <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe you will not ſay that, <hi>unleſſe a
Ciphar have ſome multitude,</hi> as well as a Point ſome Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<hi>there is not in Euclide any one Propoſition demonſtrated.</hi>
And to the ſame purpoſe is that Cap. 14. § 16. <hi>An angle of
contingence, if compared with an angle ſimply ſo called how little
ſo ever, hath ſuch proportion to it, as a point to a Line, that is,
(neque rationem, neque quantitatem ullam,) no proportion, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
quantity at all.</hi> Which how well it agrees with your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116063:34"/>
doctrines, it concerns you to ſee to, (for if a <hi>Point
to a Line, have no proportion nor any quantity at all,</hi> then is it
not a Part thereof;) and how little this comes ſhort of
what you ſo often rant at, as making a Point to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas in the place cited (both in Latine and
Engliſh) you thus define; <hi>The Way</hi> (of the Body ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
<hi>is called a Line, or one ſingle Dimenſion; and the Space
through which it paſſeth, is called Length.</hi> I argued, that <hi>Length,</hi>
doubtleſſe, <hi>was one ſingle dimenſion;</hi> and therefore, if <hi>one
ſingle dimenſion,</hi> as in your definition, be the ſame with <hi>Line;</hi>
then <hi>Length</hi> will be a <hi>Line,</hi> and not therefore need a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
definition. Now, to help the matter, in your <hi>Leſſons;</hi>
you define thus, <hi>The Way is called a Line; and the ſpace gone
over by that motion, Length or one ſingle dimenſion.</hi> Whence
my argument is yet farther inforced, If <hi>one ſingle dimenſion</hi>
ſignify the ſame with <hi>Line,</hi> (as in your Book;) and alſo
the ſame with <hi>Length,</hi> (as in your Leſſon;) then <hi>Line</hi> and
<hi>Length</hi> ſignify with <hi>you</hi> the ſame thing; &amp; therefore with <hi>you,</hi>
ſhould not have had two diſtinct and different definitions.
Which I take to be <hi>ad hominem,</hi> a good argument. You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that to ſay <hi>Line is Length, proceeds from want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Engliſh.</hi> It may be ſo. But what's this to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your Definitions? where thoſe two words are made
equivalent. Yet farther, chap. 12. parag. 1. <hi>there are,</hi> ſay
you, <hi>three dimenſions, Line (or Length,) Superficies, and Solid.</hi>
where again Line and Length are made the ſame. Now
whether or no <hi>Line be Length,</hi> or whether it be <hi>for want of
underſtanding Engliſh</hi> that you affirme it, it concernes you
to cleare; for 'tis you, not I, that affirme it ſo to
be.</p>
            <p>Your next definition is of <hi>Equall Bodies;</hi> which you thus
define, <hi>Equall Bodies, are thoſe which may poſſeſſe the ſame
place.</hi> Againſt which definition J objected, That you
ſhould rather define a thing, by <hi>what it is,</hi> then by <hi>what it
may be:</hi> That the notion of <hi>Place,</hi> was wholly extrinſecall
to the notion of <hi>Equality;</hi> for Time, Tone, Numbers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
and many other quantities are capable of Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without any connotation of Place; and the notion of
Equality in them, is the ſame notion with that of Equality
in Bodies; (elſe how can you ſay, that two Equall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and two Equall Bodies, are <hi>in the ſame Proportion;)</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:116063:34"/>
And therefore, That one good definition of <hi>Equality,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls,</hi>
in generall; had been much better, then ſo many
particulars, of Equall <hi>Bodies,</hi> Equall <hi>Magnitudes,</hi> Equall
<hi>Motions,</hi> Equall <hi>Times,</hi> Equall <hi>Swiftneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. as you here
bring; and yet, when you have all done, there be a great
many more <hi>Equalls,</hi> which you leave undefined: (And
your bare aſſertion, <hi>That there is no Subject of Quantity, or of
Equality, or of any other Accident, but Body,</hi> doth not help the
matter at all; for we are not bound to take your word for
it:) That, if you would needs mention place, you ſhould
rather have defined them by the place they <hi>have,</hi> then
what they <hi>may have;</hi> &amp; ſo, defined thoſe bodies to be <hi>Equall,</hi>
which <hi>do</hi> poſſeſſe Equall places, rather then, which <hi>may</hi>
poſſeſſe the ſame place: That a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> remaining a <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid,</hi>
may be Equall to a <hi>Cube;</hi> yet cannot, remaining a
Pyramid, poſſeſſe the place of that Cube: Or, if you will,
That a <hi>Pyramidall Atome,</hi> though ſo Adamantine as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any tranſmutation, (as thoſe who teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

no leſſe eſſentiall to a Man; then the poſſibility of being in the
ſame Place, is eſſentiall to Equall Bodies.</hi> And truly J am of
that opinion. J think it every way as Poſſible for <hi>for any

this.</p>

               <hi>You adde, That</hi> there is no man (beſide ſuch Egregious Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians

but by meaſure: And, as for liquid bodies, &amp;c. by putting them
one after another into the ſame veſſell, that is to ſay, into the

            <p>I objected farther, That it is not yet agreed amongſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
(and your authority will not decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,)
whether or no, the ſame body may not, by <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> (words underſtood by other men,
though <hi>you underſtand them not,)</hi> ſometimes poſſeſſe a bigger,
ſome times a leſſer place. We ſee, that the ſame Air in the
head of a weather-glaſſe, doth ſometimes poſſeſſe a bigger,
ſometimes a leſſer part of the glaſſe, according as the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is cold or hot, and you cannot deny, (what ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

p. 144. l. 27. (or in the Engliſh, p. 316. l. 34.) Now if it
be true, that the ſame body doth, or poſſible, that it may,
poſſeſſe, ſome time a bigger, ſometime a leſſe ſpace, (as
thoſe who deny <hi>Vacuum</hi> doe generally affirme,) then, by
your definition, the ſame body (I doe not ſay may poſſibly
become, but) at preſent is both bigger, and leſſe, and equall
to it ſelfe: Becauſe it hath at preſent a poſſibility of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
hereafter both a larger place, by Rarefaction, and a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
place, by condenſation, than now it doth. And ſo you,
by determining the equality or inequality of Bodies, not
by the place they have, but by ſuch place as poſſibly they
may have (upon any ſuppoſed metamorphoſis or tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,)
doe confound Bigger, and Leſſe, and Equall, and
ſo take away the whole foundation of Mathematicks: For
if there be no difference between <hi>Bigger, Leſſe,</hi> and <hi>Equall,</hi>
there is no roome either for <hi>Mathematicks</hi> or <hi>Meaſure.</hi> But,
whether that opinion of Rarefaction and Condenſation be
true or not: yet ſince you cannot deny, but that it is at leaſt
a conſiderable controverſy, and, by men as wiſe, and as

yea and a Controverſy not belonging to <hi>Mathematicks</hi> but

it was not wiſdome to hang the whole weight of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,

            <p>To which you reply onely this, (which is eaſy to ſay)

Magnitude is equall, or greater, or leſſer, then another, when the

I ſaid, muſt bear one of theſe two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enſes, either, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Bodies,</hi> or <hi>Bodies equally great,</hi> are of <hi>equall greatneſſe,</hi>
(which is no very profound notion:) or elſe, that the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes,</hi>
towlt the <hi>lines, ſuperficies,</hi> &amp;c. or at leaſt, the <hi>length,
bredth, &amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Equall bodies,</hi> is <hi>Equall,</hi> (taking the words
for a definition of Equall Lines, Equall Superficies, &amp;c) and
this, I ſaid, was <hi>manifeſtly falſe:</hi> for no bodies may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
whoſe length, breadth, ſuperficies, &amp;c. are unequall.
You ſay now, that you meant the former, (and I cannot
contradict it, for you know your own meaning beſt, yet
you muſt give me leave to think:) and ſo leave us without
any definition of Equall <hi>Lines, Plaines,</hi> or <hi>Superficies</hi>
Which yet, conſidering how oft you are afterwards to.
make uſe of, might have been as worthy of a definition,
as ſome of thoſe equalls that you have defined.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph, Cap. 8. parag. 14. you undertake
to prove, that <hi>one and the ſame Body, is alwaies of one and the
ſame magnitude,</hi> and not bigger at one time then another,
or at one time fill a bigger place, than it doth at another
time. Let's heare how you prove it (for, by what we heard
but now, you are much concerned to make good proofe of
it, becauſe if there be a poſſibility of poſſeſſing at any time
a bigger or leſſe place than now it doth, than it is, by your
definition, at preſent bigger or leſſe than it ſelfe.) Your
proofe is in theſe words, <hi>For ſeeing a Body, and the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and the Place thereof, cannot be comprehended in the mind
otherwiſe than as they are coincident,</hi> (obſerve therefore, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116063:36"/>
this argument doth no more prove, that a Body cannot
change its <hi>Magnitude,</hi> than that it cannot change its <hi>Place,</hi>
for you make Place as much coincident with Body, as you
doe Magnitude, and the argument proceeds equally of
both:) <hi>if any Body be underſtood to be at reſt, that is, to remain
in the ſame place during ſome time, and the Magnitude thereof
be in one part of the time greater, and in another part leſſe, that
Bodies place, which is one and the ſame, will be coincident ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
with greater, ſometime with leſſe magnitude, that is, the
ſame Place will be greater and leſſe than it ſelfe, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi>
This is your whole proof to a word. Now this, I
told you, is no ſufficient proof, becauſe it proves only that
<hi>a Body</hi> doth not change its quantity <hi>ſo long as it is at reſt,</hi> and
doth <hi>preciſely keep the ſame place;</hi> (which no body doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.)
And, pray look upon the Argument once again:
doth it prove any more than ſo? But that which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to prove was, that it doth <hi>never</hi> change its magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but hath <hi>alwaies the ſame,</hi> as well when its place is
altered, as when it remains in the ſame place: (for, J ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
you will not deny, but that a Body may change its
place.) Thoſe that hold the contrary opinion, doe not
ſay that a body doth change its greatneſſe while it doth
preciſely keep the ſame place; but that, with change of
place, it may change its dimenſions too: And to this, if
you would have ſaid any thing, you ſhould have applied
your argument. And is not this then a juſt exception to
your argument? Will this argument hold, think you, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Body doth not change its magnitude ſo long as it keeps
preciſely the ſame place: Therefore, it never changeth its mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,</hi>
but hath alwaies the ſame? This argument hath
no appearance of conſequence, but only upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>a Body doth alwaies keep preciſely the ſame place.</hi>
And, then, I confeſſe, the Argument looks like an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in this forme, <hi>So long as a body keeps preciſely one and
the ſame place, it hath preciſely one &amp; the ſame Magnitude: But a
Body doth alwaies keep preciſely one and the ſame Place: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath alwaies one and the ſame Magnitude.</hi> And if this
be your argument, we allow the form, but deny the matter
of it, and ſay, the Minor ought to be proved. For we are
of opinion, that it is poſſible, for the ſame Body, not to be
alwaies in the ſame place. If you think otherwiſe, pray
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116063:36"/>
prove it. For 'till that be proved, your preſent argument
is to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sed rem ita per ſe manifeſtam, demonſtrare opus non eſset, &amp;c.
But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>a thing of it ſelfe ſo manifeſt, would need no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
at all,</hi> (a fine facile way of Demonſtration, that
which you know not how to prove needs no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
<hi>but that you ſee there are ſome, whoſe opinion concerning
Bodies and their magnitude, is, that Body may exiſt ſeparated
from its magnitude,</hi> (no not ſo, but that it may <hi>change</hi> its
magnitude, For they doe no more believe that it can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
without Magnitude, than that it can exſiſt without a
Figure: It cannot be but that a finite Body muſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſome figure, though not alwaies the ſame: and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſome Magnitude, but whether alwaies the ſame or
no, you ſhould have proved if you could:) <hi>and have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or leſſe magnitude beſtowed upon it;</hi> (as well as different
figures:) <hi>Making uſe of this principle for the explication of the
nature of Rarum, and Denſum.</hi> Since therefore you know
there are that do ſo; why did not you, (at leaſt in your
Engliſh Editition, after you had notice of the weakneſſe
of your Latine Argument) bring ſome good Argument to
overthrow that opinion; and not content your ſelfe to ſay
that <hi>it is ſo manifeſt of it ſelfe, as that it needed no demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Eſpecially, (as I then told you) ſince <hi>you doe not allow
that Euclide may aſſume to himſelfe</hi> gratis <hi>without demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That the whole is greater than its part;</hi> (thoſe were my
words, though you recite them a little otherwiſe.)</p>
            <p>But you ſay, <hi>I know this to be untrue,</hi> that is, <hi>I</hi> lye: My
words were theſe; <hi>Non interim Euclidi permittis, ut citra de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrationem
hoc ſibi gratis aſſumat, Totum eſſe majus ſua par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:</hi>
that is, <hi>You do not allow it Euclide, that he may without
Demonſtration aſſume to himſelfe, or challenge, That the whole
is greater then its part.</hi> Now let your own words be judge,
who is the lyar, you or I. Cap. 6. artic. 12, 13. <hi>The
whole method of Demonſtration,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is Syntheticall,—
beginning with Principles, or primary Propoſitions. Now ſuch
Principles are nothing but Definitions,</hi>—And, <hi>Beſides
Definitions, there is no other Propoſition that ought to be called
Primary or</hi> (ſi paulo ſeverius agere volumus) <hi>be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number of Principles. For thoſe Axioms of Euclide, ſeeing
they may be demonſtrated, are no Principles of Demonſtration.</hi>
And accordingly art. 16. you define <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116063:37"/>
be <hi>a ſyllogiſme, or ſeries of ſyllegiſmes, derived and continued
from the Definitions of names, to the laſt concluſion.</hi> And
parag. 17. You require to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> That, <hi>the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of all Syllogiſmes be demonſtrated from the firſt Definitions.</hi>
(And the like cap. 20. parag. 6. diverſe times.) So that
theſe Axioms, being no <hi>Definitions,</hi> nor any <hi>Principles of
Demonſtration,</hi> no Demonſtration can take riſe from them,
nor can they be otherwiſe aſſumed in demonſtration, than
as they are themſelves deduced or demonſtrated from
Definitions. And doth not this come home to what I ſaid?
And cap. 8. parag. 25. <hi>Of which Axioms (omitting the reſt)
I will only</hi> (ſay you) <hi>demonſtrate this one, The whole is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any part thereof. To the end that the Reader may know,
that thoſe Axioms are not indemonſtrable, and therefore not
Principles of Demonſtration.</hi> And yet again <hi>Leſſ.</hi> 1. p. 4. <hi>As
for the commonly received third ſort of Principles, called Common
Notions, they are Principles only by permiſſion of him that is a
Diſciple; who being ingenuous, and coming not to cavill but to
learn, is content to receive them (though demonſtrable) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their demonſtration.</hi> And again pag. 9. you exclude <hi>thoſe
common notions called Axioms,</hi> from the number of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>as being demonſtrable from the definitions of their termes,</hi>
acknowledging no other <hi>Principles,</hi> but <hi>Definitions,</hi> and
<hi>Poſtulata,</hi> (thoſe the only principles of Demonſtration;
theſe of Conſtruction.) If therefore they be <hi>no Principles of
Demonſtration;</hi> if only <hi>principles by permiſſion of the Diſciple,</hi>
and only in curteſy; then, though your ſelfe poſſibly may
he ſo gracious or liberall, as to admit of them without their
demonſtration; Yet the Teacher <hi>cannot,</hi> without this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<hi>aſſume to himſelfe, or require them to be granted, as he may
doe Principles, without Demonſtration.</hi> 'Twas not I therefore
was the lyar, when I ſaid, <hi>You doe not allow that Euclide may
aſſume to himſelfe</hi> gratis, <hi>or require to be granted, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
That the whole is greater than its part.</hi> For 'tis
but in courteſy, if you grant it him, as you may any other
true Propoſition, and only upon ſuppoſition that it may be
demonſtrated: upon which ſuppoſition, you may alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all the Propoſitions in Euclide, for they may be all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>

            <p>WEE ſhall next conſider what you have to ſay in
defenſe of your 11 and 13 Chapters, concerning
Proportion.</p>
            <p>And here after a freak; and then a rant againſt Euclide;
you have a large diſcourſe about <hi>Proportion;</hi> p. 15, 16. The
ſumme of which, ſo farre as is to the purpoſe, is this, That
<hi>there betwo kinds of Proportion,</hi> (as the word is now adaies
taken;) <hi>the one of which is called Arithmeticall Proportion; the
other, Geometricall Proportion: And as the Quotient gives us a
meaſure of the Proportion of the Dividend to the Diviſor, in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
Proportion; ſo the Remainder, after ſubtraction, is
the meaſure of Proportion Arithmeticall.</hi> Pag. 16. And thus
much is both true and clear, and to the purpoſe. And had
you but thus delivered your doctrine of Proportions, in
your Book <hi>de Corpore,</hi> I ſhould never have found fault with
it. But you, not knowing (till you learned it out of my
<hi>Elenchus,)</hi> that the Quotient did as well determine Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
Proportion, (and give name to it) as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
doth Proportion Arithmeticall, were fain to
blunder on as well as you could, without it: and put your
ſelfe upon a great many unhandſome ſhifts, and which will
not hold water, to give account, even of Geometricall
Proportion, from the Remainder or difference, which was
not to be done otherwiſe then by the Quotient, as you
here clearly confeſſe; For <hi>the Meaſure,</hi> you ſay, <hi>of Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
progreſſion, is</hi> (not the Remainder, whether abſolutely
or comparatively conſidered, but) <hi>the Quotient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before you come thus farre; you tell us by the way,
That <hi>I ſay, that you make proportion to conſiſt in the Remainder,
and that I make it conſiſt in the Quotient.</hi> As to the former
of theſe, I did not then <hi>ſay,</hi> that <hi>you make proportion to conſiſt

you of them, are yet uncorrected in your Engliſh; <hi>ſeeing (by
the fifth Article of the precedent Chapter,) the proportion of
two unequall magnitudes conſiſts in their difference, &amp;c.</hi> And
again, <hi>the Proportion of unequalls EG, EF, is quantity; for the
difference GF, in which it conſiſts is quantity.</hi> Now when,
you ſay in expreſſe words, as in the places cited, <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

as you ſay I doe, that <hi>you make Proportion to conſiſt in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder;</hi>
and that abſurdly enough. And then, J pray, to
whom belong thoſe reproaches, that are ſo oft in your
mouth, as if ſomebody did affirme, that <hi>Proportion</hi> is a <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
an <hi>Abſolute quantity,</hi> &amp;c? is it not your ſelfe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

And is not then, <hi>that</hi> (by your own law p. 10,) <hi>in your ſelfe
intolerable, which you cannot tolerate in another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you adde farther, that <hi>I ſay, that I make it to conſiſt in
the Quotient.</hi> And is not this abominably falſe? J neither ſay
ſo, nor doe ſo, nor did J give any ground at all for any
man (that is in his witts) to believe J did. My words were
theſe, <hi>Videmus igitur Rationis aeſtimationem eſſe (ſecundum
Te) penes Reſiduum, non penes Quotum, &amp; Subductione, non
Diviſione quaerendam eſſe.</hi> (And what reaſon J had to ſay
ſo, they that conſult the place will ſee.) Now could any
man (who had not a great confidence that his Engliſh
Reader underſtands no Latine) be ſo impudent as to ſay,
that in thoſe words, <hi>I ſay, you make Proportion to conſiſt in the
Remainder; and I, in the Quotient?</hi> Can any man, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands,
though but a little Latine, (if he be not either
out of his witts, or halfe a ſleep,) think that theſe words
<hi>Rationis aeſtimatio eſt penes Quotum,</hi> (that is, <hi>the Proportion is
to be eſtimated according to the Quotient,</hi> or, to uſe your own
words, <hi>the quotient gives us the meaſure of the proportion,)</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:116063:38"/>
could be thus Engliſhed, <hi>proportion conſiſts in the quotient?</hi>
And that then you ſhould raile at us, quite through your
Book, for ſaying that <hi>Proportion</hi> is <hi>a certain quotient,</hi> that it is
a <hi>number,</hi> that it is an <hi>abſolute quantity,</hi> &amp;c. as if we had been
ſo ridiculous as to ſpeak like you. For, that you have ſo
ſpoken you cannot deny, (and therefore the abſurdity what
ever it be, lights upon your ſelfe:) But, to ſay, that <hi>I ſaid ſo,</hi>
or any thing to that purpoſe, till you can ſhew where I
ſaid it, J take to be, (ſo farre as a word of your mouth can
be) a <hi>manifeſt ſlander.</hi> J neither ſay ſo, nor think ſo.</p>
            <p>Now ſome men perhaps may wonder, there ſhould be ſo
great a cry and ſo little wooll; they would think perhaps,
by what you ſay, that J had ſomewhere ſaid in expreſſe
termes, that <hi>Proportion is a Quotient,</hi> or that <hi>it conſiſts
in the Quotient,</hi> or that <hi>it is a number,</hi> or <hi>an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>obs
having now ſaid it ſo often over, doth, by this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to think, that J had indeed ſaid, ſomewhere, that <hi>the
quotient was the proportion.</hi> And truly there is ſome reaſon
why he ſhould: For if he had heard any other man ſo oft
and ſo confidently affirme it, he would no doubt have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him: and why ſhould he not as well believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But moreover; It did perhaps runne in his mind, that he
had ſomewhere read ſome ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Conſiſtit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
Ratio antecedentis ad conſequens, in Differentia, hoc eſt in
ea parte majoris qua minus ab eo ſuperatur; ſive in majoris (dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto
minore) Reſiduo.</hi> Or ſuch as theſe, <hi>Ratio binarii ad qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium
eſt ternarius.</hi> Or elſe this, <hi>Ratio minoris ad majus,
Defectus; ratio majoris ad minus, Exceſſus dicitur.</hi> (And well
it might: for they are all his own words, Cap 11. parag. 3.
&amp; 5. and Cap. 12. parag. 8.) And he might think, that to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116063:39"/>
ſay thus, was all one, as to affirme <hi>Proportion</hi> to be a <hi>Number,</hi>
or an <hi>Abſolute quantity:</hi> (And truly I think ſo too.) And
that therefore the expreſſion was very abſurd; (For ſo I had
intimated to him in my <hi>Elenchus,</hi> upon this occaſion.) And
therefore (forgetting, perhaps, that they were his own
words, and not mine.) he doth (like the Woman that
called her daughter <hi>Baſtard,</hi> not minding that in ſo doing
ſhee called her ſelfe <hi>Whore,)</hi> exclaim againſt his own
words, as moſt ridiculous non-ſenſe. And who might doe
it better?</p>
            <p>Or elſe, to uſe his own compariſon, <hi>like Women of poor and
evill education, when they ſcold; amongſt whom the readieſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
word is Whore; becauſe, when they remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they think that reproach the likelieſt to be true;</hi> at leaſt,
if they be called <hi>Whore</hi> themſelves, though never ſo truly,
they will be ſure to call <hi>Whore</hi> again at all adventures, hit
or miſſe. So M. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> finding himſelfe to have been ſo
abſurd, as to make Proportion a <hi>Number,</hi> or <hi>Abſolute quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
and that I had blamed him for it; thought, perhaps,
it was poſſible I might, ſometime or other, have been as
careleſſe in my language: and therefore, however, hee'l
ſay ſo, ('tis eaſy to ſay it) and let me diſprove it.</p>
            <p>If any man, notwithſtanding all this, be not ſatisfied
that M. Hobs had reaſon to ſay as he doth; truly I cannot
help it; he muſt ſpeak for himſelfe: Theſe were the beſt
reaſons I could think of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo wee'l goe on.</p>
            <p>In your 11 Chap. parag. 3. you gave us in the Latine,
(for in the Engliſh there be ſome things altered,) this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of <hi>Proportion; Proportion is nothing elſe but the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or in equality of the Antecedent, compared with the conſequent,
according to magnitude.</hi> With this Explication, <hi>As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the proportion of Three to Two, is nothing elſe, but, that
Three, is greater then Two, by One: and the proportion of Two
to Five, is nothing elſe, but that Two, is leſſe than Five by
Three: And therefore in the proportion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequalls, the
proportion of the Leſſe to the Greater is called the Defect; and
that of the Greater to the Leſſe, the Exceſſe.</hi> And this is your
generall definition of <hi>Proportion,</hi> with the Explication of it;
and nor a particular definition of <hi>Arithmeticall Proportions,</hi>
(nor is it at all by you pretended ſo to be.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould have been ſo ordered, as at leaſt to take in <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
Proportion;</hi> For <hi>Geometricall proportion,</hi> and ſimply
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116063:39"/>
               <hi>proportion,</hi> are by your ſelfe made equivalent termes (Leſſ. 2.
p. 16. l. 25.) and <hi>this,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is onely taken notice of by the
name of Proportion:</hi> And, ſo the word is conſtantly uſed in
Euclide, and elſewhere: (And therefore you need not
wonder as you doe p. 18. l. 7, that J ſhould ſay, <hi>If Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall
Proportion, ought to be called Proportion;</hi> implying that
though now that phraſe be common, yet that it is a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the former uſe of the word; and that, according
to Euclides uſe of the word Proportion, Arithmeticall
Proportion cannot be ſo called.) Now your Definition and
Explication of Proportion, doth wholly leave out Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall
Proportion altogether, (which yet is, if not the
only, yet the more principall kind of Proportion.) For it
takes no cognizance of the Quotient at all, but only of the
Difference, the exceſſe or defect. And according to your
doctrine the Proportion of 3 to 2, is + 1, the exceſſe of 1;
and of 2 to 5, is -3, the defect of three.</p>
            <p>From this I inferred, that if the proportion of one quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
to another, be <hi>nothing elſe, but</hi> the exceſſe or defect of
this to that, (as you teach,) then <hi>where ever the exceſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is the ſame, there the proportion is the ſame; and ſo 3 to</hi> 2,
<hi>muſt have the ſame proportion that 5 hath to</hi> 4; (You ſay, p. 17.
True, the ſame Arithmeticall Proportion Very good: But
J added farther, of which you did not think fit to take
notice,) <hi>and on the contrary, where there is not the ſame defect
or the ſame exceſſe there is not the ſame proportion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
there is not the ſame proportion of 3 to 2 and of 6 to</hi> 4.
To this you have nothing to ſay, and therefore ſay nothing,
(but recite halfe my ſentence, and leave out the other
halfe:) For though, there be not the ſame <hi>Arithmeticall
Proportion</hi> (as you ſpeak) of 3 to 2, and of 6 to 4; (that is,
not the ſame exceſſe,) yet there is the ſame <hi>Geometricall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;</hi>
and that you cannot deny to be <hi>Proportion,</hi> though it
doe not come, within your definition.</p>
            <p>Now it's true, (but that's another fault, not an excuſe)
that you do not hold to this ſenſe alwaies, for in the ſame
page art. 5. (in the Latine, <hi>I</hi> mean) you do clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
what you had but now ſaid in art. 3. <hi>The proportion,</hi>
ſay you, <hi>of the Antecedent to the conſequent conſiſts in the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or Remainder, not ſimply</hi> (yes <hi>ſimply,</hi> if that be true
which you ſaid before; for if it <hi>be nothing elſe but</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that is it the difference <hi>ſimply:</hi> But if not ſimply;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116063:40"/>
how then?) <hi>but as compared with one of the termes related, &amp;c.
For though there be the ſame difference between 2 and 5, that
there is between 9 and 12, yet not the ſame Proportion.</hi> And
why not? as well as the ſame proportion between 3 and 2,
and between 4 and 5? as we heard you reply but now.
May not we as well ſay here, as you there, (Leſ. 2. p. 17.)
<hi>Is there not the ſame Arithmeticall Proportion? And is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall
proportion, proportion?</hi> But it ſeems, by this time,
you had forgotten your former expoſition, whereby in the
ſame page, your definition of <hi>Proportion</hi> muſt be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as will agree to none but <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> proportion;
now it muſt bear ſuch a ſenſe as can agree to none but <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Engliſh, <hi>I</hi> confeſſe, your Tranſlator hath a little
mended the matter, and but a little, ('tis but Coblers work
at the beſt;) But however, 'tis good to hear folks mend,
though it be but a little: it may come to ſomething in
time.</p>
            <p>But now of thoſe two ſenſes, which you have given, of
the Definition of Proportion, (oppoſite enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
one to another, though, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, you did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
therein to contradict your ſelfe,) neither of them will
ſerve your turn. For the <hi>Proportion</hi> here defined, and ſo
explicated as we have heard, is a <hi>Genus,</hi> which is, in the
beginning of your 13 Chapter, to be diſtributed into its
two <hi>Species;</hi> Proportion <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> and Proportion
<hi>Geometricall.</hi> Now take your definition of Proportion in
generall, according to which of your two expoſitions you
pleaſe, it cannot be thus diſtributed. For if Propor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on
(as you ſay chap. 11, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art. 3.) <hi>be nothing elſe but the exceſſe
or defect, &amp;c. as 3 is leſſe then 2 by</hi> 1; then it cannot agree
to Geometricall proportion, for that is ſomewhat elſe. If
it be ſuch a <hi>comparative difference,</hi> as you mention cap. 11.
art. 3. it will not agree to Arithmeticall proportion; for
according to that ſenſe, you ſay, 2 <hi>to 5, and 9 to 12, are not
in the ſame proportion. I</hi> ſay therefore, that neither of thoſe
two expoſitions, do agree to that generall notion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
which ſhall be common to both Arithmeticall and
Geometricall. And when <hi>I</hi> aske, which of the two expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
you are willing to ſtand to. <hi>Whether that of Cap.</hi> 11.
<hi>art. 3. or that of Cap, 11. art.</hi> 5. (ſhewing withall that
neither of them will ſerve your turne, for neither of them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116063:40"/>
will take in both Arithmeticall and Geometricall Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,)
you fall a raving in the beginning of your third
Leſſon, ſomething at Euclide, and ſomething at us, but
nothing to the purpoſe. And then tell us, that <hi>when you
ſay the Difference is the Proportion, by Difference, we might if
we would, have underſtood, the act of Differing.</hi> That is, wee
might underſtand, as madly as you ſpeak. Your words
were theſe, Cap. 11. art. 5. <hi>Conſiſtit autem Ratio in Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentia,
ſive Reſiduo, &amp;c. ita ratio binarii ad quinarium eſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius,
&amp;c.</hi> Would you have us underſtand <hi>Reſiduum,</hi> and
<hi>Ternarius,</hi> to be the <hi>Act of Differing?</hi> And C. 12. art. 8. <hi>Ratio
inaequaliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (EG, EF) conſiſtit in differentia GF.</hi> Would you have
us underſtand <hi>that line</hi> GF, to be the <hi>act of differing?</hi> You ſay,
<hi>we might if we would.</hi> But you'ld think us very ſimple if we
ſhould. To as good purpoſe is it, that you tell your Engliſh
Reader (for you think you may tell him any thing,) that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
ſay,</hi> that (thus much of) <hi>your Definition, Ch. 11. Art. 1. [Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is the Compariſon of two Magnitudes one to another,] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
neither with Arithmeticall nor Geometricall proportion.</hi>
For I ſaid nothing of any ſuch words, good or bad. And
'twere much if I ſhould: for I can find no ſuch words
there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the ſecond Article</hi> (chap. 13.) <hi>I note,</hi> you ſay, <hi>for a fault
in method, that after you had uſed the words, Antecedent, and
Conſequent of a Proportion, in the precedent Chapters, you now
define them.</hi> 'Tis true, I did take notice of it, but <hi>I</hi> ſaid
withall, that this was but a ſmall fault in compariſon of
many others. But what if <hi>I</hi> did? <hi>You do not believe,</hi> you ſay
<hi>that I ſpake this againſt my knowledge.</hi> No; why ſhould you
for you know 'tis true. Have you not uſed the words ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times before in the precedent chapters? And doe you
not define them here? And is not this a fault in Method?
Do Mathematicians uſe, when they have taken a Terme for
two or three chapters together, to be of a known ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſufficiently underſtood, come at length to define
it? you ſay, <hi>you had before defined it chap. 11. art.</hi> 3. 'Tis true
you had there defined <hi>the Antecedent and Conſequent of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatives;</hi>
(which definitions might have ſerved well enough
for the <hi>Antecedent and conſequent in Proportions too,</hi> for thoſe
are Correlatives, and you need not have brought any new
ones.) But where was <hi>my overſight?</hi> Did <hi>I</hi> deny this? <hi>I</hi> did
not blame you for <hi>uſing the words before you had defined them,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:116063:41"/>
(nor would <hi>I</hi> have blamed you, if they had not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
at all;) But for <hi>defining them after you had thus long uſed
them.</hi> For, if they had now, ever ſince the beginning of the
11 Chapter, been taken for words of a known ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as ſuch frequently uſed, (which you do not deny,
and your definitions at that place do but aggravate, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate,
this charge,) then, <hi>I</hi> ſay, it was immethodicall
and ſuperfluous to define them in the 13 chapter. Nor was
it my <hi>overſight</hi> to ſay ſo. And the like impertinent anſwer
you give p. 51. where <hi>I</hi> blamed you (not for omitting in
the 19 chapter, but) for defining in the 24 chapter, thoſe
termes which were of frequent uſe in the 19 chapter. But
wee go on.</p>
            <p>You tell us, Chap. 13. art. 3. <hi>That the proportion of Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
is Quantity, but that of Equality is not.</hi> Which <hi>I</hi> ſaid
was very abſurd; and that the one did no more belong to
the Praedicament of Quantity than the other; and that it is
to bee, of both equally, either denied or affirmed: And
that your argument for it, (That <hi>One equality is not greater
or leſſe then another; but of proportions of inequality, one may be
more or leſſe unequall:)</hi> might as well conclude that <hi>Oblique
angles,</hi> be quantities, but not <hi>Right angles,</hi> for theſe be all
equall, and equally Right; but not thoſe. For anſwer to
this, you fall a ranting at <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> at <hi>Praedicaments,</hi> and the
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gick Schooles,</hi> &amp;c. And then you tell us the <hi>Greater</hi> and
<hi>Leſſer</hi> cannot be attributed to <hi>Right Angles,</hi> becauſe a Right
Angle is a <hi>Quantity determined,</hi> (as though the quantity of
the <hi>Proportion of Equality were not ſo too.)</hi> What you alledge
out of <hi>Merſennus,</hi> was but his miſtake. Compoſition of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is a work of Multiplication, not of Addition, as
appears by the definition of it 5 <hi>d</hi> 6. and to argue, that
<hi>Proportion of equality is as Nothing, becauſe in compoſition of
Proportions it doth not increaſe or diminiſh another proportion;</hi>
is but as to conclude that, 1, <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, is Nothing, becauſe in
Multiplication it doth neither increaſe nor diminiſh the quantity
multiplyed thereby.</hi> But of this miſtake of Merſennus, I have
ſpoken already in the end of another Treatiſe, already
Printed, againſt <hi>Meibomius;</hi> and vindicated <hi>Clavius</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
from what both <hi>Merſennus</hi> and <hi>Meibomius</hi> allege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
            <p>To the fourth Article, where you define <hi>Greater</hi> and
<hi>Leſſer Proportion;</hi> I ſaid nothing (becauſe it were endleſſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116063:41"/>
to note all the faults I ſee) though thoſe definitions are
liable enough to cenſure. <hi>Greater Proportion,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is the
proportion of a greater Antecedent to the ſame Conſequent, or of
the ſame Antecedent to a leſſe Conſequent.</hi> And <hi>Leſſe Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the proportion of a leſſe Antecedent to the ſame Conſequent,
or of the ſame Antecedent to a greater conſequent.</hi> Yet we know,
that the proportion <hi>of an Ell to a Yard,</hi> is leſſe then that <hi>of a
Pottle to a Pint,</hi> (and this therefore greater then that,)
though neither the Antecedents nor the Conſequents, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſame, or Equall, or Homogeneous.</p>
            <p>To the 5 and 6 Articles, where you define <hi>the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi>
I ſaid Firſt, that, had Proportion been well defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before, you might have ſpared theſe definitions of <hi>the
ſame proportion.</hi> For having before defined (as well as you
could) what is <hi>Proportion</hi> (both <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> and <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall;)</hi>
and withall told us, art. 4. that <hi>by the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
was meant <hi>Equall proportions;</hi> and having alſo defined
before (after your faſhion) what are <hi>Equalls</hi> chap. 8. and
what is the <hi>Same</hi> chap. 11. Why ſhould you think (if thoſe
definitions were ſuch as they ſhould have been) that wee
needed another definition of the <hi>Same, or Equall Proportions?</hi>
But, ſince you were reſolved to doe works of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>I</hi> ask why, having defined the <hi>ſame Arithmeticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
art: 5. by the Equality of the <hi>Differences;</hi> you did
not alſo define the <hi>ſame Geometricall Proportion,</hi> art. 6, by
the Equality of the <hi>Quotients?</hi> For by the <hi>Same,</hi> you ſay,
you mean <hi>Equall,</hi> art. 4. Now univerſally <hi>all quantities
are Equall, that are meaſured by the ſame number of the ſame
Meaſures</hi> (Leſſ: 1 p: 4.) and therefore thoſe are the ſame or
equall <hi>Proportions,</hi> which have the ſame or equall <hi>Meaſures:</hi>
And you know now (though perhaps you did not then)
that <hi>as the Quotient gives us a meaſure of the Proportion in
Geometricall Proportion, ſo the Remainder is the Meaſure
of Proportion Arithmeticall.</hi> (Leſ: 2. p. 16.) And therefore,
as, in the one, you define the ſame or equall proportion,
<hi>by the Equality of the Remainder;</hi> ſo you ſhould in the other,
<hi>by the equality of the Quotient,</hi> (that is, in both places by the
equality of its meaſure:) And not have brought us ſuch an
imbrangled definition as this. <hi>viz: One Geometricall progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the ſame with another, when a cauſe in equall times tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
equall effects, determining the proportion, may be aſſigned
the ſame in both,</hi> or as your Engliſh hath it, <hi>when the ſame
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116063:42"/>
cauſe producing equall effects in equall times, determines both the
proportions.</hi> So that, to prove, that 4 to 2, and 6 to 3, are
in the ſame Geometricall proportion, we muſt call in the
help of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>Velocity,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> &amp;c.
which are wholly extrinſecall to it; and why, but becauſe,
forſooth, <hi>there is no effect in Nature which is not produced in
Time by Motion,</hi> (as though ſome <hi>Motion,</hi> in ſome <hi>Time</hi> or
other, had made this to be a true Propoſition, that 4 is the
double of 2: and therefore if we cannot find what motion
<hi>did</hi> make it ſo, we muſt imagine ſome that <hi>might have</hi> made
it.) I need not tell you, that, if this be a good reaſon, you
ſhould upon the ſame account, have found out as bad a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
for <hi>the ſame Arithmeticall proportion:</hi> (for that 8 to
6, and 12 to 10, are in the ſame Arithmeticall proportion,
is, doubtleſſe, as much as that other of Geometricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<hi>an effect which nature hath at ſome Time or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Motion.)</hi> But, ſince you have waved this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature in the definition of the <hi>ſame Arithmeticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
which you define by the <hi>equality of the Remainders;</hi>
I ſaid, it <hi>might have been expected,</hi> that you might have done
ſo in the definition of the <hi>ſame Geometricall proportion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and
accordingly defined it, by the <hi>Equality of the Quotients.</hi> But
you are very angry with me, for ſaying, <hi>It might have
been expected.</hi> And truly I could almoſt find in my heart to
confeſſe that this was a fault. For though it <hi>might have
been expected</hi> from <hi>another man;</hi> yet it was not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from M. <hi>Hobs;</hi> for his witt is not like the witt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, <hi>He is the Firſt</hi> (he tells us) <hi>that hath made the
grounds of Geometry firm and coherent.</hi> But why was it not to
be exſpected? Becauſe, you ſay, <hi>It is impoſſible to define</hi> (Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall)
<hi>proportion univerſally by comparing Quotients. (Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,</hi>
I confeſſe, is a hard word; but yet, <hi>I</hi> hope, <hi>it may
be.)</hi> But why is it <hi>impoſſible?</hi> more than it is impoſſible to
define <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> proportion univerſally by comparing
of <hi>Remainders?</hi> Becauſe, forſooth, <hi>In quantities incommenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there may be the ſame proportion, where nevertheleſſe there is
no Quotient:</hi> (Very good! But why no quotient?) <hi>for quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
there is none but in Aliquot parts.</hi> (Gooder, and gooder!)
But, <hi>I</hi> pray, is not A / B as good a Quotient, as A-B is a
Remainder? whether the quantities be commenſurable, or
Incommenſurable? No, you ſay; <hi>For ſetting their Symbols
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116063:42"/>
one above another with a line between, doth not make a Quotient.</hi>
But why not? as well, as ſetting their Symbols one <hi>after</hi>
another, with a line between, makes a <hi>Remainder?</hi> For, if
the quantities be inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menſurable, the Remainder is no more
explicable in Rationall numbers, then is the quotient. If
from 3 you ſubduct √2, the Remainder is but 3 − <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2.
If you divide 3 by √2, the quotient is 3/√2;. And is not
his as much a Quotient, as that a Remainder? and as well
deſigned? Yet this is all you have to ſay to the buſineſſe:
The reſt is but Ranting, or vapouring. But, however, <hi>we
are much deceived,</hi> you tell us, if we think, <hi>with pricking of
Bladders to let out their vapour;</hi> for <hi>we ſee,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we make

            <p>Wee began, as I ſaid, with ſlighter skirmiſhings; about
Definitions &amp;c. The skirmiſh now growes hotter; when
I charge you with falſe propoſitions and demonſtrations;
and that you be touched to the quick, we may gueſſe by
the loud out-cry; <hi>In objecting againſt the thirteenth, and

                  </gap>wrayd,</hi> was your own,
viz. that you had given us falſe demonſtrations &amp;c. and
then is it not <hi>ſpightfully</hi> done of us to diſcover them?
Well; let's ſee what 'tis that makes you cry out ſo fiercely.</p>
            <p>The propoſition is this, <hi>Of three quantities that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to one another,</hi> (ſuppoſe AB, AC,
AD; or 6, 3, 1;) <hi>the proportion of
<figure/>
the firſt to the ſecond, and of the ſecond to
the third taken together, are equall to the
proportion of the firſt to the third.</hi> That is, ſaid I, <hi>The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
compounded of that of the firſt to the ſecond,</hi> (ſuppoſe
6 to 3. which is double,) <hi>and that of the ſecond to the third</hi>
(viz. 3 to 1, which is treble,) <hi>is equall to that of the firſt to
the third,</hi> (viz. 6 to 1, which is ſextuple.) And was not
this your meaning? (I am ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e 'tis either thus or worſe)
This compoſition, I ſaid, was ſuch as Euclide defines 5 <hi>d</hi> 6;
which is done by <hi>multiplying</hi> the quantities of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
viz. 6/3 × 3/1 = 6/1, (not by <hi>adding</hi> them; for
ſo 6/3 + 3/1 = 2/1 + 3/1 = 5/1.) Did I not explaine your
meaning right? I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>meant no hurt in ſaying this was your
meaning; for the meaning was a good meaning; and
the proporſion ſo meant, is a good proporſion;
(but, if you mean otherwiſe, the propoſition is falſe:)
and, doubtleſſe, 'twas a good meaning too, when you meant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116063:43"/>
to demonſtrate it; (all the miſchiefe was, you could not do
what, you meant to doe.) If this be your meaning (as J am
ſure it is or ſhould be,) what is it that troubles you?
You doe not like the word <hi>Compoſition:</hi> that's one thing.
Well then let it be called <hi>Addition</hi> for once, J told you then,
J would not content for the name; (but you know 'tis
ſuch an Additon of Proportions, as is made by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the quantities; as appeares by the very words of
the definition 5 <hi>d</hi> 6) Then you doe not like that J ſhould
ſay <hi>the proportion of 6 to 3. is double; and that of 3 to 1, treble.
Tell me</hi> (ſay you) <hi>egregious Profeſſors, How is 6 to 3 double
proportion?</hi> The anſwer is eaſy, (though perhaps you will
not like it;) The proportion of 6 to 3, or 2 to 1, is that
which is commonly called <hi>Double;</hi> and that of 3 to 1, is
is commonly called <hi>Treble;</hi> And if you will not believe
me, pray believe your own words, <hi>Corp. pag. 110. l.</hi> 5, 6.
<hi>Ratio 2 ad 1. vocatur Dupla; et 3 ad 1 Tripla.</hi> You tell us
then, <hi>We may obſerve that Euclide never diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Double and Duplicate</hi> (no more then other Greek
writers do between <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) <hi>one word</hi> (you
ſay, <hi>ſerves him every where for either.</hi> You might as well bid
us put out our eyes; or elſe believe that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the
ſame words. Perhaps you thought ſo when you wrote
your booke in Latine; but, ſince that time you have been
better inſtructed, and have learned at length to diſtinguiſh
between Double and Duplicate, as we ſhall heare anon.
But let's goe on. All this hitherto hath been but ſcuffling,
and little to the purpoſe, though there you make the
greateſt out cry, (like a lapwhing, when ſhee's furtheſt
off her neſt.) we are now comming to a cloſe grapple.
(and 'tis like to prove as had as a Corniſh hugge.) <hi>Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,</hi>
I ſaid, <hi>was falſe</hi> (and that greeves you.) The
ſtrength of it, as I told you, lyes in this, <hi>The difference of</hi>
AB, AC, (be they Lines or Times, chuſe you whether, for
by conſtruction the times and lines are made proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,)
<hi>together with the difference of</hi>
AC, AD, <hi>taken together, are equall to
<figure/>
the difference of</hi> AB, AD; <hi>therefore
the proportion of</hi> AB, <hi>to</hi> AC, <hi>and of</hi> AC,
<hi>to</hi> AD, <hi>taken together is equall to that of</hi> AB <hi>to</hi> AD. That
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116063:44"/>
this is the ſtrength of your demonſtration you doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Now that conſequence I denyed; affirming that from
that equality of the difference, you could not inferre the
equality of Geometricall proportion; (and, of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
the queſtion is not; nor is pretended to be.) And
J gave this inſtance to the contrary, to ſhew the weakneſſe
of your Argument; Taking between A and B, any point
at pleaſure ſuppoſe a; you may as well conclude the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of aB to aD, aS of AB to AD. to be compounded of
that of AB to AC, and of AC to AD. For, (in your own
words.) <hi>the difference of AB, AC, with that of AC, AD,
are equall to the difference</hi> (not only of AB, AD, but even
of) <hi>aB, aD; and therefore the proportions of thoſe, to that of
theſe.</hi> Now all that you have to ſay againſt it, (for I doe
ſuppoſe, as you would have me, the motion to be equally
ſwift all the way,) is this, <hi>The
difference of AB, AC, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>annot
<figure/>
be the ſame with the difference
of aB, aC, except AB and
aB are equall.</hi> And here we joyne iſſue. The difference of
AB, AC, ſay I, is BC; and the difference of aB, aC, is
the ſame BC; though AB, aB, are not equall. The caſe is
ripe for a verdict. Let the Jury judge. And now you may,
if you will, go on to rant at <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> at <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi>
and <hi>Gambols,</hi> at <hi>double</hi> and <hi>duplicate,</hi> at <hi>aſſes</hi> and <hi>eares,</hi> at
<hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ius, Orontius,</hi> and <hi>too learned men,</hi> or whom you will;
<hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo.</hi> But thus 'tis, when men will
needs have Geometricall proportion, to be eſtimated by
Differences, and not by Quotients.</p>
            <p>(I told you moreover that your demonſtration was but
<hi>Petitio principii,</hi> and ſhewed wherein, with ſome other
faults which you take no notice of, becauſe you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay to them. And ſhewed you how your 13, 14,
and 15, articles with all their Corollaries, (which fill up
a matter of 4 pages.) might have been to better purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in ſo many lines. But this is no great fault with you,
who think the fartheſt way about, the neareſt way home.)</p>
            <p>At the 16 Article the caſe is as bad or worſe. The cry
goes on ſtill. This is all <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> too. And a
huge out cry againſt <hi>Quotients,</hi> and <hi>Symbols,</hi> and a <hi>loud
On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ethmus</hi> as you call it. But not a word to the purpoſe of
what was objected; (except only one clauſe wherein you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116063:44"/>
tell us how <hi>abſurd</hi> you mean to be by and by.) The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is this, Euclide (10 <hi>d</hi> 5) defines Duplicate, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
proportion, &amp;c. in this manner, <hi>If three magnitudes
be in continuall proportion, the firſt to the laſt hath duplicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of what it hath to the ſecond; if four, triplicate; &amp;c.</hi> (and
that indifferently whether the firſt or laſt be the bigger.)
Now you (that you might ſhew your ſelfe wiſer then <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide,</hi>
and be the <hi>firſt</hi> that ever <hi>made the grounds of Geometry
firm and coherent,)</hi> thought it was to be limited to this caſe
only, when the firſt quantity is the greateſt. And therefore
thus define, <hi>The proportion of a greater quantity to a leſſe</hi> (very
warily) <hi>is ſaid to be multiplied by a number, when other propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
equall to it, be added. And therefore if the quantities</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the ſame proportion) <hi>be three; the proportion of the
firſt to the last is Double, of what it hath to the ſecond; if four,
Treble, &amp;c. (which moſt men,</hi> you ſay, <hi>call duplicate, tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
&amp;c.) But if the proportion be of the leſſe to the greater</hi> (of
which Euclide, it ſeems, was not aware) <hi>and there be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of more proportions equall to it, it is not properly ſaid to be
multiplied, but ſubmultiplied</hi> (that is, divided; which yet you
tell us, by and by, is to be done by taking mean proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls.)
<hi>So that of three quantities</hi> (ſo continued) <hi>the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the firſt to the laſt, is halfe of what it hath to the ſecond;
if four, a third part, &amp;c. which are commonly called ſubdupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
ſubtriplicate, &amp;c.</hi> Now this, I told you, was foul
great miſtake, and ſuch a one as ſhould not have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a Reformer of the Mathematicks. And, to uſe
your own diſtinction <hi>(Leſſ. 2. p.</hi> 9.) 'tis a fault not of <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi>
but of <hi>Ignorance, or want of underſtanding principles:</hi>
and therefore <hi>an ill favoured fault,</hi> and, by your own rule,
to be <hi>attended with ſhame. I</hi> ſhewd you there (and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me now) that in the numbers 1, 3, 9, 27, &amp;c. the
proportion of 1 to 9, though leſſe, was not ſubduplicate to
that of 1 to 3, but duplicate, as truly as the proportion of
9 to 1 is duplicate to that of 3 to 1; and that of 1 to 27
was triplicate, not ſubtriplicate, of that of 1 to 3; Of which
<hi>I</hi> gave you this demonſtration, (though it ſeems, you did
not underſtand it, and therefore ſay, <hi>I bring no Argument.)</hi>
Becauſe 1/9 = ⅓ × ⅓, and 1/27 = ⅓ × ⅓ × ⅓, as well as
9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> = 2/1 × 3/1, add 27/1 = 3/1 × 3/1 × 3/1. And the ſubduplicate
of 1 to 3, is not, as you ſuppoſe, that of 1 to 9, but of 1 to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116063:45"/>
√3. Now this was ſo unlucky a miſtake, or Ignorance,
in a thing ſo fundamentall, that (as I then told you, and
you have ſince found to be true) an hundred to one, but
it would doe you a deal of miſchief all along. And it was
the touching upon this fore place, that gawled you ſo much
but now, and put you beſide your patience.</p>
            <p>But let's ſee now how you behave your ſelfe. A loud rant
we have, as if it were grievous doctrine I had taught,
and your own had been much better. But not a word to
the purpoſe ſave only this <hi>'Tis abſurd to ſay, that taking the
ſame quantity twice, ſhould make it leſſe.</hi> But though you ſay
ſo, you doe not think ſo. For when you have done your
rant, you goe ſlyly, (without ſaying a word of it, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
any error,) and put out that whole ſixteenth
Article, which we had in the Latine, giving us in the
Engliſh another inſtead of it, quite of another tenour,
and quite contrary to what you had before. And now a
proportion of the <hi>leſſe to the greater,</hi> (as well as of the
greater to the leſſe,) being <hi>twice</hi> taken, ſhall be <hi>duplicate,</hi>
(not ſubduplicate as before;) and <hi>thrice</hi> taken, (not ſubtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
but) <hi>triplicate.</hi> Now (becauſe you ſay it,) <hi>it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to ſay, that taking the ſame quantity twice, ſhould make it
leſſe;</hi> (though when I ſaid it, it was abſurd.) Now <hi>A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is ſaid to be multiplyed by number,</hi> not ſubmultiplyed,
<hi>when it is ſo often taken as there be unities in that number.</hi>
(Whether it be of the greater to the leſſe, or of the leſſe to
the greater;) <hi>And if the proportion be the greater to the leſſe,
then ſhall alſo the quantity of the proportion be increaſed by the
multiplication; but when the proportion is of the leſſe to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then as the number increaſeth, the quantity of the proportion
diminiſheth;</hi> For it is no abſurdity now, to ſay that taking
the ſame quantity twice makes it leſſe. And truly now,
methinks, thou ſayſt thy leſſon pretty well; I could find
in my heart to ſpit in thy mouth and make much of thee,
hadſt thou not railed at him that taught thee; which is but
a trick of an ungratefull ſchollar: But let's goe on, and
ſee whether this good fit will hold? <hi>As in theſe numbers,</hi>
4, 2, 1. <hi>the proportion of 4 to 1, is not only the duplicate of 4 to</hi>
2, <hi>but alſo twice as great.</hi> (Nay that is good againe; he hath
learned that there is a difference between <hi>Duplicate</hi> and
<hi>twice as great.</hi> Surely this is not he, (or elſe the world's well
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116063:45"/>
amended with him,) that laughed at the diſtinction of
<hi>Duplicate</hi> and <hi>Double.</hi> Well, let's heare ſome more of it.)
<hi>But, inverting the order of thoſe numbers thus, 1, 2, 4, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of 1 to 2, is greater than that of 1 to</hi> 4; <hi>and therefore
though the proportion of 1 to 4, be the duplicate of 1 to 2, yet
it is not twice ſo great as that of 1 to 2, but contrarily the halfe
of it.</hi> In good truth; a prety apt Schollar: for one of his
inches; He ſays juſt as I bid him. Well, well! the world's
well amended with T. H. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s hopes he may come to
good. Yee ſee he learnes apace. He may be a Mathematician in
time; though I ſay't that ſhould not ſay't. I confeſſe he hath
his faults ſtill, as well as other men, (you muſt not think
he can mend all at once,) The whole article is not ſo good
throughout, at this bit at the beginning. He hath got a
naughty trick of ſaying <hi>The proportion of equality is no quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
(but he hath been whipt for already;) He makes it ſtand
for a <hi>Cyphar,</hi> (but that's a thing of nothing: It ſhould have
been but 1, and that's not much more.) And he tells us
that <hi>the proportion of 9 to 4 is not onely duplicate, of 9 to 6, but alſo
the Double, or twice as greate.</hi> And again, that <hi>the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi>—4 <hi>to</hi>—6, <hi>is double to the proportion of</hi>—4 <hi>to</hi>—9,
&amp;c. which would have deſerved whipping at another time;
but becauſe he ſaid the reſt ſo well, I'le ſpare him for this
once. He doth, it ſeems, believe there is a difference between
<hi>double</hi> and <hi>duplicate,</hi> though he doe not yet know what
it is; he will learn againſt next time. And to the like
purpoſe is that which follows; <hi>If there be more quantities then
three</hi> (it's no matter how many) <hi>as</hi> A, B, C, D, <hi>in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
proportion,</hi> what ever the proportion be, ſo that A <hi>be
the leaſt; it may be made appeare that the proportion of</hi> A <hi>to</hi> B, <hi>is
triple magnitude, though ſubtriple in multitude, to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> A <hi>to</hi> D. But however he ſhall be ſpared for this bout;
becauſe I ſaid ſo; and I will be as good as my word.</p>
            <p>We have but one touch more, and <hi>I</hi> have done with
this Chapter. 'Tis at the Corollary of the 28 Article.
Here you find fault firſt with the word <hi>aliquot;</hi> and ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>I</hi> think that <hi>partes aliquot</hi> can be <hi>numero infinitae?</hi> And <hi>I</hi>
think they may. Where there are more then one, there be at
leaſt <hi>aliquot,</hi> whether few or many. What <hi>I</hi> objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that Corollary, was not againſt the truth of it, for it
is obvious and facile; but that it needed not ſo much a doe,
as to be uſhered in with three teadious Propoſitions, art:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116063:46"/>
26. 27. 28. Which, I ſaid, (and you do not deny it,) ſeems
to be put in only in order to this Corollary. In Art 28.
you were come thus farre, <hi>If from a line (AB) be cut off
a part</hi> (ſuppoſe AC) <hi>and between that and the whole, be
taken two meanes, the one Geometricall, the other Arithmeticall</hi>
(AD, AE;) <hi>the greater the part</hi>
               <figure/>
               <hi>is that is cut off</hi> AC (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the remainder CB,
the leſſe,) <hi>the leſſe will be the
difference between thoſe two meanes</hi> (AD, AE.) Hence at
length you come to this Corollary, That <hi>if the line</hi> (AB)
<hi>be divided into equall parts infinite in number,</hi> (and ſo the part
remaining CB, one of them, infinitely ſmall,) <hi>the difference
between the Arithmeticall and Geometricall means, will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
little.</hi> This I ſaid might be proved univerſally, not
only of theſe two, the Arithmeticall and Geometricall
Meanes, but of any two Meanes whatſoever. For ſuppoſing
any two lines AD,
<figure/>
AE, which are each
of them greater then
AC, but leſſe then
AB, (as all means
muſt be) your points DE, (whether <hi>D,</hi> or E, ſtand firſt, it
matters not) muſt needs fall between C and B: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the difference DE, cannot be bigger than CB, but
rather a part thereof, and ſo leſſe. Now the whole CB is
ſuppoſed infinitely little, and therefore its part DE can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be bigger. And is not this as well proved as if I had
premiſed in order to it, three whole Articles, and ſpent
three pages about it? You ſay, (and that's all you object
againſt it) that <hi>I doe not prove, that</hi> BE <hi>the Arithmeticall
difference is leſſe than</hi> BD <hi>the Geometricall difference.</hi> No;
Nor ought I ſo to doe. For the thing to be proved was not
<hi>which of the two is greateſt,</hi> but that (whether ſoever were
the greater) <hi>the difference between the two is infinitely ſmall:</hi>
which is done ſufficiently without that other. And are
not you then a wiſe Mathematician to make ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection?</p>

            <head>SECT. IX. Concerning his 14. and 15 Chapters.</head>
            <p>IN Your 14 Chapter, Art: 2. I found fault with your
definition of a <hi>Plain, to be that which is deſcribed by a
ſtreight line ſo moved as that every point of it deſcribe a
ſtreight line.</hi> I told you, it is not neceſſary, much leſſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall,
to be ſo deſcribed, (and you confeſſe it;) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
plains there are which are not ſo deſcribed. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
therefore is not good.</p>
            <p>Again. You had ſaid in the firſt Article: <hi>Two ſtreight
lines cannot include a ſuperficies.</hi> (Right,) And then Art: 2.
<hi>Two plain ſuperficies cannot include a ſolid.</hi> No, ſaid I, nor yet
<hi>Three.</hi> 'Twas ſimply done then to name but two. And
you confeſſe it to be a fault; but not a <hi>fault to be aſhamed
of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you had ſaid Art: 1. <hi>That a ſtreight line and a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
cannot be coincident, no not in the leaſt part.</hi> And then
Art: 3. You tell us of <hi>ſome crooked lines which have parts that
are not crooked.</hi> This I noted for a contradiction; becauſe
with thoſe parts not crooked, a ſtreight line may be coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
And you cannot deny it. Therefore in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
inſtead of <hi>crooked,</hi> in the former place, you put <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
crooked;</hi> which though it be but a botch, helps the
matter a little.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Art. In the deſcription of a circle, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
round a Radius; you define the <hi>Center</hi> to be that <hi>point
which is not moved.</hi> Now a <hi>Point</hi> you had before defined
cap. 8. art. 12. to be a <hi>Body moved &amp;c.</hi> So that to ſay, <hi>the
Point which is not moved,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>the Body moved
&amp;c. which is not moved.</hi> Which ſeems to me a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
To this objection, you ſay only that which I muſt
ſay to your anſwer, viz: <hi>It is fooliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Art: 6. you ſay, <hi>If two ſtreight lines touch one another in any
one point, they will be contiguous through
their whole length.</hi> No, nor alwaies;
<figure/>
The ſtreight lines AB, BD, touch
in one point B, and in that only.
And the ſtreight lines AC, BD, are contiguous only in
their common part BC, not through their whole length.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116063:47"/>
Yet are they ſuch contiguous lines as your propoſition
meanes, viz. <hi>ſuch as meeting in ſome one point, will not cut
one other though never ſo much produced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſaid farther, <hi>Crooked incongruous lines cannot touch
each other, ſave only in one point.</hi> Yes, ſaid I, a Circle may
touch a <hi>Parabola</hi> in <hi>two</hi> points. And you confeſſe it.
But ſay, you meant that each <hi>contact is not in a line,
but only in one point.</hi> Perhaps you meant ſo, (though
yet I queſtion whether you did then think of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacts
then one:) but why then did you not ſay ſo? (I mean,
in the Latine? for in the Engliſh, upon this notice it is a
little mended) But I reply, Yes, if thoſe incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
curve lines, have but <hi>ſome parts which are not crooked,</hi>
(as even now you told us,) they may <hi>touch in a line.</hi> Yea &amp;
incongruous lines <hi>continually crooked,</hi> may in ſome pasts of
them agree, though not congruous all the way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
touch in a line. And therefore even yet, it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate.</p>
            <p>But you'l ſay (as pag. 10.) <hi>Such faults as theſe, are not
attended with ſhame, unleſſe they be very frequent.</hi> What you
mean by <hi>very frequent,</hi> I cannot tell; but, mee thinks, 'tis
very ugly to have them come thus thick.</p>
            <p>Art 7. you divide a ſuperficiall Angle, into an <hi>Angle
ſimply ſo called,</hi> and an <hi>Angle of contingence.</hi> Which you
define in this manner; <hi>Two ſtreight lines applied to each other,
and contiguous in their whole length, being ſeparated or pulled
open in ſuch manner, that their concurrence in one point remains;
If it be by way of circular motion, whoſe center is the point of
concurrence, and the lines retain their ſtreightneſſe; the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of this divergence is an angle ſimply ſo called: If by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
flexion in every imaginable point; an angle of contingence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
I asked; to which of theſe two you referre the angle made
by a right line cutting a circle? or whether you doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
take that to be a <hi>ſuperficiall angle.</hi> You ſay, <hi>to an angle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſo called,</hi> that is, as we heard but now, to an <hi>angle made by
two lines which retain their ſtreightneſſe,</hi> (though one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
them be crooked.) And then, you tell us that <hi>Rectilin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
and Curvilincall hath nothing to doe with the nature of an angle
ſimply ſo called:</hi> When yet your definition requires, that the
lines <hi>retain their ſtreightneſſe.</hi> I will ask, you ſay, (yes I do
ask; and do you give a wiſe anſwer if you can;) <hi>How can
that angle which is generated by the divergence of two ſtreigh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116063:47"/>
lines,</hi> [whoſe ſtreightneſſe remains,] <hi>be other then Rectili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall?</hi>
You ſay, <hi>A houſe may remain a houſe, though the carriage
of the timber ceaſe.</hi> Much to the purpoſe! How do you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the ſimilitude? Even ſo, <hi>the lines retain their ſtreightneſſe,
though they be crooked,</hi> is that it? Or is it thus, <hi>Even ſo, the
Angle remains an angle made by lines retaining their ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when they be crooked?</hi> Perhaps you mean thus, <hi>The
Angle being once made by the divergence of ſtreight lines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
an Angle though one or both of thoſe lines be afterwards
made crooked.</hi> Very good! but doth it remain <hi>the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle?</hi>
the <hi>ſame quantity of divergence?</hi> (for ſo you define an
angle,) doth not (in your account,) the bowing of one of
the lines (the other remaining as it was) alter the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of divergence, <hi>(meaſurable by the Arch of a circle,</hi> as you
determine) from what it was before ſuch bowing? though
yet that very bowing alone, by your doctrine, be enough
to make an Angle of it ſelfe? Well, let it be ſo for once,
(though it ſhould not be ſo, by your principles.) But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
though this ſhould be allowed, yet at leaſt, ſo long as
the Angle is in making, the lines muſt be ſtreight. Tell me
then, J prithee, how a <hi>Sphericall Angle</hi> comes to be an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
ſimply ſo called.</hi> Is a ſphericall Angle made by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of ſtreight lines or of cooked? Can it be made a
ſphericall Angle ſo long as the <hi>lines retain their ſtreightneſſe?</hi>
It ſeemes ſo: for an <hi>Angle properly ſo called,</hi> that is, <hi>an Angle
made by the divergence of ſtreight lines, whoſe ſtreightneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
is diſtributed into <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> (as though all
<hi>Right lined angles,</hi> were not <hi>Plain Angles;)</hi> and then again
into <hi>Rectilineall, Curvilineall, and mixt;</hi> as though theſe were,
ſpecies of Rightlined Angles. Do you think it poſſible to
make an Angle Sphericall, Curvilineall, or mixed, ſo long
as the lines retain their ſtreightneſſe? do you think theſe
things will ever hold together? or is this to <hi>make the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Geometry firm and coherent?</hi> You were better ſay, as
the truth is, that when you formed that definition of an
<hi>Angle ſimply ſo called,</hi> you had your eye only upon a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
Angle, and fitted your definition thereunto; but
when afterward, under the ſame name, you took in curvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineall
and mixt angles, you ſhould have altered the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
but neglected it: And then apply your ordinary
apology<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it was indeed a fault, but not ſuch an one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116063:48"/>
as you need be aſhamed of. But, to goe about to defend it,
is more ridiculous then the thing it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>At the ninth Article, I had ſhewed how ſimply you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<hi>the quantity of an Angle,</hi> your definition as you call it,
is this: <hi>The quantity of an Angle, is an Arch of a circle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by its proportion to the whole perimeter.</hi> An Angle
was before defined to be the <hi>Quantity of Divergence;</hi> That
which you define now is the <hi>quantity of an angle,</hi> that is,
<hi>the quantity of the quantity of divergence.</hi> Very handſomely!
Then in ſtead of, the quantity of an Angle is <hi>meaſured by an
Arch;</hi> you ſay, the quantity of an Angle <hi>is an Arch.</hi> Again,
it is, you ſay <hi>the Arch of a circle:</hi> But what Arch? and of
what circle? for you determine neither. You mean, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that Circle whoſe center is the Angular point; but
you doe not ſay ſo: and, you mean alſo, the Arch of that
circle intercepted between the two ſtreight lines contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the angle; But then you ſhould have ſaid ſo, as well as
meant ſo. For, as the definition now runs, neither Arch,
nor circle, is determined. Next you ſay, that this quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is to be determined (for ſo the words muſt be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make ſenſe of them) <hi>by the proportion of that Arch to
the whole Perimeter:</hi> That is, what proportion that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
Arch hath to the whole perimeter; ſuch proportion
hath that Angle to—what? you do not tell us, to
what. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe the Arch be a quadrant or
quarter of the whole perimeter; the Angle is then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of—ſomewhat no doubt; but you doe not tell
us of what, Is it a quarter of an Angle? or a quarter of an
Arch? or a quarter of a Circle? No; 'tis a quarter of four
right Angles. 'Tis that, you ſhould have ſaid. Now are
not theſe faults enough for one poor definition? They are
but <hi>Negligences,</hi> you'l ſay: but they be ſcurvy ones; and there
be enough of them, for leſſe then two lines. But whether
to commit ſo many negligences, in leſſe then two lines,
be ſo <hi>very frequent,</hi> as that they <hi>be attended with ſhame,</hi> I
leave for others to judge. You ſhould have ſaid thus, as
I then told you, (but I ſee you are not alwaies willing to
learne;) <hi>The quantity of a</hi> Rectilineall <hi>angle,</hi> in proportion
to four Right angles, <hi>is</hi> determined by the proportion of
<hi>an Arch of a Circle</hi> (whoſe center is the Angular point)
intercepted between the two ſtreight lines containing that
angle, <hi>to the whole circumference.</hi> But, it ſeems, you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116063:48"/>
keep your own definition, with all its faults, then
ſeem to be taught by mee: Though yet you have nothing
to ſay in defence of any one of them; and therefore (as
you uſe to doe in ſuch caſes) take no notice of them in
your anſwer at all; as if no ſuch exceptions had been
made.</p>
            <p>The like exceptions, I ſaid, ly againſt the 18 Article.
And you take the like care neither to mend them, nor to
take notice of them.</p>
            <p>At the 12 Art. I ſhewed, what a pittifull definition you
had brought of Parallells; and that the Conſectary from it
was falſe, and the Demonſtration thereof a ſad one. You
confeſſe all: But are not pleaſed that I ſhould triumph.</p>
            <p>Your emendation which you intimate, by inſerting <hi>the
ſame way;</hi> will do ſome good in the conſectary, but will
not make good the definition. Your new definition in the
Engliſh, is little better then that of the Latine. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectary,
as it is now mended in the Engliſh, is true; but the
demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration of it hath many of the ſame faults, though not
all, that I noted in the Latine: and doth not at all conclude
the truth of the conſectary, from that definition. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what I objected formerly. What you attempt to
prove of <hi>two lines,</hi> you ſhould have proved univerſally <hi>of
any two;</hi> for ſo much your definition requires.</p>
            <p>At the 13 Art. you bring a ſorry argument to prove <hi>The
Perimeters of Circles to be proportionable to their Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
The ſtrength of the argument lies in this, <hi>The bigneſſe
of the Perimeter is determined by its diſtance from the center;
and the length of the Semidiameter is determined likewiſe by
the ſame diſtance; therefore, ſince the ſame cauſe determines
both effects, the Perimeters are proportionall to their Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
This conſequence I deny; becauſe, not only the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Perimeter, but of the circle alſo is determined
by the ſame cauſe; as alſo the ſuperficies and the ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of a ſpheare. For that diſtance of the circumference
and Center, determines the greatneſſe of all theſe. And
therefore, by your argument, circles, and ſpheares, &amp;c.
muſt be proportionall to their ſemidiameters: which is
abſurd. To which retort, becauſe you can anſwer nothing;
you d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, according to your uſuall Rhetorick, fall to
ranting.</p>
            <p>At the 14 Article, I ſaid, that your argument was but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116063:49"/>
               <hi>petitio principii.</hi> You ſay, <hi>There was a fault in the figure, (that
it was not exactly drawn) which is now amended.</hi> True; but
there is a worſe fault in the demonſtration, which is not
amended yet. For though you have altered your Figure,
and your demonſtration too; yet the fault remaines. And
'twas this, not the figure, which I found fault with. For
you do not prove that BH, BI, BC, (fig. 6.) are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
to AF, AD, AB, but upon ſuppoſition that FG,
DE, BC, were ſo: which was the thing at firſt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
You ſay, that AF, FD, DE, <hi>are equall by conſtruction.</hi>
(True.) And, that FG, DK, BH, KE, HI, IC, <hi>are equall
by Paralleliſm.</hi> But this is not true. The Paralleliſm proves
that FG, DK, BH, are equall; and that KE, HI, are alſo
equall; but not that either of theſe two, are equall to either
of thoſe three, (or to IC:) unleſſe you firſt ſuppoſe that
DE, is the double of DK, or FG, as AD is the double of
AF, which is the very thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>You tell me; There was another fault (yes, three or four
for failing) which <hi>I</hi> might have excepted againſt. But the
weight of the demonſtration did not ly there; and <hi>I</hi> did
not intend to trouble the Reader with every petty fault;
(for then <hi>I</hi> ſhould never have done:) eſpecially in this and
the next Article; where <hi>I</hi> did not then repeat your Figure
at all; and therefore did briefly intimate where the fault
lay: which had been direction enough for an intelligent
man to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound it out: But becauſe J did not point
with a feſtcue to every letter, you <hi>had not the wit</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it.</p>
            <p>In like manner Art. 15. when <hi>I</hi> told you the <hi>third Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
was falſe,</hi> and ſhewed you briefly the ground of your
miſtake; becauſe J did not, with a feſtcue point from letter
to letter, you were not able to ſpell out the meaning; but,
<hi>as being leſſe awake,</hi> thought it had been a <hi>dream.</hi> You had
told us, that (in your 7 figure) the angles KBC, GCD,
HDE, &amp;c. were as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. And 'tis true. Thence you
undertake in your third Corollary to give account of <hi>the
bending of a ſtreight line into the circumference of a circle;</hi>
namely, <hi>by its fraction continually increaſing according to the
ſayd numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> But how ſo? <hi>For,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the
ſtreight line KB being broken at B according to any angle, as
that of KBC, and again at C according to the double of that
Angle, and at D according to the treble &amp;c. 'twill containe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116063:49"/>
a rectilineall figure; But if the parts ſo broken be conſidered
as the leaſt that can be, that is, as ſo many points, 'twill be a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</hi>
This, I ſaid was falſe, and that the ground of
your miſtake was, that for the Angle BDE and its Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
HDE, you took CDE and its remainder.</p>
            <p>And J need not ſay more; <hi>verbum ſapienti</hi> a word for a
wiſe man, had been enough; but, for you it ſeemes, it was
not. You, like a man halfe a ſleep, took it to be a dreame.
Therefore, if you pleaſe to rub up your eyes a little, and
take a feſtcue I will, for your better noddification, point
to the letters as we goe along, and teach you to ſpell it out.
The tangent line BK, continued indefinitely both ways,
being broken at B, according to the Angle KBC, will lye
in BCG: Now this line BCG being broken at C, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Angle GCD which is the double of KBC,
its part CG, will lye in CD continued, CDδ And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
you be right. But this continuation of CD, is not
DH, as you ſeem to ſuppoſe, but Dδ which will fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
DH, DE. When therefore this line CDδ comes
to be broken againe at D, that its continuation may lye in
DE, the faction will not be according to the Angle
HDE (which indeed is the triple of KBC) but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the angle δDE: which will be leſſe then HDE,
becauſe it is evident that CD cuts BH, And indeed the
very ſame Angle of fraction with that at C; For ſeeing
the angle CDE, is equal to BCD, by conſtruction, the
ſubtenſes being taken equall; the adjacent angles <hi>(anguli</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) muſt be equall alſo, that is δDE = GCD
And therefore the angle of fraction at D, preciſely equall
with that at C; not as 3 to 2, as you ſuppoſe. And by the
ſame reaſon the angle of fraction at <hi>E</hi> muſt be equall to that
at D; not as 4 to 3, as you ſuppoſe. And ſo the Angles of
fraction at C, D, E &amp;c are not as 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. but are all
equall. You ſee therefore, if you be yet awake, that it was
not a dreame of mine, but a reall miſtake of yours, to
take HDE for the angle of fraction of CD. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that your propoſition was falſe. And this faſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
was the occaſion of another falſehood in the 20. Article
of the 16. Chapter. (which ſince you have blotted out.)
for there you cite this propoſition as the foundation of
that: And whereas you ſay, <hi>You cannot gueſſe what that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was,</hi> (and yet <hi>are very ſure that it was true,) for that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116063:50"/>
you have no coppy of that article either printed or written.</hi> If
you have not, J am ſure you may have, for there be enough
that have. For your book ſold in ſheets unbound, had
commonly that article amongſt the reſt, and by that meanes
it came to me. And, rather then you ſhould be farre to
ſeek for it, I have recited that whole article <hi>verbatim,</hi> yea
to a letter, in its due place in my <hi>Elenchus;</hi> and proved
it to be falſe.</p>
            <p>Againſt your opinion concerning the <hi>Angle of Contact,</hi>
(in the 16. Article,) J ſaid little; becauſe J think it needs
no refutation. Your opinion is this, <hi>That the angle</hi> PAD,
(Fig. 2. Sect. 3) <hi>is bigger then the angle</hi> PAE, <hi>as being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the line</hi> AE. <hi>But the angle</hi> EAC, <hi>is not bigger then the
angle DAC, nor is divided by the line DA, but both of them
equall as well to each other, as to the angle</hi> PAC, <hi>and alſo to
the angle</hi> GAC. That this is your opinion, is evident.
They that like it may imbrace it, for all me: And I hope,
they that like it not may leave it.</p>
            <p>The reſt of what concernes this buſineſſe, is conſidered
before in its proper place.</p>
            <p>At the 18. Art beſide what is common to this and the
ſeventh, J noted for a fault, and you doe not deny it ſo to
be, that you deliver it as Euclide's opinion, that a <hi>Solid
angle</hi> is but an <hi>Aggregate of plain Angles.</hi> Jt may be your
opinion; but ſurely 'twas none of Euclide's. If you had
thought it had; you ſhould have here if you could, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſomewhat out of Euclide where he declares ſuch an
opinion.</p>
            <p>At the 19. Article <hi>All the ways by which two lines reſpect
one an other, or all the variety of their poſition, ſeem,</hi> you ſayd,
<hi>to be compriſed under four kinds; For they are etiher Parallells;
or (if produced at leaſt) make an angle; or (if bigge enough) be
Contingents; or lastly are aſymptotes.</hi> By Aſymptots you
mean (not all ſuch as never meet, for then Prallells would
fall under this kind; but) <hi>ſuch as will come always nearer
and nearer together, but never touch one another</hi> (you might
have added this other character; <hi>that they doe ſo approach
each other, as that at length their diſtance will be leſſe than any
aſſignable quantity.</hi> But it ſeems you allow your Aſymptotes
a greater latitude: And doe in your Engliſh, determine
your meaning ſo to be: And that, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, becauſe you
had neglected to put in, that limitation, in the latine;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116063:50"/>
and therefore were not willing upon my intimation to
mend it in the Engliſh. For none elſe that I knew, ſpeak
of any other lines under the name of Aſymptotes, but ſuch
as doe not only <hi>eternally approach,</hi> but do approach alſo <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
neare,</hi> And, <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to believe, from your ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
objection <hi>Leſſ. 5. p. 48. l.</hi> 23. that you thought thoſe
two muſt needs go together, viz. that whatſoever quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
doe <hi>eternally approach,</hi> muſt needs at laſt come <hi>infinitely
neare.</hi> But however wee'l be content, if you would have it
ſo, to take Aſymptotes at what latitude you will give it
them.) You ſay now, that I am offended at the word <hi>it
ſeems.</hi> No, Sir, no offence at all. I am not at all angry,

<hi>it ſeemed otherwiſe;</hi> (And, I hope you are not offended
that all things did not ſeem to me, as they did to you: For
I perceive, that by this time, it <hi>ſeems otherwiſe</hi> to you alſo.

ſuch, as will not be ſalved with your new botch. As they

            <p>J touched at ſome other faults; as, That the definition of
<hi>points alike ſituate,</hi> (art. 31.) ſeemed very uncouth.</p>
            <p>That the word <hi>Figure,</hi> which is defined art. 22. had been

with you a ſmall fault, yet a fault it is.) And you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

            <p>That by your definition a <hi>ſolid ſpheare,</hi> and a <hi>ſpheare

but it is I confeſſe, my opinion, that this <hi>concave ſuperficies</hi>
being, as you ſay all within a ſpheare, (and therefore may
be contiguous to ſomewhat within the ſpheare,) <hi>is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous

            <p>The 15. Chapter, becauſe it contained but little Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,

            <p>J noted that (contrary to others who define <hi>Time to be

<hi>meaſure of time;</hi> And yet (contrary to your own deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination)
you do frequently make <hi>Time the meaſure of

ſlowneſſe, uniformity, &amp;c.) by Time. You confeſſe
it to be ſo: But raile at us for minding <hi>Books,</hi> more than

            <head>SECT. X. Concerning his 16 Chapter.</head>
            <p>IN the 16 Chapter, I ſaid, there were 20 Articles; you
ſay, but 19. 'Tis eaſily reconciled. There be twenty in
my book; and there were 20 in yours too, before the
laſt was cut or torne out: now, it ſeems, in yours there are
but nineteen.</p>
            <p>Well; but, be they twenty, or be they nineteen; twenty
to one but the greateſt number of them be naught. <hi>I do
confidently affirme,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that all but three are falſe.</hi> Nay,
that's falſe, to begin with. I ſaid, that, all but three were
<hi>unſound.</hi> Some of them be non-ſenſe, or abſurd; ſome be
falſe; ſome undemonſtrated; all unſound; at leaſt, within
three: And I have already proved them ſo to be. But <hi>you</hi>
(you ſay) <hi>do affirme, that they are all true, and truly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</hi>
And that's anſwer enough to all my arguments.
What need you ſay any more? If that be true, doubtleſſe
you have the better on't. But let's trie a little, if we cannot
find one unſound amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your firſt Propoſition as it ſtands yet in the Latine,</hi> you ſay, is
this, <hi>The velocity of any Body moved, during any Time, is ſo
much, as is the product of the Impetus in one point of Time, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied

                  </gap> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
you ſay, <hi>That meaning by</hi> Impetus, <hi>ſome middle</hi> impetus,
<hi>and aſſigning none, you determine nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Well what ſay you
to that? you ſay, <hi>'tis true.</hi> And then you rant at us for not
mending it, (as though we were bound to mend your faults)
yet look again, and you'l find J did. J told you what you
ſhould have ſaid; as well as what you ſaid amiſſe. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of this. Here's one fault confeſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:116063:52"/>
In the ſame Article; you would have <hi>the</hi> Impetus <hi>applied
ordinately to any ſtreight line, making an angle with it.</hi> J asked,
<hi>How an</hi> impetus <hi>can be ordinately applied to a Line?</hi> or <hi>make
an Angle with it? Abſurdly,</hi> you ſay; and that's the anſwer.
And J told you how this ſhould have been mended too.</p>
            <p>You tell me that Archimedes and others ſay, <hi>Let ſuch a
line be the Time,</hi> and again p. 36. l. 16. <hi>Let the line</hi> AB <hi>be
the Time.</hi> Very likely! juſt as when we ſay, <hi>Let the Time be</hi>
A. That is, Let it be ſo deſigned; or, <hi>Let the Line</hi> AB, or
<hi>the letter</hi> A, <hi>be the Symbole of the Time.</hi> What then? Doth it
therefore follow, that either Lines or Letters be homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
to Time? No ſuch matter. Their Symbols may be
Homogeneous though the Things be not. You ſay farther,
in the ſame Article: <hi>If the Impetus increaſe uniformely, the
whole velocity of the motion ſhall be repreſented by a Triangle, one
ſide whereof is the whole Time, and the other the greateſt Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
(Well! &amp; what ſhall be the third ſide? or what angle
ſhall theſe contain? Do you think that the aſſigning of
two ſides, without an Angle, will ſufficiently determine
the bigneſſe of a triangle? But lets go on.)</p>
            <p>Or elſe &amp;c. Or laſtly by a Parallelogramme having for one
ſide a mean proportionall between the greateſt Impetus and the
halfe thereof. <hi>Well, but what for the other ſide? And,
what Angle?</hi> Is a Parallelogramme, <hi>ſaid J,</hi> ſufficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
be the aſſignement of but one ſide, and never an angle?
<hi>what think you? is this ſound?</hi> It was indeed a very great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight,
<hi>you confeſſe,</hi> to deſigne a Parallelogram by one only
ſide. <hi>And is not all this ſufficient to prove the firſt Article
unſound? if it be not, wee'l go on, for there be more
faults yet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For,</hi> ſay you, <hi>theſe two parallelograms are equall both each to
other, and to the</hi> (fore mentioned) <hi>Triangle</hi> (without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any conſideration of Angles at all) <hi>as is demonſtrated
in the Elements of Geometry.</hi> This, I ſay, is notoriouſly falſe:
For a Triangle of which nothing is determined but two
ſides: and a Parallelogramme, of which the ſides only are
determined, but nothing concerning the Angles: can never
by any Geometry, be demonſtrated to be equall. This
therfore is not only unſound, but falſe. And all this J told
you before. What an impudence then is it, when you knew
all this, to <hi>affirm, that they be, all true and all truly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:116063:53"/>
when the very firſt of them is thus notoriouſly faulty!
But we have not done yet.</p>
            <p>It might be hoped, that this confeſſed <hi>overſight</hi> is, at
leſt mended in the Engliſh: (eſpecially ſince you tell us
that one from beyond ſea hath taught you how to mend it)
No ſuch matter. For the Amendment is as bad or worſe
then what we had before. For now it runs thus. <hi>The
whole velocity ſhall be repreſented by a Triangle &amp;c.</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<hi>or elſe by a Parallelogram, one of whoſe ſides is the
whole Time of motion; and the other, half the greateſt</hi> Impetus:
<hi>Or laſtly, by a Parallelogram, having for one ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall
between the whole Time and the halfe of that Time;
and for the other ſide the halfe of the greateſt</hi> impetus. <hi>For
both theſe Parallelograms are equall to one another, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
equall to the Triangle which is made of the whole line of
Time, and the greateſt acquired</hi> impetus. <hi>As is demonſtrated
in the Elements of Geometry.</hi> Now this, you ſhall ſee, is pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
faiſe. Let the time be T; and the greateſt <hi>impetus,</hi>
I: and let the Angles be ſuppoſed all Right Angles (for
ſuch your Figures repreſent, though your text ſays nothing
of them.) The Altitude therefore of the triangle, is T,
(the whole time:) the Baſis I, (the greateſt impet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s:)
and conſequently the Area thereof is one halfe of T × I:
that is ½ IT. Again the Altitude of the former Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram,
T, (the whole time,) its Baſis, ½ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, (half
the greateſt impetus,) and therefore the area T × ½ I, or
½ IT; equall to that of the Triangle Lets ſee now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the laſt Parallelogram be equall to either of theſe, as
you affirm. The Altitude you will have to be a mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall
between the whole Time and its halfe: that is,
between T&amp;½ T; It is therefore the root of
T × ½ T, that is the root of ½ Tq, that is √½ Tq,
or T√½: The <hi>Baſis</hi> you will have to be one
half of the greateſt <hi>Impetus,</hi> that is ½ I: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
the Area muſt be ½ I × √½ Tq, or
½ I × T √½, or ½ IT√½. But ½ IT√½ is not
equall to ½ IT: Therefore this Parallelogram is not
equall either to the former, or to the Triangle. 'Tis falſe
therefore which you affirmed. <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:116063:53"/>
Now what do you think of the buſineſſe? is not the
matter well amended? 'Twas bad before, now 'tis worſe.
When you told us but of one ſide, and left us to gueſſe the
other, 'twas at our perill if we did not gueſſe right, and
'twas to be hoped, you meant well, though you forgot to
ſet it down. But, now you tell us, what you meant, we
find that you neither ſaid well, nor meant well: For what
you now ſay is clearly falſe. The two Parallelograms which
you affirm to be equall, are no more equall then the Side
and the Diagonall of a Square; but juſt in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
viz. as √½ to 1. Nay was it not a pure piece of
wiſdome in you, that, when you had been taught from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, as you tell us, how it ſhould have been mended,
you had not yet the wiſdome to take good counſell; but,
truſting to your own little wit, have made it worſe than it
was? it falls out very unluckily, you ſee, that when you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
ſo confidently, <hi>that they are all true, and all truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,</hi>
the very firſt of them ſhould be ſo wretchedly
faulty. But enough of this. Wee'l try whether the next
will prove better.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Article you give us this Propoſition. <hi>In
every uniform motion, the lengths paſſed over are to one another,
as the product of the ones</hi> Impetus <hi>multiplied into its time, to the
product of the others</hi> Impetus <hi>multiplied into its time.</hi> And
why not, ſaid J, (without any more adoe) <hi>as the time to
the time?</hi> Which needed no other demonſtration than to
cite the definition of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform motion,</hi> (viz. <hi>which doth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
or proportionall times, diſpatch equall or proportionall
lengths.)</hi> What need had you to cumber the Propoſition
with <hi>Impetus</hi> and <hi>Multiplication,</hi> and <hi>Products,</hi> when they
might as well be ſpared? and then put your ſelfe to the
trouble of a long and needleſſe demonſtration, when the
bare citing of a definition would have ſerved the turne?
You anſwer, That <hi>the product of the Time and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpetus, to the
product of the Time and Impetus, is alſo as the Time to the Time.</hi>
and therefore the Propoſition is true. Yes doubtleſſe; and
therefore I did not find fault with it, as <hi>falſe;</hi> but as <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
to make ſuch a buſle to no purpoſe. For, by your own
confeſſion, the proportion of the lengths diſpatched, is as
well deſigned by the termes alone, as by thoſe multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and products.</p>
            <p>But there is another fault which J f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> told you that, inſtead of, in <hi>every uniforme motion,</hi>
you ſhould have ſaid, (and, that you might have ſaid it
ſafely, as the reſt of the wordsly,) <hi>in all uniform motions;</hi>
for you make uſe of this propoſition afterwards, not only
in comparing divers parts of any the ſame uniforme moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in comparing divers motions one with another.
But at this you are highly offended, that J ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
to what purpoſe this Propoſition is brought, better
than your ſelfe; and that J ſhould preſume to tell you,
what you ought to have ſaid. (And, on the other hand,
when J do not do ſo, you blame mee, that J do not <hi>to my
reprehenſion adde a correction:</hi> So that, it ſeems, you are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
well, full nor faſting: J muſt neither do it, nor let it
alone.) And then you go on to rant, after your faſhion, at <hi>Wit
and Myſtery,</hi> and <hi>times and wayes,</hi> and <hi>ſteddy brains,</hi> at <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thoughts,</hi> and <hi>noiſe of words,</hi> at <hi>ſtep and ſtumble,</hi> &amp;c. And
yet, for all the anger, (when the heats over) you think
beſt to take my counſell; and therefore ſay in the Engliſh,
juſt as J ſaid it ſhould have been in the Latine.</p>
            <p>The propoſition then being thus to be underſtood,
(though at firſt, ill worded,) the demonſtration, I ſaid,
would not hold. For though it will doe well enough
(yea more then enough; for you might have ſpared halfe
of it;) in comparing ſeverall parts of the ſame motion,
and in comparing ſeverall motions of the ſame ſwiftneſſe;
yet for the comparing of uniforme motions in generall, it
will not ſerve by no meanes; for you do aſſume at the firſt
daſh, that the motions compared have the ſame <hi>Impetus.</hi>
Now this muſt not be allowed. For it's very poſſible (as
you now know, ſince, J told you, though before you ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be ignorant of it, as J then convinced you;) that
two motions may be both uniforme; and yet not have
both the ſame <hi>Impetus.</hi> Your propoſition therefore (as it
was to be underſtood) was not truly demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe this was very evident, and not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
therefore you thought it beſt to make no words of
it, but mend it as well as you could. And ſo, in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
you have mended the propoſition, as J bid you; and
given us a new demonſtration, which is pretty good; But
not yet without fault. For in ſtead of <hi>the length</hi> AF (fig. 1.)
you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>the length</hi> DG: for the length ſhould
have been taken in the line DE, which, according to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116063:54"/>
your conſtruction, is the line of Lengths; not in the line
AB, which is, by conſtruction, the line of Times. So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
a thing is it, for you to mend one fault and not to
make another.</p>
            <p>But if all theſe faults be not enough to make this Article
unſound, there is yet another, before we leave. <hi>Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
you ſay, <hi>in uniforme motion, the Lengths diſpatched are to
one another, as the Times in which they are diſpatched; it will
alſo be, by permutation, as time to length, ſo time to length.</hi>
This conſequence I denied; becauſe Permutation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
hath place only in Homogenealls, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genealls;
(and referred you for farther inſtruction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, to what <hi>Clavious</hi> hath on the 16. Prop. of the 15.
of Euclide.) You tell me, that <hi>I think, line and time are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous.</hi>
Yes, and you think ſo to if you be not a foole.
If not, pray tell me <hi>how many yards long is an hour?</hi> Or,
<hi>How much line will make a day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, lets try a third Article. (For the two firſt you ſee
be nought, that's a bad begining.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 3. In motion uniformely accelerated from reſt, (that is,
when the Impetus increaſeth in proportion to the times) the length
run over in one time, is to the length run over in an other time.
<hi>(In the Engliſh for</hi> Impetus, <hi>you have put</hi> mean Impetus, <hi>and
ſo in ſome other propoſitions; but that neither mends
nor mars the buſineſſe.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, firſt you dream of an objection, and then think
of an anſwer to it. <hi>I object</hi> you ſay, <hi>that the Lengths run over,
are in that proportion which the</hi> Impetus <hi>hath to the</hi> Impetus.
Prithee tell me, where I made that objection to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;
and i'le confeſſe 'twas ſimply done. But 'till then,
i'le ſay 'tis done like your ſelfe, to ſay ſo however. (For
'tis lawfull with you to ſay any thing, true or falſe) Your
Engliſh Reader, perhaps, may think 'tis true.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>You aske,</hi> you ſay, <hi>where it is that you ſay or dreame,
that the lengths run over are in proportion of the</hi> Impetus <hi>to the
Times?</hi> But prithee, why doſt thou aske me ſuch a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Am I bound to give an account of all thy <hi>dreames?</hi>
Perhaps you dreamed that I had charged you with ſuch a
ſaying; But, look again, and you'l find that's but a dreame
as well as the reſt.</p>
            <p>That which I ſaid was this, <hi>The parallell line</hi> FH, BI,
(fig. 1.) <hi>do ſhew what proportion the</hi> Impetus <hi>at</hi> F <hi>hath to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116063:55"/>
the</hi> Impetus <hi>at</hi> B; to wit, the ſame with the time AF, to
the time AB: (And is not this your meaning, when you
ſay <hi>the</hi> Impetus <hi>increaſeth in proportion to the times?)</hi> But,
though thoſe (and other parallell lines) do define
what proportion <hi>the ſeverall</hi> Impetus <hi>have to each other;</hi> yet
they do not deſigne (by permutation of proportion, as
you fancied in the Corollary of the precedent article)
what proportion <hi>the ſeverall</hi> Impetus <hi>have to the Times;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they be Heterogeneous, and do not admit of that
permutation. And theſe are the words, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to thoſe your two dreames. And then (as if between
ſleeping and waking) you ask, <hi>if it be you or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that dream?</hi>
Had you been well awake, you needed not have asked
the queſtion.</p>
            <p>The objections that I made to it, were theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that in ſtead of <hi>motu accelerato,</hi> (accelerate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>motibus acceleratis</hi> (accelerate
motions,) becauſe you ſpeake of more than one. You ſay,
<hi>there is no ſuch matter:</hi> and bid mee <hi>give an inſtance.</hi> J will
ſo, and that without going farther then your preſent
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Let AB</hi> (ſay you) <hi>repreſent a Time &amp;c. Againe,
let AF repreſent another time &amp;c.</hi> And in each of theſe
times you ſuppoſe a Motion, which motions this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
compares. Therefore, ſay I, there muſt be at leaſt two
Motions, becauſe two Times; unleſſe you will ſay, that
one and the <hi>ſame motion</hi> may be <hi>now, and anon too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I objected farther, that the demonſtration doth nor
prove the proportion; except only in one caſe, to which
you do not reſtraine it. For the whoſe ſtreſſe of your
demonſtration, (in the Latine) lyes upon this, that the
<hi>triangles</hi> ABI, AFK, <hi>be like triangles</hi> (where you inferre,
that the ſpace diſpatched in the latter time AK, is to that
of the former time AB, <hi>as the triangle ABI, to the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
AFK, that is in the duplicate proportion of the times AB,
AF.)</hi> Which ſuppoſeth that the ſecond motion in the
time AF, doth acquire the ſame <hi>Impetus</hi> which the firſt
motion had acquired in equall time. Whereas it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that, of two motions, each of them uniformly accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
the one of them may in half the time acquire as great
a ſwiftneſſe, as the other doth in the whole time; If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the latter motion in the ſame AF, do acquire a ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
equall to that of the former in the time AB, (which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116063:55"/>
may very well be, for the words <hi>uniformly accelerated,</hi> doe
imply only the <hi>manner of acceleration,</hi> not the <hi>degree of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
as your ſelfe now diſcern, though then you did not,)
the triangles will be, not ABI, AFK, but ABI, AFH;
which are not like triangles, but unlike; and ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
falls. You ſhould have provided in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
not only that the two motions, (the one in the
time AB, the other in the time AF,) be each of them u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly
accelerated, but that they be both equally ſwift.
Which when you have neglected to take care of, you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that univerſally, which will hold only in one caſe.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, 'tis evident enough, by this and divers
other Articles, that you took the manner of acceleration,
(viz. if in the ſame, in the duplicate, or triplicate, &amp;c.
proportion to the times,) had ſufficiently determined the
ſpeed alſo. And therefore took it for granted, that the
motion in the time AF, if uniformly accelerated, muſt
needs attain preciſely the ſame degree of the celerity, that
the other motion in the time AB, uniformly alſo accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
had attained in equall time. (Which to be a very
great miſtake, you now doe apprehend.) Otherwiſe you
would not have let theſe Articles ly ſo naked without
ſuch proviſion; nor would you, (as in the 13 Article,
and thoſe that follow,) undertake, by the manner of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
and the laſt acquired <hi>Impetus,</hi> to determine the
time of motion. Whereas, in the ſame manner of accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(whether uniformly, or in the duplicate, or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
or quadruplicate proportion;) any aſſignable <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi>
or degree of celerity, may be attained in any aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time whatever.</p>
            <p>I objected farther, that becauſe, as hath been ſhewed,
the Triangle AFK, or AFH, is not neceſſarily like to
the triangle ABI, therefore it doth not follow that the
<hi>length paſſed over, will be in duplicate proportion to the time.</hi>
For unleſſe the triangles be alike, the proportion of them
will not be duplicate to that of their homologous ſides.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two Objections were clear and full, (and
did deſtroy your whole demonſtration;) and this you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
well enough, though you did not think fit to make
any reply or confeſſion; (but invent ſome other objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which I never made, that you might ſeem to anſwer
to ſomewhat.) And therefore in the Engliſh, without
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116063:56"/>
making any words of it, you mend it. And inſtead of thoſe
words in the Latine, <hi>As the triangle ABI, to the triangle
AFK, that is, in duplicate proportion of the time AB to AF:</hi>
you ſay in the Engliſh. <hi>As the triangle ABI, to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
AFK, that is, if the triangles be like in the duplicate
proportion of the time AB, to the time AF; but, if unlike in
the proportion compounded &amp;c.</hi> (which is a clear confeſſion
of all thoſe objections. But let's go on. <hi>Compounded</hi> of
what?) <hi>of AB, to Bi, and of AK, to AF.</hi> No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
of <hi>AF to FK,</hi> (that's it you would have ſaid:) not,
<hi>of AK to AF.</hi> There's one fault therefore; but thats not all.
Of AB to AF, and of BI to FK; thats it you ſhould
have ſaid: for AB to BI, the Time to the Impetus, hath
no proportion at all; but are Heterogeneous, as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told you. There's a ſecond fault therefore in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
And is not this Tinker-like, to mend one
hole and make two? Nay there is a third yet, which is the
worſt of all.</p>
            <p>In the mending of this fault, (though you had not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in it,) you have diſcovered another, which you did
your endeavour, but now, to hide. I ſaid in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for <hi>motion,</hi> you ſhould have ſaid <hi>motions;</hi> becauſe it was
intended of more than one compared. You tell me, <hi>there's
no ſuch matter;</hi> meaning, I ſuppoſe, the latter motion in the
time <hi>AF,</hi> was but part of that former motion in the time
AB: But if, as you now confeſſe, the triangle AFK, be
not neceſſarily alike triangle to ABI, (but that the point
K may fall either within or without the line AI,) then
muſt this be not only another, but an unlike motion to
the former: <hi>viz.</hi> either faſter or ſlower, though uniformly
accelerated as that was. Do not you know that old rule;
<hi>Oportet eſſe memorem.</hi> But this 'tis, when men will commit
faults, and then deny them. And yet preſently after, by
going about to mend them, betray themſelves.</p>
            <p>Much ſuch luck you have in mending the Corollary. You
had ſaid in the Latine, <hi>In motion uniformly accelerated, the
lengths tranſmitted are in the duplicate proportion of their times.</hi>
This, I ſaid, was true in one caſe, (viz. in equall celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,)
but not univerſally. Therefore you, to mend the
matter, in the Engliſh make it worſe; <hi>In motion uniformly
accelerated,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the proportion of the lengths tranſmitted, to
that of their Times,</hi> (No, but the proportion of the length
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116063:56"/>
tranſmitted, one to the other,) <hi>is compounded of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Times to the Times, and</hi> Impetus <hi>to</hi> Impetus.</p>
            <p>There be more faults in this Article; but I am weary of
the buſineſſe; let's go to the next.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article hath all the faults that the third hath,
(which are enough as wee have ſeen already,) and ſome
more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for <hi>motu accelerato,</hi> you ſhould have ſaid <hi>motibus
acceleratis;</hi> becauſe you compare more motions then one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Motion performed in the time AF, <hi>(Fig.</hi>
2.) though accelerate according to the duplicate propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the times, as well as that in the time AB; yet may
that be either ſwifter or ſlower than this; (becauſe as we
have often ſaid, the manner of acceleration doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the degree of celerity;) And therefore the point
K which determines its greateſt <hi>Impetus,</hi> doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
fall in the Parabolicall line, but may fall either within
or without it: according as the celerity is leſſe or more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And therefore it doth not follow, that the
Lengths diſpatched by ſuch motion, are in triplicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to their Times. For this only depends upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that the point K in the ſecond motion, muſt
needs fall in the <hi>Parabola</hi> AI, deſigned by the firſt
motion.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two latter faults, in the former Article, you
did endeavour to amend in the Engliſh: But becauſe, it
ſeems, here it was harder to doe, you have left them as
they were before. That theſe were faults, you were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of; and do as good as confeſſe, by your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to mend them in the third Article. But becauſe you
ſaw it was impoſſible for one of your capacity to think of
mending all; you reſolve to give over mending, and
(which is the eaſier of the two) reſolve to try the ſtrength
of your brow.</p>
            <p>But, as if there were a neceſſity of growing worſe and
worſe; beſide thoſe, common to this and the third article,
here is an addition of more faults, as foul as any of them.</p>
            <p>In your demonſtration; your ſtreſſe lyes upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Seeing the proportion of FK to BI, is ſuppoſed dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to that of AE to AB,</hi> (which yet is a falſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the ordinate lines in a Parabola are not in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
but in ſubduplicate proportion to the diameters:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116063:57"/>
But, ſuppoſe it true, what then?) <hi>that of AB to AF, will
be duplicate to that of BI to FK.</hi> That is, <hi>Becauſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
lines in a Parabola, are in duplicate proportion to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters;
therefore thoſe Diameters are in duplicate proportion
to thoſe Ordinate lines.</hi> Which if it be not abſurd enough, I
would it were. Firſt, the proportion of the Ordinates,
muſt be duplicate to that of the Diameters, (becauſe M.
<hi>Hobs</hi> will have it ſo;) and then (by the virtue of <hi>Hocus
Pocus)</hi> this muſt be duplicate to that.</p>
            <p>To this you make no reply: but inſlead thereof, diſguiſe
the matter in your Leſſon, by putting <hi>double</hi> for <hi>duplicate,</hi>
as if they were all one; (though yet Chap. 13. art. 16. wee
have, in the Engliſh, a long harangue of your own to ſhew
the difference between them;) and then raile at thoſe
that firſt brought up the diſtinction; and tell us, (which is
notoriouſly falſe) that <hi>Euclide never uſed but one word for
Double and Duplicate;</hi> (that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are with M. <hi>Hobs</hi> but
one and the ſame word.) But what is all this to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off that abſurdity with which you are here char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?</p>
            <p>Next I ſhewed you, that your whole argument was
grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition; viz. that the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the motion in hand, was to be deſigned by the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabola
AKB; and that the ordinate lines in that Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabola,
(by which you would have the increaſing <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
to be deſigned) did increaſe in duplicate proportion
to their Diameters (by which you deſigne the Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
both which are falſe. For, theſe ordinate lines, are well
known (to all but M. <hi>Hobs)</hi> to increaſe in the Subdupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
(not the Duplicate) proportion of the Diameters:
And conſequently that <hi>Semiparabola</hi> can never expreſſe the
Aggregate of the <hi>Impetus</hi> thus increaſing.</p>
            <p>I did farther demonſtrate, that the point K, ought to
fall within the Triangle ABI, not without it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not in the Parabolicall line by you deſigned. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
was eaſy. For if the time AF be one halfe
of AB, that is, as 1 to 2: the <hi>Impetus</hi> increaſing in dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
proportion to the times, muſt be as 1 to 4; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
FK will be but a quarter of BI. But becauſe AF
is halfe of AB, therefore FN will be halfe of BI. And
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116063:57"/>
conſequently FK (a quarter) will be leſſe then FN, which
is the halfe of BI. Which becauſe you ſaw too evident to
be contradicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you thought it beſt (as your uſuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
is in ſuch caſes,) to raiſe at it in ſtead of anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed you farther, that the Aggregate of all the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in a motion thus accelerated, or the whole Velocity,
was not ⅔ of the Parallelogram AI, but only ⅓ of it.
For this aggregate is not to be deſigned by a Semiparabola,
but by the complement of a Semiparabola. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſtakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſequent thereunto. And indeed ſo many,
as that diſpairing of mending them all, you reſolved to let
them ſtand as they were.</p>
            <p>Yet I ſhewed you withall the chiefe ground of all theſe
miſtakes, and how they might have been mended. But it
appeares you had not the wit to underſtand it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
durſt not venture upon it. But have left this whole
article ſuch an Hodge podge of errors, as would turne a
quea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie ſtomach, but to examine it.</p>
            <p>And your Corollarys are falſe alſo.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Corollary, 'Tis falſe which you affirme, that
<hi>the proportion of the parabola ABI to the parabola AFK, is
triplicate to the proportion of the times, AB to AF,</hi> (as it is
in the Engliſh.) <hi>or of the</hi> Impetus <hi>BI to FK,</hi> (as it is in
the Latine.) This exception you confeſſe to be juſt, yet
leave it uncorrected in the Engliſh; becauſe you know not
how to mend it; without giving your ſelfe the ly in the
reſt. For as badde as it is, it follows, with the reſt of your
doctrine. It muſt all ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Corollary, (at leaſt, if underſtood of the
Parabola,) is alſo falſe; for the ſegments of a parabola
(of equall height) ſucceſſively from the Vertex, are not as
the numbers 7, 19, 37, &amp;c. the difference of the Cubes
1. 8, 27, 64, &amp;c. but us the differences of theſe ſurd nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers
1, √8, √27, √24. &amp;c. That which you
alledge to juſtify your ſelfe; that the <hi>parts of the Parabola
cut off are as the cubes of their baſes;</hi> is but a repetition of the
ſame error. They are not as the Cubes of their Baſes, but
as the ſquare roots of ſuch Cubes.</p>
            <p>The third Corrollary is wholly falſe, A motion ſo acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
doth not diſpach two thirds; but one third, of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116063:58"/>
what a uniform motion would have done, with an <hi>Impetus</hi>
equall to the greateſt of thoſe ſo increaſing. You ſay, <hi>I give
no demonſtration of it.</hi> (It may be ſo; and it's all one to me,
whether you believe it to be true or no. You may think, if
you pleaſe, that the Corollary is true ſtill; it will not hurt
me.) Yet if you conſidered what had been ſaid before,
you ſhould have ſeen the reaſon: viz. becauſe the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of the <hi>Impetus</hi> did not conſtitute a ſemiparabole, but
the complement of a ſemiparabola, which is not
⅔ but ⅓ of the Parallelogram.</p>
            <p>The fift article hath the ſame faults with the fourth;
and runnes all upon the ſame miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The main foundation of all theſe continued errors, was,
<hi>I</hi> told you, the ignorance of what is proportion duplicate,
triplicate, ſubduplicate, ſubtriplicate, &amp;c. <hi>Of three numbers
in continuall proportion, if the firſt be the leſt, the proportion of
the firſt to the ſecond is duplicate, of what it hath to the third,
not ſubduplicate:</hi> That was your opinion Cap. 13. § 16. of the
Latine. In the Engliſh, you have retracted that error in
part; yet retaine all the ill conſequences that followed
from it.</p>
            <p>Next, you ſuppoſe the Aggregates of the <hi>Impetus</hi> increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the duplicate, triplicate &amp;c. proportion of the times,
to be deſigned by the Parabola, and Parabolaſters, (as if
their ordinates did increaſe in the duplicate, tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
&amp;c. proportion of their Diameters; <hi>cujus contrarium
verum eſt;)</hi> whereas you ſhould have deſigned them by the
complements of thoſe figures, But you aske me <hi>what line
that</hi> (complement) <hi>is?</hi> No Line, good Sir, but a Figure,
which with the figure of the <hi>Semiparabola</hi> &amp;c. doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleare
the Parallelogram. You ought therefore (as I then
told you, but you underſtood it not,) to have deſcribed
your Parabola the other way; that the convex (not the
concave) of the parabolicall line ſhould haue been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the line of times AB. ſo ſhould the point K have
fallen between N and F; and the convex of the Parabola
with AT (the tangent) and BI (a parallel of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
have contained the complement of that parabola,
whoſe diameter therefore muſt have been AC, and its
Ordinate CI.</p>
            <p>Next, in purſuance of this error, you make the whole
velocity, in theſe accelerations (in duplicate, tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116063:58"/>
&amp;c. proportion of the times) to be ⅔, ¾, &amp;c. of the
velocity of an uniforme motion with the greateſt acquired
Impetus, (becauſe the Parabola and Parabolaſters, have
ſuch proportion to their Para <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lelograms) whereas they
are indeed but ⅓, ¼, &amp;c. thereof; for ſuch is the proportion
of the complements of thoſe figures, to their Parallelograms.
Now upon theſe falſe principles, with many more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
hereunto, you ground not only the doctrine of the
fourth and fifth Articles, but alſo moſt of thoſe that follow;
eſpecially the thirteenth and thenceforth to the end of the
Chapter: which are all therefore of as little worth as
theſe.</p>
            <p>But enough of this. The firſt five Articles therefore are
found to be unſound; and many ways faulty.</p>
            <p>The ſixth, ſeventh and eighth Articles, I did let paſſe
for ſound: And you quarrell with me for ſo doing. But
I ſaid withall, you might have delivered as much to better
purpoſe in three lines, as there you did in five pages. (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
ſuch petty errors all along as it were endleſſe every
where to take notice of) which gives you a new occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to raile at Symbols.</p>
            <p>After theſe three, there is not one ſound Article to the
end of the Chapter, and what thoſe were before, we have
heard already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ninth article is this,</hi> If a thing be moved by two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
at once, concurring in what angle ſoever, of which the one
is moved uniformely, the other with motion uniformely accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eated
from reſt, till it acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e an Impetus equall to that of the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niforme motion; the line in which the thing moved is carried,
will be the crooked line of a ſemiparabola. <hi>Very good! but
of what ſemiparabola? (for hitherto, we have nothing
but a proporſion of Galilaeo's tranſcribed.) You tell us,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t ſhall be that</hi> Semiparabola, whoſe Buſis is the Impetus laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
<hi>And this is the whole deſignation of your Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this deſignation I objected many things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Baſis of a <hi>Semiparabala</hi> is not an <hi>Impetus</hi>
but a <hi>Line:</hi> and therefore 'tis abſurd to talke of a <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabola</hi>
whoſe <hi>Baſis</hi> is an <hi>Impetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if it be ſaid that an <hi>Impetus</hi> may be deſigned
by a line; I grant it; (a line may be the Symbol of an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:116063:59"/>
as well as a Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but this line, is what line you pleaſe;
(for any <hi>Impetus</hi> may be deſigned by any line at pleaſure:) &amp;
ſo, to ſay that <hi>It is a Semiparabola, whoſe baſis is that line
which deſignes the Impetus:</hi> is all one as to ſay, <hi>it is a Semipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola,
whoſe baſis is what line you pleaſe.</hi> So that we have
not ſo much as the Baſis of this Semiparabola deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe that the Baſe had been determined,
(as it is not) yet it is a ſimple thing to think that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the baſis, doth determine the Parabola. For there may
be infinite Parabola's deſcribed upon the ſame Baſe. You
doe not tell us what Altitude, what Diameter, nor what
Inclination this Parabola is to have.</p>
            <p>Now to this you keep a bawling; but ſay nothing to
the buſineſſe. You tell us, that you had ſaid, <hi>what angle ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
That is, you ſuppoſed your <hi>Mevents</hi> to concurre in
<hi>what angle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſoever;</hi> but you ſayd nothing of what was to
be the <hi>angle of inclination in the Parabola.</hi> You might have
ſaid indeed, it was to be the ſame with that of the Movents:
But you did not; and therefore I blam'd you for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it.</p>
            <p>Then, as to the Diameter, you might have ſaid (but you
did not) that the line of the acccelerate motion, would
be the diameter. 'Twas another fault therefore not to ſay
ſo; for that had been requiſite, to the determining of the
Parabola.</p>
            <p>But when you had ſo ſaid; this had but determined the
Poſition of the diameter, not its magnitude: it may be
long or ſhort, at pleaſure notwithſtanding this.</p>
            <p>Then as to the altitude of it; this remaines as much unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
as the reſt. You tell us neither where the <hi>Vertex</hi>
is, nor how farre it is ſuppoſed to be diſtant from the <hi>Baſe.</hi>
you might have ſaid, (but you did not,) that the point of
Reſt, where the two motions begunne, was the <hi>vertex.</hi>
(And twas your fault you did not ſay ſo in the latine, as
you have now done in the Engliſh.) But had you ſo ſaid,
you had not thereby determined either the Altitude, or the
Diameters length.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>The vertex and Baſe being given, I had not the wit
to ſee that the altitude of the Parabola is determined.</hi> No true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nor have I yet. But it ſeems you had ſo little wit, as
to think it was. Had the <hi>vertex</hi> and <hi>Baſe</hi> been, <hi>poſitione data:</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:116063:59"/>
I confeſſe, it had been determined: (For then I had been
told how farre off from the Baſe, the Vertex had been.)
But when the Baſe is only <hi>magnitudine data,</hi> there, is no
ſuch thing determined. For a baſe of ſuch a bigneſſe, may
be within an Inch, and it may be above an E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l from the
Vertex, according as the Parameter is greater or leſſe.
Now you doe not pretend any other deſignation of the
Baſe, then that it be <hi>equall to ſuch an Impetus;</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
only the bigneſſe of it, not the diſtance from the
<hi>vertex.</hi> So that the altit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de, notwithſtanding this flamme,
remaines undetermined. (And muſt do ſo, whatever you
think, till you do determine the <hi>degree of celerity,</hi> which
anſwers to the Parameter of the Parabola; as well as the
<hi>manner of acceleration,</hi> which only determines that it is a
Parabola, but not what Parabola. The propoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is extreamly imperfect; nor doth determine that
which it did undertake to determine.</p>
            <p>The figure is yet worſe. You ſuppoſe the line AB, (fig. 6.)
by uniforme motion, to have diſpatched the length AC, or
BD, and ſo ly in CD; in the ſame time that the line AC, by
motion uniformely accelerated, diſpatcheth, the length
AB, or CD, to come and lye on CD. That is, (becauſe
AB, according to your figure, it about twiſe the length of
AC,) the motion accelerated doth, in the ſame time,
diſpatch about twiſe the length of what is diſpatched by the
uniforme motion. But it is evident, the accelerate motion
is all the way, to the very laſt point, ſlower than the
uniforme, (for by ſuppoſition, it doth not till the laſt point,
attain to that <hi>Impetus</hi> or ſwiftneſſe, with which the uniform
motion was carryed all the way.) Therefore according to
you, a ſlower motion doth, in the ſame time, diſpatch a
a greater length then the ſwifter, Which is abſurd enough:
And to which you make no reply.</p>
            <p>The demonſtration alſo (ſaving what you have from
<hi>Galileo)</hi> I then ſhewed you to be faulty; and you reply
nothing in its vindication and therefore I need not repeat
it. You have in the Engliſh a little diſguiſed the propoſition,
but to little purpoſe. The Parabola which you undertake
to determine, remaines as undetermined as it was before.
And the figure the ſame with all its faults: And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
no whit mended. So much of this Article as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116063:60"/>

               </gap> tooke out of <hi>Galileo</hi> was good, before you ſpoild it;
but the next is all naught.</p>
            <p>Your tenth Article doth but repeat all the faults of the
ninth, and you have nothing more to ſay in the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this then of that. The <hi>Parabolaſter</hi> here, remaines as
undetermined as the <hi>Porabola</hi> there; your Figure (fig. 6.)
makes the flower motion in the ſame time to diſpatch the
greater length; your demonſtration is faulty as that was.
Nay you have not here, ſo much as diſguiſed it in your
Engliſh, as you did the former; but left it as it was in the
Latine. So that this falls under the ſame condemnation
with the former.</p>
            <p>I hinted alſo, that we have here a great talke of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolaſters</hi>
which are not to be defined till the next Chapter.
But that's a ſmall fault. Your Engliſh helps it, by ſending
us thither for the definiton.</p>
            <p>Your eleventh Article undertakes to give us a generall
rule, to find <hi>what kind of line ſhall be made by the motion of a
body carryed by the concurſe of any two Movents, the one of them
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformely, the other with acccleration, but in ſuch proportion
of Spaces and Times as are explicable by Numbers, as Duplicate,
Triplicate &amp;c. or ſuch as may be deſigned by any broken num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
whatſoever.</hi> Your rule for this, ſends us to the Table of
Chap, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> art. 3. to ſeek there a <hi>Fraction</hi> whoſe <hi>Denominator</hi>
is to be the ſumme of the Exponents of Length and Time;
and its <hi>Numerator,</hi> the exponent of the Length. Upon this
I propoſed you a caſe which falls within your propoſition,
but not within your Rule: (to ſhew that your Rule
did not performe what you undertook to performe by it.)
<hi>Let the motions,</hi> ſayd I, <hi>be, the one, uniforme; the other acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate,
ſo as that the ſpaces be in ſubduplicate proportion to the
Times;</hi> or, in your language, as 1 to 2. We are therefore,
by your Rule, to ſeeek in the Table the fraction ⅓. But
there's no ſuch fraction to be found (nor any leſſe then ½.)
Your rule therefore doth not ſerve the turne. Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let's
heare what you have to ſay for your ſelfe. <hi>Did I not ſee</hi>
(you aske) <hi>that the Table is only of thoſe figures which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by the concourſe of a motion <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niforme, with a motion
accelerated.</hi> Yes I did, ſee that the table is only of ſuch: Nay
more, I ſaw (which is more to your purpoſe) that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is only of ſuch; (though yet if need be, I could
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116063:60"/>
ſhew you how the ſame figures might be deſcribed by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
retarded as well as motion accelerated,) &amp; therefore I
propoſed ſuch a caſe; viz. an acceleration in the ſubduplicate
proportion of the times, that is after the rate √1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> √2. √3.
√4. &amp;c. which is the ſubduplicate rate of 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>I had
no reaſon therefore,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to look for</hi> ⅓ <hi>in thae Takle.</hi> That is,
I had no reaſon to expect, that your Rule ſhould performe
what you undertake. But why no reaſon to expect it? <hi>For
my caſe is of motion uniforme concurring with motion retarded.</hi>
No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch matter, (nor be you ſo ſimple to think ſo,
whatever you here pretend;) for √1. √2. √3. √4. &amp;c.
is no decreaſing progreſſion, but increaſing: for √2, is more
then √1 &amp; √3, &amp; more then √2. &amp; ſo on. But why ſhould
you think it is not ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi> forſooth. <hi>I do not make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the ſpaces to that of the times duplicate, but ſubduplicate.</hi>

Squares? Think againe and you'l ſee they doe. Well, but
however, though this table will not ſerve the turne, yet the

               </gap>aſe may be ſolved, you tell us, another way. No doubt of
it. I could have told you ſo before. (For though you knew
not how to reſolve it; I did; and therefore directed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you
to the 64. Prop of my <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum;</hi> where you
have the caſe reſolved more univerſally then it is by you

            <p>Your twelfth propoſition, I ſaid, was wretchedly falſe;

hath well examined it) will ſay 'tis true? and that, in all
caſes? In ſome caſes I told you, it may happen to be true;
and in in other caſes it will be certainely falſe: (And I
told you alſo, when, and where.) And I did in the caſe
propoſed prove it ſo to be; and you can ſay nothing to
the demonſtration. You would indeed tell me of another
caſe wherein, you think it is true. But what's that to the
purpoſe? When I give inſtance to the contrary of a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
propoſition, you muſt allow me to lay the caſe as
I think good (ſo as it be within the limites of that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall)
and not as you would have me. The propoſition
therefore is demonſtrated to be falſe. And you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay in vindication of it.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth Article doth propoſe a <hi>Problem</hi> as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
as a man would deſire to read. 'Tis this <hi>Let AB</hi>
(fig. 8.) <hi>be a Length tranſmitted with uniforme motion in the

ſhall be tranſmitted in the ſame time with motion uniformly
accelerated, ſo as the</hi> Impetus (or, as in the Engliſh, the
<hi>line of the</hi> impetus) <hi>laſt acquired be equall to the ſtreight line
AC.</hi> The Anſwer ſay J to this Probleme, is <hi>what length
you pleaſe.</hi> (And you might as well have propounded, <hi>A
quantity being aſſigned which is equall to its foure quarters;
let it be required to find another quantity which is equall to its

altitude of a triangle on the ſame baſe.</hi> Where, <hi>what quantity you
will,</hi> doth ſerve for anſwer to the former: And, <hi>what alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
you will</hi> for the latter. And, <hi>what length you will,</hi> is the
anſwer to your Problem.) For there is no length aſſignable,
which may not, in any aſſignable Time, be diſpatched by
a motion uniformly accelerated, whoſe laſt <hi>Impetus</hi> ſhall be
what you pleaſe. And 'tis but as if you ſhould have asked;
<hi>What may be the height of that Parabola, or Triangle, whoſe
Baſis is equall to AC?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Problem being thus ridiculous, it cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that the conſtruction or demonſtration ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And truly 'tis pittifull ſtuffe all of it: as J then ſhewed.
And you do not ſo much as attempt any thing by way of
anſwer, to juſtify either your conſtruction or demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>You ask here, (for you have no more witt then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſuch a queſtion,) granting that <hi>a Parabola may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

ſomewhat to be done, not, of ſomewhat done already,)
<hi>by two motions, the one uniform, the other uniformly accelerated
from reſt; That the determining the Baſe, doth not alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the whole Parabola?</hi> J anſwer. Becauſe every <hi>Parabola</hi>
may be ſo deſcribed; (which if you did not know before,
you may now learn of me:) And therefore, ſince that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Baſe given, a Parabola may be deſcribed of any altitude
(as you grant;) and that every Parabola may be ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:
the determining of the Baſe, doth not determine the
Altitude of a Parabola ſo to be deſcribed; more then the
Altitude of a <hi>Parabola ſimpliciter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you would have done any thing to acquit your
ſelfe of the charge in this Article, (of propoſing a Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,

And therefore your Problem is as ridiculous as a man

            <p>There be divers other petty faults, that J took notice of

            <p>J noted farther that in all theſe Articles 13, 14, 15, 16,
as in thoſe before Art. 9, 10, 11. &amp; thoſe following 17, 18,
19. You doe every where make <hi>the ſlower motion, in the
ſame time, diſpatch the greater length.</hi> Which I did clearly
demonſtrate. To this you reply nothing to the purpoſe:
But cavill, that you might ſeem to ſay ſomething. You ſay,
<hi>I corrupt your Article by putting</hi> Movens <hi>for</hi> Mobile. But
there's no ſuch matter; for in the place alleadged (Art. 1.)
<hi>Movens</hi> is your own word, not mine. You ſay, <hi>'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whether</hi> AB <hi>or</hi> AC (in the fifth figure) <hi>be the greater.</hi>
Yes it is; it's impoſſible that AB, according to your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
ſhould be ſo bigge as AC; and yet, you have made
it almoſt twice as big. You ſay, <hi>you ſpeak of the concurſe of two
movents;</hi> very true. But each of thoſe movents have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
pace aſſigned them; &amp; therefore you ſhould not have
made the ſlower movent to rid more ground. And then
you would tell mee, <hi>what I think;</hi> and then talk of <hi>hard
ſpeculations,</hi> of <hi>edge</hi> and <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> &amp;c. But nothing to
the purpoſe. For when you have all done, its evident, and
you cannot deny, that in your 5 and 6 and 11 Figures, AB
is made welnigh twice as long as AC; and ſo again in your
8, 9, and 10, Figures AH much longer then AB; and yet
theſe longer lines deſigne the length, diſpatched by the
ſlower motions in the ſame time. For the motion accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which doth not till its laſt moment attain the
ſwiftneſſe, with which the uniform motion proceeds all the
way, muſt needs be ſlower then that uniform motion. But
this was a fault which I might ſafely have let paſſe; for
theſe Articles were ridiculous enough before.</p>
            <p>In the 17 Article, I ſhewed firſt, that the Propoſition,
as it was propoſed, was not perfect ſenſe. Then, that, the
ſenſe being ſupplied, the Propoſition was falſe. And laſtly,
that your Demonſtration had at leſt fourteen faults, and
moſt of them ſuch, as that any one was ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Propoſition was this,</hi> If in a time given, a Body run
over two lengths, one with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform, the other with accelerated
motion, in any proportion of the length to the time, And again in
a part of that time, it run over parts of thoſe lengths with the
ſame motions; the exceſſe of the whole longitude above the whole
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116063:63"/>
               <hi>(to what?)</hi> is the ſame proportion with the exceſſe of the part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the part, <hi>to what? Is this good ſenſe? No; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
there was ſomewhat</hi> left out in that Propoſition, <hi>but ſay,</hi>
it was abſurdly done to reprehend it. <hi>Very good! It ſeems you
muſt have the liberty to ſpeak non-ſenſe without controll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well; but how is the ſenſe to be ſupplied? we made
two or three eſſays the laſt time, and found never a one
would hold water, but which way ſoever we turned it,
the Propoſition was falſe. We have two proportions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
only by their Antecedents, and we are to gueſſe at
the conſequents. The beſt conjecture I could make was
this; <hi>As the exceſſe of the whole above the whole, is to</hi> one of
thoſe wholes; <hi>ſo is the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the part above the part,</hi> to
one of thoſe parts, (reſpectively.) That is (calling the
greateſt whole G, and its part <hi>g:</hi> and the leſſer whole L,
and its part <hi>l.)</hi> as G − L, to G; ſo <hi>g − l,</hi> to <hi>g.</hi> Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
thus; as G − L, to L; ſo <hi>g − l,</hi> to <hi>l.</hi> But both theſe
are found falſe. My next conjecture was from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
(but there I was fain to leave my propoſition quite, and
take up new Antecedents, as well as ſeek new conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,)
and that directs me to ſuch an Analogiſme (p. 140.
l. 39.) <hi>I ſay that as AH to AB, ſo AB, to AI;</hi> but this
is ambiguous, becauſe, AB comming twice, once as a whole,
and another time as a part, ſit doth not appear which is
which; therefore here be two conjectures more; viz. a
third thus, <hi>as the whole to the whole, ſo the part to the part;</hi>
(that is <hi>G. L∷ g. l.)</hi> Or fourthly thus, <hi>as the whole to
its part, ſo the whole to its part.</hi> (that is <hi>G. g∷ L. l.)</hi> But
theſe two are both falſe alſo. My next attempt was from the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (but here alſo I muſt deſert the propoſition
too, and ſeek new antecedents as well as conſequents,)
where I find it thus (p. 141. l. 7, 9.) <hi>as AH to AB, ſo is
the exceſſe of AH above AB, to the exceſse of AB above AI:
which was to be demonſtrated.</hi> that ſends me to a fifth, ſixth,
ſeventh and eighth analogiſme (becauſe it doth not appear
which AB is the whole, and which the part;) the fifth
thus, <hi>as the whole to the whole, ſo the exceſſe of the whole above
the whole, to the exceſſe of the part above the part,</hi> (taking AB
in the two firſt places for the whole) that is G. L∷
G − L. <hi>g − l.</hi> The ſixth thus, <hi>as the whole to the whole,
ſo the exceſſe of the whole above its part, to the exceſſe of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116063:63"/>
whole above its part</hi> (taking AB in the firſt and laſt place,
for the whole,) that is <hi>G. L∷ G − g. L − l.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
thus, <hi>as the whole to its part, ſo the exceſſe of the whole
above the whole, to the exceſſe of the part above the part,</hi> (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
AB in the firſt and laſt place for a part,) that is
<hi>G. g∷ G − L. g − l.</hi> The eighth thus, <hi>as the whole is
to its part, ſo the exceſſe of the whole above its part, to the exceſſe
of the other whole above its part,</hi> (taking AB in the two firſt
places, for the part,) that is <hi>G. g∷ G − g. L − l.</hi> But
theſe four be all falſe likewiſe, as well as thoſe before. Now
all theſe eight conjectures are of equall probability (though
all falſe) it cannot be ſaid which of them is more like to be
the ſenſe intended than the other. And yet, forſooth, when,
by talking non-ſenſe, you leave us at this uncertainty of
conjecture, it is (you ſay) <hi>abſurdly done to reprehend it.</hi> I
confeſſe, if any one of theſe Analogiſmes had been true,
we might have gueſſed that to be your meaning: but when
they be all equally probable, and equally falſe, which
ſhould we take? Well, but 'tis to be hoped, that now you
will tell us. You tell us therefore <hi>(Leſſ.</hi> p. 38.) it ſhould
be thus, <hi>as the exceſſe of the whole above its part, to the exceſſe of
the other wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le above its part, ſo that whole, to this whole:</hi> which
affords us a ninth analogiſme, G − g. L − l∷G. L.
which is coincident with my ſixth conjecture. And yet
again <hi>(Leſſ. p.</hi> 39.) you tell us, <hi>that the propoſition is now
made</hi> (in the Engliſh) <hi>according to the demonſtration</hi> (that is;
both falſe,) and there we find it thus, <hi>the whole to the
whole, as the part to the part;</hi> that is <hi>G. L∷g. l.</hi> which
allſo is coincident with our third conjecture. But
which ſoever of all theſe analogiſmes you take, the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is falſe, and therefore the demonſtration muſt needs
be ſo too.</p>
            <p>Now to prove that this Propoſition is falſe, which way
ſoever you turne it, (either as it was before, or as it is
now,) I made uſe of the figure of your firſt article, and
proceeded to this purpoſe. Let the whole time (fig. 1.) be
AB, an hour, (that is, becauſe I would not have you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
mee, as you doe Archimedes, let the line AB repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
an hour, or, be the ſymboll of an hour; for I would
not have you think that I take a <hi>line</hi> to be an <hi>hour;</hi> but to
repreſent an houre; and the letters AB to repreſent that
line, not to be that line; like as at another time we take
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116063:64"/>
a letter, without a line, to repreſent an houre:) and part
of that time AF, halfe an houre. Let alſo the continued
Impetus of the Uniform motion (I mean the Symboll of
it) be AC, or BI: which BI alſo is to be (the Symbol
of) the laſt acquired Impetus of the motion accelerated.
And this acceleration we will ſuppoſe at preſent (as your
ſelfe do in your <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to be uniform acceleration.
The velocity therefore of the whole uniform motion, will
be repreſented by the Parallelogram ACIB; (by the
firſt article;) and of it's part, ACHF; (by the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;)
The velocity of the whole uniformly accelerated
motion, will be the Triangle AIB; and of its part,
AKF; (by the ſame article.) Since therefore the lengths
diſpatched be proportionall to thoſe velocities; the whole
length of uniform motion, to the whole of the accelerate,
will be as the Parallelogram ACIB, to the Triangle
AIB, that is, as 2 to 1. (viz. the length of the uniform
motion, bigger than that of the accelerate; whereas your
figure and demonſtration, do all the way ſuppoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;)
ſo that if the uniform motion do in an houre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
16 yards, the accelerate will in the ſame time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
8 yards, (that is G = 16, &amp; L = 8.) Again, the
length diſpatched by the uniform motion in the whole
time; to that in half the time, is as the Parallelogram
ACIB, to the Parallelogram ACHF; that is, as 2 to 1;
ſo that if G (as before) be 16, then is <hi>g</hi> = 8. Laſtly; the
length diſpatched by the accelerate motion in the whole
time, to that in halfe the time, is as the Triangle AIB, to
the Triangle AKF; that is as 4 to 1, (for the ſides AB,
to AF, being as 2 to 1, and the triangles in duplicate
proportion to their ſides, the triangles will be as 4 to 1:)
So that if L (as before) be 8, then is <hi>l</hi> = 2. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus found the meaſures of theſe four lengths; (viz.
G = 16. L = 8. <hi>g</hi> = 8. <hi>l</hi> = 2.) You ſhall ſee that
thoſe Analogiſmes are all falſe; not one true amongſt them.
The firſt is this, G − L. G ∷ <hi>g − l. g.</hi> that is 16 − 8 =
8. 16 ∷ 8 − 2 = 6. 8. or 8. 16 ∷ 6. 8. But this is
falſe. The ſecond this, <hi>G − L. L</hi> ∷ <hi>g − l. l.</hi> that is
16 − 8. 8 ∷ 8 − 2. 2. or 8. 8 ∷ 6. 2. But this is falſe
alſo The third this, <hi>G. L ∷ g. l.</hi> that is 16. 8 ∷ 8. 2.
and this alſo is falſe. The fourth this, <hi>G. g ∷ L. l.</hi> that
is 16. 8 ∷ 8. 2. and this is alſo as falſe as the other. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116063:64"/>
fifth is this, G. L∷G − L. g − l. that is 16. 8∷16
− 8. 8 − 2. or 16. 8∷8. 6. which is alſo falſe. The
ſixth this, G. L∷G − g. L − l. that is 16. 8∷16 − 8.
8 − 2, or 16. 8∷8. 6. which is like the reſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
is this <hi>G. g∷G − L.</hi> g − l. that is, 16. 8∷16 − 8.
8 − 2 or 16. 8∷8. 6. falſe alſo. The eighth is this. G. g∷
G − g. L − l. that is 16. 8∷16 − 8. 8 − 2. or
16. 8∷8. 6. which is alſo falſe. The ninth is this,
G − g. L − l∷G. L. that is 16 − 8. 8 − 2∷16. 8.
or 8. 6∷16. 8. The tenth is like the third, <hi>G. L∷g. l,</hi>
that is 16. 8∷8. 2. all falſe. The propoſition therefore,
turne it which way you will, is a falſe Propoſition. And
yet you have the Impudence to tell us (though you knew
this before, for I told it you laſt time, and brought the
ſame demonſtration, to which you have not replied one
word) that <hi>'tis all true, and truly demonſtrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you think 'tis worth while after all this, to examine
your demonſtration? 'Tis a ſad one, I confeſſe; but tis
yours, and therefore it may perhaps be beautifull in your
eye. The laſt time we looked upon it, we found it had at
leaſt fourteen groſſe faults: (and moſt of them ſuch, as
were ſingly enough to deſtroy it:) enough in conſcience
for one poor demonſtration. (And had you not been
good at it, a man would have wondred how you could
have made ſo many <hi>ex tempore.)</hi> Since that time, 'tis quite
defunct. And there is a young one ſtart up in ſtead of it.
But 'tis of the ſame breed, and tis not two pence to chooſe,
whether this or that. Your new demonſtration runs it ſelf
out of breath at the firſt daſh. You had told us <hi>(Art. 3. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll.</hi>
3) <hi>In motion <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformly accelerated from reſt,</hi> (ſuch as is
one of theſe) <hi>the length tranſmitted</hi> (as here AH, fig 8.) <hi>is
to another length</hi> (viz. AB,) <hi>tranſmitted uniformly in the
ſame time, but with ſuch Impetus as was acquired by the acccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
motion in the laſt point of that time</hi> (juſt the caſe in
hand) <hi>as a Triangle to a Parallelogram which have their alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and baſe common,</hi> that is, as 1 to 2, <hi>for the Parallelogram
is double of the Triangle.</hi> So that AH, in your figure, ſhould
be but juſt half as bigge as AB; and you have made it all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
twiſe as big. And upon this foundation depends the
whole demonſtration. For if that fault were mended,
your whole conſtruction comes to nothing. And is not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116063:65"/>
this demonſtration then well amended? eſpecially when
you had faire warning of it the laſt time.</p>
            <p>And then you ſend us to the demonſtration of the 13
Article for confirmation of this, whereas that Article hath
been caſhiered long agoe, and the demonſtration with it.
But thus 'tis when men will not take warning.</p>
            <p>At length you fall to <hi>raating,</hi> (as you uſe to do when you
be vexed;) about <hi>skill,</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> and <hi>too much truſting;</hi>
about <hi>diſcretion, Hyperbole's,</hi> and Sir <hi>H. Savile,</hi> &amp;c. And
tell us that <hi>when a beaſt</hi> (Joſeph Scaliger) <hi>is ſlain by a Lion</hi>
(Clavius) <hi>'tis eaſy for any of the fowles of the aire</hi> (Sir H. S.)
<hi>to ſettle upon, and peck him.</hi> And <hi>Veſpaſian's</hi> law, no doubt,
will bear you out in all this. Only this I muſt tell you, that
Sir <hi>H. Savile,</hi> had confuted <hi>Joſeph Scaliger's</hi> Cyclometry,
as well as <hi>Clavius;</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, before him. Which if
you have not ſeen, I have.</p>
            <p>In the 18 Article, we have this Propoſition. <hi>If, in any
Parallelogram,</hi> (ſuppoſe ACDB, fig. 11.) <hi>two ſides contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an angle be moved to the ſides oppoſite to them,</hi> (as AB to
CD, and AC to BD,) <hi>one of them</hi> (AB) <hi>with uniform
motion, the other</hi> (AC) <hi>with motion uniformly accelerated: that
ſide which is moved uniformly</hi> (AB) <hi>will effect as much, with
its concurſe through the whole length, as it would do if the other
motion were alſo uniform,</hi> (or were not at all. For what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the other motion be, the motion of AB to CD, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
the thing moved with it from ſide to ſide, and that's
all. What point of the oppoſite ſide it ſhall come to, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the other tranſverſe motion, not upon this at
all. And this is ſo eaſy that no body would deny it. If you
mean any thing more then this, that it ſhall carry it juſt to
the oppoſite ſide &amp; no farther, your demonſtration doth not
at all reach it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But you go on) <hi>and the length tranſmitted by
it in the ſame time, a mean proportionall between the whole and
the halfe,</hi> of what? Till you tell us of what? I ſay, as I ſaid
before, that theſe words have no ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The conſtruction and demonſtration of this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I remember, we made ſad work with, the laſt time we
had to doe with them, as well as with thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Article; which will be now too long to repeat. The
whole weight of the Demonſtration lies, ſeverally, upon
at leſt theſe three Pillars, of which if any one do but fail,
the whole demonſtration falls. Firſt, upon the ſtrength
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116063:65"/>
of the 13 Article, which we have deſtroyed long agoe.
Secondly upon the 12 Article, which we have alſo long
ſince proved to be falſe. Thirdly, upon this learned aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<hi>the ſtreight line FB will be the exceſſe by which
the</hi> (leſſer) <hi>length tranſmitted by AC with motion uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accelerated, till it acquire the impetus</hi> BD, <hi>will exceed the</hi>
(greater) <hi>length tranſmitted by the ſame AC in the ſame
time with uniform motion, and with the Impetus every where
equall to</hi> BD. Which deſtroys it ſelfe. For if the accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
motion, as is ſuppoſed, do not till its laſt moment
acquire that ſpeed with which the uniforme motion is
moved all the way; then that muſt needs be ſlower than
this; and conſequently diſpatch a leſſer length in the
ſame time: whereas you according to your diſcretion,
make the length diſpatched by that ſlower motion, to be
more then that of the ſwifter in the ſame time, and tell us
the exceſſe is FB. And then to helpe the matter,
when I preſſe you with this abſurdity, you tell us you
ſpeak of <hi>motions in concurſe:</hi> as though in concurſe, the
ſlower motion did in the ſame time, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> diſpatch
a greater length than the ſwifter, though out of concurſe
the ſwifter motion did diſpatch a greater length than
the ſlower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now either of theſe three, much more all of
them, doth wholly deſtroy the ſtrength of your demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
Yet they that deſire to ſee more may conſult what
I ſayd before.</p>
            <p>The ninteenth Article doth not pretend to any other
ſtrength than that of the eighteenth. And therefore falls
with it.</p>
            <p>The twentieth Article I did before prove to be falſe and
frivolous. (it depended upon Chap. 14. Art. 15. Corol. 3.
which Corrollary <hi>I</hi> have there conſuted.) You ſay nothing
by way of vindication of what <hi>I</hi> excepted againſt; only paſſe
your word for it, that <hi>it is true.</hi> Yet withall confeſſe, <hi>there is
a great error;</hi> and that error ſay <hi>I,</hi> though there were nothing
elſe, would make that article unſound. But this article
you ſay, was <hi>never publiſhed</hi> (yet 'tis as good as moſt of thoſe
that were in this Chapter; for i'le undertake for it, there
he above a dozen worſe;) and therefore it was <hi>inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
done, you ſay, to take notice of it. Truly, if the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were a good propoſition, as you ſay it was. J think J
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116063:66"/>
did you a courteſy to publiſh it for you, that you may
have the credit of it; yet J ſhould not have done it, had
it not been publike before. If you would not have it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, you ſhould have taken care not to ſend it
abroad. For it hath been commonly ſold with the reſt of
your book (to many more perſons beſide my ſelfe;) they
that would, might teare it out (as ſome did) and they that
would, might keep it in, as J did.</p>
            <p>Well, (be the number of articles 20, or be they 19,)
before the ſixth there was none ſound, (but either in
whole or in part unſound,) and from the eighth there
hath been none ſound; therefore there have not been above
three ſound at the moſt. <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>

            <p>In the 17. Chapter, ſome of the Propoſitions are true
and good; (and truely I wondred at firſt where you had
them, but ſince I know:) But the demonſtrations are

your own (you know where you ſtole them;) and the
Demonſtrations are of your own making; (for there be

And tell us, that <hi>they are words that ſignify the ſame thing;</hi>
and, <hi>that they differ (in what ſubject ſoever) you never heard

did never know the difference between thoſe two words
till I taught you. (But this was your ignorance not my
fault.) But now, you know there is a difference. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116063:66"/>
therefore (contrary to what you had affirmed in the Latin)
you tell us in your Engliſh, Chap. 13. art. 16. p. 121.

proportion;</hi> for you confeſſe you did not, but tooke it
to be the ſame with <hi>double and ſubduple,</hi> and <hi>never heard that
they did differ till now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond Article, becauſe it is fundamentall to
thoſe that follow, I took the paines firſt to ſhew how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely
the propoſition and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were contrived;
and then to ſhatter your demonſtration all to pieces; and
ſhewed it to be as ſimple a thing as ever was put together,
(unleſſe by you, or ſome ſuch like your ſelfe.)</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, you tell us, that, <hi>to proceed which way you
pleaſed was in your own choice.</hi> And I take that for a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
anſwer. You did it, as well as you could; and they
that can do better may.</p>
            <p>As to the Demonſtration, you keep a vapouring (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe,) as if it were a good demonſtration.
and not confuted. Yet, when you have done, (becauſe
you knew it to be naught) you leave it quite out in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and give us another (as bad) in ſtead of it. That is,
you confeſſe the charge. Your fundamentall Propoſition
was not demonſtrated; and ſo this whole chapter comes
to nothing.</p>
            <p>But however, 'tis to be hoped, that your new demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
is a good one; is it not? No, 'Tis as bad as the
other. Only 'tis not ſo long: And of a bad thing, (you
know,) the leſſe the better. It begins thus, <hi>The proportion
of the complement BEFCD,</hi> (fig. 1.) <hi>to the deficient
figure ABEFC, is all the proportions of DB to OE, and
DB to QF, and of all the lines parallell to DB, terminated
in the line BEFC, to all the parallells to AB terminated in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116063:67"/>
the ſame points of the line BEFC.</hi> Now for this (beſides
that it is a piece of non-ſenſe) you ſend us for proof to the
<hi>ſecond Article of the 15. Chapter,</hi> where there is nothing at
all to that purpoſe. Then you go on. <hi>And ſeeing the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of DB to OE, and of</hi> DB <hi>to</hi> QF, <hi>&amp;c, are every where
triplicate to the proportion of AB to GE, and of AB to HF &amp;c.
the proportions of HF to AB, and of GE to AB, &amp;c. are
triplicate</hi> (no, but ſubtriplicate) <hi>of the proportions of QF to
DB, and of OE to DB &amp;c.</hi> Now this is but the ſame
Bull that hath been baited fo often. viz. <hi>becauſe the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
(DB, OE, QF, &amp;c. that is CA, CG, CH,) <hi>are in
the triplicate proportion of the Ordinates</hi> (AB, GE, HF,)
<hi>therefore theſe Ordinates are in the triplicate proportion of thoſe
diameters.</hi> You might as well have ſayd, <hi>ſeeing that 6 is the
triple of two therefore 2 is the triple of</hi> 6. But let's hear the reſt,
for there is not much behind.) <hi>And therefore the deficient fig.
ABEFC, which is the aggregate of all the lines HF, GE,
AB, &amp;c. is triple to the complement BEFCD, made of all
the lines QF, OE, DB, &amp;c.</hi> A very good conſequence!
<hi>Becauſe the Ordinates are in triplicate proportion to the diameters</hi>
(yet that is falſe too, for they are in ſubtriplicate) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the figure is triple to its complement?</hi> But how doe you
prove this conſequence? Nay, not a word of proof. We
muſt take your word for it. Well then, of this laſt Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem,
(which was directly to have concluded the queſtion,)
the Antecedent is falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the conſequence at leſt not
proved (<hi>I</hi> might have ſaid falſe alſo, for ſo it is.) And
this is your new demonſtration.</p>
            <p>The third article, I ſayd, falls with the ſecond; for
having no other foundation but that, (nor do you pretend
to other) that being undemonſtrated (for your former
demonſtration your ſelfe have thrown away, and your new
one we have now ſhewen to be nothing worth,) this muſt
be undemonſtrated too.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Article, you attempt the drawing of theſe
Curve lines, by point; and to that purpoſe require the
finding of as many mean proportionalls as one will,
(like as you had before done Cap. 16. 6. 16. for the finding
out an arbitrary line to be taken at pleaſure: Which I told
you was ſimply done, becauſe that without ſuch mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionalls,
(that is, without the effection of ſolid &amp; Lineary
problems,) it might have been done by the Geometry of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116063:67"/>
Plains, that is with Rule and Compaſſe. And I ſhewed
you how. To which you have nothing to reply, but, that
<hi>I made uſe of one of your figures</hi> (to ſave my ſelfe the labour
of cutting a new one,) that is, I made better uſe of your
figure then you could doe.</p>
            <p>The fifth propoſition (beſide that it is built upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and therefore falls with it,) is inferred only from the
<hi>Corrollary of the 28. article of the 13. Chapter,</hi> (nor doth
your Engliſh produce any other proof,) <hi>where,</hi> ſayd I,
<hi>there is not a word to that purpoſe.</hi> And you confeſſe it.</p>
            <p>The 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9. Art. do not pretend to other foundation
than the ſecond; &amp; therefore till that be proved, fall with it.</p>
            <p>The 10. Article is a ſad one, as may be ſeen by what
I did <hi>object againſt it,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>for almoſt three leaves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
One fault amongſt the reſt you take notice of, and
you would have your Reader think that's all; though there
be above twenty more. 'Tis this, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (in fig. 6.) B <hi>C is
to</hi> BF for ſo your words are, though your Leſſon miſ-recite
them, <hi>in triplicate proportion of CD, to FE; therefore, inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
FE, to CD is in triplicate proportion of BF to</hi> CB.
And doe you not take this to be a fault? No, you ſay, <hi>this
I did object then</hi> (Yes and doe ſo ſtill, as abſurd enough:)
<hi>But now,</hi> you ſay, <hi>you have taught me;</hi> (what a hard hap have
I, that I cannot learn;) <hi>That of three quantities,</hi> (you ſhould
rather have taken foure; but however three ſhall ſerve for
this turne,) <hi>beginning at the leſt,</hi> (ſuppoſe 1, 2, 8,) <hi>if the
third to the firſt</hi> (8 to 1) <hi>be in triplicate proportion of the
ſecond to the firſt</hi> (of 2 to 1) <hi>alſo, by converſion, the firſt to
the ſecond</hi> (1 to 2) <hi>ſhall be in triplicate proportion of the firſt
to the third,</hi> of 1 to 8. This is that you would have had me
learne. But, good Sir, you have forgotten that, ſince that
time, you have unlearned it your ſelfe. For your 16. <hi>artic.
of Chap.</hi> 13. as it now ſtands corrected in the Engliſh,
teacheth us another doctrine; viz. that if 1, 2, 4, 8, bee
continually proportionall, 1 <hi>to 8 ſhall be as well triplicate</hi>
(though not bigger) <hi>of 1 to</hi> 2, (not this triplicate of that,)
<hi>as 8 to 1 is of 2 to</hi> 1. The caſe is now altered from what
it was in the Latine. And therefore you are quite in a
wrong box, when, in your Engliſh, you cite <hi>Chapt.</hi> 13.
<hi>Art.</hi> 16, to patronize this abſurdity. For in ſo doing you
doe but cut your own throat. You muſt now learne to
ſing another ſong; called <hi>Palinodia.</hi> Well, this is one of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116063:68"/>
the faults of this article. They that have a minde to ſee
the reſt of them, may conſult what I ſaid before; where
I have noted a parcell of two dozen.</p>
            <p>In the 11. Article, you doe but undertake to demonſtrate
a propoſition of <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Your demonſtration (beſides
that it depends upon the ſecond Article which is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrated)
is otherwiſe alſo faulty, as I then told you.
And therefore to ſay, that <hi>I allow this to be demonſtrated, if
your ſecond bad been demonſtrated;</hi> is an untruth. For I told
you then, that your manner of inferring this from that, is
very abſurd.</p>
            <p>The 12 Article (like all the reſt, ſince the ſecond, beſide
their other faults,) depends upon the ſecond; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
till that be demonſtrated, this muſt fall with it.</p>
            <p>In the 13. Art. you undertake to demonſtrate this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Archimedes;</hi> that <hi>the Superficies of any portion of a Sphere,
is equall to that circle, whoſe Radius is a ſtreight line drawn from
the pole of the portion to the circumference of its baſe.</hi> Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
I ſaid, was of no force; but might as well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to a portion of any <hi>Conoeid,</hi> Parabolicall, Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
Ellipticall, or any other, as to the portion of a ſphere.
<hi>By the truth of this,</hi> ſay you, <hi>let any man judg of your and my Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</hi>
Content, 'Tis but tranſcribing your demonſtration;
&amp; inſerting the words <hi>Conoeid, Vertex, ſection by the Axis, &amp;c.</hi>
where you have <hi>Sphere, Pole, great Circle &amp;c.</hi> which termes:
in the Conoeid, anſwer to thoſe in the Sphere, and the
worke is done.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>BAC,</hi> (in the ſeventh figure,) be a portion of a ſpheare,
<hi>or Conoeid, Parabolicall, Hyperbolicall, Ellipticall, &amp;c.</hi>
whoſe Axis is <hi>AE,</hi> and whoſe baſis is <hi>BC;</hi> and let <hi>AB</hi> be
the ſtreight line drawn from the Pole, <hi>or vertex, A,</hi> to the baſe
in <hi>B:</hi> and let <hi>AD,</hi> equall to <hi>AB,</hi> touch the Great circle, <hi>(or
Section made by a plain paſſing through the Axis of the
Conoeid,) BAC,</hi> in the Pole, <hi>or vertex, A.</hi> It is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that a Circle made by the Radius <hi>AD,</hi> is equall to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the portion <hi>BAC.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the plain <hi>AEBD</hi> be underſtood to make a revolution
about the Axis <hi>AE. And</hi> it is manifeſt, that, by the ſtreight line
<hi>AD,</hi> a circle will be deſcribed; and, by the Arch, <hi>or Section,
AB,</hi> the ſuperficies of a Sphere, <hi>or Conoeid mentioned;</hi> and
laſtly, by the ſubtenſe <hi>AB,</hi> the ſuperficies of a right Cone.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing both the ſtreight line <hi>AB,</hi> and the Arch <hi>or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116063:68"/>
AB,</hi> make one and the ſame revolution; and both of them
have the ſame extreme points <hi>A</hi> &amp; <hi>B:</hi> The cauſe why the Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
<hi>or Conoeidicall</hi> Superficies which is made by the Arch
<hi>or Section,</hi> is greater then the Conicall ſuperficies which is
made by the ſubtenſe, is, that <hi>AB</hi> the Arch <hi>or Section,</hi> is
greater then <hi>AB</hi> the ſubtenſe: And the cauſe why it is greater,
conſiſts in this, that although they be both drawn from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B,</hi>
yet the ſubtenſe is drawen ſtreight, but the arch <hi>or Section</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly;
namely, according to that angle which the arch <hi>or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
makes with the Subtenſe; which angle is equall to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<hi>DAB.</hi> For the Angle of Contact, <hi>whether of Circles or
other crooked lines,</hi> addes nothing to the angle at the ſegment:
as hath been ſhewn, <hi>as to Circles,</hi> in the 14 Chapter of the 16
article: <hi>and as to all other crooked lines, Leſſon 3. pag.</hi>
28. <hi>lin. ult.</hi> Wherefore the magnitude of the angle <hi>DAB,</hi> is
the cauſe why the ſuperficies of the portion deſcribed by the Arch
<hi>or Section AB,</hi> is greater than the ſuperficies of the right Cone
deſcribed by the Subtenſe <hi>AB.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the cauſe why the Circle deſcribed by the tangent
<hi>AD,</hi> is greater then the ſuperficies of the right Cone deſcribed
by the ſubtenſe <hi>AB,</hi> (notwithſtanding that the Tangent and
Subtenſe are equall, and both moved round in the ſame time,)
is this, that <hi>AD</hi> ſtands at right angles to the axis, but <hi>AB</hi>
obliquely; which obliquity conſiſts in the ſame angle: <hi>DAB.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that the quantity of the angle <hi>DAB,</hi> is
that which makes the exceſſe both of the Superficies of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the Circle made by the Radius <hi>AD,</hi> above the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the Right Cone deſcribed by the Subtenſe <hi>AB:</hi> It
followes, that both the Superficies of the Portion, and that of
the Circle, do equally exceed the Superficies of the Cone. Wherefore
the Circle made by <hi>AD</hi> or <hi>AB,</hi> and the Sphericall <hi>or Cono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eidicall</hi>
Superficies made by the arch <hi>or Section AB,</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to one another. Which was to be proved.</p>
            <p>Shew me now if you can, (for you have pawned all
your Geometry, upon this one iſſue,) where the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
halts more on my part then it doth on yours? Or,
where is it, that it doth not as ſtrongly proceed in the caſe
of any Conoeid, as of a Sphere? All that you can think
of by way of exception (and you have had time to think
on't ever ſince I wrote laſt,) amounts to no more but this
(which yet is nothing to the purpoſe) you ask, <hi>In caſe the
crooked line</hi> AB, <hi>were not the arch of a Circle, whether do I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116063:69"/>
think, that the angles which it makes with the Subtenſe</hi> AB,
<hi>at the points</hi> A <hi>&amp;</hi> B, <hi>muſt needs be equall?</hi> I ſay, that (its
poſſible, that in ſome caſes, it may be ſo; and J could for
a need, ſhew you where; and therefore, at leaſt as to thoſe
caſes, you are clearely gone; for you had nothing elſe to
ſay for your ſelfe; but) this is nothing at all to the purpoſe
whether they be or no; For the angle at B, what ever it
be, comes not into conſideration at all; nor is ſo much
as once named in all the demonſtration; So that its equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or inequallity, with that at A, makes nothing at all to
the buſineſſe. And therefore your exception is not worth
a ſtraw. Think of a better againſt the next time; or elſe all
your Geometry is forfeited. And they are like to have a
great purchaſe that get it, are they not?</p>
            <p>At the 14. Article; (having before, Art. 4. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
to teach the way of drawing and continuing thoſe
curve lines, by points: and directed us (for the word
<hi>require</hi> doth not pleaſe you) for that end to take mean
proportionalls;) you now tell us how that may be done;
viz. by theſe curve lines firſt drawn. I asked, whether this
were not to commit a circle? You tell me, No. But mean
while take no notice of that which was the main objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
viz. That this conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yours was but going about
the buſh; for, upon ſuppoſition that we had thoſe lines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
drawn, the finding of mean proportionalls by them
might be performed with much more eaſe than the way
you take. And I ſhewed you, How.</p>
            <p>But that which ſticks moſt in your ſtomach, is a clauſe in
the cloſe of this Chap. I told you that ſome conſiderable
Propoſitions of this Chapter (and I could have told you
which) were true, (though you had miſſed in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,)
however you came by them. But that I was
confident they were none of your own. (and you know,
I gueſſed right.) And leaſt you ſhould think I dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
to intimate that you had them elſewhere: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
I could ſhew you where: I told you, that I did no
worſe than thoſe that a while before, had <hi>hanged a man
for ſtealing a horſe from an unknown perſon.</hi> There was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough that the horſe was ſtolen; though they did
not know from whom. So, though I knew not whence
you had taken them, yet I have ground enough to judge
they were not your own. And ſince that time, (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116063:69"/>
that book was fully printed,) I found whence you
had them; namely out of <hi>Merſennus,</hi> (as I told you then
pag. 132, 133, 134.) And to take them out of <hi>Merſennus,</hi>
was all one as to rob <hi>a Carrier;</hi> for there were at leſt
three men had right to the goods, (and ſome of them if
they had been asked, would ſcarce have given way that
you ſhould publiſh their inventions in your own name,)
<hi>Des Chartes, Fermat,</hi> and <hi>Robervall:</hi> And perhaps a fourth
had as much right as any one of theſe; and that is <hi>Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerio,</hi>
who (though, I then did not know it) hath (contrary
to what you affirme, that they were never demonſtrated
by any but you ſelfe; and that as wiſely as one could wiſh:)
demonſtrated thoſe propoſitions in a Tractate of his <hi>De uſu,
Indiviſibilium in poteſtatibus Coſſicis.</hi> But though the thing be
true enough and you cannot deny it, yet you doe not like
the <hi>Compariſon.</hi> And would have me conſider, <hi>who it was,
was hanged upon Hamans Gallows?</hi> And truly J could tell you
that too, for a need. The firſt letter of his name was H. But
enough of this.</p>

         <div n="12" type="section">
            <head>SECT. XII. Concerning his 18, 19, 20. Chapters.</head>
            <p>WELL! We have made pretty quick work with
the 17 Chapter. With the 18 we ſhall be yet
quicker.</p>
            <p>The charge againſt this Chapter, was, that <hi>it was all falſe.</hi>
And, you confeſſe it. Not one true Article in the whole.</p>
            <p>But, you tell us, in the Engliſh 'tis all well. <hi>It is now ſo
corrected in the Engliſh as that I ſhall not be able (if I can
ſufficiently imagine motion,</hi> that is, if I can be giddy enough,)
<hi>to reprehend.</hi> Very well! ('Tis a good hearing when men
grow better.) They that have a mind to believe it, may:
I am not bound to undeceive them. We have had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
all along, that you have a ſpeciall knack at mending.
(as ſowr Ale doth in ſummer.) You grant that <hi>I have
truly demonſtrated,</hi> what was before, <hi>to be all falſe.</hi> You would
have me do ſo again, would you? Very good! When I
have nothing elſe to doe I'le conſider of it. They that
think it worth the while, may take the pains, to examine
it a ſecond time. For my part, I think I have beſtowed as
much pains upon it already, as it deſerves, (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116063:70"/>
more:) And all the amendment that I find, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that whereas before wee had <hi>three</hi> falſe articles, now we
have but <hi>two;</hi> and the number of true ones, juſt as many
as we had before, viz. <hi>never a one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 19 Chapter there were faults enough in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(for a matter of no greater difficulty than that was;)
I noted ſome of them (and left the Reader to pick up the
reſt:) Two or three of the lighter touches, (about me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,)
you take notice of, and make a buſineſſe to juſtify
or excuſe them; and the main exceptions (as you uſe to do)
you paſſe over with a light touch, and a way.</p>
            <p>I told you, in the beginning of it, that your Chapters
hang together <hi>like a rope of ſand.</hi> And 'tis true enough, for
they have no connexion at all. There are ſo few <hi>hooked
atomes,</hi> that a man cannot tell how to tacke them together.</p>
            <p>Next, that having in your 24 Chapter undertaken to
ſhew us, what is the <hi>Angle of Incidence;</hi> and, what, the
<hi>Angle of Reflexion;</hi> and, that the <hi>Angles of Incidence and of
Reflexion are equall:</hi> you do, in purſuance of that aſſertion,
in this 19 chapter, ſhew us the <hi>conſequences thereof.</hi> Upon
this I asked; why not, either this after that; or that before
this? You tell me, that <hi>(think I what I will,) you think
that method ſtill the beſt;</hi> (to ſet the Cart before the Horſe.)
Then you tell us, that <hi>I ſay, you define not here.</hi> (Nay that's
falſe, I did not ſay ſo; and 'tis not the firſt time that I have
taken you tripping in this kind;) <hi>but many Chapters after,</hi>
(that I ſaid, I do confeſſe; and you know 'tis true;) <hi>what
an Angle of Incidence, and what an Angle of Reflexion is.</hi>
And then, talk againſt <hi>haſt,</hi> and <hi>overſight.</hi> But if your ſelfe
had not been <hi>over haſty,</hi> (or rather willfully perverted my
words,) you might have ſeen (and you know it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
that I blamed you here, and two or three times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not ſo much for <hi>uſing words, before you had defined them</hi>
(for this fault, as J remember, J mentioned but once; and
there you took it patiently:) but for <hi>defining words ſo long
after you had uſed them.</hi> For when words, for two or three
chapters together, have been ſuppoſed, and frequently ſo
uſed, as of known ſignification, (whether they had been
before defined, or not,) it is ridiculous for a Mathen atici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to come dropping in with definitions of them at latter
end, (as your faſhion is,) like muſtard after meat. For theſe
definitions ſhould either have come in due time, or elſe
not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:116063:70"/>
The two firſt Articles are very triviall. And yet (as if it
were impoſſible for you, be the way never ſo plaine, not
to ſtumble) there wants, at leaſt in the Engliſh, a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the ſecond Corollary; and yet (as if that were
to make amends for t'other) there's one too much. <hi>If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any point</hi> (ſay you) <hi>between B and D,</hi> fig. 2. (yes, or any
where elſe upon the ſame ſtreight line, produced either
way, though not between thoſe points,) <hi>there fall (from
the point</hi> A, you ſhould have ſaid,) <hi>a ſtreight line, as AC,
whoſe reflected line is CH, this alſo produced beyond C, will
fall upon F.</hi> Here, I ſay, that limitation <hi>between B and D,</hi>
is redundant; and that <hi>from the point A,</hi> is wanting. For
though C. be taken at pleaſure, yet A is not, And if it
come not from A, its reflex will not come at F.</p>
            <p>The third, fourth, and fifth Articles, I told you were
falſe. <hi>(viz.</hi> The Propoſitions affirme that univerſally, which
holds true but in ſome particular caſe. And the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
proceed <hi>ex falſis ſuppoſitis,</hi> ſuppoſing that to be,
which is not; or is, in many caſes, impoſſible.) And this
you confeſſe to be true; but take it unkindly to be told
of it. You have endeavoured a little to patch up the
buſineſſe in the Engliſh, but not ſo as to hold water. For
they are yet lyable to divers exceptions if it were worth
the while to unravell them.</p>
            <p>The eight Article was ridiculous enough. It makes a huge
buſineſſe to no purpoſe. (You ſpend the beſt part of two
pages to reſolve a Problem which might as well have been
diſpatched in two lines.) And you doe as good as confeſſe

Latine for <hi>to Bring.</hi>

            <p>The Twent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth Chapter will be ſoon diſpatched. This
Chap. all but the two laſt Art. is wholly new, as it is now
in the Engliſh: that which you had before in the Latine,
being wholly routed &amp; beat out the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (&amp; your <hi>Problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
dictum</hi> into the bargain.) We had in your Latine three
attempts for the ſquaring of a circle; but they all came
to naught, and are now vaniſhed. In your Leſſon, you
give us a fourth; endeavouring to new mould and rally
one of the former, which I had before routed; And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to vindicate it from the exceptions I had made to
it: But not an anſwer to any one of them; nor is
this new attempt better than the former, but retaines
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116063:71"/>
moſt of the fundamentall errors therein; And when you
have all done, you caſhier it your ſelfe and dare not inſiſt
upon it. Beſide this, you have in your Engliſh, yet three
attempts more; and much a doe there is with long and
perplexed figures to no purpoſe. They are by your own
confeſſion but <hi>Aggreſſions;</hi> and you doe not your ſelfe <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them to be exact.</hi> You doe not, I ſuppoſe, think it
worth the while for me to confute them, (or if you doe
I doe not;) for to what purpoſe? That you have <hi>attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it,</hi> (ſeven times over,) no man can deny; That your
attempts <hi>come to nothing,</hi> your ſelfe confeſſe; Only, you
think it convenient to let the Reader know what paines
you have taken to no purpoſe. For my part, J doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to follow you in all your new freakes: nor think my
ſelfe ingaged to confute falſe quadratures as oft as you ſhall
make them. I have done enough already, to let the world
ſee, how little 'tis that you underſtand in Geometry, and
how much they deceive them ſelves who expect any great
matter from you.</p>
            <p>Your two laſt Articles ſtand as they were, and ſo doth
my anſwer to them. Your attempt of finding <hi>a ſtreight line
equall to a Spirall;</hi> is but an <hi>attempt,</hi> as well as that of <hi>ſquaring
a Circle.</hi> Your rant at Analyticks, with which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it, (like doggs barking at the Moon,) hurts no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but your ſelfe. That Art will live when you be dead;
and thoſe that know it, will not think it ever a whit the
worſe for your not underſtanding it, or rayling at it.</p>
            <p>The following Chapters I did let alone before, and ſo
ſhall doe now: not becauſe J like them better than thoſe
that went before, or think the matter therein to be true;
but becauſe I have done enough already. I told you then,
that much of them was taken out of others, (and I told
you from whence, and you cannot deny it;) And that
much was falſe. Now this, (becauſe I did not think it
worth while to inſiſt upon a particular confutation,) you
ſay, is <hi>a Lye;</hi> yet, you know that <hi>Tacquet</hi> hath confuted
much of it; and, to ſo good purpoſe, as that beſide other
alterations, you have been fain, you tell us, to make <hi>the
twenty-fourth Chapter almoſt all new.</hi> But whether you have
made it <hi>better</hi> or no, than it was before, they that have a
mind thereto, may, if they pleaſe, take the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

            <p>You had, in your Latine, a railing rant againſt <hi>Vindex,</hi>

            <p>Which is a ſuſpicion like to that of p. 57. that <hi>ſome of
