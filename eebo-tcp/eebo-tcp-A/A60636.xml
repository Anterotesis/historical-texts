            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVer since the Devil (that enemy of Mankind, who is the leader of Nature out of its course) got rule in Man's heart, his work and way hath been to stir up his Instruments, first, to cast Ignominious reproachful names upon the true Worshippers of God, as New Sects, <hi>Turners of the World upside down, Pestilent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Sowers of Sedition, Ring-leaders of Sects, Blasphemers, Hereticks, Seditious Sectaries, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of Plots,</hi> and <hi>Stirrers up of Rebellion, &amp;c.</hi> Then when he hath by his Emissaries cloathed them in this mantle of Reproach, he can the easilier bring his designs to pass upon them; whether it be to Imprisoning in nasty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious holes, or Whipping, Banishing, Burning or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which hath been his work through Ages, among both false <hi>Jews</hi> and false <hi>Christians,</hi> as well as among those called <hi>Heathen,</hi> to this day: for as once among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> it was crime enough to cause the true <hi>Christians</hi> to suffer, to have the Name of a <hi>Christian</hi> (which was a name of Reproach in that day) and carried enough with it to be guilty of all Crimes, in the judgment of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58673:3"/>
believed all that was spoke and published against them, though they saw no proof: The like Parallel is now; we have the name <hi>Quaker</hi> given us in reproach and derision, and its crime enough to cause us to suffer (before and among some) to have that name; And what is spoke and published, surmised and evilly suggested of us, many believe without any manifest proof: but the Wise and Judicious will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and believe every Report, nor give Judgment of any Person or People because of a Name, Speech, or Report, though it be from the mouth of a Judge, but will desire to know the Truth; therefore to inform such is this Reply fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing published.</p>
            <p>And we may truly say for ourselves, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apollogie once said for the <hi>Christians,</hi> when the <hi>Heathen</hi> called their Society, Meetings or Assemblies, <hi>Factious; Did we ever</hi> (saith he) <hi>assemble to proclaim the hurt of any one?</hi> As we are in the particular, so we are in the general; that is to say, In whatsoever state we are found, we offend no body, we injure no body: And further, saith he, <hi>when any vertuous or godly People are associated, when any pious or chast persons assemble together; their Union should not be called a Faction, but a Lawful Society.</hi> pag. 142.</p>

               <p>Our Conversation for these many years, hath been noted, and strictly observed by many, and hitherto we have not been found Transgressors of any Law which is made to preserve mens Persons or Estates, or for the punishment of Evil-doers; And so have not given the Magistrates occasion justly to appoint days of Tryal for us.</p>
               <p>For the Law once in Tables of Stone, and all other just Laws were and are added because of mans degeneration from the Law and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Principle of Life, which was once, or at the beginning, placed in his heart: So when man fell from his obedience to this Righteous Law (which we say was not in a Book, nor in Tables of Stone, in the beginning, but in the Heart) and abounded in Acts of Cruelty, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Oppression and Idolatry, Then because of these Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions was that Outward Law added, in order to limit, bridle and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and also to bring Mankind back again in a measure to that which he degenerated from, as <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth <hi>(viz.)</hi> to the Word in the month and in the heart, that they might hear it and do it (or obey it.) And true Christians are come to Christ Jesus, who is the Power of God; and are created anew in him unto <hi>good works,</hi> that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58673:4"/>
they should walk in them; and are made Witnesses of that <hi>Glorious Promise fulfilled in them,</hi> (viz.) <hi>as to have the Law written in their hearts, and the Fear of the Lord put into their inward parts;</hi> which Law and Fear teacheth to depart from evil, and crucifieth that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing spirit within, from whence all manner of wickedness proceeds; and against such there is (or ought to be) no Law <hi>they being a Law to themselves,</hi> as it is written, <hi>The Law is not made for the Righteous man; but for the Lawless and Disobedient, for the Ungodly and for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for Unholy and Prophane, for Murderers of Fathers and Murderers of Mothers, for Manslayers, for Whoremongers and Buggerers (or abusers of themselves with mankind) for Man-stealers, for Lyars, for Perjured Persons, and any other evils which are contrary to sound Doctrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now seeing we are preserved by the Power of the living God, (whom we fear and serve) from those and such-like evils (which are the occasion of Law and Magistrates, otherwise there would be no need of either) and yet notwithstanding are persecuted and thronged into nasty Holes and Prisons, and guarded with a great many Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Bill-men, and haled before Judgment-Seats and Rulers, as if we were great malefactors: This makes People slock together, and expect, and also wonder what will be the end of these things; That People against whom no evil can be justly charged, should be the greatest Sufferers in this Generation: And pity and compassion will arise in thousands, who shall see or hear of our Sufferings for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Conscience towards God, notwithstanding our cruel Adversaries endeavour to cloath us in Woolf-skins, to make people believe that we are the Beasts of Prey, and a <hi>Stubborn Sect, which will not be reclaimed by the Mercy of the King, nor the Purity of the Church of</hi> England. As for the <hi>Kings Mercy</hi> it cannot save us, if we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress against God, and make shipwrack of Faith and a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; his Righteous Judgments will find us out, and we must give an account to him; and walk so, as we may partake of <hi>His</hi> Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the King as well as the Beggar hath and will have need of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; howbeit we never yet forfeited our Interest in the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of <hi>Liberty to tender Consciences,</hi> so often renewed by him; though it appears by this Judge's so much inveighing against us, that he would fain make people believe we do not deserve our Liberty or Interest therein; but that will not clear him nor them in the sight of God concerning those Promises.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58673:4"/>
And as for the <hi>Purity of Englands Church</hi> it's out of our sight, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it consists much in <hi>Swearing,</hi> which the Judge saith is a special part of God's Worship: If this be <hi>Purity,</hi> there's too much of that among the members thereof; but that will never reclaim us, for we can see a great deal of <hi>Impurity,</hi> Corruption and Soul-sickness in it; And as much the members of it confess themselves, <hi>That they are full of putrified sores, from the crown of the head to the soal of the feet; and that there is no health nor soundness in them; And that they do those things they should not do, and leave undone those things they should do; And that they are Miserable Offenders, and sin in their Best Performances:</hi> Indeed they speak enough of themselves to cause all wholsome, sound, understanding People to shun them and their Church and Worship, as men shun a Contagious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease or Infection; And it is manifest that the Nature and Spirit of Christianity is wanting among them, and that the spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> (that worshipper, who was the first Murderer about Religion) rules among them: And what weapons have they ever used to reclaim us (or call us) back again to worship as they do? have not their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons been Carnal, and the course they have taken Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by stirring up the Magistrates to make cruel Laws against us? which was never the true Christians work nor way to bring people to believe their Doctrine, and to worship as they did, but <hi>Cains</hi> way; and his wages will all Persecutors about Religion receive from the hand of the Lord, as a just recompence of reward.</p>

                  <hi>They teach dangerous Principles; this for one,</hi> That it is not lawful to take an Oath. <hi>You must not think their Leaders believe this Doctrine themselves, only they perswade these poor ignorant souls so; but they have an Interest to carry on against the Government, and therefore they will not swear Subjection to it; and their end is Rebellion and Blood. You may easily know that they do not believe themselves what they say, when they say it is not lawful to take an Oath, if you look into the Scriptures; that Text</hi> (Mat. 5.) <hi>where our Saviour saith,</hi> [Swear not at all] <hi>will clear it self from such a meaning as for bids Swearing, if you look but into the next words, where it is said,</hi> Let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay; <hi>and it is said,</hi> an Oath is the end of all strife; <hi>this for the New Testament: And the Old is positive for Swearing. And they that deny Swearing, deny God a special part of his Worship.</hi>

               <p>Our Principles are Truth, and according to the Scriptures of Truth; but that great Evil, to call <hi>Light darkness,</hi> and <hi>darkness Light; Good evil,</hi> and <hi>evil Good,</hi> is befaln this Generation; And that which leads to <hi>Unity</hi> and the Preservation of Mankind is now counted <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> and <hi>destructive.</hi>

               <p>Swearing, or taking of Oaths was not in the beginning, there was no need or occasion for it, Strife was not begun; but when Man broke his <hi>Unity</hi> with God, and ran into Disobedience, then Strife, and every evil work followed among men: Then to limit this evil spirit which Man followed into Transgression, an Outward Law was added, and <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Vowing</hi> under a Curse came up; and such as vowed were to perform their Vows unto the Lord; and those that swore, were to swear by, or in the Name of the Lord, and not in or by the name of an Idol, or any other creature; and this was in the Fall, while the Wall of Partition stood: Now Christ who is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer and the maker up of Breaches, (who was with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of these things were) in the Fulness of time, in a Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, he appeared, to fulfill the Law, and to put an end to Sin, which was the occasion of the Law) and to finish Transgression, and to bring in Everlasting Righteousness; and to restore and bring Man back again into the knowledge and unity of his Maker, from whom he fell by disobedience: And these things which the Father sent him to do, he finished and finisheth; for all that received, believed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivet and believe in him, and follow him in the Regeneration.</p>
               <p>And while he was with his Disciples, in that prepared Body in which he came to do the Will of the Father, he gave forth many Precepts and Commands unto them, among which this is one, minding them how it was in old time <hi>(viz.)</hi> under <hi>Moses</hi> Law, how that they were to swear, and perform their Vows to the Lord; But saith he <hi>(who was before Moses was) I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by one thing or another; but let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil.</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and the Old time saith also, <hi>An eye for an eye,</hi> and <hi>a tooth for a tooth, smiting for smiting,</hi> and that they should <hi>love their neighbour and hate their enemies;</hi> but Christ taught and teacheth his Disciples a harder lessen, of Bearing and Forhearing, Love, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Heavenly-kindness, that they might be more like their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58673:5"/>
heavenly Father than <hi>Moses</hi>'s Disciples were; for saith he, <hi>if you love them that love you,</hi> and if you are friendly to your Brethren on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>what do you do more than sinners? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he that was before the Law, leads to the End of the Law, (which is <hi>Love)</hi> and brings those that follow him, to be like-minded to him: as the Christians in the Primitive times were, who said, they had the mind of Christ; and did exhort one another to the same. And that this Command of Christ forbids all Swearing, is not only clear from the end, and circumstance of the foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, but also from the Apostle James's Exhortation; who said <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven nor Earth, nor any other Oath, lest ye fall into condemnation.</hi> And it is also written, <hi>that if any say they love Christ, and keep not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, they are Lyars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So who ever reads these Scriptures <hi>(Mat. 5. Jam.</hi> 5. 12.) except the god of this world hath blinded the eye of their minds, may plainly perceive, that not only prophane swearing, but all manner of Swearing among the Disciples of Christ; who brings all that truly follow him, out of the strife which is among men, into Love, Peace and Unity, which was before Oaths, and where there is no need of any.</p>
               <p>And the Swearing, Strife and Confusion, Rebellion and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirstiness is among the false Christians, who have the Name of Christ in their Mouths, but want his Spirit and Nature, being inwardly ravening Wolves, and by their fruits are they known.</p>
               <p>And it is true which a Bishop of <hi>Englands</hi> Church <note place="margin">Bishop Gauden his Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Oaths.</note> once said; that <hi>Among false Christians Oathes are not to be regarded; and amongst true Christians there was no need of them.</hi> Our Leader is Christ, whose Voice we hear and follow, and whose Riches and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we partake of. And the poor and ignorant souls are such as creep into houses (ignorantly called Churches) and lead silly women captive, who are laden with sins, and led aside with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth: While we were in <hi>Englands</hi> Church, we our selves were such, as knew not the Physician of our souls, and so were full of putrified sores, and unsoundness, and no health was in us; and we did those things we should not do, and left undone those things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58673:6"/>
we should do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the states of <hi>Englands</hi> Church still as the Members thereof confess in their common Service: so, doth not divers lusts lead them? and are they not ever learning, and ever ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant? And do not many thousands of them go down to the Pit without the knowledge of that precious Truth which makes free from Sin? Let God's Witness in the Consciences of its Members an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>Our Interest which we desire to cary on, is Truth &amp; Righteousness; and we shall rejoyce to see it established: though we are counted as the filth of the earth, and the off-scouring of all things, and not sit to live in this the Land of our Nativity, yet we have and do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our selves friends to our Nation; and since the Lord hath made us a People, we have sought and endeavoured its temporal and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good, and have not been found contriving nor acting evil against Persons or Governments, since we were brought to the knowledge of that Truth we profess.</p>
               <p>Therefore what ground of suspicion have we given to our cruel Persecutors, that they should suggest and surmise so much evil of us, that our Design is Rebellion and Blood? But what cause or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion did harmless <hi>Abel</hi> give bloody <hi>Cain</hi> to kill him? Consider and see the same is now.</p>

                  <hi>Now you shall see how this Principle of not Swearing tends to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Government.</hi> First, <hi>It denies the King the Security he ought to have of his Subjects for their Allegiance; which Oath they deny; and security by bond is not so good: for thereby they are not engaged in Conscience, and they will only wait for a convenient season to forfeit their Bonds without hazard, and make sure work in overthrowing the present Government, and secure their own securities; but an Oath binds the Conscience at all times, and that they cannot abide. Again, this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple tends to subvert the Government, because without Swearing we can have no Justice done, no Law executed; you may be robbed, your houses broke open, your goods taken away, and be injured in your persons, and no Justice or recompence can be had, because the fact cannot be proved: the truth is, no Government can stand without Swearing; and were these People to have a Governmet among themselves, they cold not live without an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <p>If this Judge had the Mind of Christ, he would not speak after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58673:6"/>
this manner: for Government was before Swearing, and may be without it; and Oaths of Alleagiance are but a novel thing to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hatched and imposed in the Apostacy, and was not among the true Christians, whose <hi>Yea</hi> was <hi>Yea,</hi> and their <hi>Nay Nay</hi> in all things; and the word and promise of a true Christian, is security sufficient, and their Consciences are bound to perform what they say and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as firm as they that Swear. There hath been no want of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these and other Nations called Christian, yet what subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, turnings and overturnings, and treacherous dealing hath there been among the Princes and People thereof? and many have sworn to one Governour and Government, and then to another, and so to a third, and may be ready to swear to any that get to the helm of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and these Swearers and Conformers to any thing that is uppermost, make little conscience of Oaths, so they may save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from suffering: and if we were or had been of this spirit, we need not have suffered so exceeding deeply in our persons and estates in the time of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the other Powers: And it is envy which blindes the understanding of this Judge, that makes him charge us, with not believing what we say, when we say, <hi>It is not lawful for us to take an Oath;</hi> and that we have a Design to carry on, and therefore will not Swear Allegiance to the King. Now if he did believe what he saith of us, that we should assert what we do not believe, or were so void of Conscienciousness; then how can he in reason expect that an <hi>Imposed Oath should be so much binding to us, if we could be forced to take it,</hi> especially since it is a maxime of their own, <hi>that forced Oaths are not binding.</hi> And this Judge and all such would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what weight their Oath hath upon their Consciences, whereby they are enjoyned to do equal Law and Execution arightly to all; but how this is performed, set the wise in heart judge, when they go about with groundless Suggestions and Suspitions against an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People, to instigate both Juries and Country against them.</p>
               <p>We are such as desire the good of all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godliness and honesty under them; and have never yet been found Designers or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Destruction: Therefore the greater is this Judges evil, to endeavour to make us odious among the People; and the unfiter he appears to be our Judge, being full fraighted with enmity against us without cause: and a Judge ought to be impartial, a man fearing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58673:7"/>
God, and judging for him, and not for men; such Judges Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will answer the righteous Principle of God in all Men, and such are a terror to the evil doers, and a praise to those that do well; and the Lord is with such in Judgement.</p>
               <p>That which subverts, undermines and destroys Governours, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and People, is Cruelty, Oppression, Tyranny, Sin and Rebellion against the God of Heaven, who hath power to give the Kingdoms of this World to whom he pleaseth: and who so rules in Righteousness, and answers the just and righteous Principle of God in all men, needs not fear subversion or undermining; 'tis the evil doer that is filled with fear and terrour round about.</p>
               <p>We are not the Obstructers of Justice, nor the Cause of it, our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against any evil doer, shall be as true as any that take Oaths; and if false, our penalty the sawe with false Swearers.</p>
               <p>And further, Witnesses under <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, had no Oath admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to them, though the crime bore witness of, reached life; but if any bore false witness, the same punishment which should have been inflicted upon the person witnessed against, should be insticted upon the false witness and witnesses: which thing we desire may be done unto us: So then the fault is in the Law, and the Judges of it, which denies true and faithful Evidence, (which in conscience they can believe) except it be under the Ceremony of an Oath. It is a shame for Christians to have a jealousie of each others testimony, except they Swear: it was enough in the first age of Christianity, to confirm any testimony without an Oath, to say <hi>[Christianus sum,]</hi> or, I am a Christian.</p>
               <p>And if no Government could have been without taking of Oaths, the Author of all <hi>true Government</hi> and Rule, would not have said, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but swearing Oaths and Strife, is among men in the fall and degeneration (and not among true Christians) where it will remain, till they know the Restorer of all things take away the cause of it; which is sin.</p>

               <p>But for such which the Judge means by Leaders, who have been made instruments to turn our minds from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to God, they, together with us, are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to keep to the Grace of God, (the true Teacher) which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and Godly in this present world; and by this Grace (which appears to all men) are we taught and preserved from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against any Just Laws once; and so he may well warrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and others, that they will not offend three times: And his ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing those he calls Leaders, as if they put on others to suffer, and slee themselves, is altogether false; for it is well-known in the Nation, that many of them are in prison, where some of them have long remained for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance; upon which account divers of them are <hi>permunired,</hi> and many suffer for meeting: howbeit, if you should be suffered to take away some of their lives, which they can freely give up, if called to it; yet know that the God whom we serve is unlimitted, and will open the mouths of thousands to bear witness against Unrighteousness: So when you do take and catch more of them, you will have no evil to lay to their charge, nor nothing to accuse them for, but about matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God's Kingdom; as Conscience, Faith, Worship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which the Civil Magistrate ought not to intermeddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it belonging to God alone, to whom all must give an account for such things: and people ought not to be imprisoned and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and their lives taken away about Matters of Religion; for if a People have a false faith, and a misguided conscience, and are by reason of this faith and misguided conscience, exercised in a false
