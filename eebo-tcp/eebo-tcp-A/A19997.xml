            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Namely, first into a meere naturall bodie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> meane a corporall substance consisting ioyntly in an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate of sundry particular members sympathically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one.

Then next, into a meere Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall bodie, I meane the publike estate of kingdomes, and countries collaterally compact in one mutuall consort.

            <p>As this fourefold order of bodies doth comprehend, and vphold to the full, the seuerall conditions of men here on earth: so surely, the second and the last of these foure seuerall estates I do purposely pretermit for the present, as hauing heretofore in <note n="d" place="margin">In a Treatise of household gouernment couertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed from me, and set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hang downe the head, but all the other states else (by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent) they do collaterally become very crazie and weake, concerning any the dutifull discharge of their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar designements.</p>
            <p>As for example, the said stomacke it selfe, namely, the poore husbandmen, they are fearefully subiected to an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable feeblenesse concerning the timely performance of any their appointed functions; to offensiue yelkings, and vomitings forth of sundrie discontentments against the whole State; to an immoderate thirsting after other mens places; to many most bitter heart-burnings, gripings, and gnawings; to sodaine, and vnappeaseable inflammations of furie; to an vtter loathing of their appointed ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to a dog-like appetite after other mens profites; to an insatiable hunger concerning the speedie supply of their sundrie vnsufferable wants; to a very bad digestion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their present oppressions; to many windie sufflations, and proud puffings vp; to angrie belchings, to cholericke passions, to an vnnaturall fluxe of the purse, by meanes of too many their immoderate and superfluous dispendings; to inward heart-gripings; with sundry such other like feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occurrents as do finally disable their persons from the orderly collecting, and proportionable dispersing of publike maintenance to any one of the other estates in that selfe same Politicall body.</p>
            <p>Yea, and not onely the said stomacke it selfe (I meane the poore husbandmen,) but all other estates besides are likewise (by a common consent as it were) collaterally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to sundry most dangerous distempers: whether we consider the superiour, or any the inferiour parts of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall body.</p>
            <p>For first, (concerning the superiour parts) who may not
<pb facs="tcp:9959:4"/>
easily see and perceiue how the head it selfe will forthwith begin to be fearefully tainted with capitall paines about the disordered State; with want of due rest, by reason of sundry occurring cares; with idle vertigoes, and many terrible turne-about thoughts; with sundrie implacable furies, with most secure and fearefull Lethargies, dreames, and drowsie securities; with crasinesse of memorie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their duties to God and man; yea, and (which more is) with such sodaine congealed Catalepsies, violent conuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ituall benummings, as if all conscionable sense and mouing (in and about their designed imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) were vtterly lost, or quite forgot, at the least.</p>
            <p>And then next, for the Shoulders and Armes (the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and Gentrie I meane) who may not likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how that (when the poore husband-mans state, which did vsually aford their Politicall maintenance, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to fag) they do eftsoones begin to fall forthwith into fearefull Apoplexies, I meane, to an vtter decay of all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall mouing and sense; into quaking Palsies and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of heart, vpon euery crossing occurrent; into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Epilepsies, and deadly downefallings to euill; into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conuulsions, with a sodaine shrinking vp of the sinewes of loue; into fearefull oppressing Ephialteis, and intollerable burdens of sinne, each houre surcharging their sorrowfull soules; into choking Squinancies, I meane, a mercilesse throatling of all their Inferiours; into sundrie most deadly Pleurisies, through the abundant spilling of innocent bloud; into many quarkening Peripneumonies, and suffocating Ptisickes, I meane, into a difficult brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth of any gracious decrees concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent good of the poore; yea and (which more is) into very many such impostumating Empiemaes, and most fearefull
<pb facs="tcp:9959:4"/>
exulcerations of conscience (with other outragious enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) as bring an vtter consumption and waste to the whole Politicall bodie.</p>
            <p>And as the superiour, so likewise the inferiour mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that selfe same Politicall bodie, feeling once a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the stomacke (I meane in the poore husbandmans state) they do eftsoones decline to an vnnaturall weakenesse and distemperature of the Liuer and Splene (I meane, to a fearefull decay of Christian loue, for the timely discharge of any their Christian duties; to sundrie inflammations, obstructions, coldnesse, and hardnesse of heart against the whole State; to most filthie deforming Iaundeis, through an vnnaturall dispersing of cholericke pangs, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke passions ouer all the Politicall bodie; to many most languishing Cachexies, I meane, to an inordinate consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and wasting of politicke nutriment, by reason of some euill disposition in their proper estates; to such dangerous Dropsies, and disordered cariages, as do either procure a dissolute loosenesse throughout their peculiar societies, or an vnnaturall swelling at least, against the peaceable, and prosperous state of the whole Politicall bodie; to dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stranguries, and dangerous difficulties about the timely dispatch of their publike designements; to deadly benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sciaticaes, and griefes in the huckle-bones, so oft as they are to vndergo the obsequious dispatch of their seuerall duties; yea and (which more is) into many preposterous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagraes, and intollerable paine in their feete and ioynts, so oft especially as they are made to support and beare vp the necessarie burdens belonging to that Politicall body whereof they are made the vnited members.</p>
            <p>So as your most excellent Highnesse may here againe be pleased to perceiue very plainly, that (by the onely
<pb facs="tcp:9959:5"/>
distempers of the stomacke it selfe in either of both these bodies) the whole bodies of both are most fearefully brought into such a languishing condition and state, as neither those stomackes themselues, nor the head, nor the shoulders, nor the armes, neither yet the legs, nor the feete are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to dispatch their proper designements: by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eanes whereof, euen those selfe same bodies (with all their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts) must needs remaine in a languishing state. And therefore, as the good estate of the stomacke it selfe must be carefully continued, especially, if we desire to vphold the happie condition of the whole bodie it selfe: so surely I do verily suppose there may no better meanes be deuised about that good estate of the stomacke, then to become very carefull first, for the ordinary supply of whatsoeuer good meanes may be helpefull vnto it: and then next, for the powerfull and speedie suppressing of whatsoeuer occurrent may be hurtfull vnto it in any respect.</p>
            <p>Now then, these foure succeeding faculties are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially helpefull to the good estate of the stomacke it selfe, if they be rightly had, and ioyntly continued: Namely, Appetite, Retention, Digestion, with an orderly Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
            <p>For sith it is the proper office of euery particular sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, very orderly to concoct the whole sustenance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued therein, that so, the said sustenance may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with become good naturall nutriment for the whole bodie it selfe: who seeth not therefore but that (in the stomacke) there must first be procured an able and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute appetite towards that the former receiued suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
            <p>And because it is to very small purpose though the forenamed Appetite be singular good, vnlesse the Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

facultie be also euery way fitted for the firme retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and orderly holding of whatsoeuer solide sustenance so soundly affected before: who seeth not now, but that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a sound Retention must necessarily be wrought in that selfe same stomacke?</p>
            <p>And because the Appetite, and Retention both, will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little auaile to the good estate of the stomacke, vnlesse the said stomacke be throughly able withall, most soundly to digest whatsoeuer good sustenance so orderly affected, and so firmely retained before: who seeth not therefore, but that a very strong and absolute Digestion must third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be kindled, and firmely continued in that selfe same stomacke?</p>
            <p>And because both Appetite, Retention, and Digestion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, are to very small purpose for the good estate of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, vnlesse the said sustenance so affected, so retained, and so digested, be likewise as proportionably dispersed throughout the whole bodie for naturall nutriment to the seuerall members thereof: therefore, who seeth not fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that the said stomacke it selfe must be aptly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards the proportionable Distribution of that selfe same concocted nutriment to each seuerall part of the whole body it selfe? Now then, all those the forenamed faculties so fitly and so proportionably concurring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the orderly accomplishment of that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nutriment, this stomacke it selfe may not properly be said to feele any want at all, for the timely dispatch of it owne imployments about any his designed functions.</p>
            <p>These fourefold faculties must (in like manner) all ioyntly concurre about the happie and prosperous estate of those our Politicall stomackes: if especially, we would haue them profitably imployed in the orderly collecting, and
<pb facs="tcp:9959:6"/>
frugall disposing of publike maintenance, for the conuenient supportation of the whole Politicall body, in all and singular the seuerall parts thereof.</p>
            <p>And therefore, a principall care concerning the poore husbandmens happie condition, must first be made knowne to the world, by an orderly procuring of good Appetites in euery of them towards their seuerall husbandries: that so, they may chearefully, comfortably, and profitably both affect, and effect the fruitfull managing thereof in euery respect. Whereby it is apparently euident, that those their said Appetites must not be killed by vnreasonable Fines, by excessiue Rents, by ouer heauie Impositions, or any such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther importable burdens.</p>
            <p>And then next, there must likewise be cherished in euery of them, a powerfull Retention, an enabled facultie (I meane) to retaine, vphold, and continue their seuerall hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandries, for those the former publike respects. So as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a like prouident care must be further had, that by no meanes they may be discouraged from their said husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries by any mercilesse, vncharitable, or cut-throate dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: neither yet compelled (by any causlesse, and cruell oppressions) to cassier themselues from their former callings, and so (in a malcontentednesse) forthwith to cast their ploughs in the ditch.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, they must yet further be furthered this way, by a strong &amp; speedie Digestion, with such warme and cherishing comforts (I meane) as may enable them all to the orderly maintaining, the husbandly managing, and the wholsome digesting of those their said husbandries for publike good.</p>
            <p>And lastly, there must very carefully be wrought in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them (by the ministeriall operation of the word and
<pb facs="tcp:9959:6"/>
praier) a sympathicall disposition, in and about the timely Distribution of that their former collected maintenance, for the publike good of the Prince, the Peares, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Gentrie, the whole Communaltie, and euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of that selfe same Politicall bodie. These things accordingly effected, who seeth not now, but that the naturall and Politicall stomacks both, are sufficiently furnished with whatsoeuer supplies may any way be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to either of them both for publike good?</p>
            <p>And not onely things helpefull must so be supplied, but things hurtfull likewise must forthwith be suppressed, for feare of enfeebling or weakening the forenamed faculties. But there may not any thing be possibly found more hurtfull to the happie estate of those the forenamed stomacks, then superfluous excesse, or pining wants. For, as by superfluous excesse, the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>state of those the said stomacks is feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerwhelmed and tumbled headlong into most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous surfeits and deadly distempers: so surely, by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and pining wants, they are fearefully enfeebled, and finally disabled from the timely performance of their proper designements for publike good.</p>
            <p>First therefore (for the timely suppressing of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer superfluous excesse annoying the healthfull estate of both these stomacks) a prouident care must forthwith be had, that not onely all carowsing and quaffing, all gulling and gormandizing, all excessiue and riotous banquetting: but also that all superfluous buildings, all needlesse braueries, all extrauagant sports, and all other profluuious dispendings be heedfully auoyded in euery state, more especially in those the forenamed stomacks themselues.</p>
            <p>For these onely respects, I haue here euen purposely (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yet synecdochically) censured all those the former most
<pb facs="tcp:9959:7"/>
foule and shamefull disorders vnder the onely name of <hi>Tobacco fumes;</hi> putting downe a part for the whole: and naming that one vice especially, as a most liuely represent of those other the smokelike vanishing vapours; and as the very principall annoyance to both the stomacks: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the flourishing estate of the naturall, and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodies themselues.</p>
            <p>And not onely all such superfluous excesse, but (which more is by much) all those oppressing and pining wants whatsoeuer, which may (in any sort) surprize the good estate of those stomacks, must forthwith be warily suppressed. Namely, the want of competent tillage for corne; the want of conuenient pasturing for beeues, for oxen, for milch-kine, for sheepe, with such other conuenient meanes to manure, mannage, enable, and strengthen their seuerall tillages and pasture grounds, for such a conuenient increase as may fully suffice from time to time, about the necessarie supportation of their owne, and the publike good. The want (in like manner) of politicke, of peaceable, and publike good orders, about the orderly and quiet collecting of such singular blessings as the Lord (in much mercie) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth vpon any their ordinarie labours for publike good, must be heedfully respected and timely redressed by publike authoritie.</p>
            <p>So as your excellent Highnesse may herein againe be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see the great conueniencie of all those good penall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes (were they but carefully executed) which do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concerne the orderly vpholding of husbandrie in it owne proper nature, or do purposely tend to the timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of whatsoeuer riots, routs, and vnlawfull assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that might respectiuely ouerlay the poore husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens labours, and peaceable proiects concerning any their
<pb facs="tcp:9959:7"/>
peculiar professions for publike good.</p>
            <p>In consideration whereof, I haue here purposely, and largely laid open the vrgent necessitie for the timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of that late disordered and vnlawfull attempt of lawlesse persons, in and about the vnorderly and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disparking of pastures and seuerall grounds, vnder an idle pretence of the necessarie (though needlesse) augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tillage: demonstrating most plainly, that their falsely supposed defect of tillage is no such an oppressing want, as doth presently hurt the poore husbandmans happy estate (all other things else proportionably and euenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected:) and that therefore there needed no such disordered and headie attempts, for the timely supply of that their falsly supposed want.</p>
            <p>Hauing hitherto anatomized the whole purport of this my purposed proiect for publike good, I am now, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing the same should be soundly peized with those the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued weights of the Sanctuary which will not deceiue. Especially, if our learned Physitions be made the indifferent cyzers and censurers concerning all Physicall questions: as also, if those our experimented Politicians and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke States-men may become the prouident weigh-masters of what points soeuer appertaining to matters of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
            <p>More respectiuely (most dread Soueraigne) I do here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely, and submissiuely put ouer the whole to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties approued consideration and view, as vnto the most competent Iudge of publike regard; very humbly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your excellent Highnesse, that (from out of your long experimented Physicall skill) you would first of all be pleased, very soundly to censure that former part of this present Discourse, which more especially concernes those exceeding
<pb facs="tcp:9959:8"/>
great hurts that do vnperceiueably surprise the bodies of men, by meanes of their inward taking of <hi>Tobacco fumes.</hi> And then next (with no lesse humble submission) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreate, that your vnmatchable wisedome for publike good, would likewise be pleased (from out of your long set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iudgement, and experimented practise about the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppressing of whatsoeuer shamefull disorders adiudged pestiferous to the publike good of our countrey) to priuiledge with the approued stampe of your authenticall approbation, that other part of this present Discourse, which more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely relateth the purses profluuitie about the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charges of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> and the pestiferous poysoning of the long setled peace of our publike State: so farre forth especially, as the truth it selfe, and present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions do instantly craue from time to time. Very submissiuely intreating moreouer, that the whole Treatise it selfe may find at your Maiesties hands, that fauourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which your gracious wisedome shall thinke good to grace it withall: and thereupon also, may publikely and boldly march vnder the martiall ensigne of your kingly care for publike good, against all the fiery encounters of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fuming <hi>Tobacconists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So shall the almightie Iehouah his absolute wisedome be <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 11.19.</note> freely iustified of all her children; so shall your kingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation be iustly eternized among all posterities; so shall the publike State of our countrey be much more bettered, and more soundly conserued in a solide condition; so shall the almightie Law-maker be more largely magnified for his manifold mercies bestowed among vs; so shall the poore husbandmens hearts (as it were with kingly cordials) be forthwith reuiued; so shall our disordered <hi>Tobacconists</hi> be presently daunted, and for euer hereafter discouraged:
<pb facs="tcp:9959:8"/>
yea and so shall my poore selfe be more securely protected from whatsoeuer the fierie <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 18.18.</note> strokes of venimous tongues, to my better emboldning, and further encouragement in such other like future attempts for publike good. And euen so, I most humbly surceasse my purposed suite for the present good of our publike State: beseeching the almightie Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah to blesse your excellent Highnesse in bodie and soule, and to enrich you in both with a principall spirit, correspon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent to your Princely place; to the publike good of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and your owne euerlasting comfort in Iesus Christ.

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, if thou wilt more seriously bend thy best thoughts awhile towards some serious consideration concerning thine accustomed inward taking of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> it may be thy good hap (by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful goodnesse of our gracious God) to haue thereby thy fantasticall mind enlightened about a foule fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie error; thy crazie corps disburdened of many pestiferous humours, and thy prodigall purse more might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The true and timely apprehension of these three such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and present auailes, succeeding these Paganish and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish practises, may make thee in time (by the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God) to veile thy bonnet for publike good: and herein withall, to become forthwith a Merchant Venturer, by aduenturing boldly vpon the seasonable venting forth of this late inuention, for the publike aduantage of whatsoeuer our trifling <hi>Tobacconists</hi>; vnlesse haply, those their vapouring euacuations (very chymically extracted from the fennish fumes of their filthie <hi>Tobacco)</hi> haue now too too fearefully ouerwhelmed their blindfold braines with such foggie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling mists, as do dangerously suppresse the senses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

and too too sottishly surprise the sway of sound reason.</p>
            <p>Although notwithstanding, I am in no doubt at all, but that thou thine owne selfe (hauing once in an approued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, very sensibly apprehended the exceeding great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of this present Discourse for publike good) wilt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hold for an infallible Axiome, that <note n="a" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>If thy mind be still in a mammering doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the venimous condition of these poysonsome <hi>fumes</hi> be so pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous as this present Discourse doth seeme to purport, then turne thy present thoughts (I pray thee) towards the vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths of sundry such excellent personages as (tampering too much therewith) haue (euen now of late) not onely bene sodainly surprised by an vnnaturall death, but (which more is) their dead bodies being opened, had all their entrails as blacke as a coale, and the very fat in their bodies resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling (in all outward appearance) the perfect colour of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or reesed bacon: whose names notwithstanding, I do here purposely conceale, for the very reuerence it selfe
<pb facs="tcp:9959:10"/>
which I formerly bare to their persons and places.</p>
            <p>If notwithstanding all this, thou wilt not (as yet) bee brought vnto a present dislike of those the said <hi>fumes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then turne thy serious and timely considerations to those fearefull effects, which (not long since) afforded their vntimely and terrible attendance towards those our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and turbulent <hi>Tobacconists</hi> of former times. Who (for very loue of their <hi>Tobacco</hi> trafficke, and other disordered courses) neither spared their persons, nor purses, but wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoyled and consumed them both: to the manifest wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of many other besides, the publike contempt of good positiues lawes, the wilfull breach of his Maiesties peace, the rebellious resisting of his martiall power, with the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spilling of their owne, and other mens bloud.</p>
            <p>Let no partiall affections (good Christian Reader) so far forth miscarrie, nor so violently inueagle thine vnsetled and wauering mind, as that thou shouldest once dare to applaud the disordered courses, and intemperate actions of any such barbarous Cannibals as do causelesly conspire, and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pretend to bring in a confused paritie throughout the whole State. With very base and most beastly degenerate minds are those monstrous Minotaures bewitched, no doubt, who may (by no meanes) be brought to endure, or to broke the renowmed estates of the Nobilitie, or Gentrie in any their countrey coasts: neither yet to like long of any his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties fauourites, whom the Almightie himselfe (for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of sundrie their singular vertues) aduanceth to a timely honour. Howbeit, very true is the saying it selfe, and the truth thereof made too too apparent in such disordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: namely, that <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>Well (whatsoeuer may be the successe with some others) I doubt not at all, but that these my poore labours for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good, will (from henceforth) make me as deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in some other mens labours of like interchangeable trafficke: more especially, of those well minded persons who

            <l>(With toyling trade) the trifling wares which they for money sell:</l>
            <l>Then why should <hi>Deacon</hi> doubt to purchase praise of men,</l>
            <l>To whom he frankly giues the gift of this his learned pen?</l>
            <l>If he his busied brow hath beat for our auaile,</l>
            <l>And for our profit taken paines: why should his guerdon faile?</l>
            <l>No greedie golden fee, no gem, no Iewel braue;</l>
            <l>But of the Reader, good report this Writer longs to haue.</l>
            <l>No man of meanest wit, no beast of slender braine:</l>
            <l>Who thinkes that such a worke as this, was penn'd with little paine.</l>
            <l>The worke it selfe portends what toyle he vndertooke,</l>
            <l>Or er'e his curious file could frame this passing pleasant Booke.</l>
            <l>If pleasure thou possesse, or profit thereby take:</l>
            <l>He hath the depth of his desire, who penn'd it for thy sake.</l>
            <l>But, though thou feele some want of that thou wish at furst:</l>
            <l>Reade once againe with good aduice, before thou iudge the wurst.</l>
            <l>Lay loue and hate aside, affection put to flight:</l>
            <l>So shalt thou iudge as Iustice wils, so shall thy doome be right.</l>
            <l>Remember, <hi>Midas</hi> eares were framed like an Asse:</l>
            <l>Because he said that <hi>Pan</hi> in skill, <hi>Apollo</hi> farre did passe.</l>
            <l>So, if thou shalt preferre some trifle more then truth,</l>
            <l>Thou shalt deserue (as <hi>Midas</hi> did) the Asses eares with ruth.</l>
            <l>For, learned is the man that did this Treatise frame:</l>
            <l>And, learned is the wight, to whom he dedicates the same.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:9959:12"/>And, learned is the worke, and honest eke the fact:</l>
            <l>And honest men will honestly allow each honest act.</l>
            <l>But, those that needes will storme, and wot not well wherefore,</l>
            <l>Must needs haue part of that reward which <hi>Midas</hi> reap't before.</l>
            <l>Which, if thou wilt auoid (as I would wish to shun)</l>
            <l>Do deeme with good aduised drift, this deede by <hi>Deacon</hi> done.</l>
            <l>So, I that made this verse, will thinke no worse of thee,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Deacons</hi> worke doth well deserue, accompted of to be.</l>
            <l>But, if thou barke at Moone (like Bandog void of feares)</l>
            <l>All men may deeme thee for an Asse, by those thine Asse like eares.</l>

               <p>With very good will.

               <p>Certainely, euen such, and so exceedingly strange, as did (for the present) most fearefully daunt the very vigour and force of his vitall spirits. For, finding in that sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (aboue other nations) a wonderfull couragious mind, with exceeding great strength of body to beare out the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test brunt of the battaile; and hauing also at length obtained of them a very laborious and tedious victorie, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much toyle, and very great bloudshed: by the often consideration thereof, he was sundrie times drawne into this deepe and serious cogitation: Namely, how it might possibly come to passe, that he should so experiment in euery of them, such a rare and couragious spirit, and so resolute a will, with sufficient strength accordingly, to vndergo any imminent danger; whereas, in others he found nothing at all but an effeminate life, with a mind of curiositie, in withdrawing themselues from all dangerous and deadly occurrents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capn.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what? was he caried so farre into this end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse labyrinth, as he wotted not well which way to winde himselfe out, but with leading himselfe backward by the onely conduct of a labyrinthian clew?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing lesse. For (hauing searched all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his diuine wit, to find forth some reason in nature concerning this matter) at length (with exceeding great iudgement, and singular wisedome) he espied two speciall causes hereof; Namely, their abstinence from wine: and, their want of trafficke with other nations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capn.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>What benefits could come vnto them by either of both these courses?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, exceeding great benefits. For, by the first (namely, by their abstinence from wine) they reaped this certaine commoditie; I meane, they continued the state of their bodily humours in a sound and setled temperature: and, by the other (that is, by their vtter want of vsuall trafficke with other nations) they kept entire their ancient customes and manners, and held them continually absolute, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted with the venimous vices of forreine countries. As
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9959:15"/>
also (by the ordinary meanes of both) they receiued this singular benefite, that they preserued from time to time, the vigour, as well of their minds as their bodies, substantially sound and liuely, and euery way pregnant and readie, both for peace, and for warres.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>In very deed, exceedingly much. For, hauing eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones somwhat seriously pondered this his approued iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comparing it euen now, with the present occasions of this our licencious age, as also, with their childish &amp; fond resolution concerning such forreine aduentures: I do find too too many important and weightie causes, very earnestly perswading me to be iumpe of <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such a purposed proiect.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Dost thou aske me why so? Do but euenly compare the one age with the other, and thou shalt plainly perceiue the reasons thy selfe. For, what made them (in those dayes) such able men of their bodies and minds, and so apt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery difficult enterprise, but euen that their ordinarie absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from wine and strong drinkes? And what causeth vs now to become such cauallering Carpet Knights, such fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall effeminate fellowes, and so vtterly vnfit for martiall affaires, but our continuall carousing of cup after cup; our insatiable tippling vp of <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> and our contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conuersing with the vicious customes of forreine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capn.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I can (as yet) conceiue no one inconuenience from either of both.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Let vs then consider them seuerally: for, so shall wee the sooner perceiue the pernicious occurrents procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from either. Obserue therefore I pray thee, what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous diseases are daily bred in mens bodies, as also, how many and diuerse corruptions are couched close in their minds, by reason of an immoderate swilling vp of wine, of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9959:15"/>
ale, and of beere. For, from whence proceedeth superfluous moistures ouerspreading each solide part of the body? From whence cometh <hi>Catarres, Coughs, Rheumes, distillations</hi> of the <hi>braine, Comaes, Apoplexies, Palsies, Dropsies, Peripneumonies, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumations</hi> of the <hi>Lungs, Lethargies, Ephialties, Tremblings, Cataracts, Ophthalmies, Crudities, Iliaca passions, Cachexies, Surfets,</hi> vnnaturall <hi>Vomitings, Ioynt sicknesses, Goutes,</hi> and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry such other; besides the manifold corruptions of the mind it selfe: from whence (I say) do all and euery of these take primarie being, but from an immoderate quassing? Would to God, this preposterous age of ours did not so pregnantly purport and witnesse the same, without any my record herein.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capn.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indéede I must fréely acknowledge, that such sundrie and strange diseases are growne too too rife and ripe in this our decrepite age, and those also very feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting both yong and old: but do all those diseases you speake of, directly procéede from an immoderate gulling in of hote wines, and other strong drinkes?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Vndoubtedly, they do take their primarie sprout from those pernicious fountaines, either immediatly, or, by a mutuall consent in their sundrie and diuerse gradations at least: as thou thine owne selfe (by some sober conference with graue and skilfull Physitions) maist more sensibly and more soundly be made to perceiue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capn.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well Sir, I vnderstand (by the purport of your spéech) what fearefull inconueniences may successiuely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon such an immoderate swilling: and therefore I do herein accord with your selfe and Iulius Caesar, that, a moderate abstinence from wine and other strong drinks, is a singular good meanes to support the sound estate of mens naturall humours, and (thereby) the better to enable their bodies and mindes for euery notable exploite. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I cannot (as yet) conceiue, how this our entercourse of trafficke with forreiners should any way preiudice the persons of men; or procure annoyance to the publicke good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9959:16"/>
of our English Iland. And therefore, tell me without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, whether you do absolutely deny vs all trafficke with strangers?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing lesse. For, so should I be sure, not onely to crosse the singular good purpose of God, in the mutuall conseruation of people and nations dispersed abroad: but also, euen vtterly ouerthrow an excellent good course for the orderly increase of mutuall concord betwixt kingdome and kingdome, while the pining wants of the one, are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully supplied by the others abundance. Concerning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the timely entercourse of trafficke with strangers, though I hold the same simply lawfull, nor flatly to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by any; if especially, a prouident care and a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be first had of the traueller his age and yeares, as also, of the religious and honest estate of those countries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whereunto the trauellers bend their purposed desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements for such traffice intended: Although yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (I know not well how) this I am certainely sure of, that, whilest such an inconsiderate recourse to and fro from sundrie nations and kingdomes farre remote, lyeth carelesly open for whosoeuer will first giue the onset vpon it, wee leaue our ancient simplicitie eftsoones in a forreine ayre: and (in stead thereof) do too greedily sucke vp from forreiners, not their vertues, but vices, and monstrous corruptions, as well in religion and manners, as also, in framing the whole course of our life (both for apparell, diet, and all other things) euery way correspondent and currant to such a contagious, and most pernitious president.</p>

               <p>Very true as thou sayest. It is the law of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which leadeth vs captiues to sinne; and that euery man is inticed and drawne vnto euil by his proper concupiscence. But yet, marke thus much withall, that the Scripture doth not there make the mindes of men meere agents, but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents rather in the perpetrating of any vngodly actions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, those their minds, are said to be enticed and led, which necessarily importeth thus much at the least: Namely, (sith those their minds are said to be inticed, and led) necessarily there must (in euery such sinfull action) be some other prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie agent (besides their said mindes themselues) which so inticeth, and leadeth men captiues: as also, a conuenient meanes with some proportionall obiect, whereby they may so be inticed and led vnto euil. Now then (to speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pertinently) the diuell himselfe is that primarie agent: who, by sundrie externall occurrents (as it were by most apt and conuenient meanes thereunto) doth accidentally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle mens minds: that so (their said minds being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly captiuated by their proper concupiscence) he might the more easily intice, and leade them captiues to all manner of euill. For so <hi>Iames</hi> speaks plainly in the forenamed Scripture, thus: <hi>Let no man say (when he is tempted) I am tempted of God, for God tempteth no man: but euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his proper concupiscence.</hi> Where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle(yousee)spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth purposely of three concurring together in euery tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Very true. But how difficult a matter it is for mans nature (so vniuersally polluted) to escape the pollutions themselues, each one may perceiue in his proper experience, and find it most apparently demonstrated by this ordinarie experiment: Namely, let a sweete christall streame but haue it accustomed course through the midst of a foule filthie channell, and then tell me how long that streame it selfe will soundly retaine his inherent sweetnesse or clearenesse. Now then, mans corrupted nature (being neither inherently sweet, nor essentially cleare in it selfe) if it be carelesly permitted (hand ouer head) to haue an ordinarie entercourse of traffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with corrupt and contagious countries, as it were in a foule filthie channell, the very mind it selfe will be as vnable to withstand the pernicious customes of those contagious countries, as the very bodie of man (accustomably conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in pestilentiall places) is vnfit to resist the pestilentiall infections of those selfesame places. For a further proofe of this point, let other Christian policie; or the King his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue royall; or the force of feare and bloudie massacres, but once proclaime a finall restraint, or perpetually forestall the accustomed course and recourse for trafficke to any the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Babels of beastly confusions, and thou shalt plainely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9959:19"/>
perceiue by the very sequele therof, how farre forth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion it selfe hath hitherto possessed those passengers minds. For the Merchants of the earth (making erst their ordinary trafficke, in the bowels and bellie of those beastly Babels) will eftsoones beginne very greeuously to bemoane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, by reason of such a finall restraint from those their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Babels of beastly confusions; <hi>because no man may now</hi>

When I had somewhat more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bethought me hereof (though somewhat too late) and with great griefe of heart obserued these matters, as well concerning our Church, as Commonwealth, euen thereupon I met with (as I verily imagined) a very fit meanes for the timely forestalling of all those the forenamed mischiefes: the which also I will here propound to the serious consideration of thy selfe, and all other besides. Not because I do once i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that either thou or they may possibly be ignorant of it, being a point so frequent and popular in publike policy: but rather, that you all may ioyntly record, and mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize with me that selfesame thing which cannot possibly become vnpleasant to any; being (in very truth) approued of all, and vniuersally conuenient for the good estate of our Church and Countrey.</p>

               <p>To a very good purpose.

               <p>Because then (their humours being formerly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) the stayednesse of those their said humours will cause the perturbations of the mind to be calmed: so as (from the orderly asswaging of both) there must necessarily proceed a maturitie, and ripenesse in iudgement.

               <p>That was and is the furthest end of my thought.

                  <hi>First, because you so boldly auouch some such
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9959:21"/>
vainly imagined venime, to be ouercarelesly conuayed from out of the farthest India into this our English Iland, by vicious and wilde dispositions. Secondly (for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those your manifold supposed corruptions) you touch onely Tobacco by name, as that onely Troian horse-bellie from whence all forreine filthinesse (as your selfe very soundly surmize) doth too too infectiously ouerflow this Iland of ours.</hi>

               <p>I may safely sweare for hauing a thought or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, either to point at any mans person, or once to pursue his particular trafficke: but onely to insist vpon matters for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke good. Howbeit, seeing this thy particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enforceth here some further explication, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuer my mind in plainer termes touching either of both.</p>
               <p>For the first, who knoweth not of old, that this thy inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Tobacco,</hi> was primarily posted ouer from West <hi>India</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> by a vicious, a vaine, and a wilde disposition? that I say no more. And who seeth not likewise, that the same now (for the most part) is very vainly entertained in <hi>England,</hi> by as vicious, as vaine, and wilder dispositions, if wilder may be? For tell me (I pray thee) what more vicious disposition then that, which so excessiuely taketh <hi>Tobacco,</hi> of very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to inflame his excessiue and vicious affections? Or what more vaine disposition then that, which so insatiably swallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the filthie fume of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as an ordinarie shooing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, to pull on more insatiably, an aboundance of wine, and strong drinke? Briefly what more vicious, more vaine, or more wilde dispositions may possibly be then those our carousing companions, who so viciously, so vainely, and so wildly do vse the inward taking of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> as an intoxicating poyson to make themselues, and other their swaggering associates most dangerously wilde and mad with the venimous and deadly contagion thereof? Lo <hi>(Capni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>) these onely considerations (not thy particular person) did make me so peremptorily to terme those our carelesse
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9959:22"/>
                  <hi>Tobacco triflers,</hi> with that proportionable title of vicious, vaine, and wild dispositions. So as none but such as cannot distinguish betweene the men and the matter it selfe, may iustly be offended therewith.</p>
               <p>Neither did I precisely or purposely ayme at any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular trafficke, appertayning more properly vnto thine owne selfe: but (intending onely to propound and declare what dangerous discommodities in physicke are forcibly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to our orderly method of Curing, through an vnorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transporting of sundry pernicious drugs into this poore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of ours from forreine countries) I made (for further proofe of this point) a speciall choyce to intreate of <hi>Tobacco</hi> alone in stead of the rest: of very purpose to bridle our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled and bewitched <hi>Tobacconists</hi> from tampring any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith.

               <p>Content. Wherein, marke this well, that almost all kinds of combustible matter, do send foorth either smoke, vapour, or exhalation extracted from thence by the heate of the fire.

               <p>I will. First therefore, smoke and vapour they ioyntly accord (thou maist see) in their proper efficient cause, for both of them are wrought by a vehement heate, whereas exhalation is effected by a very small heate. Againe (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their matter) smoke doth differ from vapour, and exhalation both: for so much as smoke is the extraction of moisture and drought together, whereas vapour and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they are onely but the extraction of moisture. Againe (in regard of the effect) smoke altogether varieth from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, because smoke is neither resolued into aire, not yet into spirit, neither doth it moisten at all; both which are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by vapour. Againe, smoke and exhalation (in their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9959:24"/>
effect) do partly differ; for that smoke coloureth, which the other doth not: and partly they accord in this, that neither of them both doth moisten. Againe, vapour (concerning the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) seemeth both to differ from exhalation, and to accord with the same. For, in that vapour turneth vnto a spirit, and moisteneth also, therein it differeth: but whereas it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned to aire, therein it accordeth with exhalation. By all the premisses then thou maist plainly perceiue wherein smoke accordeth with vapour and exhalation: and wherein also it differeth from either of both.</p>

               <p>Surely a very fit introduction to this our intended businesse. For, seeing fume is drawne (by the operation of heate) from those selfesame materiall substances, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature more earthie) will not, nor cannot be made to melt, but by reason of their drinesse (which is the nature of flame in an only losse of their coldnesse) are turned estsoones into fire: and seeing flame it selfe is nothing else but aire, or smoke set on fire and kindled, it must necessarily follow (thou seest) that therefore, fume, it hath a farre greater force to heate and drie, then either <hi>fuligo,</hi> or <hi>nidor</hi> hath.</p>

               <p>Be it supposed, that those men do hit on the sooth, by telling vs ioyntly that <hi>Tobacco</hi> is hot and drie in the second degree.

But now, that the heate and drought of this thy <hi>Tobacco smoke</hi> surmounteth the due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of heate and drought in the bodies of men, let our tipling <hi>Tobacconists</hi> tell thee the truth hereof in their proper experience; who (by reason of the excessiue scorching and burning flames of their inward taken <hi>Tobacco fumes)</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced eftsoones to asswage the vehemencie and outrage of that excessiue heate, by an excessiue swilling in of wines, of ale, or of beere at the least.</p>
               <p>Seeing then this inward taking of <hi>Tobacco smoke</hi> dissolueth

the due proportion of Elements in a body compounded or mixt; seeing it corrupteth things naturally mixt in such a compounded bodie; seeing it augmenteth that due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heate and drought which nature her selfe hath iustly limited to such a compounded bodie: it is more then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently manifest, that the same surmounteth the naturall heate and drought of our bodies, by two degrees at the least.

Namely, that the smoke of Tobacco taken inward, doth spread and disperse through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole body, a venimous matter, and a mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the nature of man?</hi>

               <p>The truth thereof doth sound forth it selfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euerie coast, by the sodaine and lamentable end of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Tobacconists</hi>; more especially, by a pitifull experience in <hi>Parson Digbie</hi> at <hi>Peterborough</hi> of late: who (hauing excessiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken <hi>Tobacco</hi> in a tippling house) did instantly fall downe starke dead in the open streets. All which examples (being no lesse true then wofull) as they may serue for a terrour to all: so especially, these our insatiable suckers in of <hi>Tobacco smoke,</hi> should conscionably apply to themselues, and be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

thereby. Notwithstanding, this fantasticall course (I know not how) is now growne into such a foole-hardie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome among vs, as other mens harmes cannot make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: neither yet are bare examples of sufficient force to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and abolish this idle opinion from out of our idle braines.</p>

For the pestilence, and sundry such other infectious diseases, they containe in them essentially some contagious and veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous matter, which (dispersing it selfe presently through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the parts of the body) will vndoubtedly procure the present destruction of that selfe same bodie: whereas you haue not hitherto proued, that there is in Tobacco it selfe any such infectious or venimous matter.</hi>

               <p>I scorne such a grant at any mans hand: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this so euident, and so cleare a cause. And therefore, I will here vndertake afresh to conuince (if possibly I may) by sound and substantiall reasons, that which I cannot perswade by sundry examples, how lamentable and pregnant soeuer. Thou hauing therfore so freely granted, that the thing which thus sodainly surpriseth the life of mens bodies, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily haue in it some infectious or venimous matter, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing it selfe presently throughout the whole bodie: why should not the Assumption it selfe (established especially vpon so certaine a ground) be able to stand inuincibly against whatsoeuer assaults of fantasticall and idle companions?</p>

               <p>That may soundly be proued by this subsequent syllogisme.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer sodainly ouerthroweth both the faculties of mind, and strength of bodie, that doth vndoubtedly spread and disperse throughout the whole bodie, a

               <p>But the <hi>smoke</hi> of <hi>Tobacco</hi> taken inward, sodainly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoweth both the faculties of mind, and strength of bodie.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the <hi>smoke</hi> of <hi>Tobacco</hi> taken inward, doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly spread and disperse throughout the whole bodie, a venimous matter repugnant to nature.</p>

               <p>In so doing (<hi>Capnistus)</hi> thou declarest the selfe an absolute Asse. For this know thou assuredly, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>axiome</hi> among Physitions conuinceth the Proposition to be certainly true: namely, that nothing can sodainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and ouerthrow both faculties of mind, and strength of bodie, &amp; so either leaue none at all, or a depraued motion in both, but the same hath some infectious &amp; venimous quality wherewith it possesseth the bodie. And thereupon it is, that all Physitions (with one consent) do ioyntly affirme that the falling sickenesse ariseth of a venimous aire possessing the braine.</p>

               <p>Surely <hi>Capnistus,</hi> the daily experience of such as vsually drinke that selfe same <hi>smoke,</hi> doth easily confirme the truth of this matter. For what one is he among our tippling <hi>Tobacconists,</hi> that doth not (alas) euen presently perceiue a certaine whirling about of the braine, and find himselfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearfully possessed with a certaine kind of giddinesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the taking thereof? Or (if not so) that suffreth not at the least, a maruellous perturbation, and a dangerous disturbance of nature? Notwithstanding (besides this their proper experience) I will yet further maintaine, and defend this point, by the approued authoritie and fortresse of sundry late writers (as it were with a wall, or rampire) against the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent assaults of all sorts of gaine-sayers how gallant soeuer.</p>

Wherefore, I was very desirous to taste therof: but presently I perceiued a maruellous sharpnesse therein, and it did most strangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me. So as, me thought verily I was starke drunke; and (as it were) sayling downe a Riuer in some staggering ship: yea and trying the same againe and againe some three or foure times, I eftsoones found the selfesame effect. Wherefore, washing my mouth, and drinking vp a spoonefull of vineger: I forthwith put away the giddinesse of my head. Moreouer, I gaue a peece of the leafe (bruised and wrapped in flesh) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dog: which (presently after some few houres) did cause him to vomit abundantly.

                  <hi>Not so Sir, for then should the force thereof be generally perceiued in all men alike. Howbeit, this swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the head is not generally in all: and in them whom it so strangely possesseth, the same may séeme rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of a certaine thinne humour sodainly turned into wind, and of a whirling about of that aire so sodainly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then of any other supposed quality in the smoke it selfe, as being venimous, and a mortall enemie to the nature of man.</hi>

               <p>This peraduenture (in a simple swimming, and such as is eftsoones felt at some other time else) might seeme to carrie some shew of truth: but in this sodaine darknesse and falling into trances vpon the onely taking of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and at none other time else; and wherein all the senses, and the whole braine is so sodainly ouerwhelmed with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and cloudie <hi>smoke,</hi> it cannot possibly haue any place at all, but by the operation of some venimous matter concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therewith. For such a swimming (for the most part) is the vndoubted forerunner of the falling euill: and impresseth such a sensible weaknesse in the braine, as may not possibly be cured, nor ordinarily helped by any medicine at all.</p>

               <p>That is nothing at all to the purpose.

And therefore, whereas all men are not equally affected with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> selfesame swimming, that ought rather to be attributed to the benefit of nature, and sound constitution of the braine, then vnto any defectiue poysonsome qualitie in the <hi>smoke</hi> it selfe, which is euermore venimous, and a mortall enemie to the nature of man.</p>

And there is much difference betwixt the smoke of the earthie and stinking fume of a burnt hearbe, and the airie iuyce of the said hearbe drawne forth by infusion, by steeping, by boyling, or seething. Indeed, the broath of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> or a sirupe made of the infusion thereof, doth somewhat helpe the stopping of the lungs, but not the smoke.</p>

               <p>Yea marrie Sir, a very trimme purgation (no doubt) that draweth so forth from the bodie and braine such a thinne, subtile and waterish matter, as (it may be) nature her selfe had proportionably appointed to both for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more easie conueyance of the bloud it selfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole bodie: and (in stead thereof) placeth grosse humours in the braine and all the rest of the members; and whereby a certaine curdled matter is increased, and this same smokie stinking <hi>fume</hi> setled in the roome thereof.</p>

               <p>And doth it so indeed? When rather the spirits (whom nature hath ordained to be cleare and bright, both for the discoursing of reason, as also for the ministerie of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9959:38"/>
senses themselues) by this filthie fume-drinking are made obscure and darke, and the braine, and whole bodie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a smokie blacke colour? yea, and when in stead of that same drie clearenesse &amp; light which <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and (with him) all, both Philosophers and Physitions of any sound iudgement do accompt the principall and purest soule, those fume-drinkers do substitute and thrust in their appointed place, most palpably obscured and darkened spirits? In which their so preposterous a purging of the braine it selfe, they do both confound the orderly works of nature, and euen quite ouerthrow the infallible precepts and rules prescribed by Physitions: who are the appointed ministers of nature her selfe for the orderly preseruation of the body in health. Who all ioyntly with one vniforme assent do affirme; that a cloudy and obscure aire, or such as proceedeth from hollow and fennie places, is very vnwholsome for the bodies of men. Which their canonicall iudgment those our fume-deuourers do neuer obserue, vntill (with an extreme hazard of life) they do find (by their miserable and wofull experience) how pernicious a thing it is. Neither, without an exceeding great cause were chimnies (by our Ancestors formerly inuented, that thereby, the smoke (drawne by a vehement heate of the fire from matter apt to burning) might be dispersed abroad in the aire, for feare of hurting the bodies of men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Why Sir? there are many sorts of fumes inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taught by the Physitions themselues, as well for the strengthning of diuerse parts, as also for the curing of hard diseases.</hi>

That therefore the <hi>smoke</hi> of <hi>Tobacco</hi> sucked vp by a pipe or conduite, is exceeding wholsome for the bodies of men? Alas sillie soules, who may not plainly perceiue a flat fallacion in this their consequence?

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9959:39"/>
fumes as do heate and drie. Yea and that sweete kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing the spirits was instituted first by nature her selfe, who telleth vs directly and truly that <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>Not so Sir, for some stinking fumes are also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Physitions themselues in the suffocation of the matrixe, or rising of the mother: and this also with lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and happie successe.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Very true as thou sayest. Howbeit, those stinking <hi>fumes</hi> they are not so applied by expert Physitions with any purpose or mind to cure the disease, but for this end rather: Namely, that nature her selfe, and the naturall heate so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly surprised by reason of those stinking <hi>fumes</hi> which they naturally abhorre, might be the sooner prouoked to gather their naturall strength and vigour afresh, and thereby disperse and expell that venimous aire wherewith the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixe it selfe being stuffed, did so dainly arise and ascend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

               <p>They are so I confesse. Howbeit, warily, sparingly, and in very small quantitie: yea and this also not without a considerate, and proportionable mixture of some other things else to correct and alay the force of their venimous qualities. And that moreouer the operation thereof in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely (which agreeth with nature) might be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9959:39"/>
to the bodie it selfe: and yet (notwithstanding all this) the learned (for their parts) haue euermore had a very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suspition of this kind of curing. And (in the consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lungs especially) I see that <hi>Galene</hi> mislikes those <hi>fumes:</hi> and approueth rather of a sweete bath, or hot-house. And certainly, <hi>Fallopius</hi> himselfe doth not altogether ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of those <hi>fumes.</hi> And for learned <hi>Fernellius,</hi> he vtterly misliketh of them: in so much as (in the cure of the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poxe) he will not admit any ointment compounded of quick-siluer. And verily, if <hi>Galene</hi> durst not so much as taste of the herbe <hi>Lycoporsium,</hi> because onely it but smelt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strong: shall those our smoke-deuourers thus dare, not onely to taste, but also to entertaine into the secret and most inward parts of their bodies, yea euen into the very treasury of nature it selfe, such an infectious, venimous, and most deadly consuming poyson?</p>

                  <hi>Well Sir. And yet for all that, if this smoke of Tobacco were taken but once in a wéeke, peraduenture it might do much good in resoluing the excremental humours onely; as also in expelling them out of the bodie, and yet not consume the naturall moisture thereof.</hi>

               <p>Doest thou place the preseruation of mens health vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blind peraduentures? Surely, a wise man should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peraduenture, before he aduenture to take any thing inwardly into his body: or else he may peraduenture but play the part of a foole. And yet this I confesse withall, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the taking of <hi>Tobacco</hi> but once in a weeke would do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lesse hurt, though it would (notwithstanding) do very much hurt, by working such an imbecillitie and weakenesse in the braine it selfe, as would make it much more apt to entertaine sundry other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall humours afresh: and by procuring the said braine withall (by reason of the excessiue heate and drines thereof) to draw and sucke vp from the lower parts, some such excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall humours as were not to be expelled that way. And verily, if our common prouerbe be true in any one thing, it is infallible, and most certaine in this so seldome a sucking vp of <hi>Tobacco smoke:</hi> namely, That a little can do no harme at all, if the same be not taken.</p>

               <p>What <hi>Capnistus?</hi> And must we (in very deede) be inforced to borrow from the furthermost parts of <hi>India</hi> this stinking, infectious and venimous <hi>smoke,</hi> to expell that masse or sinke of humours from out of the body: when we haue here at home that selfesame method of curing (whether by pilles, by medicines to be chewed in the mouth, or put into the nose, or by sweating) which was formerly deriued from the ancient, &amp; most famous Physical fountaines of the world? Or (if that do not like thee so well) thou maist then (by the meere benefit of nature it selfe) very easily dispatch thy selfe from all such corruptions, if thou diligently and religiously obserue that golden meane which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> perswades, and prescribes in thy labour, thy meate, thy drinke, thy sleepe, and thy lust. For as in domesticall and household affaires, parsimonie or sparing is worth a great stipend: so surely, from the very manner of thy conuersation and cariage, thou mayest receiue a very rich benefite, as well for retaining thy strength, as for preseruing thy health. And herein I will giue to thy selfe, and all our <hi>Tobacconists</hi> this onely precept: which if thou and they do conscionably and carefully obserue as you ought, you may easily and a long time preserue your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie healths healths in good estate. The precept for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is this: Do not lift vp your hands so oft to your mouths: for, an insatiable swilling downe of wine, ale, and beere, as also this inordinate sucking vp of filthie <hi>Tobacco smoke,</hi> do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen band and bend themselues ioyntly together, to breede, hatch, and nourish this filthie foule channell or sinke of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> is reported to haue sharply accused himselfe, for that (whiles he went about with ouermuch abstinence) to keepe his bodie vnder, by corrupting the vigour and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of that his said bodie, he did (after a sort) defraud the functions of his mind, of their appointed organe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9959:41"/>
For vnderstanding at length, that he ought not to liue priuately to himselfe alone, but also to the publicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of others, by instructing, exhorting, and comforting them: and perceiuing withall that those publicke duties of pietie required the ministery of the bodie it selfe, he found by experience at length, that a man ought so far foorth to make much of his bodie, or otherwise to keepe the same vnder: as (in the meane time) the powers and operations of the mind be neither choked with pleasures, nor dulled by too much austeritie. Now then, if so grieuous a pricke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science did euen sting that holy man <hi>Bernard,</hi> because he but made his bodie too too leane and withered with godly exercises, what punishment (thinkest thou) are those men to expect and looke hourely for from the hands of our God, who (by vnseasonable swilling and riotous <hi>fumes</hi>) do most prodigally consume and so riotously weaken and waste the very treasurie of nature it selfe? I for my owne part will put downe no censure vpon them: but (with all my heart) I will beseech the Almightie to giue them farre better minds.

               <p>The reason is this.

Suppose now withall, that this man forsooth (to fulfill the inordinate lust of his owne licentious heart) would yearely dispend one hundred pound at the least, vpon the vanishing flames of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> not abating at all his said excesse in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, in meates, and in drinkes: doth it not necessarily follow, that either this mans fiue hundred pounds rent must other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies receiue some extraordinarie supply for the continuall support of such a superfluous waste, or that else his present estate (in continuance of time) will be tumbled vpside downe? What sayest thou <hi>Capnistus?</hi> do answer directly either yea, or no.</p>

               <p>They are those sighing sobs, and those sorowfull outcries which euen present necessitie, and the fearefull fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights of their future wants doth hourely vrge them vnto. For the better explanation wherof, imagine thou shouldest here likewise behold before thy face, a yong tender brat, or little pretie nest-cukkle (beginning to bite in the lip, to whimper a little) and then (creeping pretily betweete the degenerate father his legs) should cry out and say thus vnto him in the name of all the rest of his brethren and sisters:</p>
               <p>Dad, hearke Dad in thine eare. Am not I thy best boy, am I not, Dad? And doest thou not loue me thy best boy, Dad? Harke Dad, thou wert wont (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wentst to the Faires) to buy thy best boy, fine knacks, fine boxes, fine rattles, a fine feather, a fine gilden dagger, and a fine golden hobbie-horse: wert thou not, Dad? And wilt thou now let me thy white-headed boy runne barefoote and barelegged without hose and shooes? Why harke Dad, hath the fire of <hi>Tobacco</hi> filched thy purse? Hath filthie <hi>Tobacco</hi> flames enforced all thy gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den angels to creepe couertly out of thy coffers into thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluuious pouch, and from thence to flie forth all about? Tell me good Dad, hath the poysonsome stinke of those filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes</hi> made me thy owne pretie boy, my brethren and sisters to stinke now so horribly in thy vnnatural nostrils, as thou art vtterly vnable (how willing soeuer) to buy my brother <hi>Humfrey</hi> an hat, or little <hi>Francke</hi> a fustian coate, or my sister <hi>Kate</hi> a new coife, or poore prettie <hi>Tib</hi> a tawdrie lace, or yet me thy best boy a new nothing to hang on my sleeue? I pray thee hearke Dad, and i'le tel thee a thing in thine eare.

enough of many good mariages. And Dad, little <hi>Kit,</hi> he cries out for a prenticeship, but cannot preuaile therein, for want of preferment. Yea and mine eldest brother <hi>Will,</hi> he goeth wailing vp and downe: because his birth-right (he saith) is bangled out about nothing. Dad, hearke in thine eare; <hi>Will,</hi> he prates many bugs-words to my brothers and sisters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thy backe. He maruels (he saith) how thou canst for very shame go daily (as thou doest) to heare Sermons, and profite no more by preaching. Nay, hearke Dad, he telleth them that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith plainly, <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>thou hast denied the faith</hi>; art become an apostate, and <hi>worse them an infidel:</hi> because thou shewest thy selfe so carelesse in prouiding for vs, &amp; the folke of thy familie. Yea and that the Lord God proceedeth iustly in iudgement against thee, by causing thy fantasticall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of filthie <hi>Tobacco flames,</hi> to feede thee as fat as a foole.

For lo, our owne father himselfe (being fearefully giuen ouer to the insatiable lust of his owne licencious heart) hath now made such an absolute sale of his lands, and so beastly bangled out our birth-rights in so many odde parcels, as there is vtterly no hope at all of any redemption; nor possibilitie that any one of our fathers poore of spring shall euer be able to cast forth a coard by lot, in any our alienated inheritances.

               <p>With a very good will. Wherein thou hast here to obserue, that those selfe same effects, they are either such as more especially concerne the poore Tenants themselues: or such else as more generally appertaine to the publike State.</p>

               <p>They are all those importable burdens which their intoxicated Land-lords do most grieuously impose vpon the poore mens backs, for the bloudie supplie of their beastly wants. For, these our insatiable suckers of <hi>smoke,</hi> feeling once (in a miserable experience) that their fiue hundred-pounds yearely reuenewes will not render an allowance to that their prodigall dispending of one hundred pounds yearely at least vpon those their filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> without a finall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their forefathers patrimonie; and perceiuing moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that no one supply of those their superfluous wants may possibly bee expected from any the good blessings of God, but the cursed supplanting rather of their present possessions, they begin eftsoones to cast about with themselues, which way they may assuredly support their fantasticall fooleries, without the finall subuersion of their proper estates. And this imagination of theirs, no sooner possesseth their swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming heads, but the diuell himselfe doth forthwith suggest as pleasing a supply to their swilling hearts; perswading them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9959:52"/>
seriously (through the diuellish deuice of <hi>Christian Craft,</hi> that Machiuilian monster which hourely attends on their persons, and vndertakes withall to mannage their domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires) that they may very well raise yearely some two hundred pounds more at the least from among their poore Tenants, towards the timely defraying of those their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and idle expences, without any present oppressing of those peasant-like fatbackes at all.</p>

               <p>Very true as thou sayest. For this diuellish deuice is no sooner set on foote by those monstrous Minotaures, but the same is as diuellishly entertained of our Tyger-like <hi>Tobacconists,</hi> and as perniciously put in present practise by them, and their bloudie Bailifs together. So as, from this sandie foundation doth forthwith arise the monstrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing of Lordships, the mercilesse inclosing of seuerall grounds, the insatiable inhaunsing of incomes and fines, the excessiue racking and raising of rents, the beggerly boro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of some three yeares pay before hand at the least; the rufull riding and running; the chargeable carting and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so vncharitably exacted vpon the poore Tenants; their bondslaue-like boonings at euery becke; their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rent-corne, rent-coales, rent-capons, and I wot not what; together with the vnseasonable haling home of their hungry Land-lord his haruest, notwithstanding the exceeding great losse of their owne, lying all abroad in great danger of waste. Yea from hence also ariseth the taking of so many new lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in a needles reuersion; the vnhonest drowning vp of some nine or ten yeares in the old lease at least; the finding forth of some certaine odde quirkes in either of both; and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall making of forfeitures in either of both, so oft as poore Tenants refuse to crouch downe like old beaten hounds at their maisters becke, or to supply the insatiable

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>Not so. For howsoeuer it be a most fearefull sinne before the Maiestie of the immortall God, for any man thus vainely to waste his wealth: yet surely this our superfluous sucking in of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes</hi> goeth neuer alone by it selfe, but hath (like an amourous Ladie) her lasciuious hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies attending hourely vpon her traine, to aggrauate her needlesse excesse the more in the presence of God. For this burning and scorching <hi>flame</hi> being once inwardly taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bowels; there must necessarily follow, an insatiable quaffing vp of wine, ale, or beere at the least, to allay and quench the excessiue heate of the stomacke. And by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable quaffing in of these strong drinks, <hi>Dame Venus</hi> her selfe beginneth eftsoones so fiercely to be enflamed and set on fire, as nothing in the world but some one of her Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, or Draf-sackes at least, must forthwith be fetcht, to calme the new kindled coales of their lusting hearts. And those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous Damosels so seruiceably attending their becke, &amp; so wantonly seruing their turnes that way, they must not only be most gallantly adorned with whatsoeuer ornaments of brauery themselues, but be courted eftsoones (by those their prodigall paramours) in sundry changeable &amp; charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sutes. And this brauery of apparel, it must be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably graced with proud &amp; sumptuous buildings: and those
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9959:53"/>

               <p>My meaning herein is this. Namely, if there could none other helpe at all be had, then were it much better to beare a time with such desperate aduentures as tend to the onely hurt of some priuate persons, then ouer carelesly to neglect the vnnaturall nourse-mother of some such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempts as directly do aime at the publike good of the State. I will demonstrate this matter by an apparent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus.</p>
               <p>Those our late traiterous Recusants, they were all (for the most part) but beggerly Bankrupts, and men of very base condition, as Authoritie it selfe (by due inquisition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident

Now those men (for the most part) they were formerly held for professed <hi>Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>: namely, for disordered and riotous persons. Who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling first from <hi>Tobacco</hi> to tippling; from tippling to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; from whoring, to a Court-like brauing; from a Court-like brauing, to superfluous building; from a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous building, to a prodigall dispending of their ancient patrimonies, &amp; other their alloted preferments; from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall dispending, to an excessiue want; from an excessiue want, to a wofull malcontented condition; and from their malcontended condition, to the proud pioners most bloudie profession in that the vndermining practise of theirs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they purposely put downe their pestiferous proiects and plots for their present reliefe. For howsoeuer they made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it selfe vnseemely couerture to those their traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempts, because among them, <note n="i" place="margin">

The sequele it selfe doth sound forth at large the truth of the premisses now, how intricate soeuer before. For their intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable wants became so heauie a burden vnto their vnben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded backes, as (before they would too long vndergo the huge weight thereof) they rather most damnably resolued among themselues to massacre our most Christian King, our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene; our peerlesse young Prince, the whole royall of-spring, the honorable Councell; the Nobles, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, the Cleargie, the Communaltie, and the happie estate of this our whole countrey: like a most viperous brood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring the very belly it selfe wherein they were borne and bred.</p>

And howsoeuer these, and the other may seeme somewhat to differ in their seuerall circumferences, they do both of them ioyntly fall iumpe and pat vpon one and the selfesame period of publike disorder. For (concerning any their practicall designements) they mutually march forwards in one and the selfe same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion, I meane, in the pestiferous disturbing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous supplanting of our publike State.</p>

                  <hi>There is no necessarie consequent in either of both. For behold Sir, they may forthwith surceasse from such a superfluous waste, and eftsoones betake themselues to a much more frugall course.</hi>

               <p>Thou mayest be assured of that, if thou but obserue their ordinarie courses. For (hauing ioyntly determined vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the match making) to make then their sweete liquor of life the appointed period to all those their pot-like procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they suppose it not greatly amisse, to begin the match first, by drinking in measure next their hearts; that is, each man (for his share) must carouse a whole quart at a clap, for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his eie-sight. After all this, they mispend some quarter of an houre in questioning about the maner of their Hostes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses brewing, and in commending most highly that last bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed liquor of life. But now (forsooth) perceiuing some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine cold qualme ouerwhelming their queasie stomackes by reason that their lately receuied liquor lieth cold in the same, they do call forthwith for one ounce of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> for a <hi>Tobacco</hi> pipe, and a greasie candle to kindle the same: suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9959:56"/>
in (by course) that filthie <hi>Tobacco fume,</hi> as eagerly (I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thee) as the hungrie horse-leach sucketh vp the putrified bloud from a sore bruised leg. This is no sooner done, but they begin eftsoones to feele the fierie scorching <hi>flame</hi> of that filthie <hi>Tobacco fume,</hi> to fret and burne in their bellies: and thereupon, they do presently call for a whole yard of ale, that is, for so many fresh cups of that their beloued liquor, as may stand one by one within a yard compasse euery way. With these they resolue to allay, and to quench the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heate in their belching breasts: wherein also they do make exceeding much haste, for feare of fiering their rubie vermilion noses. This purpose performed, they perceiue their former fierie stomackes so sodainly cooled, and do then feele withall, such a chilling cold dispersing it selfe throughout all the parts of their bodie, as they feare to be forthwith surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a cold deadly palsie, or to fall eftsoones into some new feauer-lurden at least: and thereupon they take <hi>Tobacco</hi> afresh: and withall (for preuenting the worst) they do call forth a whole Iurie of fresh cups, to conclude and determine the good estate of their bodies. The first quart cup of those twelue (being called <hi>Tom Troth</hi>) they do make the foreman of the Iurie: swearing him forthwith, to giue vp a very true verdict concerning this present point, and to kisse the booke, that is, to cleaue close to their pale coloured lips till all the liquor be out. After him, <hi>Brafield-font</hi> he is next called, and so all the rest of their Iurie in order: telling them one by one, that the same oath which their fore-man had taken, must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them also (for their parts) take and fulfill, so helpe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Exceedingly well: and no maruell at all. For it is the manner of such cup-shotten companions, to accompt those wiues the best wiues (what baddes-bies soeuer) which with one after-noones sport, are able to make their pottage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot play the better for a whole weeke together.

Whereupon the whole crew of companions fell a scuffling together, neither once knowing, nor yet caring whom they do strike, so they may soundly light pat on any mans pate. In this their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fought fray, there was giuen many a broken head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides sundry drie blowes about their shoulders. At length they friendly parted themselues: and thereupon <hi>Arthur</hi> (to saue his recognizance) conueyes them one from another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seuerall corners, there to sleepe out the good-ale suddes. After all this (hauing somewhat recouered their senses) they call forthwith for a reckoning: which came iust to twentie shillings ten pence for ale, and seuen shillings sixe for <hi>Tobacco</hi> and candle. Such as had present money payed their shares: and such as had none, either layed downe their pawnes, or else ranne on the score till a further reckoning. And then (calling for a fresh paire of cardes, and their reckoning cups) they thought good to conclude their sport, with a game or too at Poope-noddie.</p>

               <p>Surely, <hi>Capnistus,</hi> thou art ouer shallow of conceit to deale in deeper matters of policie, if thou perceiuest not this. For (besides the great hurt which those our <hi>Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> do causelesly procure to their owne proper persons and states) is it not exceedingly hurtfull to the publik good of our countrey, that any such able persons should be so carelesly permitted to cassier their publike callings; to leade an idle and loytring life; to lose their precious times; to abandon their ancient trades; to neglect their charges; to consume their patrimonies; to lauish forth their worldly preferments; to waste their whole wealth; &amp; so to procure such needlesse pouerty vpon themselues and all theirs, as they must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced perforce, either to beg their bread, or to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon publike charge at the least: to the vntimely imbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilling of their present prouision, and the preposterous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of publike good? Tell me (I pray thee) whether these their disordered courses do not collaterally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently become very pestiferous to our publike State? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, these disordered persons, they are egregiously scandalous to sundry such others of like disposition, in giuing them all a very pernicious president to such profluuious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences as they are naturally prone vnto, by procuring them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9959:58"/>
to the like disordered practises; by causing them very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly to foreslip their present auailes; to lose their precious times; to neglect their commendable callings; to cast off all Christian care concerning themselues, their wiues, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all the folke of their familie; yea and euen prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally to dispend, and wastefully to consume their worldly wealths vpon vanishing and vaine delights. Are not these squandring courses of theirs become very pestiferous presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and most pernicious practises (thinkest thou) to the vndoubted preiudice of our publike State? For how should publike States be prouidently supported, and safely preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their publike good: without the honest cares, the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeuours, and industrious labours of men in their sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry professions and callings? And who shall attend vpon such industrious, laborious, and painefull endeuours, if all sorts of trades-men should confusedly become such carousing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions?

What reason haue we to become bondslaues for bellie-gods; poore <hi>Saint Christophers,</hi> for proud carousers, diligent drudgs, for such desperate drunkards; yea and most prouident sparers, for such prodigall spenders?

Howbeit (in the meane time) these our tippling <hi>Tobacconists</hi> they run headlong an end vpon sundrie other disordered courses, no lesse perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to our publike State then those other before. For when their patrimonies are all dispended; when their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth is vtterly wasted; yea when those their profluui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purses haue thus prodigally poured forth the best bloud in their bellies, then they bring their hungrie Hostesse some pretie pawne or pledge for their beloued liquor. Then their houshold trash must trudge forth; then their whole webs of cloth must walke; then their bras pots, their bras-pans, their

               <p>Thou speakest the truth. And therefore, their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prate it selfe would forthwith be sharply suppressed, for

feare of some subsequent mischiefe. Howbeit, these our tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling <hi>Tobacconists</hi> (those riotous companions I meane) they feare not to surpasse the pestilent bounds of that their pestiferous prate, by putting in present practise all those perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious proiects and plots which their pestilent tongues had so audaciously, and so vndutifully prated of, long before. For <hi>Mad-braine</hi> the Make-shift, <hi>Proud-mind</hi> the Plummer, <hi>Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braines</hi> the Shoomaker, and <hi>Iustle king</hi> the Ioyner, they do no sooner heare speech of causing Inclosures to crack, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they care not a point to cracke their desperate consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on peeces, in an vndutifull vndertaking to set such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous practise on foote: arming themselues, and animating their desperate associates to the ioynt and speedier perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance (forsooth) of such a preposterous enterprise. Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall (to such as demand a reason of those their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate aduentures) that one <hi>Maister Neede</hi> did this way set them on worke; that they were resolued to deale no further therin, but according to <hi>Maister Mend-all</hi> his only direction, and with the authenticall warrant besides of an old penall Statute against such hurtfull Inclosures: yea and that also (for their protection and pay) they marched vnder the approued conduct of <hi>Captaine Pouch.</hi> This exploit was no sooner brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad, but the very garbage of gracelesse subiection; they off-scouring of honestie; the scumme of humanitie; yea the whole rif-raffe of vicious persons came flocking thicke and threefold from euery coast vnto their accursed company: reporting abroad, they had twelue pence aday for their paines, with wine, ale, and beere so much as their bellies would hold. These flying reports drew multitudes vnto them from euery place, and procured them many moe fauourets wheresoeuer they came: who would not sticke on their ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench to say, God speed the plough, though yet they durst not afford them their presence.

               <p>But what? doth it follow thereof (thinkest thou) that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for the needful vpholding of tillage there are prouided many good statutes,) therefore these disordered persons (for the better preseruation of tillage) might (at their priuate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures)

               <p>Very well. Now then we are consequently come to consider more especially of that our second propounded point. Namely (for that the surest supportation of all estates in a countrey or kingdome doth primarily consist in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9959:68"/>
vpholding of husbandmen) whether therefore the augmentation of tillage (all other things continuing still in their ordinarie course) would become the onely best ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes to maintaine that one onely state it selfe in such solid condition, as that thereby also all other estates besides are the more surely supported from time to time? My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this, whether (all other things else continuing stil their ordinarie accustomed rate) the onely augmentation of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage must be adiudged the best meanes of all to maintaine and vphold the husbandmans happie estate?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>They take in hand to demonstrate the matter thus. By the augmentation of tillage (say they) there might be maintained in England, as many moe husbandmen as there are at this present. And so the greater multitude of husbandmen, the greater aboundance of corne; and the greater aboundance of corne, the better cheape it would be by much.</hi>

               <p>They shew themselues to be men of shallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts: because such an augmentation of husbandrie, would directly become an augmentation of beggerie. For if a poore husbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may now very hardly vphold his present husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, when corne is presently worth some two shillings sixe-pence at least: how should he be able to vphold the same in any good sort, when the price of corne is but sixe-pence the bushell at most?</p>

               <p>

For if he might vsually sell his one bushell before for two shillings sixe-pence at least, and now (that corne is so cheape) can sell those his foure bushels but for bare two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at most, is not the poore husband-mans state impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, rather then bettered, by this their augmentation of tillage, notwithstanding any the exceeding great plentie of corne? Now then, if the abundance of corne (arising from that their former augmentation of tillage) be brought once to such a low price, as (albeit the poore husbandman had now foure bushels at least for euery one bushell before: how shall he be able (in such an impouerished estate) to discharge his annuall rents, to performe his seruants wages, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide plough and plough-geares, cart and cart-geares, at such an excessiue reckoning, to defray his domesticall charges, and vphold his husbandrie also, without the vtter impouerishing of his present estate?</p>

               <p>Thou conceiuest the matter aright. For whereas in former times (when corne was sold for fiue pence a bushell) the poore husbandman payed for a good new cart but one noble at most: now he payeth foure nobles at least for the like. Then he might buy him a plough readie made for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene pence; now it will stand him in fourteene groates at the least. Then he might prouide him his yron-workes for three farthings the pound: now he must pay three pence halfe-penny for euery pound at the least. Then he might haue a whit-leather hide for one shilling at most: now he payeth fiue shillings foure pence at least. Then he might haue had an acre of grasse both mowne and made to his hands for two groates, or ten-pence at most: now he must giue two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings sixe pence at least, and not haue it so well done by the halfe. Then might he hire a very good man-seruant for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie groates wages: now can he not haue any so good for twice fortie shillings at least. Then might he purchase a very good yard of full brode-cloath for three shillings foure pence at most: now he must pay some foureteene shillings foure pence at least, for the like, Then he might haue had a good paire of Shooes for sixe pence: now can he not haue the like for two shillings sixe pence at least, and so for the rest. These things therefore being soundly considered, how should the poore husbandmands state be bettered one pinne, by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the prices of corne through that their preposterous aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of tillage, so long as all other things, else do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue still in that their former excessiue reckoning?</p>

the sheepe-maisters flockes are all shorne.

in the prices of corne did drinke vp his gaine? As also, which way would the abundance of corne make the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Trades-men become the wealthier one groate then they were at the first, if corne (notwithstanding the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof) continue still at the accustomed price? It is not therefore the abundance of corne, but an excessiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement in the prices of corne, that these men do make the onely shot-anker of all their hope. And very certaine I am, that (so themselues might buy bread-corne and mault-corne fox sixe pence a bushell) they would neuer thus disorderly prate, and practice for the augmentation of tillage: though there were lesse corne in the land then (God be blessed) there is, by ten hundred thousand quarters at least. By all this it is apparently euident, that then the augmentation of tillage doth vndoubtedly tend to a publike good, when not onely some one or two sorts of people are thereby helped, and the poore husbandman especially is not therwith hundred at all. Otherwise the partiall supportation of some few alone, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fearefull suppression of sundrie besides, were very preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For euen as in our naturall bodies, when the sustenance thereof is soundly concocted, and proportionably dispersed throughout for conuenient nutriment to each seuerall part, then the whole bodie it selfe is vniuersally vpheld and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a very good state; whereas, if that the said nutriment should be wholly exhaust by some three or foure members, with an vtter depriuation of nutriment from the rest of the members besides, then surely, that selfe same body would not onely grow out of order in it selfe, hauing some three or foure members thereof puffed vp vntill they bee ready to burst, and all the rest made as leane as a rake; but besides, there would follow (in continuance of time) a finall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all the whole bodie: So surely, in the body of our Commonwealth, when the whole commodities thereof are aptly imployed, and proportionably disposed for the more conuenient welfare, and publike good to each seuerall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, then the whole bodie of Commonwealth is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9959:74"/>
vniuersally vpheld, &amp; continued in an happie estate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the commodities of our countrie were wholly sucked vp by some three or foure sorts of subjects, to the pitifull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerishing of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he rest: then without question, the whole body of our Common-wealth could not long continue in good estate. Because some would be readie to burst with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, while many other besides, do euen woorne away with their wants, to the finall confusion of the whole State it selfe in a very short time, without some timely redresse. And therefore, howsoeuer such abundance of corne, might vndoubtedly become exceeding commodious to some three or foure Monopolian Merchants, who (by transporting the same (at such a slender reckoning) into all forraine parts with an excessiue great gaine, would grow (in a very short time) so abundantly rich as if they were readie to burst. Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer such an excessiue abatement in the ordinarie prices of corne, might be singular good for Artificers &amp; Trades-men, and poore labouring persons, who (buying corne now for nothing, and selling their commodities and ordinary labours as excessiuely deare as euer before) might (in very short space) attaine to a wonderfull wealth: yet without doubt, the poore husbandmans state (by whose onely industrious labours all other estates are hourely vpholden) it being greatly impouerished by the small prices of corne, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly oppressed through the excessiue rating of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities else; I cannot possibly perceiue how this their aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For tell me, I pray thee, whether it be the great store of tillage, or the well manuring of tillage that breedeth abundance of corne? Hath not some excellent husband as much corne of one acre, as some haue of two or three? Be it therefore supposed that a poore husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hauing in his occupation before, but bare fortie acres of arrable land, did yearely grow thereof some fortie quarters of corne at the least: whereas now (when he hath some fortie acres more annexed to his Farme) hee hardly groweth fortie quarters of corne at the most. How much (thinkest thou) is this poore husbandmans state aduanced by this their augmentation of tillage? May he not boldly put vp the whole gaine of his getings in his eye, &amp; yet see neuer the worse? Is he not properly promoted by tillage, being thereby surcharged now with a two fold toile, for a bare sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle increase of corne? Is not his great abundance of arrable ground (through some lacke of good order) growne now so farre out of order and heart, as it will either yeeld him but little, or no burden at all? His charge of housekeeping, of houshold seruants, of horses, of carts, of ploughs, with other odde implements, is mightily increased: and the great gaine of those his daily endeauours, and industrious labours, as deepely decreased. How then is this poore husbandmans estate made any thing the better, by that their augmentation of tillage?</p>

                  <hi>Sir, he must procure him abundance of shéepe (they say) to amend his barren land by the often foulding thereof: and withall, he must get him a great companie of beasts to bréede him good store of compose, and thereby better his barren grounds by manuring of the same to the full.</hi>

               <p>This, (indeed) is something they say. But yet now (when the small prices of corne haue so mightily impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the poore mans purse, as he is hardly able to buy him cloathes to his backe) where is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes (thinkest thou) that

should compasse those cattle? Corne he hath none to sel: and many quarters of graine would not buy him halfe a quarter of a flocke to fould his said barren ground. Or, be it supposed the man had money good store to buy those beasts: where is the most conuenient place for their walke? or wherewithall shall he pasture those cattell, when all his Inclosures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laie-grounds are quite conuerted to tillage? Before this augmentation of tillage, a poore man might very well raise his whole rent from out his Fallow-fields, those fields affording him great store of grasing to pasture his sheepe: but when all his gras-grounds are turned to tillage, that hope of gaine is growne out of vse; and he may haply reape from his Fallow-fields now, some three or foure loades of thistles to recompence his paines in ploughing the same. For, consider <hi>Capnistus</hi> and marke it well, are there not (at this present) in euery Champion field, some ten, twelue, yea twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres of laie-grounds at least, which being (as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) in former times made arrable land, were all of them left laie by poore husbandmen, some two hundred yeares past or more.

But yet (say they) this their augmentation of tillage would bring abundance of corne: and so poore husbandmen (hauing abundance of corne) might kéepe (if néede were) their milch-kine with corne.</hi>

               <p>I told thee euen now (and thou couldest not deny) that it is not the abundance of tillage, but the well manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of tillage which breedeth abundance of corne.

How would the excessiue prices of corne be any whit abated thereby, all the while that selfe same abundance is quite consumed with keeping of cattell?

there may be an excessiue abatement of beeues and muttons in <hi>England</hi> without the present impairing of our publike good?

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9959:78"/>
thought of their owne proper hearts: yet when they shall hereafter somewhat more considerately examine the matter it selfe without any such wry-respect, and according to the proportionable bounds of Christian policie for publike good, I make no question at all, but that they themselues will eftsoones affirme, that (in those their blind baiard-like bold speeches against such necessarie breeding of sheepe) they were rather misguided with the sway of inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than soundly directed with any authenticall rule of setled reason. For, howsoeuer those our great pasture men do gather vp to them selues an exceeding great gaine by the breeding of sheepe, as there is no reason at all, but that they which win it, should weare it: yet surely (if I conceiue not the matter amisse) there is no one commoditie throughout the whole land more tending to the publike good of rich and poore, than the great abundance and mightie increase of sheepe, as that which was <note n="f" place="margin">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9959:79"/>
amongst vs in England, yet cloathes (they say) are neuer the cheaper in England: and therefore they sée not how poore men are bettered any thing at all, by the making of cloath.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Though cloathes (in very deede) were neuer the cheaper by the great store of cloath-making among vs in <hi>England,</hi> which is vtterly vntrue: yet would cloathes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more excessiuely deare among vs in <hi>England</hi> by much, were it not for the great store of cloath-making throughout the whole land. And therefore howsoeuer these gaine-saying companions, do grosly imagine that the poorer sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are nothing bettered by the making of cloath, yet surely if that one trade alone were discontinued among vs but for few yeares together; not onely the better sort of men they would quickly begin to feele some very shrewd want, but many poore soules besides (set on worke by that meanes) should shortly haue hungrie bellies. Yea euen those our <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacconists</hi> themselues would plod vp and downe with thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare backes, and tattered tailes. But now tell me <hi>Capnistus</hi> (I heartily pray thee) how any great store of cloathes may possibly be made without abundance of wooll; which way, men may haue abundance of wooll, without a continuall breeding of sheepe; how such a continuall breeding of sheepe may well be maintained without abundance of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; and how such abundance of pasture may possibly be had, where all our Inclosures are thus preposterously conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tillage?</p>

                  <hi>Surely Sir, I wot not which way to supply such a want: and therefore I do fully referre the further answer hereof to those our disordered Tobacconist's who labour so eagerly after such a preposterous augmentation of tillage, without giuing regard at all to sundrie other as néedfull commodities as corne it selfe, for the orderly supportation of euery seuerall estate in the land. Wherein moreouer they declare (at vnawares) that as the water which dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the mill, decayeth the mill: so surely, those their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9959:80"/>
affections which so preposterously enforceth them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in such an idle conceite of publike good, would turne (in very short time) to the fearefull subuersion of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good.</hi>

               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>With a very good will: this therefore it is. It came to passe on a time (<note n="h" place="margin">Policrat. <hi>de nugis Curiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.</note> saith he) that all the members of a mans body conspired ioyntly against the poore stomacke, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him (forsooth) who (by his insatiable rauine) did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhaust and deuoure the ordinarie labours of all the other members besides. For, whereas the eie it selfe was neuer satisfied with seeing, nor the eare with hearing; whereas the hands were bent each minute of an houre vpon their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie labours, the feete became fearefully sorebated with trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to and fro; the tongue was euen worne to the stumpes about the moderating of speech and silence; yea all the whole members were mutually deuoted towards the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good of the whole body it selfe: onely (in this their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall carefulnesse and excessiue toyle) the stomacke it selfe (as they falsly surmised) he liued at ease, and whatsoeuer the rest of the members had carefully prepared before by any their mutuall labours, he alone deuoured vp the same by a prodigall waste. What neede many words? The rest of the members considering this, they do all ioyntly conclude to desist forthwith from all those their peculiar designements for publike good: and therewithall (withholding whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conuenient sustenance from the said stomacke it selfe) they fully resolued to torture that their insatiable and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduersarie with the continuall want of nutriment. Vpon this their ouerhastie and headie resolution, one day was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed quite in a pining penurie. The second day followed more tedious and irkesome than the other before. But the third
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9959:80"/>
was so extremely byting and pinching to the stomacke it selfe, and all the said members besides, as they ioyntly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faint and to fagge. Oppressed thus by vrgent necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the members they assemble themselues afresh, very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consulting about their owne, and that their supposed aduersarie his present estate. In which their publike assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, the head it hung drooping downe; the shoulders (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shrewdly benummed) they shakingly shrunke together; the armes became weake; the hands vnable to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vp; the feete were infeebled so sore, as they could not possibly support their appointed burden; the whole body it consumed away; yea the tongue which vntill then was preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enough to pleade for the publike good of the whole body it selfe, it eftsoones began to faulter, and cleaue so fast to the roofe of the mouth, as it had now no power in it selfe to propound and expound the publike occasion of that their present calamitie. The case standing fearefully thus, the whole members (by a ioynt consent) they make their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all recourse to their soueraigne Ladie the Heart, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent aduice in this their publike distresse: who (examining the matter with a more aduised and mature deliberation,) by the very sway of sound and substantiall reason did make it apparently euident to all the members, that this so exceeding a miserie befell them all, onely because of their former hard measure towards the said stomacke their falsly supposed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary. For, by withdrawing a competent sustenance from him (he being the deputed publike dispenser thereof to the rest of the members,) they did thereby also depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues of conuenient naturall nutriment. And (sith none ought <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> 
                  <hi>to go a warfarre at his owne proper cost)</hi> it cannot otherwaies be, but that (by withholding the publike maintenance from the said stomacke it selfe) they themselues were proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably disabled euery of them from the dutifull discharge of their proper designements for publike good. Neither may any blame thereof bee iustly imputed vnto the poore sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: because he could not possibly distribute that publike
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9959:81"/>
sustenance to the rest of the members, which he receiued not first for himselfe. And therefore (saith reason) I conclude it a safer course, and much more consonant to natures sacred direction, that a conuenient nutriment be primarily besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on him who must propor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ionably distribute the same vnto others, then (by thus peeuishly depriuing the said sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke therof) to procure an ineuitable penurie vpon it selfe, and all the rest of the members. Hereupon it came forthwith to passe (by reasons pithie perswasion) that the said stomacke being presently repleate with corporall sustenance, all the rest of the members (by her operation) were proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and mutually refreshed together. Ladie Experience (the Schoolemistrisse of fooles) making the rest of the members now to perceiue their former exceeding great follie, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke he was vniuersally freed from all imputation of blame concerning this their needlesse calamitie. Because, howsoeuer he be (in very deede) an insatiable deuourer of whatsoeuer their publike labours, yet doth he not so insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly feede thereupon for himselfe alone, but likewise, for all the rest of the members: and therefore, he being pined with a needlesse penurie, they cannot but be miserably pinched with a biting hunger. Surely <hi>Capnistus,</hi> if thou examine the matter aright, thou shall find it euen so in the politicke body of euery particular countrey. Wherein, albeit the stomacke (the poore husbandman I meane) doth heape vp together exceeding much maintenance: yet doth he not heape vp the same so much for his owne proper vse, as for the publike good of all the particular members in that selfe same politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body. And therefore so much the more heedfull regard must hourely be had about the orderly supportation of that one estate aboue all the rest: by how much the prosperous, or the pining condition of all other estates doth proportionably depend vpon that one estate aboue all the rest. For be thou throughly assured of this, that there is proportionably euen one and the selfe same office of the stomacke in a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and of the poore husbandmans estate in euery politicall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9959:81"/>
body. Because if the stomacke it selfe be hourely kept in good quarter, all the rest of the members they are mutually refreshed thereby. Whereas, if it be made empty of corporall sustenance, how should it then be able, either properly to support it owne selfe, or collaterally to sustaine the rest of the members? And euen so, if the poore husbandmans estate be vpheld in an happie condition, the rest of the members throughout the whole politicall body, are substantially and soundly supported from vtter confusion. Whereas, if the poore husbandmans happie estate be fearefully impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, how should any estate else in that selfe same politicall body be possibly enriched, or safely preserued? And therefore let these our disordered <hi>Tobacconists</hi> take heede in time, lest (by this their preposterous augmentation of tillage vnder an idle and fained pretence of publike good) they do not hurt themselues and the rest of the members in this our politicall body, to the vtter subuersion of our publike good. For if corne it selfe (by this their augmentation of tillage) should inconsiderately and causelesly be brought to such a small price, as the poore husbandman (all other things else conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing at an excessiue great reckoning) be not able to sustaine himselfe and his familie: how should he possibly be able to afford any publike maintenance to all other states else in the politicall body?</p>

Howbeit, if these pedling Parsons and Vicars were but once enforced to find and feele in their proper experience, that such a preposterous augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tillage did afford them no further augmentation of tithes then they reaped before, yea and that those selfesame tithes which thus befall to their portion, are farre worse in quantitie and qualitie both, then were those their former tithes which they possessed before, when there was lesse store of tillage by much; and (which more is) that (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the badnesse thereof) they are eftsoones enforced to bestow a twofold labour in gathering the same: surely when their proper experience hath made them perceiue the plaine truth of the premisses, they will then crie out to their seruants and say, Sirs, we haue now adaies a very long haruest for a little corne. For fie vpon this preposterous augmentation of tillage: it was neuer well with the Common-wealth, since the same was first so fantastically set on foote. For euery hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman now hath so much arrable land in his proper pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, and so little manure withall to make it more burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as he loseth one acre while he is sore toyling about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The land (for want of good order) is now so cleane out of order and heart, as it yeeldeth more weeds then corne: yea and the corne which it commonly beareth is so leane and so light, as it affordeth no floure at all.

               <p>Very true as thou sayest.

               <p>I tell thee this in good earnest: it must either be needfull, or needlesse. But howsoeuer the augmentation of tillage may very truly be said to be simply good init selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was <note n="x" place="margin">

Then next, a matter but needlesse it may seeme to be for the present: because corne is not now so excessiuely deare, but that each man (of what sort soeuer) may as sufficiently

For when as one bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell of barley (being then sold for fourepence in former times) was able to buy him but one pound of candle: one bushell of barley now (being sold for two shillings sixpence) will purchase this poore husbandman, a pound of candle, a pound of hops, a quarter of lambe, three pennie-worth of bakers bread, &amp; a gallon of good ale at the least; &amp; so forth proportionably for the rest of any his other needfull affaires.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The case is apparently euident concerning the husbandmans happie estate: but how for the inferiour sorts of subjects?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>The selfe same proportion (respecting their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons and places) will fitly serue for euery of them. For who seeth not but that the Artificers, Trades men, and poore labouring people (being painefull in their callings, frugall in their gettings, and prouident in all their dispendings) may
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9959:85"/>
as competently, and as conueniently maintaine themselues, and the folke of their familie now, with bestowing two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings sixpence vpon euery bushell of corne, as their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might haue done in former seasons when they payed but sixpence for euery bushell. For euen as the prices of corne are now increased, so surely the different prices of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall traffickes, their sundrie commodities, and ordinarie labours, they are likewise proportionably augmented and raised accordingly, so as the different times haue brought no disparagement at all to their different states. I will make it more apparently manifest by this demonstration: When a Shoo-maker (in former seasons) might readily buy him a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell of corne for sixpence, in those selfe same times he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could sell a good paire of shooes for sixpence. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Shoo-maker now payeth two shillings sixpence for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bushell of corne, he may now also sell the like paire of shooes for two shillings sixpence. So as one paire of shooes (in former times) would buy but a bushell of corne: and one paire of shooes (in our present daies) will likewise procure him a bushell of corne. These things being certainely so, the Shoo-makers state is much better now, then was the Shoo-makers state in former seasons. For, this Shoo-makers hauing once procured him a bushell of corne with one paire of shooes, which also his fore-fathers were forced to giue for a bushell in former ages, he hath fully as many shooes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for his further vses, as had his fore-fathers before him, yea and each paire of his will be fully as much worth as fiue paire of the like in his fore-fathers daies. And as in this one, so likewise in all other trades else, according to the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same proportion of persons, of times, of trades, and of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is euen certainly so as you say. And therefore I wonder what should make our Artificers, our Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and poore labouring people so malcontent as they are, with their present estates.</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9959:85"/>
a fantasticall wantonnesse rather, which (shaping their shooes now a great deale higher in the instep, then did their fore-fathers in former times) doth make them so malcontended. My meaning is this. Our men (hauing now more ambitious, more aspiring and haughtier hearts than had their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before them) they cannot <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8.9.</note>

                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>consume the same</hi> vpon their inordinate and licentious affections. For let our Artificers, our Trades-men, and our poore labouring people be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious now in their different degrees, as diligent in their seuerall callings, as painfull in their ordinary labours, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident in getting, as carefull in keeping, as frugall in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and as heedfull in their domesticall dispendings as were their forefathers before them: and I see not (as yet) to the contrary, but that (the premisses themselues being proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably and rightly respected) they might euery way liue in as happie a state as did their fore-fathers before them. But when those men were industrious, and our men are riotous; when they were diligent, and ours too too lazie; when they were painfull, and ours ouer playfull; when they were proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in gathering, and ours profluuious in scattering; when they were carefull in keeping, and ours carelesse in sauing; when they were frugall in disposing, and ours prodigall in bestowing; when they were heedfull in dispending, and ours altogether heedlesse in dispersing: how should they possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accord in their proper conditions, when there is so great discord in their diuerse professions? How should they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in their equall properties, when they dissent so much in their seuerall practises? or how should they iump pat in their congruent states, when they so greeuously iarre in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent stirres? The Trades-men (in former times) would not willingly spend so much in seuen yeares together about the necessarie decking vp of themselues, their wiues, and seauen
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9959:86"/>
small children, as our Trades-men now do wilfully waste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the needlesse trimming vp of proud Tag-tailes their wiues in lesse then one quarter of a yeare, or two at the most. The ancient Artificers then would not vsually prouide so many delicate dishes for themselues and their families in a whole twelue-moneth together, as our new vpstart Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do now commonly procure for each Sundaies dinner at least. Milke, cheese, and butter, was a rich and bountifull banquet with them: Pig, porke, and lambe is nothing with ours, vnlesse also they haue a whole quart of sacke to kindle their queasie stomackes withall. It was very much with poore laboures then, to play one poore halfe-pennie at cards throughout a whole Christmas together to cobble their shooes: it is nothing with our loyterers now, to lauish forth twelue-pence a weeke at one vnthristie, or poope-noddie at least, for whole gallons of ale to comber their cockscombes withall. It was fully sufficient for the common sort then, their wiues &amp; poore children, to be reputed good, honest, plaine countrey people: whereas our vulgar sort are neuer satisfied now, vnlesse themselues be reckoned the odde burgo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of euery parish; vnlesse their proud wiues be gentilized with, May it please your good worship at euery word; vnlesse my yong princkcockes their sonnes be maistered with long lowsie huge lockes on their head, and a guilt-dagger for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, behind at their backes; yea and vnlesse my prettie pigs-nie their daughters bee ladified with a tucke on their tailes, and a paire of new pumpes on their heeles for hurting their kibes. So as howsoeuer our ancestours liued honestly, &amp; contentedly with their former conditions, it is no maruell at all if these our late vp-startes be monstrously malcontent for their proper estates; without any one occasion at all from the scarcitie of corne for want of more tillage.</p>

all men may now plainly perceiue, that it is not any want of corne, but the wantonnesse rather of their leud disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that makes them discontented with the times, with their states, and with whatsoeuer else is opposite to their humorous affections.</hi>

Neither is it their want of a competent skill, or sufficient strength of bodie to maintaine their labours that constraines them thus to complaine: for therein they farre exceede, and go beyond those other poore men by many degrees. But it is their onely want of grace, their want of a Christian consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their want of an honest heart, and the want of a readie will to walke industriously in their seuerall callings, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this stirre.

               <p>Content. And (for this respect) thou hast here to obserue afresh from the premisses, that a rebell is he who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene lawfully conquered before, and vpon his humble submission receiued to mercie) doth estsoones (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) seditiously raise vp and vnlawfull war against his liege Lord, and lawfull Superior. Or else, a rebell is he, who abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not firmely in that honest loyaltie and faithfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wherein he is strictly obliged to his authenticall King, and dutifully bound to his naturall countrey: but too too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliously reuolteth from both, and resistingly taketh vp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against his said authenticall Soueraigne and naturall countrey. By this then it is apparently euident, that rebellion is nothing else but a wilfull resisting or rising vp against a lawfull authoritie. And that therefore, if the word <hi>bellare</hi> be properly and purposely put downe to import and authenticall and lawfull warre, then the word <hi>rebellare</hi> it doth not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but euen purposely betoken an vnlawfull rebelling, or an vndutifull raising of warre against a lawfull authoritie. As also, if the word <hi>bellator,</hi> be truly translated an authenticall warriour, then the word <hi>rebellator,</hi> is not vnaptly termed a treacherous rebellour. I will yet more plainly demonstrate this matter thus. When two fight together in a cause contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie, or in a matter of meere repugnancie, that quarrell (in the one of them) is vndoubtedly iust: but yet (in the other) it is vtterly vniust, so as (in this case) the imputation of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion it cannot be truly imputed to both. For he that hath the iust quarrell, is properly said <hi>bellare,</hi> that is, to fight lawfully in the necessary defence of his owne proper right: but he that vpholdeth the vniust quarrell, he is not improperly said
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9959:91"/>
                  <hi>rebellare,</hi> that is, vnlawfully to rebell or rise vp in an vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary opposition to him that stands in the lawfull defence of his owne proper right. Not the other then, but this man that maketh the vniust opposition, is properly termed the partie rebelling. To apply this to our present purpose. The Kings Maiesties power, and these our disordered persons did skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish together in a cause contradictorie, or in a matter of meere repugnancie. Because the Kings power it stood for the timely supportation of publike peace, and the necessary defence of his Maiesties positiue lawes against that their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull assembling together for the lawlesse and needlesse disparking of pastures inclosed: those disordered person so vnlawfully assembled they rose vp in their owne proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against that his authenticall power, to mannage the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse of that their desperate attempt against those his Maiesties lawes. Not both, but the one of these may truly be said to rebell. If they had dared to say then, or at this present do but thinke that his Maiesties power rebelled against them, and not they against his Maiesties power, it were more then high time they were all cut off quite, for so proudly <note n="e" place="margin">

Because in whomsoeuer there is a maioritie, in them there is placed a commanding authoritie, and in whomsoeuer there is a minoritie, vpon them is imposed an obeying necessitie. And therefore, if his Maiesties power may not iustly be said to rebell in that action, because it authentically stood vp for the onely supportation of publike peace, and the timely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Maiesties positiue lawes: it must then necessarily follow, that they themselues (so vnlawfully arising against his said Maiesties authenticall power) did make the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And euen so, those our disordered persons (in that their vnlawfull resistance) they are very aptly and properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led obstinate rebels, how vnsauourie soeuer the word <hi>rebell</hi> doth seeme to that their vnsauourie taste.

                  <hi>Let euery soule be subiect to the authoritie of the higher powers.</hi> For there is no power but of God, the powers that be, are ordained of God: whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receiue to themselues damnation. For Princes are not to be feared for good workes, but for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Wilt thou then be without feare of the power? Do well, so shalt thou be praised for the same, for he is the Minister of God for thy wealth. But if thou do euill, then feare; for hee beareth not the sword for nought, for he is the Minister of God, to take vengeance on him that doth euill. Wherefore you must be subiect, not because of wrath onely, but also for conscience sake. What sayest thou <hi>Capnistus,</hi> to the word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> now? as also to the testimonie of the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same?

                  <hi>The case (I confesse) is much more apparently euident, than that any sound hearted subiect may once dare to oppose himselfe to the same. Although notwithstanding, they themselues, and their vnderhand fauourites do séeke to suppresse the imputation of rebellion thus: Indéed (say they) if those silie poore soules had taken vp armour against his Maiesties power, they might iustly be called rebels: but (alas) they were silie poore snakes, vtterly vnarmed, and therefore no rebels.</hi>

Had they not hatchets, axes, mattocks, shouels, spades, forks, staues, bowes and arrowes, bils, partizans, guns, with other like implements? were these no weapons thinkest thou? And would they be commanded (in a peaceable manner) to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp these?

               <p>Such a man may vnblameably do it (saith God) because I my selfe (for that selfe same purpose) haue vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly substituted him thereunto, according to <note n="m" place="margin">

               <p>Surely, euen that which sufficiently tendeth to the true opening of this portion of Scripture according to that onely sence which I set downe before. For seeing the holy Ghost hath not here put downe the word <hi>bara,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly betokeneth the creating of something from out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preexisting in nature; neither yet hath vsed the word <hi>tsarath,</hi> which properly signifieth to forme or fashion a thing (as it were) by melting the same in a mould: therefore, this portion of Scripture (being not purposely declared by any of those two words) it cannot properly be vnderstood of that primarie image of God which more particularly respecteth the first creation of man; and so consequently the speciall reason comprehended therein, it can haue no such peculiar reference to that murdered man in whom the created image of God is so defaced. Moreouer, sith the holy Ghost doth precizely put downe in this portion of Scripture, neither <hi>bara,</hi> nor <hi>tsarath,</hi> but the onely word <hi>gnasa,</hi> which properly betokeneth to aduance, to extoll, or to magnifie with honor, as I told thee before: therefore the text cannot significantly be resolued thus; For in the primarie image of God, hath the Lord created or formed that murdered man: but rather more proportionably thus; For in the secondary image of God, hath the Lord aduanced, and magnified that his subordinate reuenger of innocent bloud. And so the maine reason ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred there in that text, it hath (thou maist see) a much more peculiar reference to such a reuenger of innocent bloud as is peculiarly authorised thereunto according to that diuine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of soueraignetie, wherein such a reuenger (by a peculiar dispensation from God) is authentically aduanced, extolled, and most honorably magnified. Now then, the Almightie Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah (protesting to <hi>Noah</hi> and the rest, that the <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9959:99"/>
reason, why such a subordinate reuenger of bloud may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vnblameably accomplish that businesse: namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a man (such a ministeriall reuenger of bloud I meane) is authentically formed or made in the image of God; or (to speake more significantly and properly according to the originall text) because such a subordinate reuenger, is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically aduanced, dignified, extolled, or magnified with the authenticall image, or liuely resemblance <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>There is (I assure thee) no question thereof. Yea and therefore the <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 16.27.</note> onely wise God (to take quite away all colourable shewes of any such idle conceipt) hath of very purpose compacted and coupled euen those the former three words (I meane, <hi>bara, tsarath</hi> and <hi>gnasa</hi>) all ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one and the selfe same verse, yea and (which more is by much) for those the three former different respects which we precizely spake of before, saying thus: <hi>Euery one shall be called by my name,</hi> for <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>We may not therefore too too grosly imagine that these three seuerall words were here put downe by the Prophet, onely for bate Synonima, as words (I meane) of one and the

same signification; for so should he haue made but an idle tautologie, that is, but a superfluous and a needlesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of one and the selfe same matter, propounded thus: I haue created him, I haue created him, I haue created him. But those three seuerall words they are vsed there rather <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Tremeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Isa</hi> 43.7.</note> as different termes, or as an elegant gradation, to set forth more succinctly, the excellent and most admirable order of the Lord his exceeding great kindnesse towards the elect.

                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.4.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>The matter (as you make it) both seeme verie probable. But yet do tell me (I pray you) wherefore you your selfe haue purposely translated the word gnasa put downe in that place (aduanced or magnified) rather then (made or formed that man in the image of God) as it is vsually turned in many of our Latine and English Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hydr.</speaker>
               <p>I haue purposely translated the word <hi>gnasa</hi> so, for three principall reasons. First, because (among the manifold significations of that word set downe before) it is no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but a most proper signification of the word it selfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that the very coherence and purpose of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent text doth euen proportionably require that selfe same translation. And thirdly, because (in sundry other places <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6.</note> of Scripture besides) the same word <hi>gnasa</hi> (vpon the like vrgent occasion, by many most excellent and learned <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>See R. D. Kimbi, in</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6. <hi>See Tremelius in Deut.</hi> 32.6.15. <hi>and</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.4.</note> Linguists) is ordinarily and vsually translated, to aduance, to extoll, and to magnifie with a soueraigne dignitie, dominion, prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9959:100"/>
or princely power. As in Deuteronomie thus, Is not the Lord God thy Father, that hath redeemed thee, that hath magnified thee, that hath proportioned thee? And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thus: He forsooke God that magnified him, and regarded not the strong God of his saluation. Also in Samuel, thus: It is the Lord that magnified <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt. Also in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isaiah thus: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one shall be called by my name (saith the Lord) for I created him, I formed him, I magnified him. And againe in another place thus: I the same, euen I will beare you vntill the hoare haires, I haue magnified you; I will also beare you, I will carrie you, and I will deliuer you. Where also he vseth the like elegant gradation, (though in different termes) to that which he spake of before. Now then, sith such excellent Linguists (notwithstanding the forenamed opposition in some of our Latine, and English Bibles) haue thus (vpon vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion from those the former propounded <note n="o" place="margin">

Although this I acknowledge withall, that (if my purposed iourney had this way bene prosperous) I could (by the onely trafficke of Tobacco it selfe) haue cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained thrée hundred pounds by my voyage at least; so vainly are our vaine English-men affected after a vaine, and vanishing filthie fume.
