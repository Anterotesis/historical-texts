            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61780:7"/>
Rich in good Works. The Matter of his Preaching (as also of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation) was very Pious and strict. The Manner of his Preaching at his first coming was too Academical for the Community of his Auditors, whereupon divers of them Request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Preach in the Method they had been used to, and conceived might be most Useful; namely, by Doctrine, Reason, and Use; to which he readily condescended, as aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their Profiting more than his own Praise: He was Observed to be very Temperate in his Diet, and sparing in his Recreation; he was a hard Student, early and late at it, where the Bible was the Centre of his Library, out of which his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were well Studied, and Penn'd almost <hi>Verbatim</hi> before he Offered them in the Pulpit. At one time, upon an Apprehension that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry was slighted, and likewise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful, and that he did no good
<pb facs="tcp:61780:7"/>
among them, he resolved to leave them, and go Preach else-where; upon which some of the meaner and poorer sort came to him, and one of them spoke these words to him: If you will indeed go, I will give you one word, which is this; If you have been an Instrument to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any good Work of Grace in the Heart of any one of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that one Soul miscarry through your departure, the blood of that Soul God will require at your Hands, I charge you therefore not to go: Whereupon he resolved to stay till his dying day, and after this the Fruit of his Ministry appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him more and more. The year before his Death he said to some that he doubted his Ministry had not that effect he would have it, and he feared the cause was because some paid towards his maintenance by way of Collection for him; I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therefore I will not have a

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61780:27"/>
                  <hi>That the Judgement of the Saint, and the Judgement of the World, the Judgement of the Godly Religious Heart, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prophane heart, there is a great deal of difference between them in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Juding about Good and Evil, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which the one accounts a very very little Sin, if a sin at all, the other may count (as having a little better Eyes in his head than the bleer eyed World) a very gross, a very grievous, a very hainous Sin, a sin enough to make one a very Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Belial. So Adultery, a sin which I doubt the World accounts no such great sin; yet <hi>Josephs</hi> Godly heart, what a great sin made he of it! <hi>How can I commit this great wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> So single Fornication, a sin much more made nothing of in the world, yet how does the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> Godly heart aggravate and set it forth for a most grievous Sin? being highly injurious to our own Body, to a Member of Christ, to a Temple of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Covetousness, meer and bare and single Covetousness, so it be not attended with Injustice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not so much as taken notice of to be a Sin in the world; and yet what a great sin the same Apostles godly Heart took it for, you may know
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61780:28"/>
by this, in that he can scarce mention it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out setting this upon the head of it; <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness which is Idolatry.</hi> So contentious Wrangling and going to Law one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not rather (if possible) labouring to end things by friendly Arbitration of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, that the world takes this for no sin, full Terms and crouded Courts shew: and yet what a scandalous and ungodly thing the Apostles godly Heart took this kind of Lawing for, you may know by his earnest reasoning against it for almost half a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, and then concluding thus; <hi>Now therefore there is utterly a fault, &amp;c.</hi> Neither can any man say, that he spake onely against the Christians contentious Lawing before unjust and unbelieving Judges, for that is but onely a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance aggravating their Law and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not the whole thing condemned by him, as appears <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7. So Swearing, vain ordinary swearing, what Fault is it counted? And yet if the Apostle <hi>James</hi> his godly Heart had not taken it for a great sin, would he in such strange precise manner have forbid it? <hi>But above all things, my Brethren, swear not,</hi> &amp;c.

and 27. 14. So a little Pride of Heart, to be lifted up for any thing that we have, above what is meet, and to proceed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to some outward Act expressing it, who counts of it as any great sin, or matter much to be repented of? Yet what a great sin <hi>Davids</hi> godly Heart when it awakened and came to it self, made of it, you may know by his Confession, and setting these two upon the head of it, <hi>I have</hi>

                  <hi>sinned greatly, I have done very foolishly.</hi> An ordinary Heart would not have found any such great sin in a little Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the People, out of a little Pride and Conceitedness of heart for the Greatness of their Number; but <hi>Davids</hi> godly Heart thinks otherwise. So what a great Sin did the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> think Bribery and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be, who rather than bribe <hi>Felix</hi> to procure Liberty to preach the Gospel, (for it cannot be said, it was because he was not <hi>able;</hi> for had he been but <hi>willing,</hi> the Christians no doubt, (sayes <hi>Calvin</hi>) would have made a Purse for him, and found him Money,) he would lie two full years in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the prejudice of the Gospel: And yet what great sin is Bribery and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made now adayes, though not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Liberty to preach the Gospel, (that they may do <hi>Gratis</hi> if they will,) but more

               <p>Sixthly, That we may avoid Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, consider the Apostle's Remedy, or means against it; <hi>sc.

               <p>Seventhly, That we may avoid Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness, consider another Remedy of the Apostle, <hi>sc. Eph.</hi> 5. 18. to be filled with the Spirit: <hi>And be not Drunk with Wine, wherein is Excess, but be si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Drunkards are among those that shall never come into Gods House, never Inherit his Kingdom: Drunkards (I say it the third time) look to it, as surely as the Devil shall never go away with any of Gods Children, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
