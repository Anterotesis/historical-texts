            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Pavier or zealous brother, being very intimate with the grand Doctors of that unſanctified diſcipline, and being privy to moſt of their waies and ſecrets, and hearing it taught at one of their Coventicles or meetings, that it was a great ſinne for a woman to conceale any mony from her husband (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe being finiſhed) one of the women of that auditory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Teacher, that ſhe was guilty of that ſinne, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ſhe concealed 20. l<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g>. from her husband, &amp; demanded what ſhe ſhould doe to be forgiven of that ſinne, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to bring the mony to him, promiſing ſo to diſpoſe thereof amongſt the people, that her offence in that behalfe ſhould be pardoned, which the ſimple woman did, whereby ſhe and the poore were coſened by a knave.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How the Pavier taking this preſident of the holy man of God his practice, cozened three women of their cheeſes.</head>
                  <p>Who ſpeedily repaired unto three rich women of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (that he knew to be well ſtored with good cheeſe which he wanted) and made them believe that they were ſuch hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinners againſt God, that if ſpeedy meanes ſhould not be made for the remiſſion thereof, they were in the ſtate of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereat the poore women being put into a great fright
<pb facs="tcp:112103:4"/>earneſtly beſought the Pavier (who they conceived to be a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man full of ſanctitie and a deteſter of vice) to find out how Gods wrath might be appeaſed, and their ſinnes remitted; who (after much intreatie and promiſes of rewards) told the women that firſt they ſhould confeſſe their ſinnes, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity thereof, meanes ſhould be made for the remiſſion therof: and being demanded how and to whom their tranſgreſſions ſhould bee acknowledged whereby the quality therof might be evident, wiſhed each of them to fetch him down a cheeſe of the biggeſt they had, and ſcales to weigh them in, which being weighed and notice taken of the weight thereof; the Pavier did cut a round circle in the middle of every one of the cheeſes, and tooke out the cheeſe within thoſe circles in lumps unbroken; inſomuch that there was a round hole in the middle of every of the ſaid cheeſes almoſt through; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Pavier delivered every woman her owne cheeſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine charging every of them by the next morning to confeſſe all their ſinnes in thoſe holes and that he would then come to them, and in the meane time would goe home and pray for them, and ſtudy meanes for the remitting of their iniquities, and did take home with him the lumps taken out of the cheeſe, and cut off all the cheeſe thereof neere from the rine, and made round lumps of lead fit for the filling of them holes, which he took in his pocket the next morning, and comming to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they brought their cheeſes to him, ſaying that they had confeſſed all their miſdeeds that they could remember that ever they did, whereupon the Pavier wiſhed them to fetch ſcales thither to weigh the cheeſes, and in the meane time cunningly clapt the lead into the holes which he covered with the rine of cheeſe that he had in his pocket, which (being weighed) fame exceeded the weight they were of the day before, whereby the Pavier expreſſed unto them, that the quality of their ſinnes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſo great, that if ſpeedy meanes wore not eftſoones obſerved for the remitting thereof, doubtleſſe they ſhould preſe
<pb facs="tcp:112103:4"/>them downe to hell, and therefore the Pavier for to baniſh the multitude of their confeſſed ſinnes from off the face of the earth, tooke the cheeſes and threw them over a great bridge into a great river called Eboy, wherehence the Paviers wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his directions tooke them up and feaſted upon them a goodwhiles after.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>What meanes the Pavier preſcribed to have the Womens ſinnes forgiven, and how he cozned them of 9. <hi>l<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g>.</hi> by promiſing to die for their ſinnes and how be was like to be hanged by a boy in earning the mony.</head>
                  <p>Vpon a ſerious conference betwene the Pavier and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he made it appeare unto them that every ſinne was mortall and that therefore there ought to be a death before thoſe ſinnes could be blotted out of the ſight of God; whereat the women being in a perplexity not knowing what to ſay, deſired him to invent ſome other way whereby they might ſave their lives, and promiſed to give any content; wherupon the Pavier ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtedfaſt upon his former words, told them that there muſt be a death had before God would bee ſatisfied for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and that he loved them ſo well that he for a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reward would die for them rather then they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the ſtate of damnation for their miſdeeds, whereat the women became very joyfull, giving him many thanks, brought three pound a peece, which he received, and was the only thing he aimed at, and preſently thereupon tooke a little ſtoole and a rope with him into an upper room in one of the womens houſes where ſpying a croſſe beame tyed the rope about it, making it ready for to be hanged therein, for to puchaſe a pardon for the womens tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he (together with the women, having joyned in fervent prayers) ſtood upon the ſtoole, and telling them that the ſpirit was then ſtrong with him, did put the rope about his
<pb facs="tcp:112103:5"/>necke, and wiſhed the women to goe into the next roome, and pray for his happineſſe in ſo great a taske. And when as they ſhould heare him groane, they ſhould helpe him downe, for that by that time ſatisfaction would bee made, and their ſinnes abſolutely forgiven. And ſo away the women went as he had bid them, leaving him upon the ſtoole with the rope about his necke; inſtantly thereupon a ſonne of the woman of the houſe (being a pretty big youth, in regard of much whiſpering that he ſpied up and downe the houſe, ſtealing up ſtaires to ſee the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof) ſaw the Pavier ſtanding upon the top of a ſtoole, with his backe towards him, and his necke in a rope, and in a manner playing therewith: at the ſight whereof the youth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde that the Pavier had been a meanes to procure him to be whipt at ſchoole divers times for playing at Tennis and Cat upon the Sunday, intended to be revenged upon him then, and ſuddenly ſhifted the ſtoole from under the Paviers feet, and runne away, leaving him there ſwinging, in a way indeed to performe what he had undertaken. But the women being near unto him, and hearing him ſchreech, ſpeedily runne to him, and by much adoe made a ſhift to ſave his life. Now for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens paines in hindring the Pavier to performe what hee had undertaken, I could finde in my heart in a manner to wiſh them the ſucceſſe that the Pavier ſhould have, had hee beene left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not by them hindred in his proceedings.</p>
