            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Some few Conſiderations, ſuppoſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful;</hi> Concerning the vote of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Friday</hi> the 24. <hi>February</hi> upon the Bill, <hi>For the Hindring the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of</hi> Gold <hi>and</hi> Silver, <hi>and the Melting down of the</hi> Coin <hi>of this Realm, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Propoſed by Dr.</hi> Hugh Chamberlain, <hi>to the Wiſdom of the Honourable Houſe of</hi> Commons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gold and Silver, as all other Commodities, whether Foreign or Domeſtick, muſt be conſider'd with reſpect to their real natural Value, and the Market-price, which are both very variable, and not to be governed by Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The real natural Value of all Commodities, is the Expence of labour, Charge and Hazard, in raiſing and bringing the ſame to a Market, and this Varies it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for Gold doth not coſt ſo much in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Guiny,</hi> as it doth in <hi>London, Paris,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> The Market-price varies according to the Multitude or Paucity of Chapmen, and the plenty or ſcarcity of the Commodities.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The multitude or paucity of Chapmen, are commonly governed by their ſeveral Neceſſities and Pleaſures in the uſe of the Commodities: Thus we ſee, where Gold is not the meaſure of Trade, as in ſome parts of the Eaſt and Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Africk,</hi> Iron is much more valuable, becauſe they have much occaſion for the one, and little or no uſe for the other; neither for Veſſels, Ornaments, or Mony. So likewiſe tho Gold ſhould coſt you 3 <hi>l. per</hi> Ounce, if you can find but few Chapmen, you muſt ſell it for 40 <hi>s.</hi> if you can get no more, and your Neceſſities compel you to ſell: and if it ſhould coſt you but 40 <hi>s. per</hi> Ounce, if you have multitude of Merchants, you may ſell it for 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> more or leſs, for 'tis not what Charge it ſtands you in, but the greater or leſſer number that hath occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The plenty and ſcarcity of Commodity varies the Price, tho much above the natural Value, or below it. Thus a piece of Bread in a Siege of a Penny natural Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue is oft ſold for 5 <hi>s.</hi> and on the contrary, a Diamond formerly ſold for 10 <hi>l.</hi> when ſcarce, hath by clogging the Market yielded but 5 <hi>l.</hi> tho poſſibly leſſ than the Charge expended, which is the natural Value.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nothing can poſſibly bring Gold or Silver, being of Foreign Growth into <hi>England,</hi> but the Exportation of Commodities of our own Growth or Manufacture; or what our Natives can return from Foreign Service for their Labour, or what Foreign Travellers ſpend here to ſee the Country.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nothing can poſſibly carry our Gold and Silver out of <hi>England,</hi> but the conſuming more For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gn Commodities at prime coſt, then we get in Value for the Sale of our exported Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, or what Foreign Merchants, and Mechanicks by their labour and Thriſt can ſave he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to return to their own Country; Or what our Nobility and Gentry ſpend abroad in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Travels, or what our Ambaſſadors, Foreign Ministers, or our Armies in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or Mercinary Allies draw out of the Nation.</p>
            <p>So that 'tis neither changing the denomination of our Coin higher or lower, above or under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ural Value and Market-price of the material, which quantity and uſe will regulate, can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither gain, keep, or drive away our Gold and Silver, but only the abovementioned bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Trade, over or under which like Neceſſity will over-rule all Laws.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That which makes the variety of Value here at home, betwixt Gold, Silver and Bullion, is the diſproportion among themſelves, according as, they exceed the ſettled proportion by the Standard, in Uſe or Quantity. For Example, When there is more uſe for Gold, or leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uantity in proportion than for Silver, Gold ſhall be dear, and exceed the Standard in the Market-price, tho the natural Value continues the ſame. And when there is more uſe for Silver, or leſs quantity in proportion than for Gold, Silver ſhall be dear, and exceed the Standard in the Market-price, tho the natural Value were the ſame. And when there is more uſe for Plate than for Mony, Plate ſhall be Deareſt and exceed the Standard in Value, and Coining ſhall not only ſtand ſtill, but very oft the Coin ſhall be melted down: For, if the qantity of Gold exceeds in proportion the Silver, Gold ſhall be Cheap: If Silver ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Gold, Silver ſhall be Cheap: If Mony exceeds Plate, Mony ſhall be Cheap, If Plate exceeds Mony, Plate ſhall be Cheap. And tho Mony ſtill retains the ſame Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it doth not always the ſame Value, being alſo over-ruled by the plenty or ſcarcity of other Commodities, for a Crown is not of the ſame Value When it will purchaſe but half a Buſhel of Wheat, as when it can a whole one, there being then either leſs Corn, or more need of it, or more Chapmen that come with more Mony; but this Variety is no prejudice to the Nation, in reſpect of the quantity of Gold and Silver, that being always the ſame; for when we have more Mony, we have ſo much the leſſ in Plate, and if more in Plate, we have the leſs in Mony: But notwithſtanding, it is a very great damage to Trade, becauſe Mony is living Riches, Plate but dead; the one being capable of turning and improving Trade, but Plate is not.</p>
            <p>The Nobility's hoarding and carrying of Gold in their Pockets and the great Gaming with Gold, will raiſe the price above Silver, tho the proportion remains the ſame.</p>
            <p>From the Premiſſes may be concluded, that raiſing the value of our Mony, cannot keep it, but will give our Merchants ſome trouble to adjuſt the Parr in their Exchange and Trade abroad: Nor lowering it cannot drive it away, without bringing as much or more in the room; but if we take no care to exceed in Exportations, all we can do, will never keep our Mony; and if we do exceed in Exportations, all Foreigners can do, can never draw is away. Exportations muſt be ſufficient to anſwer the Charges that foreign Payments, of Allies, Armies, Ambaſſadors, Engliſh Travellers, and returning ſtrange Dealers, requires as well as importing Foreign Commodities, or we muſt ſtill Decline. Which regulation of Trade 'tis hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceived, may well deſerve the ſerious Care of this Honourable Houſe. This Duty I thought I ow'd my Country, and hope 'twill give no Offence if I have been miſtaken, I'le thank any that will rectifie me.</p>
