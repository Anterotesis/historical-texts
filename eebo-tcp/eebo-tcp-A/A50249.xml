            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is justly accounted one of the glories of the <hi>English
Nation,</hi> that God hath honoured them with special
light in some momentous Truths, above what he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Protestant Churches</hi> round about them. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Christian Sabbath, deep and spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
into those secret transactions between the Lord and the soules of his
elect at their first conversion, &amp; also in their after walking in communion
with God, are usually observed as instances hereof. And of the same
kind, though perhaps in a lower rank, are those Truths about the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Worship</hi> of God, which have been now for some years a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of those disquisitions, which do also at this day exercise
the most searching thoughts and ablest pens that are amongst us. And
truly the dealing of God in his Providence towards the people of <hi>this
Land,</hi> in bringing out the light and glory of these Truths, hath been
observable, and different from the way that he hath walked in to <hi>other
Churches.</hi> For, whereas they rose up from <hi>Antichristian apostasie</hi>
in Doctrine and Discipline both at once, together with his abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Faith, rejecting also his inventions in <hi>Church Order,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as neither the Head, the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor his Body in the principal
Members of it, the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> with the rest of that
<hi>Hierarchical frame,</hi> have at all been to be found exercising the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
of the <hi>man of sin,</hi> in most of the <hi>Reformed Protestant
Churches</hi> since the first day of their rejecting <hi>Popery:</hi> In <hi>England</hi>
it was far otherwise, the head of <hi>Antichrist</hi> being indeed here cut off
by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>eighth,</hi> who justled him from his usurped supremacy
within his Territories, but yet (as is observed of him) he left his
body, the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> continuing; which for many years not only
stood, but exercised in a great measure, the authority of the <hi>Dragon,</hi>
and made an image of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and caused as many as would not
worship it to be killed. And in this the Lord had doubtlesse a design,
more fully to lay open the loathsomnesse of the abominations of the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
<pb facs="tcp:59363:3"/>
of iniquity</hi> in this part of it; which by his infinite wisdom he
effectually carried on all along, and hath in a good part accomplished
in these daies wherein we live. For even from the first <hi>Reformation</hi>
here begun, the Lord shone in upon the understandings of some of his
precious servants, with such an evidence of light in these things, as
overpowred their Consciences, and constrained them to bear a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
testimony against the <hi>remainders</hi> of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the Land. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as from that time, till the day of the downfal of all the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical
brood,</hi> God never suffered himself to be without his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in this cause of his, whom he raised up, and whose right hand
he held, to plead, and preach, and pray, and weep, and beleeve, and
print, and contend, and resist, and suffer, for the institutions of
Christ, not only to silencing and reproach, but to banishment and blood
it self some of them. And verily the number of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who have had his testimony and kept the Word of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Saints in this Land since the first Reformation, will be
found not to be few, and their sufferings neither few nor light, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that dying wish of judicious and blessed <hi>Ames</hi> shall be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it deserves, <hi>viz.</hi> that a <hi>Martyrologie,</hi> in this cause of <hi>Church-Discipline</hi>
under the <hi>Bishops,</hi> should be compiled and published to
the world. And hence it is come to passe, that amongst the <hi>English</hi>
Divines and Christians there is, as was said, more light in these
points, and in sundry of their Church Assemblies and administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more purity, then is so ordinarily to be met withal in others. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all that have suffered for and searched into these Truths, they
of <hi>New-England</hi> justly deserve, and will have, a name and a glory,
as long as the earth shall have any remembrance of an <hi>English Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
not only for their sufferings here under the iniquity of those bloody
Fathers of the Church (as they loved to be stiled) the <hi>Bishops,</hi>
though they bore as great if not a greater share therein than most of
their brethren that staied behind them. But more especially will after
ages honour them, for that great and high adventure of theirs, in
transporting themselves, their wives, and little ones, upon the rude
waves of the vast Ocean, into a remote, desolate and howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
and there encountring by Faith and patience, with a world of
temptations, and streights, and pressing wants, and difficulties; and
this, upon no other inducements, but that they might meet with him
whom their souls loved in the midst of his Golden Candlesticks, and
<pb facs="tcp:59363:3"/>
see him as they have there seen-him in his Sanctuary: An under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
hardly to be parallell'd, unlesse perhaps by that of
their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> or that of his seed
from the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these are the men, Christian Reader, who are the Authors
of this disputation now put into thy hands; which deserves esteem and
acceptance somwhat the rather on this account, because it comes from
such as it doth, and is about such a Subject; even from men holy and
learned, and is about that which they have searched into, as seriously,
impartially and unprejudicedly, as any men are ever like to do in this
world. Besides, that being themselves Officers to <hi>Instituted
Churches</hi> of Saints, and this work of theirs being nextly and especially
for the service of the Churches, they did therein lie under as direct
and full an influence of the Spirit of Christ, and were on all accounts as
compleatly wrapt within the promise for their guidance, as men can on
this side Heaven. Yea 'tis about those Truths which they have, and
at this day do suffer for; aud therefore they are as likely as most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to be the instruments in the hand of Christ, by whom he will
communicate further light in these points: God is never behind
hand with men, and as some special exercise of any particular Grace
strengthens and encreaseth it, and establisheth the heart in it and with
it; so, the obedience and faithfulnesse of his servants to any truth of
Christ, especially if in an eminent degree and manner, engageth God
to make known more of his counsel and will in that truth to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and as under such an engagement the Lord looks upon himself.
It is true indeed the <hi>Civil Magistrates</hi> of that <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the
<hi>English</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> that lies upon the River <hi>Connectiquot,</hi>
sent these Questions to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> and
they mutually called together sundry of the ablest <hi>Ministers</hi> of each
<hi>Colony,</hi> and recommended to their search and considerations these
enquiries thus stated, thus framed: And this was the happy rise
of this <hi>Disputation;</hi> what is here thus tendered to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the result and product of the consultations and debates on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
had, which was by the Elders met together agreed to, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
presented, to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Jurisdictions</hi>
respectively. But neverthelesse, it was especially and nextly for the
service of the <hi>Churches,</hi> the pious and careful <hi>Magistrates</hi> being
herein indeed nursing Fathers to them; for they finding doubts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:59363:4"/>
perhaps some differences about these points, likely to arise and disquiet
the <hi>Churches,</hi> took this prudent and happy course, timely to bring
forth such light, as might be to universal satisfaction, before dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
had brought forth difference in judgment and perhaps practise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and that contentions, and they such animosities and paroxysmes as
would afterwards more hardly be healed, than prevented.</p>
            <p>These Papers came some moneths ago to <hi>England,</hi> and it was
then in his thoughts that had them in his hands, to have made them
publick; but for some reasons which then prevailed with him he forbore,
yet hath since given way thereto, partly expecting, according to some
intimation which he had from <hi>New-England,</hi> that the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
there would have ordered the printing of them. But, not hearing
since that it is there done, he hath given way to the desires of some
Friends here, who were acquainted with them, and with his having
of them, that they should now thus be made publick; hoping withall,
that what is done herein, will not be unacceptable to those <hi>Reverend
persons,</hi> that were the <hi>authors</hi> of this <hi>Disputation.</hi> Especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that God who formes the Spirit of man within him, and in
an especial manner guides the hearts and studies of his servants, hath
of late set awork some of them in <hi>Old England</hi> also, to search into these
<hi>Questions,</hi> and communicate the issue of their enquiries to the world
in print; whence likewise many more, are awakened to desire and
long, for further light in these points about which the main part of this
disputation is. Thus we see, the same great and blessed Spirit, that
dwells and works in the hearts of all the Saints all the world over,
hath, in this also, wrought the same work, on the hearts of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ in <hi>Old England</hi> and in <hi>New:</hi> From whence there
ariseth (though not such as quite to take away all difference in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet) a further onenesse and agreement between them, than that
of blood and language, as men of the same Nation; or that of the
common Faith, as fellow-Saints and servants of the same Lord.
Like as two needles of equall weight, toucht at once with the loadstone,
will as they say, by a secret Sympathy move alike and at once, though at
many miles distance one from another; so the hearts of the Saints in
both <hi>Englands,</hi> as being toucht with the same Spirit, have moved
together towards the same enquiries; although perhaps, as in other
points, they got the start of most of us here in <hi>England,</hi> being in the
light, and shaking of the dust of <hi>Babilon,</hi> before most of our Churches
<pb facs="tcp:59363:4"/>
did; so they may in this also, have had the same honour; there appearing
in them a study of the Questions resolved in this <hi>Disputation,</hi> before
there was any observeable discovery of such a search here amongst us;
the wise God keeping towards us both the like proportion still, so carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them and us, in an even pace, towards the same end of light
and glory, which he will bring us both unto at last. And these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
with the truths therein, having in themselves a tendency to this
happy end, the midwifeing of them by the press into the publick and
common light, in compliance with the aforesaid providence (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likely otherwise to have lien hid in a private hand or two) cannot
be lookt upon as at all injurious to those <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>reverend El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
that were the Authors of them, much lesse to any others; for 'tis
here done, (saving the Errata of the press) with such faithfulnesse
as cannot be impeached.</p>
            <p>And this is the rather said, because perhaps the Reader may have
been deceived in some other Treatises, which have gone abroad, and
generally been look't upon, as the compilement of the <hi>Elders</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi>
whereas they had but one private person for their Author.
So it is indeed in the 32 <hi>Questions,</hi> the Answerer whereof was <hi>Mr.
Richard Mather,</hi> and not any other Elder or Elders in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who likewise is the Author of the <hi>discourse concerning
Church-Covenant</hi> printed therewith, which latter he wrote for his
private use in his own Study, never intending, nor indeed consenting
to its publication, nor so much as knowing unto this day how the copy
of it came abroad into those hands by whom it is made publick, save
that he conjectures some procured a copy of it from <hi>Mr. Cotton,</hi> to
whom (such was their intimacy in his life time) he communicated
it, as he writes in a late Letter to a Son of his now in <hi>England</hi> who it
seems had enquired of him concerning those Treatises; and much lesse
is there any truth in that which is said in the Title page prefixed to the
<hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> as if it were sent over to <hi>Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
Anno 1639; Mr. Mather</hi> having neither acquaintance nor any
intercourse by Letters with <hi>Mr. Barnard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor indeed, are these Papers, now in thy hands, the declared judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Elders in <hi>New-England,</hi> there being but about twenty
called together by the <hi>Magistrates</hi> to consult of these things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their judgments in them, and of those twenty, two or three met
not with the rest. They are neverthelesse the genuine product of that
<pb facs="tcp:59363:5"/>
               <hi>Meeting of Elders</hi> which on the forementioned occasion was held in
the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Moneth</hi> 1657 at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What entertainment they will meet with now they are abroad it is not
for me to say. They must now run the same hazard with other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of this kind. Some passages there are which I fear will be wrested
by one kind of men or other to serve their own hypothesis. It was in
my thoughts, having some special advantages for it, here to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
somthing as to those particulars for the prevention of such an
abuse. But I shall only say this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let but such passages in this short
tract as seem most to vary from what the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> of
<hi>New-England</hi> have been accounted to professe and practise, receive
an interpretation as they will bear, from their own declared judgment,
either in their <hi>platform of Church Discipline,</hi> or in other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of their own, and I doubt not but it will be found, they are not
warped from their former Faith and Order: Whatever some may
think from this Treatise, or whatever <hi>Mr. Giles Firmin</hi> hath born
the world in hand, in any of his late misrepresentations of them; whom
I rather chuse to instance in, for that his reports of <hi>New England</hi>
have perhaps therefore found the more credit, because he above others
is not without advantages to know <hi>New-England,</hi> and the waies of
the Churches there, better than it seems he doth.</p>
            <p>The design of these <hi>enquiries</hi> being to search out what course the
<hi>Lord Christ</hi> in his wisdom and faithfulnesse hath appointed, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the degenerating of Churches in successive generations, from
their primitive soundnesse and purity, and of the polluting and prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his holy things thereby; it is not altogether improbable, but
some additional contribution of light, may be brought forth by them to
us here in <hi>England,</hi> in that great case of ours, about the restoring of
such of our <hi>Parishes</hi> as retain any thing of the essence of a Church in
them (and thence are capable of a reformation) to such a measure
of purity, as may take off the just distasts and dissatisfactions of such,
as are conscientiously tender of their Church-Communion: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Churches pure, &amp; restauration of them when collapsed, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the end, do also run along together in the way thereto, and are to be
accomplished by the same rules. May this in any measure be the fruit
of this <hi>Disputations coming</hi> under the presse, it will never repent any
of those persons that have had any hand therein; yea it will be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
and their glory in the day of the Lord Iesus; and, that so it
may, the blessing of Heaven be upon it.</p>

DISPUTATION
CONCERNING
Church-Members
AND THEIR
CHILDREN
IN
ANSWER to 21 QUESTIONS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether any Children of confederate
Parents be under their Parents Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and members with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Some Children of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Parents are by meanes of
their Parents Covenanting, in Covenant also, and so
Members of the Church by divine Institution. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59363:6"/>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. They that are in that Covenant for substance
which was made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7. they are in
Covenant, and Members of the Church, by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
because that Covenant doth inferre Church-Membership,
as being the formall cause thereof; For
1. A people that are in that Covenant, are thereby the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
People or Church of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. compared
with <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 12, 13. by this Covenant the Family of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and so afterwards the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> was
made and established the visible Church of God.
2. Many were in that Covenant, which never were in
saving state of grace; Therefore that was the externall
or Church Covenant, which God makes with his visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church or People. 3. Circumcision sealed that
Covenant, which was the distinguishing mark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those within and those without the Church.</p>
            <p>But some children are in that Covenant for substance
which was made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7. as appears
by sundry Scriptures, which being rightly considered, and
compared, do inferre the continuance of the substance
of that Covenant, whereby God is a God to his People
and their seed, under the new Testament, <hi>Acts 2. 39.
Gal.</hi> 3. 14. with <hi>Gen. 28. 4. Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17. the
Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do partake of the root of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
<hi>Abraham</hi> and of Olive or Church estate thereby:
So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. The word [Holy] as applied to any
sort of persons, and opposed to <hi>Gentile</hi>-uncleannesse is not
in Scripture used for lesse then a Faederall, or covenant-holinesse,
but is often used in that sense, as <hi>Ezr. 9. 2.
Deut.</hi> 7. 6. and 14. 2. 21. and 26. 19. and 28. 9. <hi>Dan.</hi>
8. 24. and 12. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. and where a covenant or fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral
estate is asserted of children, what doth it but refer
us to that Ancient and never revoked covenant, common
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59363:6"/>
to all Nations, whereof <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Pattern-Father,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5, 7. And if <hi>Gentile</hi> Proselytes of old,
they and their children shared in that covenant, surely
<hi>Gentile</hi> believers now are not behind them in the like
priviledge; For the <hi>Gentile</hi> confederate believer is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a child of <hi>Abraham, Gal. 3. 7, 29. Rom.</hi> 4. 11,
16.</p>
            <p>Therefore he hath that covenant of which <hi>Abraham</hi>
was a pattern subject, made with him, <hi>viz.</hi> That
God will be his God, and the God of his seed, <hi>Luk.</hi>
19. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Such children as are by Christ, affirmed
to have a place and portion in the Kingdome of Heaven,
they have a place and portion in the visible Church, and
so consequently are members thereof. But so it is with
some children, <hi>Math. 19. 14. Mark 10. 14. Luk</hi> 18.
16. The Proposition is evident, for the Kingdome
of heaven or of God is sundry times used to expresse the
visible Church, or Church estate, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 1. and
21. 43. and 8. 12. And if the Disciples might or should
have known that those children were to be admitted to
Christ upon that ground, then the Kingdome-Interest
of such children was a visible or knowable and apparent
thing.</p>
            <p>If any should expound it of the Kingdome of Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet that would inferre the same thing: For neither may
the Church exclude those from her fellowship, who by
Christ his testimony are visible heirs of Glory, nor are
any in ordinary course heirs of the Kingdome of Glory,
that are not of Gods visible Church, and Kingdome of
Grace here. And what is there spoken by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as a standing truth, and that under the term of
the Kingdome of Heaven (a term in speciall manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59363:7"/>
unto Gospel-Administration) cannot be doubted
to continue in force in the Christian Church of the new
Testament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If no children be members of the visible
Church, then was not the Lord Jesus (when a child) a
member of the visible Church, but none (we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume)
will venture to say so of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If it were not so, no children might be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
For Baptisme being a Church Ordinance, and a
seal of being incorporated into the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
13. and succeeding circumcision, which was proper to
the Church, none can be subjects immediately capable
thereof, but Church-Members; Nor doth the Power
of Officers, as such, extend further then to the Churches;
as they cannot judge, so they may not Baptize them
that are without, or non-members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. They that are some of the Disciples intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. are Church-members. For as the
term [Disciples] is ordinarily used for Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 5. and 9. 26. and 14. 22, 23, 27,
28, and 18. 27. and <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 16. and
20. 7. So this sense thereof best suits that place in
<hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. because the Disciples there are the
immediate subjects of Baptisme, and so of being called
by God his name, the wonted Title of Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and because they are such as are subjected to Christs
School, to Christs Doctrine and Discipline, and to the
authoritative teaching of his Ministers, and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things that shall be taught by them,
<hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>But some children are some of the Disciples intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. For 1. some children were some of
those whom the Apostles in accomplishing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59363:7"/>
did Disciple, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20. Those whom the
false Teachers would have reduced, under the yoke of
circumcision, they were some of those whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
accounted Disciples, or whom the Apostles had
Discipled: But some children were some of those, whom
the false Teachers would have reduced under the yoke
of circumcision, for they would have had both <hi>Gentile</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and children circumcised, after the manner of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
v.</hi> 1, 5. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 21. And
that the Apostles took in children with Parents when
they were conversant in the work of Discipling, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. &amp; 16. 15, 31, 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
14. 2. Some children are under the promised teaching
of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 13. And the Word there used is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Disciples, <hi>Isa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. 16. 3. Some children do visibly
belong to Christ, <hi>Mark. 10. 14. Iosh.</hi> 22. 24, 25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Disciples. Compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 42. with <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41.
4. When Christ saith, Disciple all Nations, he bids
gather the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into like covenant and Church-estate
(for the substance thereof) which had been the portion
of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Therefore he bids Disciple some chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. They that are subjects of the Lords visible
Spiritual Kingdom, servants and children of the Lords
Family, they are Members of the Church, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Lords Kingdom, and House and Family in the
Scripture: But so are some children, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25, 26, 27.
It is <hi>Davids, i. e.</hi> Christs Spiritual-Gospel-Kingdom,
that he there speaks of; and that in reference unto visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sanctuary or Church-estate. That some children are
the Lords Servants, see, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 39, 41, 42. And that,
not by common right of Creation onely, or designment
unto some particular service; but of special Redemption
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59363:8"/>
and conservation, there spoken of. And surely both
childrens capacity so to be, and the Lords Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
so to accept them, was not greater then, than
now. That they are children, sons and daughters of
God, see <hi>Rom. 9. 4, 26. Gen. 6. 2. Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. &amp;
23. 37. And how were these children the Lords children
properly and meerly upon the account of internal and
spiritual regeneration? For that was not found in many
of the children spoken of in the places mentioned, nor
yet only by Creation, for so others were Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as well as the children of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so the
daughters of men were his daughters as well as the other
were his sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. Therefore they are said to be
Gods children, because of their Covenant, and Church
relation unto him, which was common to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Church, and to none other, and so, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. shews, being compared with <hi>verse</hi> 20, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If no children be members of the visible
Church, then we have no well-grounded hope accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ordinary course of dispensation, of the salvation
of any dying Infants: And the reason is, because salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pertains to the Church, <hi>Isa. 45. 17. Eph.</hi> 2. 12. &amp;
5. 23, 26. <hi>Ioh. 4. 22. Act. 2. 27. Luke</hi> 19. 9. Those that
are without the visible Kingdom of God, are visibly in
the Kingdom of Satan; for he is the God of the world,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. And to him are men delivered, when they
are cast out of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20. So
if children live and die out of the visible Church, they
live and die out of Gods visible Kingdom, and visibly in
the Kingdom of Satan: And then what visible ground of
hope (according to ordinary course) of their salvation?
But to account the estate of all that die children, so hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and forlorn, is contrary to the tender and rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59363:8"/>
of the Lord, and to the Doctrine of the Scriptures,
and to Godly Parents most uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. If some children were Members of the Church of
God in the old Testament, then some children are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of God in the daies of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But some children were Members of the Church in
the time of the old Testament; which though a Truth,
that we know not how any can deny, yet we may briefly
evince and confirm thus; That children then were in
Covenant, is expresly witnessed, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Deut.</hi> 29.
11, 12, 15. And that they were in such a Covenant, or
so in Covenant, as to be Members of the Church that
then was, appears, because 1. They were in the same
Covenant that their Parents or elder persons were in,
and whereby they were constituted Members of the
Church, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 14, 15. &amp; 27. 9.
&amp; 26. 18. <hi>Ier. 23. 11. Acts</hi> 7. 38. 2. They were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of a Church-Ordinance, never regularly applied to
any out of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2.
They were <hi>Israelites, (i. e.</hi> In other words, Members of
the Church of <hi>Israel)</hi> to whom pertained. Church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
<hi>Rom</hi> 9. 4. They were children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and such as were capable of being cast out of
Church estate, therefore in it, <hi>Mat. 8. 12. Rom. 11. 20.
Ier. 7. 15. 2 King.</hi> 17. 20. 5. They were visibly the
Lords people by Covenant, even as the rest of the
people were the Lords people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8, 20, 21.
6. They were children of the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to dogs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Persons out of the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.
24, 26. In a word, as oft as they are said or implied to be
a part of the holy seed, of the holy people, of the Lords
people, of <hi>Israel,</hi> of the Circumcision, of those whom
God redeemed out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to make them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59363:9"/>
his peculiar treasure, of the inheritance and congregati-
of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So often are they shewed to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church.</p>
            <p>But all the Question will be about the consequence of
the Proposition, and that may be cleared thus.</p>
            <p>1. If the Church of the old Testament and the
Church of the Gentiles under the new Testament, be
for kind essentially the same, then if children were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Church, they are also Members of these:
For if they be the same essentially, and the same for
kind, then they have the same Covenant or general
From: Therefore that Covenant which takes in the
seed or children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. Therefore the seed or
children are in and of the one Church as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But that the Church State then and now, was
and is essentially the same, is evident, because it is the
same Kingdom of God, and not another; which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them, and given to us, <hi>Mat. 21. 43. &amp;</hi> 8. 11,
12. One and the same sheepfold for kind, under one
and the same shepheard, in which were the <hi>Iews</hi> first,
and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> afterwards, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 16. The <hi>Gentiles</hi>
are fellow heirs with the <hi>Iews</hi> of the same body, and
partakers of the same promise, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 6. We are in the
same root and Olive, from which some of them were
broken off, in which the Godly <hi>Iews</hi> not broken off,
did still continue, and into which the rest shall be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in again in time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 24. The conversion
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is expressed in such a manner, as to be by
coming in to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and joyning with them, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
must dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem, Gen.</hi> 9. 27. And
not that <hi>Shems</hi> Tents must be destroyed, and other kind
of Tents built for <hi>Iaphet</hi> to inhabit: All which do shew
that the Church then and now, is not essentially
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59363:9"/>
(though sundry waies accidentally) differing, but the
same.</p>
            <p>2. Again, If the consequence be not good, then it
will follow that such <hi>Iews</hi> as were brought in by the
Gospel into Church-estate, were great losers by embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Gospel; and the children losers by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Faith, inasmuch as though in the former state, the
children were Members with the Parents, yet now in
the Gospel-estate, the children by this assertion are all
left out. Yea, then the children of those <hi>Iews, Acts</hi> 2.
Which before the Sermon, when their Parents wanted
Faith, were in the covenant and Church-state with their
Parents, are now after the Sermon, when their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are become believers, cast out or fallen out of the
Church. A strange and harsh Doctrine, that the Faith
of the Parents should set the children further off from
God, and from his Church and covenant, than they
were before.</p>
            <p>3. Then also when the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be converted in the
latter daies of the new Testament, the Parents must be
Members of the Church, but not the children, and so
they shall be in a worse condition than formerly, as not
having their children in the Church with them, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was. But besides the harshnesse of such a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
see the contrary, in <hi>Ier. 30. 20. Isa.</hi> 61. 9. &amp; 59. 21.
&amp; 65. 23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>4. Although it be true that the Lord hath made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Administration of his covenant and
Grace to his people in these daies, from that which was
in former times, yet as these differences are not in the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Church-estate, but in accidentals and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
so where any alteration is made, it is still for our
advantage and greater benefit; and therefore our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59363:10"/>
is called a better covenant, and established upon
better promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. &amp; 8. 6. And from this it is
that the burden of ceremonies which lay on them, is
now taken off; the darknesse of Types and Shadows
is now removed, and liberty is now given to worship the
Father every where; whereas they were for many
things tied only to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and every congregation of
Saints is now a Church entire within it self, whereas
then no single congregation had such Church-power
and entirenesse of Jurisdiction; but all their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had dependance on <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and all made up but
one National Church. In these things and some others
that might be named, there is alteration made, but still
it is an alteration for the better and for our advantage.
But now for the Particular in Question, If children were
then Members of the Church, and now be not, here
is an alteration made for the worser, and not for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not for our advantage but for our losse (for so it is,
to have all our children put out of covenant and Church,
and from all the priviledges thereof, <hi>Iosh. 22. 24, 25.
Eph. 2. 12. Psal. 87. 3. Mat.</hi> 15. 26.) And therefore such
a change may not be admitted. For Christ by his coming
did not worsen the condition (not of the whole
Church, but not) of any one person upon Earth, nor
yet of any age or condition or sort of persons, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10.
And surely the child in minority (as the Church of old
was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2.) hath not a greater or larger place in
the house, nor is in better condition in respect of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
than the heir that is full of age. And who can
think that a place in Gods House which is promised as so
great a Benefit, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 5, 7. And accounted such a
Glory, Advantage, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. &amp; 9. 4. Should be
no more but a part of that bondage and tutorage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59363:10"/>
which belongs to children under age? Hence also add
a fifth Argument to prove the consequence above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>5. If children were once Church-members and do not
continue to be Church-members still, then their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership
must have been repealed by the Lord, who alone
could make such an alteration: And if any should affirm
that the Lord hath done it, it lieth upon them to prove
it; and to shew when or where such an alteration was
made, or such a repeal may be found. But in the mean
time, though it be lesse needful to prove the negative,
when-as the affirmative (in such a case as this) cannot
be shewed, yet let these considerations amongst others
that might be named for that purpose be duly weighed.</p>
            <p>1. If the Lord had made such an alteration, (that
now under the new Testament no children should be
Members of the Church) then in all likelihood Christ
or his Apostles would have made mention of it: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
their Faithfulnesse: And how else should we know
that the Lord had appointed any such alteration? but
now Christ and his Apostles in stead of mentioning any
such thing, do confirm the contrary, <hi>Mark 10. 13, 14, 16.
Acts 2. 39. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 14. And hence the Apostles writing
Epistles to Churches, do sometimes expresly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
apply their speeches unto children, <hi>Eph. 6. 1. Col.</hi> 3. 20. Which seems to imply that they accounted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be parts and members of the Churches unto
whom they sent those Epistles.</p>
            <p>2. If the Apostles had taught any such alteration,
surely the <hi>Iews</hi> who raised Objections and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
about matters of far lesser moment, and who did so
stumble at taking away the particular Rite of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
(for though they had Member-ship and Baptism
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59363:11"/>
allowed to their children, yet that would not satisfie
them, without the Rite of circumcision also, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 3.
&amp; 15. 1. &amp; 21. 21.) And considering also how they had
been from age to age wonted to this covenant and
Church-estate of their children; Sure'y we say, they
would have made a remarkable stand at this, if
the Apostles had taught or practised this discovenanting
or unmembring of all their children, and the Apostles
would have needed both by preaching and writing to
have bestowed much pains to have quieted them in this
point: But of any such thing there is a deep and total si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in all the new Testament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Whether all children of whatever years or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
be so, as, 1. Absent children never brought to the
Church. 2. Born before their Parents Covenanting.
3. Incorrigible of seven, ten, or twelve years old. 4. Such
as desire not to be admitted with their Parents, of such an
age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Onely such children as are in their minority,
covenant with their Parents; therefore not all children
of whatsoever years and conditions. We do not hereby
exclude such as being defective in their intellectuals, are
as children in respect of their incapacity. That adult
children are to covenant in their own persons, see <hi>Ans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
to <hi>Quest.</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 2. Children in their minority, though
absent, covenant in their Parents, and are Members
with them, <hi>Dout.</hi> 29. 14, 15. 3. Children born before
their Parents covenanting, yet if in their minority when
their Parents enter into covenant, do covenant with
them and are Church-members, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 25. The whole
houshold of <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jailor and others were baptized,
therefore some children in minority which were born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
except we shall deny so much as one child in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59363:11"/>
then alive in all those houses. 4. There is no
sufficient reason (at least ordinarily) to conclude a
child of seven, ten, or twelve years old to be incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because a child at the ages mentioned is <hi>infans in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
Ecclesie, i. e.</hi> He hath no voice nor is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard in a Church way, therefore not incorrigible
as to the Church. Their obstinacy at the years mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is not capital: By Gods Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18. There
is still place for hope, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 18. &amp; 22. 15. 5. Their
desiring or not desiring in their own persons during the
ages forementioned, is not to be attended as the ground
of proceeding in this case, because the ground thereof
is the covenant founded upon Divine Institution, and
in-depending upon such childrens desires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Till what age shall they enter into Covenant
with their Parents, whether sixteen, twenty one, or
sixty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As long as in respect of age or capacity they
cannot according to ordinary account, be supposed able
to act in a matter of this nature for themselves, so long
they shall enter in by means of their Parents covenant,
because whilst they are children and in their minority,
they are not otherwise capable of covenanting: When
adult, they are to covenant in their own persons. If a
precise and certain age may here be prescribed, surely it
is safe to go, at least so far, as may answer the example,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 25. Where <hi>Ishmael</hi> is admitted to the Seal by
his Fathers covenant at thirteen years of age. Howbeit,
the bounding of adult and in-adult age, depending upon
the judgment of prudence, much is to be left unto the
discretion of Officers and Churches in this case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. What Discipline a child is subject to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to sixteen years old?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59363:12"/>
               <hi>Ans</hi> 1. Church Discipline is taken either more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the act of a Church-member dispensed to a
Church-member as such, by way of Spiritual watch,
rebuke, <hi>&amp;c. Luke 17. 3, 4. Mat.</hi> 18. 15. Or more
strictly, for the act of the whole Church, dispensed by
a Member thereof; as in case of publick rebuke, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
excommunication, <hi>Mat. 18. 17. 2 Cor. 2. 3. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20. In the first sense, children in their minority, are
subject to Church Discipline immediately, but not in
the second.</p>
            <p>2. It is the Duty of the Elders and Church to call
upon Parents to bring up their children in the narture
and admonition of the Lord, and to see as much as in
them lieth, that it be effectually done, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Churches respect vely succeed Apostles in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ordinary practise.</p>
            <p>3. Besides their subjection to Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
they are also subject to civil Discipline respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to their capacity, whether Domesticall,
Scholasticall, or Magistraticall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Whether a Father may twice Covenant for his
Children in Minority in several Churches?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. When a Parent is called to remove from
one Church to another, he is also called to enter into
covenant in that Church to which he removes, <hi>Paul</hi> was
first baptized and in communion at <hi>Damascus, Act.</hi> 9. 29.
Afterwards removed unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and joyned to the
Church there, <hi>v.</hi> 26. This, the very nature of order
calleth for, because otherwise he can neither do all the
duties, nor enjoy all the priviledges of a Member, in
the one Church or in the other; not in the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
now he dwelleth not with them; nor in the other,
because though dwelling amongst them, he joyneth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59363:12"/>
not with them in covenant.</p>
            <p>2. When the Parent thus removing, entreth into
covenant, his children then in minority covenant in him:
The child and the power of Government over the child,
must go together, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 15.</p>
            <p>3. Hence it is the duty of Churches when they give
Letters dimissory unto Parents, to insert the dismission
of the children then in minority with them.</p>
            <p>4. Adult children yet under the power of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and removing with them, are to give their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
consent unto this translation of their Membership,
and so to be orderly dismissed and received with their
Parents, otherwise they remain Members of the Church
of which they were before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. Whether the end of a Deputy Covenant, be
not to supply personall incapacity, or whether Children ripe
for personall Covenanting in regard of age, should
Covenant by a Deputy, as others that are unable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Children in their minority, whose immediate
Parents are in Church-Covenant, do covenant in their
Parents; see the proof hereof in answer to Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
1.</p>
            <p>2. Children adult ought to covenant in their own
Persons. To covenant in our own persons according to
the sense of this Question, is nothing else but an orderly
and Church profession of our Faith, or a personall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and solemn avouching of God, in an Ecclesiasticall
way, to be our God, according to the covenant of his
Grace, the great duty of the people of God throughout
all generations, both in the times of the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
Pregnant and Illustrious examples whereof we
have, in the time of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18, 19. &amp; 29.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59363:13"/>
10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of <hi>Ioshua, Iosh.</hi> 24. 18, 27.
Of <hi>Asa, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 12. Of <hi>Iosiah, 2 Chron.</hi>
34. 31, 32. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 50 5. A considerable part of which
Prophesie (for it extends it self also to the ages after
Christ) we have accomplished <hi>Nehem 9. ult.</hi> &amp; 10. 28,
29. The Priests and Levites and many others there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and their wives, and their sons, and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
every one that had knowledge, and that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
did cleave unto their Brethren, their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and entred into a covenant and an Oath, to walk
in Gods Law; so of the times under the Law.</p>
            <p>Concerning the times under the Gospel, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 5.
&amp; 41. 3, 4, 5. We read of the seed and off-spring of <hi>Iacob</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> that when they should be sprung and grown
up (<hi>h. e.</hi> become adults) they should both by word and
writing, by saying and subscribing with their hands, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themselves unto the Lord. It is a part of instituted
Gospel Worship. The same reason which called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to confession before, calleth the son also when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult.
It went for good reason among the <hi>Iews;</hi> He is
of age, he shall speak for himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 21. What
more meet than that the confession of our Faith should
be made with our own mouths when we are able? God
avoucheth them in the same day when they avouch him.
It is a special engagement of the adult person, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 106. I have sworn and will
perform.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It is a duty (compared with others) especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended in the Scriptures, from the subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>viz.</hi> A Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. Every believer is a
confessor. From the matter, the greatest Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi>
The Doctrine of Christ Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. The Apostle
of our confession. From the manner (others not being

excluded, as we are called thereunto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15.) In a
Church way, <hi>Mat. 16. 16, 19. Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 13. in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner commends the subjection of the obedience of
the Church astipulation of the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> From its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
a good Profession, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

is made unto salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. Whether as large Qualifications be not required
of a Members child to the participation of the Lords Supper,
and the priviledges of votes and censures, as were requira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his Parents at their first entrance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The holding forth of Faith and Repentance with
an ability to examine themselves, by way of confession,
to the judgment of Charity,<note place="margin">See the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, <hi>cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 12. §. 7.</note> were all requirable in the
Parent for admission into the Church to full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the same is requisite for the regular admission of
the Parents child being grown adult, unto his full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this Proposition two things are to
be proved. 1. That they are to have Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
2. That this Faith and Repentance must appear
to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They are to have Faith &amp; Repentance. 1. Because
Examination is the duty, and Faith and Repentance are
the matter of their Examination, without both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and exercise of which, they cannot come worthily
to the Lords Supper, which is the end of their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. From the end of the Lords Supper, which is
instituted, not for regeneration, but for nourishment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59363:14"/>
and confirmation. 'Tis a Supper and a Seal.</p>
            <p>That their Faith and Repentance ought to appear to
others, is manifest thus; The Officers ought to be wise
and faithful stewards, now to such it belongs not only to
dispense a portion in reason, but to see also that those to
whom it is dispensed, are meet to receive their portion,
<hi>Luke 12. 42. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 2. The Lords Supper cannot regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
be administred to any receiver, concerning whom
personally, according to Truth, in the judgment of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Minister cannot say, Take and eat, this is the
body of the Lord Jesus which was given for you: But
this the Minister cannot say with good Conscience to
any one upon his meer having of Faith and Repentance
without a visible holding forth of the same to others in
their own persons, because both the exercise of reason
and the exercise of Grace are requisite to the taking and
eating here required. As this proves the assertion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Officers, so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15, 16, 17. proveth the
same concerning the whole body, because in a regular
celebration of the Lords Supper, the whole Church doth
judge all the partakers thereof to have spiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ crucified, and one with another as one
body in him. It is the duty of the Church and Officers
respectively (as the keepers of the holy things) so to
discern between the holy and prophane, the clean and
the unclean, as that the Sacrament may onely be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
unto worthy receivers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 7, 8, 23. But
this cannot be, except the premised essentiall requisites
be made appear to them in judgment of Charity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the power of voting, it is not rational that they
should exercise a Church-power as to the administration
of Church-Ordinances, which voting implies, who
themselves are unfit for all Ordinances. They who are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59363:14"/>
thus unfit will abuse the Ordinances themselves, and
admit and retain unworthy Officers and Members, and
discourage the worthy, and therefore power in the
hands of such is not for edification, but for destruction,
contrary to the mind of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 8. Whether by Covenant seed, is meant the seed of
immediate Parents onely, or of remote also?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Gospel by Covenant seed, intends only
the seed of immediate Parents in Church Covenant, as
appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. The Parents there spoken of
are immediate Parents, their Progenitors were Heathens.
The Gospel extends not the external Covenant beyond
the immediate Parents: If neither of the immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
be in Covenant, their children are unclean; see
the Text. The next Parent may bring in his seed,
though his Progenitors be unbelievers; and the next
Parents may cut off their seed, though the progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
be believers; witnesse the instances of <hi>Ishmael</hi> and
<hi>Esau, Ier. 9. 25, 26. Ezek. 32. 29. Psal. 83. 6. Mal. 1. 4.
Gen.</hi> 21. 10. Otherwise there can no generation be given,
where the Covenant Interest of posterity can expedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be bounded: <hi>Depinge ubi sistam,</hi> Shew us where we
shall make our stand. The contrary exposeth the
Churches to inevitable and intollerable impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 9. Whether adopted Children and bond servants
be Covenant-seed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Adopted children and Infant-servants, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and absolutely subjected to the Government and
dispose of such heads of Families as are in Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
though they cannot be said to be their natural seed,
yet in regard the Scriptures (according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many Godly Learned) extend to them the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59363:15"/>
same Covenant priviledges with their natural seed, we
judge not any Churches who are like-minded with
them, for their practise herein: All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
yet we desire at present to leave this
Question without all prejudice on our parts to after free
disquisition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 10. Whether the child admitted by his Fathers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
be also a Deputy for his seed, without or before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Covenanting, or without &amp; before like personal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
in kind, as his Father was to enjoy when he became
a Deputy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The meaning of this Question in other terms
we conceive to be this; whether the child of a person
joyned in Church-Covenant by means of his or her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Parents Covenant, though such a Parent be
not admitted to, nor qualified for full communion, nor
have covenanted in their own person, whether we
say, the child of such a person is to be baptized:
Whereunto we answer, in these following propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 1. Infants either of whose immediate Parents
are in Church-Covenant, do confaederate with their
Parents, and are therefore Church-members with them.
See Ans. to Quest. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. It is the duty of those Infants when grown
up to years of discretion, though not yet fit for the
Lords Supper, to own the Covenant they made with
their Parents, by entring thereinto in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and it is the duty of the Church to call upon them
for the performance thereof; as appeareth by Scripture
examples of persons both called to, and entring into
Covenant, many of whom could not be looked upon as
personally Gracious, and therefore not fit for all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59363:15"/>
and full communion, <hi>Deut. 29. 12, 14. 2 Chron. 15.
12. 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 31, 32. Where it is mentioned as the
performance of a duty whereto they stand obliged by
the Covenant made in their Infancy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. Being accordingly called thereunto, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Church-admonition and other due means with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
used,<note place="margin">See the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. §. 7.</note> they shall refuse the performance of this great
duty, or in case they shall (notwithstanding like
means applied) any otherwise continue scandalous, it
is the part of the Church to proceed with them to the
censure of excommunication, because the Facts menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
deserve excommunication, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 13. Mat.
18. 17. 2 Cor. 5. 11. 2 Thes.</hi> 3. 6, 14. And the persons
are Church-members, being confederate with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
and the Church as the matter requireth, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth
Discipline to the Members thereof, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons, according to their capacity, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 12.
1 Tim.</hi> 5. 21. Add hereunto the instance of those who
are separated from the Congregation, for their non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of that Covenant, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10. 3, 7, 8. Together
with the examples of <hi>Cain, Ishmael,</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> not a
little contributing to the truth of this assertion, by way
of proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 4. In case they understand the grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are not scandalous, and solemnly own the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in their own persons, wherein they give up both
themselves and their children unto the Lord, and desire
Baptism for them, we (with due reverence to any
Godly Learned that may dissent) see not sufficient
cause to deny Baptism unto their children, these
reasons for the affirmative being proposed to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>1. Church-Members without offence and not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59363:16"/>
are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>The children in Question are Church-Members with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence and not baptized.</p>
            <p>Therefore the children in Question are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>2. Children in the covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to the
substance thereof, <hi>i. e.</hi> To whom the promise made to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> as to the substance thereof doth belong, are to
be baptized.</p>
            <p>The children in Question are children in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to the substance thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore the children in Question are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>3. Children in the same estate with those children
under the Law, unto whom the seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Faith, because in that estate was by Institution
Divine to be applied, the Precept for so doing not
repealed, and the reason for so doing still remaining are
to be baptized.</p>
            <p>But the children in Question are children in the same
estate (<hi>viz.</hi> regularly in Church-covenant) with
those children under the Law, unto whom the seal of
the righteousnesse of Faith, because in that estate was
by Institution Divine to be applied, the Precept
for so doing not repealed, and the reason for so doing
still remaining.</p>
            <p>Therefore the children in Question are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>4. Either the children in question are to be baptized,
or the Gospel dispensation forbids the application of the
seal unto children regularly in Church-covenant, unto
whom the Mosaical dispensation commanded it to be
applied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59363:16"/>
But the Gospel despensation forbids not the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the seal unto children regularly in Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
unto whom the Mosaical dispensation commanded
it to be applied.</p>
            <p>Therefore the children in question are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>The contrary opinion infers that the Gospel bereaveth
the children mentioned (at least in a considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
of their glory, advantage, mercy, blessing, and
that in this respect it casts reproach, yea brings disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
a judgment, a curse upon them, <hi>Iosh. 5. 9.
Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. &amp; 9. 4, 5. This seems to be a lesse Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Tenent, the nature of the Gospel being to enlarge
and better, not to contract and diminish the external
dispensation of Grace.</p>
            <p>5. Children unto whom the Gospel testifieth both
the promise and baptisme by vertue of that promise, to
belong, ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>The children in question are children unto whom
the Gospel testifieth both the promise and baptism
by vertue of that to promise, to belong, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 39.</p>
            <p>Therefore the children in Question ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Parent though a Church-member, owning
the Covenant in his own person, and qualified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the premises, is not admitted to full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
therefore the child ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Church-act onely, and not any other act
(much lesse defect) of the Parent is by Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
accounted to the child. The membership of the
child is a distinct membership, from the membership
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59363:17"/>
of the Parent. In case the Parents membership ceaseth
by death or censure, the membership of the child remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
still. The membership of the child is the same in
kind with, and not inferiour to the membership of the
Parent. Membership is a Relation, and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
not of <hi>magìs</hi> and <hi>minùs,</hi> more or lesse: Members
are better or worse, and communion is more or lesse;
but membership admits not of degrees. <hi>Benjamin</hi> an
Infant, but of an hour old, is as truly a son as <hi>Reuben,</hi>
a man of twenty two years of age. The child is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by vertue of his own membership, and not by vertue
of his Parents membership. The Parents death
is not with us an obstacle of the Childs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 5. The same may be said concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of such persons in question, who being dead or
necessarily absent, either did or do give the Churches
cause in judgment of charity, to look at them as thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
and such, as had they been called thereunto would
so acted: For in Charity that is here done interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
which is mentioned in the fourth Proposition
expresly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propos.</hi> 6. Though the persons forementioned own
the Covenant according to the premises, yet before they
are admitted to full communion (<hi>i. e.</hi> To the Lords
Supper and voting) they must so hold forth their Faith
and Repentance, unto the judgment of Charity by way
of confession in the congregation, as it may appear unto
the Church, that they are able to examine themselves
and to discern the Lords body. See the proof hereof in

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 11. Whether children begotten by an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
person are to be baptized, he so remaining?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59363:17"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We cannot for the present answer the following
Arguments for the Negative. 1. Persons excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
are not members, and the promise made to the
seed, belongs (under the Gospel) onely to the seed
of immediate Parents in Covenant. 2. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Parents are to be looked at in Church account as
Heathens and Publicans, now the Church ought not to
baptize the children of those which she is to account as
Heathens &amp; Publicans, because their children are unclean,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. 3. To baptize the children of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
is to have Church-communion with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate:
But those that we are forbidden to have
civil communion with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. We are much

with.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 12. Whether a Child born of a justly censurable
person, yet not actually excommunicate, be to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We answer affirmatively. 1. Because the child
is a Church-member by vertue of his covenanting with
his Parents. 2. Because the foundation of the covenant
membership of the child, is Divine Institution,
which imputes the Covenant Act only, and not
any other Act of the Parents to the child.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 13. Whether a Members Childs unfitness for

and inexperience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A Members child (like as it is with all other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59363:18"/>
members) is censurable only for scandalous sins, <hi>Mat.
18. 15, 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 11. Consequently for ignorance and
inexperience when scandalous, for all ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience
though blameable, is not scandalous, <hi>Rom.

himself, and may not be examined by others, of his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for seals?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a duty of a Members child to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and yet he is also subject to the examination of
others.</p>
            <p>1. Because the Elders are to give an account,
which necessarily presupposeth that God hath given
them power in some respects to take an account, <hi>Heb. 13.
17. Acts</hi> 8. 37.</p>
            <p>2. It pertaineth to them to see that the holy things
be not defiled, by the accesse of any unclean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
person, <hi>Ezek. 44. 23. Mal.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 9. &amp;
2. 1.</p>
            <p>3. To teach by question and answer in the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 16. Whether only Officers must examine in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or else publike before the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Concerning their examination by the Elders in
private, the former reasons conclude affirmatively,
whereunto may be added occasionally that <hi>Iames</hi> and
the Elders contrive and prepare in private, for the more
orderly and quiet transactions of things in publick, <hi>Acts</hi>
21. 22, 23. 'Tis spiritual wisdom by preparing the stones

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59363:18"/>
Publick examination we also conceive to be regular,
edification or due satisfaction of the Church calling
thereunto, yet alwaies orderly, that is, by approbation
of the Presbytery, and the immediate proposal of
the questions by them, to the examinate, <hi>Rev. 2. 2.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 17. Whether the same grown Members Child
must not be examined of his Charitable experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
before Baptism, as well as before the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We think the Elders do well to take an account
of children, concerning the Principles of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their capacity, before they be baptized. If
the children spoken of in the question, be yet in their
minority, their right unto Baptism being founded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
upon the Covenant made in their Parents;
this Examination is to be looked at as conducing to the
better application, but not to the being of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
But if they be adult, they are to give an account
of their Faith and Repentance, in their own persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be baptized, <hi>Acts 8. 36, 37. Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Church for settlement, and not intending return,
are continually to be accounted Members?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Baptized children though locally removed from
the Church unto which they belong, are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Members, until dismission, death or, censure dissolve
that Relation, because Christ the Institutor of this
Relation, onely by these waies dissolveth the
same.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 19. Whether Historical Faith and a blamelesse
life fit a Members Child for all Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59363:19"/>
Priviledges, and he must be examined only about
them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not only historical Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> The meer
knowledge of the fundamental Doctrine of Faith and a
blamelesse life, but also such an holding forth of Faith
and Repentance, as unto judgment of Charity sheweth
an ability to examine themselves and to discern the
Lords body, is requisite to fit a Members child for all
Ordinances and Priviledges, and his blamelesse life
notwithstanding, a Members child is to be examined
concerning the other qualifications.</p>
            <p>That both the having and holding forth of Faith and
Repentance, are requisite to fit for all Ordinances, see
<hi>Ans.</hi> to <hi>Quest.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>That a meer Historical Faith and every blamelesse
life is not sufficient to hold forth these qualifications, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;</p>
            <p>1. An Historical Faith as meerly such, is insufficient,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>2. A blamelesse life is either taken for such a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the external man to the Letter, as exempts
from censure, <hi>Mat. 19. 20. Phil.</hi> 3. 6. Or for such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of the whole man as in judgment of Charity
commends a person to the Conscience of the beholder,
as in measure spiritual, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. &amp; 2. 15.</p>
            <p>A blamelesse life in the first sense is not sufficient to
qualifie for all Ordinances, but for our fitnesse thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the Rule calleth for a blamelesse life in the second
sense, <hi>Matth. 3. 8, 9. Iames</hi> 2. 21. Besides the

               <hi>Quest.</hi> 20. Whether if a Church-Member barely say,
it repents me, though seventy times seven times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

he relapse into the same gross evils, as lying, slander,
oppression, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He be to be forgiven, and not censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Though we alwaies acknowledge that the Holy
One of <hi>Israel</hi> is not to be limited by man or Angel, as to
the dispensation of his Grace, yet so far as we remember
the Scriptures, seventy times seven times, <hi>i. e.</hi> 490<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
relapses into the same grosse sin, and repentance is an
instance not extant there. Without the fruits meet
for repentance, we are not called to forgive, <hi>Mat. 3. 8.
Luk.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding a Brother offends seventy times se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times, that is, many times, a definite number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put for an indefinite, yet whilst God enables him to
repent, it is our duty to forgive. 'Tis not the number
of offences, but the holding forth of repentance in the
offender, that is the measure of our forgivenesse, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 22. As God for Christs sake forgave us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
ought we to forgive one another, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.
32.</p>
            <p>To say in words, I repent, and to gainsay it in
deeds, is according to Scripture, not to repent, yea,
rather to continue in impenitency, <hi>Tit. 1. 16. Iam.</hi>
2. 18, 26.</p>
            <p>An ingenuous and solemn profession of repentance,
nothing appearing to the contrary, is to be accepted as
true repentance in the judgment of Charity, <hi>Luk. 17. 3.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 21. Whether a Member under offence and not
censured, or not with the highest Censure, can authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
be denied the Lords Supper or other Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. None but the Church can Authoritatively
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59363:20"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59363:21"/>
deny to the Member his accesse unto the Lords Supper,
because the power thereof is only delegated to that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17.</p>
            <p>2. The Church cannot deny unto a Member
his accesse unto the Lords Supper, untill she
hath regularly judged him to be an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>3. The censure of admonition is the first act whereby
a Church doth judicially declare a Member to be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender;
therefore till the censure of admonition be past,
a Member cannot Authoritatively be denied communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Lords Supper, or other Church-priviledges,
because of offence.</p>
            <p>4. After the sentence of Admonition is past, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
now admonished, may be (yea thereby is) Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively
denied to come unto the Lords Supper,
and to vote in the Church, because he is judicially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 3, 4. &amp; 7. 20, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, 24.
Though he be not yet Censured with the Censure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
            <p>5. All which notwithstanding, there are cases where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Brother apparently discerned to be in a condition
rendring him (should he so proceed to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
an unworthy Communicant, may and ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
to be advised to forbear, and it is his duty to
hearken thereunto.</p>
            <p>6. Yet two things are here carefully to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>1. That Brethren be not many Masters, taking upon
them to advise and to admonish others to abstain
without cause, or before the time, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>2. That none forbear to come worthily, which is their
duty, because to their private apprehension, another is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59363:21"/>
supposed (at least) to come unworthily, which is
their sin.</p>
            <p>7. In case the Church shall see cause to advise a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to forbear, and he shall refuse to hearken thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
his refusal being also a violation of Church Order,
addeth contumacy to his offence, and thereby ripens
the Offender for Censure.</p>
