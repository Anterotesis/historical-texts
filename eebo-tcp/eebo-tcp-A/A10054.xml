            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For we knowe, that the hyghe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyficer

Southe, and in the ſame boke he

becauſe erth was made fleſh,
althoughe ſuche expoſition dothe
dyffer from the tradition and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
of Moſes, ſens among the
Hebrewes it is not wrytten with
foure but with .iii. letters. Yet for
all that, this expoſition in ſo holy
a man is not to be dyſprayſed, for
as moche as he was not lerned in
the Hebrewe tongue, the whiche
verye many ſaynctes and expoſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of holye ſcrypture, to theyr
ſmall blame knewe not. But if I

after my mynde and iugement, to
vſe lyke etymologie and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word and name of <hi>Eue,</hi>
at the leaſte lette me be ſuffered to
ſpeake this one thynge out of the
<pb facs="tcp:4574:5"/>
miſticall decrees, and agreeable
wylles of the Cabaliſtis, the very
name of a woman to haue more
affinitie with the ineffable and in
enarrable name of the diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
almyghtye, called <hi>Tetragram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton,</hi>
than the name of man, the
whiche with the name of god, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in letters nor in figure, nor in
nombre doth agree.</p>
            <p>¶But nowe we wyll leaue theſe
thynges, for they be redde of few,
and of fewer vnderſtande &amp; they
requyre a longer proceſſe than is
mete to be ſpoken of here. In the
meane ſeaſon, we wol ſerche oute
the excellencie of womanheed, not
of the name onely, but of the very
thynges, dueties, and merites.</p>
            <p>Therfor let vs (as they ſay) ſerch
the ſcriptures and takynge oure
grounde at the fyrſte creation, let
<pb facs="tcp:4574:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs diſpute and reaſon, what dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
woman obteyned aboue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whanne ſhe was fyrſte made. We
knowe, that whatſo euer god al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty
made, do chiefely differre
in this point, that certain of them
ſhuld abyde and remayn for euer
more incorruptible and withoute
putrifaction, and certaine ſhuld
be ſubiecte vnto corruption, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie
and change. And in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
thoſe thynges, god proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
forwarde, after thys order he
beganne at the more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellente
of one thynge, and ended
at the moſt noble of an other. And
thus he created incorruptible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and ſoules: for ſo doth ſaint
Auguſtyne diſpute &amp; reaſon,<note place="margin">Aug. ſup. Gen. li. 7.</note> that
the ſoules of our fyrſte parentes,
were created with angels, before
the bodyes were made. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb facs="tcp:4574:6"/>
he created incorruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the ſterres and
the elementes incorruptible, but
ſubiecte to dyuers mutations: of
the whiche he made al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that be ſubiecte vnto corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
From the more vyler by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
degrees and orders of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
agayne aſcendynge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
vp vnto the perfection of the
hole worlde. Firſte he made mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
thanne thynges vegetable
plantes and trees: after that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
lyuinges,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> than brute beaſtes,
ſome crepynge, ſome ſwymmyng,
ſome fleynge. Fynally he created
two creatures lyke to hym ſelfe,
fyrſt the male, and laſt the female:
in whiche female, the heuens, the
erthe, and al the goodly ornament
of the ſame, were perfeyted and
fully finiſhed. For the maker com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
<pb facs="tcp:4574:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the creation of woman;
reſted at her, as hauynge before
his handes nothynge more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to be made, and in her al the
wiſedome and power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
came to concluſion and ende:
after the which there can no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be found or imagined. Than
ſeing a woman is the laſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the full ende, moſte perfect
of all goddis workes, and of the
ſame the very perfection: who wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deny
a woman to be the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy

without whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very world,

the whiche coude none other
wyſe be perfyted, thanne with the
mooſte perfecteſt of al creatures.
For it were ageynſt reaſon and a
<pb facs="tcp:4574:7"/>
thynge, vnſemely to thynke, that
god wold finiſh ſogret a worke in
any vnperfect thing. But bicauſe
the world it ſelfe, as the abſolute,
hole, and moſt perfect cyrcle, was
created of god, the ſame cyrcle
muſt nedes be ended in that lyttel
parte, whiche myghte couple and
ioyne within it ſelfe the fyrſte of
all thynges with the laſte of all
thynges with one knotte. So a
woman, whanne the worlde was
made, was the laſte in tyme, and
laſte made: and the ſame woman
partly in auctoryty, but chefely in
dignitie, was the fyrſt of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
conceyued in the mynde of
god as it is wrytten of her by the
prophete: Before the heuens were
made, god dyd choſe her, and he
choſe her, before all other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

            <p>¶By reaſon of the place alſo, in
whiche the woman was created,
<pb facs="tcp:4574:8"/>
howe farre ſhe paſſeth man in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
holy wrytte doth witneſſe
vnto vs mooſte plentifullye. For
where the woman was made in
Paradyſe, a place mooſte noble
and pleaſaunt, amonge aungel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
the man was made withoute
Paradyſe, in the wyelde fyelde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
brute beaſtes. Afterward,
to thintent, that woman ſhuld be
created, he was brought into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radyſe.
And therfore the woman,
endowed with the peculyar gyfte
of Nature, as ſhe were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be in the hygheſt place of
her creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though ſhe loke down

yet ſhe neyther ſuffreth nor feleth

to be in lyke peryll of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge

that any thing is born or brought

Wherfore Iſaac commanded his

And vnto this, is not moche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke,
whiche is ſpoken in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

We haue founde Ieſus the ſonne
of Ioſeph of Nazareth. And Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thanael
ſaid to hym: What good

now let vs speke of other matters
¶A woman doth paſſe a man in
the materiall ſubſtance of her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
For ſhe was not made of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
creature wantyng lyfe &amp; ſoule,
or of the vyle clay or dyrte, as the
man was, but of a matter purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and lyuely, hauyng a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoule, and a godly minde. Fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore,
god made manne of the
erthe, whiche naturally bryngeth
forthe all kyndes of beaſtes and
lyuely creatures, by the working
togither of the heuenloy influence:
<pb facs="tcp:4574:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the woman, aboue al heuenly
influence and promptues of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and without any other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
&amp; power, was onely made
of god, full ſtedfaſt and perfite in
all thinges, the man in the meane
ſeaſon loſynge one of his rybbes,
of the whiche ſhe was made, that
is to ſay, <hi>Eue</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleping, and
that ſo ſoundly, that he could not
fele his ribbe plucked away. And
thus, man is the worke of nature,
and womanne the worke of god.
And therfore the woman is many
tymes more apt and mete then the
man, to receyue the heuenly light
and bryghtnes, and is ofte reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed
thet with: whiche thyng is
eaſy to be ſene, by her clenlyneſſe,
&amp; marueylous faire beautye. For
ſeyng that beautie it ſelfe is none
other thyng, but the clere bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4574:10"/>
of goddes viſage naturallye
ſette in thinges, ryght fayre ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
in the beautifull bodies of
creatures: he therfore hath choſen
women before men, to be far more
endowed, and moſte abundantly
repleniſhed therwith. The propre
body of a woman in ſyght and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge,
is moſte delicate and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:
her fleſhe ſofte and tender:
her colour faire and clere: her ſkin
ſofte and ſlyke, her head comelye,
and decked with heare ſofte lyke
ſylke, long, and ſhynyng lyke the

her loke and chere merye and

her eies rollyng and ſhyning like

<pb facs="tcp:4574:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her pace and going is right come<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly:
her mouynge honeſt: her port

in the order of al the body, in ſhap

aboue al other ſhe is farre the fai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſt

of creatures, there is noo thynge
ſo wonderfull to ſee, ne noo mira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle

and rauyſhed with the beautie of

by many experyences is notablye

            <p>¶Thoſe thynges (all thoughe
ſome what at lengthe) I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed
vnto you, and that almoſt
the very ſelfe ſame wordes out of
holy ſcripture, where mention of
beautie is ſo ofte made: to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
we ſhulde playnely perceyue,
that the beautie of women is not
<pb facs="tcp:4574:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely among men, but alſo of god
hyghly eſtemed and honoured.</p>
            <p>¶In an other place of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
we lyke wyſe rede,<note place="margin">Num. 31.</note> that god
commanded all the men, and men
children, to be ſlayne: but the faire
women to be ſaued.<note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> In the booke
of Deuteronomy it was permyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the chyldren of Iſraell, eche
to choſe hym a fayre womanne to
wyfe, of thoſe that were taken pry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>¶And beſydes this wounderfull
beautie, woman is endowed with
a certaine dignitie and worthines
of honeſtie, whiche is not gyuen
to man: for the heare of her head
hangeth downe ſoo lowe, that yt
wyll couer and hyde all the pryuy
partes of her body. Farther, it is
not nedefull for a woman, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
theſe partes of her body, in the
<pb facs="tcp:4574:15"/>
workes of Nature, whiche man
cuſtomably vſeth to doo. Finally
Nature hathe ſoo wounderfullye
wrought for the comelynes of wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man,
that her priuie partes nr not
ſo apparant as mans, but ſet in a
place more ſecretely. And nature
hath gyuen more ſhamfaſines to
woman than to man. Wherfore it
hath ofte chanced, that a woman,
greuouſely dyſeaſed in her prime
partes, hath choſen rather to dye,
than to abyde the ſyght and hand
lynge of the ſurgian, to be cured
and healed. And this ſhamefaſte
honeſtie they obſerue and kepe,
both in dyenge, and after they be
dead: as it appereth by them that
be drowned. For as Plinie and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perience
witneſſen, a woman ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
grouelyng whan ſhe is deade
by the fauour that nature bereth
<pb facs="tcp:4574:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to her ſhamefaſte honeſtie: but a
man ſwymmeth vpryghte on his
backe. Farther, the moſt worthye
parte of man, wherby we chiefly
differre from other brute beaſtes,
and doo repreſente the dyuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is the heade, and in it chiefly
the countinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Truely a mans
heade is deformed with baldnes,
and contrary, a womanne by the
great pryuilege of nature, is not
bald. Moreouer, the countinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and face of man is (by the bearde
to hym hateful) ſo oft defiled and
hyd with filthy heares, that ſcarſe
from brute beaſtes he may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
in woman contrary wiſe,
the face doth alway remayn pure
and comely. Wherfore it was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creed
in the law of the .xii. tables,
that women ſhuld not ſcrape nor
ſhaue theyr chekes, leaſte at any
<pb facs="tcp:4574:16"/>
tyme the bearde ſhuld growe out,
and ſhamfaſtenes be hyd. Alſoo
of the clennes and puritie of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
this maye be to all men the
moſte euydent argumente and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
That a woman ones waſhed
clene ouer, as ofte as ſhe is waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
afterwarde in cleane water,
that water receyueth no ſpotte of
vnclenneſſe: but a man, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo clene waſſhed, as ofte as he
waſhethe agayne, troubleth and
fouleth the water. Furthermore,
Nature hath ſo ordeyned, that wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men
auoid ſuperfluous humours
by ſecrete partes, that men auoide
by the face, the moſte worthy part
of mannes body. And where it is
graunted to man aboue all other
beaſtes to haue the face and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunce
lokynge vppe to heuen:
Nature and fortune haue prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:4574:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo wonderly for woman, and
ſhewed ſo great fauor, that if ſhe
chaunce to fall, ſhe ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
falleth on her head or face.</p>
            <p>¶Shall we ouer paſſe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrement
of nature to woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
man, in the procreation of
mankynde? Whyche thynge is
thus very well perceyued. For on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the womans ſeede (as wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen

and nouriſhment of the chyld,<note place="margin">Gale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. de Sparmate &amp;. 14. de v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tilitate par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticularum. Aui doc. S Fen. 1. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.</note>
and not the mans, whiche is but
an accident to the ſubſtance. For
as the lawe ſayth, the greatteſt &amp;
chiefeſt offyce and duetye of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
is to conceyue, and to ſaue
that is conceyued. For which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
we ſe very many to be
lyke theyr mothers, by reſon they
be begotten of their bloudde: and
this lykenes is very oft well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
<pb facs="tcp:4574:17"/>
in the proportion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
of their bodies, but it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in their maners. For if the
mothers be foolyſhe, the chyldren
proue foolyſſhe alſo. If the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be wyſe, the chyldren ſhall
haue a ſent thereof. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
wyſe it is in the fathers. For
thoughe they be wyſe, ye manye
tymes they gette folyſhe children.
and foolyſſhe fathers gette wyſe
chyldren, ſo that the mothers be
wyſe. And there is none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
why mothers more than the
fathers, ſhuld loue theyr children,
but that the mothers perceyue,
that theyr chyldren haue, and ſoo
they haue in dede, in theym more
of theyr mothers ſubſtance, than
of theyr fathers. For this cauſe,
that I haue ſhewed you: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it naturally grafte in vs, to
<pb facs="tcp:4574:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be more kynde and louyng to our
mothers, than to our fathers. In
ſo moch, that we ſeme to loue our
father meanely, and to loue oure
mother hartelye. And for this
cauſe, Nature hathe gyuen vnto
women, milk of ſo great ſtrength
and vertue, that it not onely nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſheth
infantes and babes, but
alſo reſtoreth ſuch as ar brought
lowe by ſycknes, and is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente
foode, to preſerue the lyfe of
thoſe, that are of perfecte age.</p>
            <p>As we rede an example in Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Maximus,<note place="margin">Val. li. 5. cap. 4.</note> of a certain yong
woman, whiche with the mylk of

called it, The temple of Pitie.</p>
            <p>¶It is well knowne, that for the

            <p>¶Further it is a wonderful my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of Nature, that a womanne

Mercurius iudgeth it to be of as
great pryce, as moch worth, and
as good a thynge, as immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And Heſiodus nameth it the

And is not a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
more eloquent, more copious and

Do not all we, that be men, lerne

            <p>¶We know ſurely, that god bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed

Who ſo fyndeth a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

And no man may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

For as Eccleſiaſticus ſaythe:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> A

benediction, and glorye of
the man: and as Auguſtin ſayth:
the fyrſte ſocietie and company of

Wherfore of neceſſitie euery man
loueth her, whome who ſoo euer
wyl not loue, but hate, is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

in this place.</p>
            <p>¶Thus bleſſyng was gyuen for
<pb facs="tcp:4574:21"/>
the woman, and law for the man:
The lawe I ſay,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> of anger and of
curlynge. For why, the fruyte of
the tree was forbydden to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
but not to the woman: which was
not than created. For god wolde
her to be fre from the begynning.
Therfore the manne ſinned in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
not the woman. The man
gaue vs deathe, not the woman.
And all we ſynned in Adam, not
in Eua. And we toke orygynalle
ſynne of oure father the man, not
of our mother the woman. And
therfore the olde law commanded
all the malekynde to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but the females to remayne
vncircumciſed: that is to witte, he
ordeyned the originall ſynne to be
punyſhed onely in that kind, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
had treſpaſſed. Furthermore,
god rebuked not the woman, for
<pb facs="tcp:4574:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſhe had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but bicauſe ſhe
gaue occaſion of yuelle vnto the
man, and that dyd ſhe vnwarely,
intyced therto by the dyuell. The
man knew well he dyd amiſſe: but
the woman being deceyued, erred
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. For ſhe was fyrſt temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
of the dyuell, whom he knewe
to be moſte excellent of all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And as Bernarde ſaith: The

and perceyuynge her to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by our forfather: he toke
vpon hym manhode, as the more
humble and lower kynde, and not
womankynde, the more hygher &amp;
noble. Furthermore, bycauſe we
were condemned for the ſynne of
the man, and not of the woman,
god wolde, that in what kynd the
ſynne was committed, in the ſame
ſhulde be the purgation of ſynne:
and by the ſame kinde, whiche ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
was deceyued, we ſhuld

ſaid vnto the ſerpent, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man,
or more truly, the ſede of the
woman, ſhoulde breake his head,
and not the man, nor the ſeede of
the man. And perchaunce, hereof

Whereof this is a notable profe,
that the circuite of the hole world

the whiche is alſo callid
Aphrica. And finally to recite all

euery where obteyne the hygheſte
place. For the vyrgin Mary was
a woman, the whyche fyrſt dydde
vowe her vyrginitie to god, and
thereby deſerued to be the mother
of god. The womenne prophetes

            <p>¶But to the ende that noo man
ſhuld doubt women to be as able
to doo all thoſe thynges that men

examples: and we ſhal fynd, that
there was neuer noble nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
acte, in any kynde of vertue,
doone by men, but that as noble
hath ben done by women. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
ſacrifyce, as the paynyms in

olde tyme vſed, Melyſſa Cibeles
was the Mynyſter, after whoſe

was Mineruas mynyſter, Mera

And the mynyſters of Bacchus,
were very notable, as Thyades,
Menades, Bacche, Eliades, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallonides,

Sanctuarie,<note place="margin">Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a place conſecrate or halo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</note> and was taken as a
mynyſter or prieſt. And although
women be forbydden in our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to vſe the order of preſthod
yet it appereth by hyſtories, that a
woman on a tyme by counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
her kynde, was biſhoppe of
Rome. There haue bene in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis
<pb facs="tcp:4574:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
churche, many abbaſſes and

This thynge was well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

bycauſe he lacked women, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
ſhed and caried away the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines

the cruel warre that ſhuld folowe
thervpon. For he knewe, that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
an empire wolde in ſhort time
periſſhe, yf they wanted women.
And at laſte, whan the Capytoll
was taken by the Sabynes, and
that in the myddes of the market
place, they foughte moſte cruellye
hande to hande, with the ſodayne
runnynge of the women betwene

and at the laſte a peace being

a perpetual amitie. For the
whych cauſe Romulus regeſtred
theſe womens names in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

by the Romaynes aſſente decreed
and wrytten in the common ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that women ſhuld not grind

Moreouer, great honours
tokens of high reuerence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie
were done to women by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the Senatours, as theſe:
that in the way they ſhulde go on
the vpper hane: and that men
ſhuld ryſe on their fete vnto them
&amp; gyue them place. Furthermore,
it was graunted theym, to weare
purple garmentes, embrowdred

<pb facs="tcp:4574:44"/>
with precyous ſtones, rynges
at theyr eares, &amp; chaynes of golde
about theyr neckes. And it was at

lawes, that as ofte as any ſtatute
was made in any place, forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ornamentes or apparayle to
be worne, women ſhoulde not be
comprehended vnder that lawe.
Alſo it was granted theym, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
herytage and ſucceſſion of
goodes, &amp; the funerals of women
to be celebrate and honourablye
kepte, as the funeralles of noble

and that there was not ſoo

¶And in the warre that Cyrus
made agaynſt Aſtiages, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
armye was by the caſtyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of women reprehended, and
being newely reſtored againe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
a right worthy vyctorye.
For the whiche dede Cyrus made
a lawe, that kynges of the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
entrynge into the cytie. ſhuld
paye to euerye woman a piece of
golde. The whiche thynge alſo
kynge Alexander, entrynge twyſe
into that citie payd twyſe. Ye and
more ouer, he commaunded the
gyft to be doubled to women with
chylde. So from the moſte aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
kynges of the Perſyans and
Romaynes, yea from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng
of the citie of Rome and
empire, women were hadde in all
hygh honour and reuerence: and
the very emperours theym ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:4574:45"/>
eſtemed theym moſte highly. For
Iuſtynian the emperour, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
of lames, thoughte it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniente,
to haue the counſaylle
and aduyſe of his wyfe. And in
an other place, the law ſayth, that
the wyfe ſhyneth in the honour of
her huſbande, and the brightnes
of his dignitie beautifieth her, for
the higher the huſband is aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in honour, the higher is his
wyfe. Soo the Emperours wyfe
is callid empreſſe, the kingis wife
quene, the princis wyfe, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe:
and is therby enobled, howe
lowe ſo euer ſhe be of byrthe. And
Vlpian the lawyer ſayth. A prince
that is to ſaye, the Emperoure or
kynge, is aboue the lawes, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though
the empreſſe is bonde by
the lawes, yet the emperour frely
granteth her as great priuileges
<pb facs="tcp:4574:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as he hath hym ſelfe. Wherfore it
is permitted vnto noble women,
to iudge, to arbytrate and decyde
matters, to doo and take homage
and fealtie, to keepe courtes, and
mynyſter Iuſtyce amonge theyr
tenauntes. And for this pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the woman may haue coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ſeruauntes of her owne, as
well as the man may: and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne
may be iudge, yea amonge
ſtraungers. She maye alſo gyue
name to her familie and kynred:
ſo that the chyldren ſhalbe named
after their mother, and not after
their father. And in dyuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the lawe cyuyle, womenne
haue, touchynge theyr doweries,
many great priuileges graunted
them. Where amonge other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it is ordeyned, that a woman
of good name and fame, ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:4574:46"/>
be impryſoned for dette, and the
Iudge, that commytteth her to
pryſon, ſhall loſe his heed. If ſhe
be ſuſpected of any faute, ſhe ſhal
be putte into a monaſterye or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
place, or elles be delyuerid to
wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be impryſonde by them.
For the lawe ſaythe, A woman is
of better ſtate and condition than
a man: and alſo in one ſelfe kynd
of offence, the manne treſpaſſeth
more than the woman. Wherfore
the man taken in auoutrie, loſeth
his head: but the woman aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
is put into a monaſterye.</p>

that women were not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
to men, neyther in excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
of mynde, nor in ſtrengthe of

but lyke able vnto all thynges,
decreed and made lawes, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhoulde exerciſe ſuche may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries
as men vſed, yea all feates
perteynynge to the warre, in the
bowe, in the ſlynge, in hurlynge

in armour, as well on hors
backe as on foote, in pytchyng of

and couductynge of an hoſte: and
to be briefe, they ordeyned, that
women ſhuld as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly as men
<pb facs="tcp:4574:47"/>
vſe all maner exercyſes. Lette vs
rede writers of antiquitie, worthy
to be beleued, and we ſhall fynde,
that in Getulia, Bactris, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>letia,
the maner was, that menne
gaue them ſelfes to eaſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
and the women to plow and
tylle the fieldes, to buylde, to bye
and ſel, to ryde, to go on warfare,
and to do all other thynges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
nowe amonge vs the men do.
Amonge the Cantabrians, men
gaue dowerye to the women, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
were gyuen to mariage by
theyr ſyſters, doughters were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to be heires. Amonge the
Scythians, the Thracians, and
Frenche menne, all worthy dedes
were as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly done by women
as by men, and in matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
warre and peace, women
were called to councelle, to gyue
<pb facs="tcp:4574:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theyr aduyſe and ſentence. Which
thynge the Truce that the Celtes
made with Hanniball, dothe well

lette the women of the Celtes be

But by the great tyranny of men,
preuaylynge ageinſt the lawes of

gyuen to women.</p>
            <p>¶Thou wylte ſaye, that is nowe
forbydden by lawes, aboliſhed by

<pb facs="tcp:4574:48"/>
For anon as a woman is borne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from her infancy, ſhe is kept
at home in ydelnes, &amp; as thoughe
ſhe were vnmete for any hygher

ſhe is perpetually ſhutte vp in a

be forbydden theym by the lawes.
Nor it is not permitted to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
though ſhe be very wiſe and
