         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in his passage hence, let fall, &amp; (as somtime <hi>Elijah</hi> his mantle)

            <p>The eminent Worth, &amp; rare Accomplishments of the (now bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
Author, none but such as knew Him not, or envied Him, can,
or will deny. The rare Beauties, &amp; Sweets of Nature, Learning,
and Grace which the Great God had endowed, &amp; adorned Him
with, were such, &amp; so attractive, that nothing but unacquaintance
disingenuity, &amp; prejudice could secure from being captivated, and
held fast in the pleasant bonds of Love, &amp; Delight. Had all the
Art, and Grace He was filled, &amp; furnished with, been tunned up
into an ill-sented Cask, tainted with Haughtiness, Peevishness, &amp;
Vanity; their Flavour, and delightful Sweetness would have been
lost in a nauseous unpleasancy. What He was to my self, I cannot
without renewing my grief, express; Onely I shall say, He was
(what is rare, &amp; hard to be found in this lower World) a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
loving, profitable, fast &amp; faithful Friend: Being gone, I cannot

            <p>The designe of this Sermon, as left by the Author written with

of Ignorance, Atheisme, Unbelief, Carnal Reason, &amp;c. While
we are too intent in gazing upon the Living Creatures, and the
dreadful Wheels, (which by their swift, and whirling Motion do
oft raise a Cloud of dust) we soon lose the sight of Him who sits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
upon the Throne, overruling, and Working all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Counsel of his own Will. We are apt to be too fearful,
and distrustful in our <hi>Entrance</hi> upon; and too forgetful of God in
the <hi>Issues</hi> of great and doubtful Affairs; quicker of sight to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
an host of <hi>Aramites,</hi> than to discern an Army of <hi>Angels,</hi> like
him 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 6. 15, 16, 17. and more ready to give too much to

Prevention of, and help against Evils, so <hi>prejudicial</hi> to our selves

seasonable, and serious Discourse; worthy to be perused by all

<hi>Penitential Psalm</hi> (the 51. Psalm) So it is rationally conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that <hi>Solomon,</hi> his Son, being at last throughly awakened
out of his Sensuality, Security, and Idolatrous Courses, or
Connivences and Tolerations, by those great Adversaries,
<hi>Hadad, Rezon,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> (of whom you read 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.
14. &amp;c.) that God stirred up against Him, Penned this Book
of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and left it (according to the Counsell of God)
for a standing Monument of his publick Confession of, and
hearty Repentance for all his Errors, and Miscarriages. The
general Scope of this Book, is to shew us wherein the <hi>Chief
Good</hi> of Man doth consist; which was the great Inquiry of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
Philosophers of old; about which they had endless Opinions
and Discourses, and could never hit the mark, nor arrive at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57349:5"/>
thorough Satisfaction, because they wanted the Light, and
Direction of the Word, and Spirit of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> plainly
tells us, that the <hi>Happiness</hi> of Man consists in the <hi>Fear,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
and <hi>Fruition</hi> of God: and not in the Enjoyment of the
<hi>Honours, Profits,</hi> or <hi>Pleasures</hi> of this World; or any good
Thing <hi>under the Sun.</hi> And because man, having by the Fall
lost God, is turned away to the Creature; &amp; as it is originally
inlaid in his nature to desire Happiness, so it is the Ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of his corrupt nature to pursue it and seek for it in
the Creature, and good Things of this Life: therefore He is
very Large &amp; Elaborate in discoursing the Vanity of all these
Things, and their Insufficiency to make a man Blessed, or to
make any real contribution towards the essential Happiness of
Man, being never made to be the Chief Good of Man, nor
proportioned and suited to the condition of the Soul of Man,
&amp; being made subject to Vanity, the greatest Vanity! as they
were made for Man and put into his Covenant, and so fell
with Him under the Curse, upon his Apostasy from God.
The large Experience this Wise Man had of created Things,
the many Proofs and Experiments, and curious critical Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
He had made into the Nature, and Use of sublunary, or
subsolary Enjoyments, together with the Infallible Conduct
of the Spirit of God, advantaged Him to discourse feelingly,
and accurately, as well as largely from point to point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the huge Vanity of all things under the Sun. A great
part of the Book is spent on this Subject. Among other Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that fall under his observation, this was One and none of
the Least, that men of greatest Sufficiency in any Course, or
Kind, meet with many unexpected Disappointments in their
Undertakings. This He declareth in the words of my Text.
Concerning the settling the Connexion of these words, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
are not at perfect agreement among themselves.
Some apprehend this to be an Argument of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi>
whereby they would demonstrate that all Things in the world
are rolled up and down, tumbled and toss'd about by meer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57349:5"/>
Chance, and fall out as it may happen, uncertainly and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itously:
Because <q>
                  <hi>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the
Strong</hi> &amp;c. </q>  but the Ablest men are often cross'd in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and defeated of their Ends and Hopes by these &amp; those
Intervening Accidents. Hence they deny the wise, overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
all-disposing <hi>Providence</hi> of God; and make I know not
what Imaginary blind <hi>Fortune</hi> the praedominant Deity in the
World. But there seems to be no necessity of fixing upon such
an Exposition and accomodation of the words; considering
that they may well admit of a better, and more savoury Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Others think that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath respect here to what
He had discoursed before, concerning the unsearchable &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable
Providence of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8, 16, 17. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.
1, 2. And whereas He had said there, that <q>
                  <hi>the Righteous, and
the Wise &amp; their Works are in the Hand of God;</hi>
               </q> He now shews
the Truth of that Assertion by an Induction of Particulars.
Others conceive it is a Correction of that Precept <hi>V.</hi> 7, 8, 9.
of this Chapter, concerning the Leading a pleasant, &amp; merry
Life in the free, and comfortable Use of outward Blessings;
which is here cautioned, and corrected by this Consideration,
that there is a great Uncertainty of Events, nor do things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Succeed according to a Rational Expectation: which
renders it apparent that no man is secure of the Perpetuity
of his earthly Felicity, or assured of the enjoyment of these
Comforts, and of an even course of Prosperity, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
troublesome Rubbs, and Disappointments. Others
judge He hath respect to the words immediately preceding
<hi>V.</hi> 10. where He adviseth us <q>
                  <hi>to do what we have to do, with
all our might,</hi>
               </q> whilest Life, and working Time continues.
<hi>Vid. Voet. Select Disput. Theol. Par. 4. P.</hi> 739. And lest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one should therefore presume upon a necessity that all
Things should succeed unto him according to his Abilities,
and endeavours, He subjoins this seasonable Admonition,
That we should not trust to our own Sufficiency, and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
in the management of any Business, to which there is no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57349:6"/>
sure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntail of Success; but depend upon, and attribute all to
the gracious Concurrence, free Favour, and Blessing of God.
But what ever may be conjectured about the connexion of the
words; evident it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here acquaints us with a
great Vanity under the Sun, which He had before intimated,
when He said, <q>
                  <hi>All things are alike to all, &amp; there is one Event
to the Righteous, &amp; to the Wicked, the Good and the Bad,</hi>
               </q> and
here amplifies, and adds, that <hi>swift,</hi> and <hi>slow; strong,</hi> and <hi>we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k
wise,</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi> have many times like success; and men of the
greatest sufficiency, as well as others, are often disappointed.
This <hi>Solomon</hi> returned and saw under the Sun, that is, when
He took a view of the frame, and posture, and condition of
Humane Affairs, among other vanities which He turned his
eyes upon, this was one over and above the rest, a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
vanity, which He considered over and over, That
Events do not alwayes answer the abilities, and endeavours of
men, and succeed according to their Expectations. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which <hi>Solomon</hi> discovered, and considered, and here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us with, is, that it is not in the power of the ablest
men, or best accomplished for Action, to effect their Designs,
or <hi>praestare Eventum,</hi> secure, and warrant the Event &amp; success
of their Undertakings: And this is, 1. Argued, &amp; proved
by the Induction of five Instances in particular, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more may by parity of Reason be added. <q>
                  <hi>The Race is not
to the Swift.</hi>
               </q> It is not in the power of the swiftest Footman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to evade danger, or win the Prize by Running. <q>
                  <hi>Nor is
the Battel to the Strong.</hi>
               </q> The Victory is not determined, or the
decision of the warre made alwayes on the side of the strongest
and valiantest men. <q>
                  <hi>Nor yet Bread to the Wise.</hi>
               </q> Many wise men
are not able to get their Bread, or Livelihood in the World.
<q>
                  <hi>Nor Riches to men of Vnderstanding.</hi>
               </q> Many understanding
men have not any success in their endeavours to gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

and get Estates. <q>
                  <hi>Nor Favour to men of Skill.</hi>
               </q> Many times the
most Skillful Artists, and Artificers, and the best Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Persons find little Favour and Acceptation among men,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57349:6"/>
how deserving, and ingenious soever they be. 2. Illustrated
by the <hi>Antithesis</hi> of a different, and the true Cause of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of Successes and Events, signified in those words,
<q>
                  <hi>But Time and Chance happeneth to them all.</hi>
               </q> By which we are
not to understand that the Determination of Events is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
and referred to meer <hi>Chance &amp; Fortune,</hi> as the <hi>Epicurean</hi>
Philosophers imagined: but that the Counsel and Providence
of God disposes and orders out all Successes, or Frustrations
of Second Causes, casting in sometimes such unexpected Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
and Obstructions, as defeat the Labours and hopes
of men of greatest Sufficiency; which though they seem whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casual and fortuitous Emergencies (and are so indeed unto
men themselves) yet they are governed by the secret Counsel
and effectual Providence of God. The Summe is, that no
man, how accomplish'd soever, is <hi>Master of Events,</hi> or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Determiner of the Issues of his <hi>own</hi> Actings and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
but the soveraign Counsel and the Providence of God
orders <hi>TIME</hi> and <hi>CHANCE</hi> to be an effectual Furtherance,
or Hindrance of the Designs of all men, as seems good in His
sight. The Observation is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That the Successes and Events of Vndertakings and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
are not determined infallibly by the greatest Sufficiency of
Men, or Second Causes; but by the Counsel and Providence of God
ordering and governing Time and Chance according to his own
good Pleasure.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to comprize and grasp the substance of
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Intendment, in this Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nal Conclusion: and shall
explicate and demonstrate the Truth of it (as God shall help)
in the following Propositions.</p>
            <p>Prop. 1. <hi>Second Causes may have a sufficiency in their Kind,
to produce these and those Effects:</hi> an liability, a congruous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition,
or an aptness, yea a kind of sufficiency in order to
the putting forth this and that Act, and the giving Existence
to these and those Effects: not indeed an absolute and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Sufficiency (which can be affirmed of none but Him that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57349:7"/>
is All sufficient and Omnipotent) but a limited sufficiency, or
a sufficiency in their <hi>Kind,</hi> and order: The Sun, to <hi>shine;</hi> the
Fire, to <hi>burn</hi> that which is combustible; the Rational Creature
to act or effect this or that in a way of <hi>counsel,</hi> and with <hi>freedom
of will;</hi> the Swift, to <hi>run;</hi> the strong and valiant, and well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
Souldier, to <hi>fight well;</hi> the wise man, to <hi>get his bread</hi>
to gather <hi>riches,</hi> to gain <hi>acceptance</hi> among those with whom he
hath to do. This is no more than to say, that created Agents
and Second Causes, may have the active power and virtue of
causes, all that is requisite on their parts in orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of their peculiar and appropriate Effects, all that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
that <hi>dependent Beings,</hi> and <hi>second Causes</hi> are capable of.
And indeed it belongs to the Infinite Wisdom and Goodness of
God to furnish his Creatures with sufficient Ability for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
and effects He hath made them for: and so He did at
<hi>first,</hi> when He made every thing good in its <hi>Kind;</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Defect there is <hi>now</hi> in this respect, it is the fruit &amp; punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sin. Though God is <hi>able</hi> to give Being to things in
an immediate way, yet it is his <hi>pleasure</hi> in the course of his
Providence to use Means, and to produce many things by the
mediation and Agency of second Causes, and so gives <hi>causal
virtue</hi> and ability to these and those things in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of such and such Effects. It is a good observation, that
the Lord is pleased, not through any <hi>defect of power</hi> in Himself
but out of <hi>the abundance of his goodness</hi> to communic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te causal
power and virtue to his Creatures, &amp; to honour them with that
Dignity that they may be his Instruments, by which He will
produce these and those Effects: whereby He takes them, as
it were, into partnership &amp; fellowship with Himself in the way
of his providential Efficiency, that they may be <hi>Vnder-workers</hi>
to, yea <hi>Co-workers</hi> with Himself. Hence He gives them an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude
and sufficiency in their <hi>kind</hi> in order to their respective
operations and effects: though some have a greater aptitude &amp;
sufficiency than others. But without some degree of such <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cy,</hi>
nothing can deserve the name of a <hi>Cause;</hi> the very <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57349:7"/>
whereof consists in its <hi>power, virtue</hi> &amp; <hi>ability</hi> to produce
an <hi>Effect.</hi> A <hi>cause</hi> cannot be a <hi>cause</hi> without an <hi>active power,</hi>
or <hi>sufficiency</hi> to give <hi>being</hi> to this or that <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Successes, and Events of Affairs and Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
do ordinarily depend in some respects upon the Sufficiency of
Second Causes.</p>
            <p>I do not say in the <hi>Observation;</hi> nor is it the meaning of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
that Successes and Events of Affairs and Undertakings
do not depend at all in an ordinary course, on the sufficiency
of Second Causes. For this were to deny and destroy their
<hi>causality,</hi> and to make nothing of their <hi>efficiency.</hi> Second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
have their peculiar Influence into their <hi>Effects,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
something to their <hi>Existence:</hi> and to assert the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
were to say that Causes are no Causes, and to speak a flat
Contrad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction. This would be to suppose that the Lord hath
set up an Order and course in Nature, in vain; and given to
Second Causes a sufficiency <hi>in their Kind,</hi> for <hi>Action,</hi> to no
purpose; and to deny the ordinary Providence of God, which
is that whereby the Lord observes the Order which He hath
set, and that course of Nature which is originally of his own
Appointment, whereby one thing depends upon, and receives
Being from another. Though the Lord is pleased sometimes
upon great and important Occasions, to leave the ordinary
Road of Providence, and act beyond and above the usual, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
course of Things; and not to concurre with, and shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the endeavours of created Agents, so as to crown them
with that success which according to an ordinary course of
Providence, might be rationally expected; yet it is not to be
imagined that He should ordinarily dispence with the course,
and methods of his ordinary Providence: For why then should
it be called <hi>ordinary?</hi> God who is the Lord of Hosts, the great
Leader Commander &amp; Ruler of Nature, not only <hi>permits,</hi>
but also <hi>effectually commands</hi> and causes his whole <hi>Militia,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>act</hi> according to their <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Properties</hi> respectively, without <hi>Countermanding</hi> them, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57349:8"/>
turning them out of their way. For (as I remember One
argues) He will not shew such a dislike to his own workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as ordinarily to cross the Order, and alter the course He
hath set in the World. Therefore the meaning of the Text is
not, that <hi>Swiftness</hi> conduces nothing to the <hi>winning of the Race,</hi>
or <hi>Strength,</hi> to the winning of the <hi>Battel;</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> &amp; <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
to the getting of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Riches;</hi> or <hi>Prudence, Art,</hi>
or <hi>Skill,</hi> to the getting of the <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>good will of Princes,</hi>
or <hi>People:</hi> nor, that the <hi>Race</hi> is <hi>never</hi> to the <hi>Swift,</hi> or the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
never</hi> to the <hi>Strong;</hi> no nor yet, that the <hi>Race</hi> is not <hi>more
frequently</hi> to the <hi>Swift,</hi> and the <hi>Battel usually</hi> to the <hi>Strong, &amp;c.</hi>
For the Lord doth most ordinarily award <hi>Success</hi> unto causes of
greatest <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> rather than <hi>Disappointment</hi> &amp; <hi>Defeatment.</hi>
Otherwise, it would be a very <hi>heartless,</hi> if not a <hi>foolish</hi> Thing (in
the eye of Reason) to <hi>use means,</hi> or to think to get the <hi>Race</hi> by
<hi>Swiftness,</hi> or <hi>Bread</hi> by <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> or <hi>Favour</hi> by
<hi>dexterous &amp; prudent Behaviour;</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> by <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;</hi>
or to <hi>win the Battel</hi> by good <hi>Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and
<hi>numbers of men.</hi> Yea then <hi>Wisdom</hi> would not be better than
<hi>Folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor <hi>Strength</hi> more desirable than <hi>Weakness;</hi> nor <hi>Diligence</hi>
more beneficial &amp; available than <hi>Idleness,</hi> and <hi>sitting still.</hi> This
therefore is evident, that the Issues and Events of Undertakings
do <hi>in some respect, ordinarily,</hi> depend upon the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Causes;</hi> insomuch as the greatest probability of Success
(according to an ordinary providence, and in the eye of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
is ordinarily on the side of Causes that are most sufficient
in their kind of Efficiency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Second Causes, though of greatest Sufficiency in their
kind, have not the certain Determination of Successes &amp; Events in
their own Hands: but may be frustrated &amp; disappointed.</p>
            <p>Though the Successes and Events of Undertakings ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
depend upon the sufficiency of Second Causes; yet they
are not infallibly determined thereby. Created Agents have
not Events in their own Hands, but may be disappointed: they
cannot warrant the Events of their Undertakings, or Success
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57349:8"/>
of their Counsels and Endeavours, but may be defeated of
their Hopes and Expectations. Thus no man hath the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
command of the Issue &amp; success of his own Undertakings.
He may be sure of this or that Event, if the Lord <hi>Promise</hi> it to
him, or <hi>Reveal</hi> it to be <hi>His Pleasure</hi> to give such Success to
such Endeavours: but he cannot be secured of it from, or by
any <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of his own. He may, as a wise man, foresee &amp;
say, what in an ordinary course of Providence is rationally to
be expected; but cannot warrant the Success of his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
or carv out what Event he pleases, to himself. His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Providence, and Diligence, and <hi>Sufficiency for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
cannot assure him of the <hi>Event,</hi> or determin the Success
on his side. And there is that Demonstration of it, that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Agents of the the greatest <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> are sometimes disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
Two Things I would say here,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Agents of greatest Sufficiency are subject to Disappointment,
as well</hi> (I do not say, as much, or as ordinarily and often, but
as well) <hi>as Agents of less sufficiency.</hi> The Ablest Men in any
kind may miss of the Success they expect, as well as weaker
men. That Men of great Sufficiency in this or that way, may
be defeated of their Ends and Hopes, <hi>Solomon</hi> from his own
Experience, assures us, in the Text: and who is it that upon his
own observation cannot set his Seal to what He asserts? He
gives five Instances. 1. <hi>The Race is not to the Swift:</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
or successful to him always; but sometimes pernicious,
&amp; destructive. Many agood Runner runs Himself into mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and Ruine. Thus <hi>Asabel,</hi> that is said to be as light of foot
as a wild Roe, ran after <hi>Abner</hi> so fast, that he lost his Life in
that overhasty pursuit 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 18-23. There are Times
when men that are swift would run from danger, and cannot:
they have neither power to run, nor success in attempting it,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 46, 6. Sometimes the Flight perisheth from the Swift, and
he that is swift of foot, or that rideth the Horse, though it be
at full speed, cannot deliver himself, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 14, 15. It is not
absolutely in the power of the swiftest man to escape danger,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57349:9"/>
or win the prize by Running. 2. <hi>The Battel is not to the
Strong.</hi> There is <hi>in Bello Alea, the Chance of Warre,</hi> as they
use to speak. There is, as it were, a kind of Lottery, a great
Uncertainty in Warre. Great Armies are sometimes defeated
by small and inconsiderable Forces; the great Host of <hi>Midian,</hi>
by <hi>Gideon</hi>'s three hundred men; the Garrison of the <hi>Philistines</hi>
by <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and his Armour-Bearer. This hath been often
observed in the World. Sometimes strong and valiant Men
are overthrown by those that are in strength farre inferiour to
them; <hi>great Goliah,</hi> by <hi>little David.</hi> Well might <hi>David</hi> say, as
<q>
                  <hi>
                     <bibl>Psal. 33. 16, 17.</bibl> There is no King saved by the multitude of an
host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An Horse is
a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great
strength.</hi>
               </q> There are Times, when <q>

                  <hi>Bread is not to the Wise.</hi>
               </q> Wise men are not able to get
their Livelihood, but have much adoe to make a shift to get a
bare Subsistence in the world; and, it may be, are forc'd to
beg for it, or be beholding to the Charity of others. There
have been strange Instances of very wise, and worthy Persons,
that have been reduced to such a Condition. Some of you
know the famous Story, <hi>Date Obolum,</hi> or (as others have it)
<hi>Panem Belisario. David</hi> was put to beg his Bread of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1.
Sam. 25. &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> was often in Hunger and Thirst, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>4. <q>
                  <hi>Riches are not to men of Vnderstanding.</hi>
               </q> Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
wise men get Estates and gather Riches; and one would
think they should be best accomplish'd for it: and yet it so falls
out, that some understanding M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n cannot thrive in the World
and grow rich, notwithstanding all their Endeavours. So it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57349:9"/>
is, that many men of great Understanding and rational Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castings
and Contrivances to gather wealth, though they lay
out their Parts and their Hearts this way, and would be rich,
yet they cannot; but are strangely defeated. You read of the
<hi>poor</hi> wise man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 15. Many men of great Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are too wise, and of too great Spirits to labour after
wealth; or if they do, their designs are unsuccessful. 5. <q>
                  <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is not to men of Skill.</hi>
               </q> Many very wise, and knowing, &amp;
skillfull men, and experienced in Affairs, and prudent also in
their Deportment, yet cannot get, or keep the <hi>Favour</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or People. Some Expositors on the Place, instance in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
that was envied, and hated, and sold by his Brethren, &amp;
also lost the favour of <hi>Potiphar</hi> (though He managed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of his House prudently and prosperously, and deserved
well at his Hands) and was cast into Prison by him. <hi>David,</hi>
that was hated and persecuted by <hi>Saul; Daniel,</hi> that was cast
into the Lions Den, though <hi>an excellent Spirit was found in
Him,</hi> and great Prudence and Faithfulness in managing the
Affairs of the Empire; and before that, though He had been
in great Favour and Esteem in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s time, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the Reign of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> He lived obscure, and as
it were buried at Court, as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> gathers from <hi>Dan.</hi>
5. 11, 12, 13. Many wise, and learned, and Ingenious Men
cannot get the Favour of men, or keep it, when they have. The
<hi>poor</hi> wise man delivered the City, and yet no man remembred
that same poor man, <hi>Eccl. 9. 15. Belisarius</hi> (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </q> Other Scripture Testimonies and
Instances, besides those in the Text, might be produced, if it
were needful. But every observing man's experience may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with Demonstrations of this Truth, <hi>That Agents of
greatest Sufficiency among men are subject to Disappointments, as
well as those of less Sufficiency.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Agents of little, or no Sufficiency, succeed sometimes in their
Undertakings; when those of greater Sufficiency, miscarry &amp; meet
with Disappointment.</hi> There is many times one Event to both
as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 2. when the ablest Agents are frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated,
as well as the weakest: and there is sometimes a better
Event to weaker Agents, &amp; Instruments; they prosper in their
way, when abler men are disappointed. The Race is <hi>sometimes</hi>
to the Slow, and the Swift lose the Prize. The Battel is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
to the Weak; and the Strong are put to flight: as we
have many Instances both in Scripture and common History.
Weak and simple people have bread enough sometimes, when
wise men are in want of their daily bread. <hi>Nobal</hi> had good
store, when <hi>David</hi> was hard put to it. Men of shallow heads
grow rich and get great Estates, when men of understanding
can thrive at no Hand. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of the <hi>poor</hi> wise
man; and our Saviour in that Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 16, 20. tells
us of a <hi>rich Fool.</hi> It is ordinarily seen in the World, that the
thriving men in Estates, are none of the most understanding &amp;
judicious. Many a man hath this world-craft, that yet is a
man of no deep or solid Understanding. So, many weak,
worthless, ignorant, empty Persons find Favour with Princes
and People: when men of Skill, &amp; Learning, &amp; great worth
are neglected and despised. This is an Evil under the Sun, &amp;
an Error that proceeds from the Ruler, a great miscarriage in
Government, that <q>
                  <hi>Folly is set in great dignity</hi> (Fools are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and advanced) <hi>and the Rich,</hi> i. e. men of rich Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Wisdom and Piety, <hi>sit in low places,</hi> i. e. are depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and discountenanced: <hi>Servants are upon Horses,</hi> men of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57349:10"/>
poor servile Spirits and Conditions, are set up and honoured,
<hi>and Princes,</hi> i. e. men of great worth, <hi>walking as Servants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Eccl. 10. 5, 6, 7.</bibl>
               </q> So that it appeares plainly, that
Success doth not alwayes wait upon the Counsels and Actions
of Persons of great Sufficiency; but they may suffer Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
when others are prosperous: Which demonstrates
that the Issues and Events of Undertakings and Affairs are not
determined infallibly by the Qualifications &amp; accomplishments
of created Agents, and Second Causes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. The Defeat &amp; Disappointment of Agents of great Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in their kind, is from the Hapning of <hi>Time</hi> &amp; <hi>Chance</hi>
unto them.</p>
            <p>Some read it (and the Original will bear it) <hi>because,</hi> or <hi>for</hi>
Time and Chance happeneth to them all. For Explication.</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>Time,</hi> understand not barely the <hi>Duration,</hi> or <hi>space</hi> of
Time, which hath no such determining Influence into humane
Affairs. But Time <hi>so &amp; so Circumstanced.</hi> Time is sometimes
as much as a special <hi>Season</hi> or <hi>Opportunity,</hi> when there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of Helps, means, and advantages for the furthering
the Designs and undertakings of men. By <hi>Time</hi> sometimes,
we are to understand such a <hi>Nick,</hi> or <hi>Iuncture</hi> of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is a coincidence of Difficulties, disadvantages, &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
to the effecting of any Business. And this seems the
meaning of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Text. An adverse or <hi>evil Time,</hi> Ec.
9. 12. Sometimes the Times favour the Enterprizes of men,
Sometimes they frown upon them. At one time, wise and
good men stand up for the Defence of their Country and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
thereof, and prosper in it; the Times favour them,
there is a concurrence of all manner of Furtherances and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages:
at another time, they may endeavour it, and the Times
frown upon them, the Spirit and Humour of the People is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated;
and they swim against the stream, &amp; are lost in the
Attempt. And we say, <hi>Such a Man was worthy of better Times,</hi>
had been a brave man, if He had lived in be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter Times, his
worth had been more known and prized, and He would have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57349:11"/>
had better success. So when the Time of Judgment upon a
People, is come, then wrath ariseth against them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
and then the <hi>strong man</hi> may fight for the defence of
such a Country; and <hi>the wise man</hi> endeavour to deliver the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
but all in vain; they shall miscarry in the Undertaking. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben
Ezra</hi> (as <hi>Mercer</hi> tells us) referres this to the <hi>Conjunctions,</hi>
and <hi>Aspects</hi> of the Starres, by which He apprehended these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Things were governed. We are sure there are certain
Periods, and Revolutions of Time, respecting the Prosperity,
or Adversity of Nations, Countries, Cities, Churches, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
Persons. As Time is set to all the Successes, so to all the
Defeats and disappointments of men; and when this Time
comes, no Sufficiency of man can withstand Disappointments.</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>Chance,</hi> Understand contingent and casual Events.
Many things fall out between the <hi>Cup,</hi> and the <hi>Lip;</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than expect or imagine, or can possibly foresee. Some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
chops in, and interposeth unexpectedly, to cross a man's
Designs, &amp; defeat his Hopes &amp; rational Expectations. When
<hi>Saul</hi> and his men were compassing <hi>David</hi> and his men, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to take them, then comes a Messenger to <hi>Saul,</hi> saying, <q>

Contrivance In this sence <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> happens to
men of greatest Sufficiency, which they cannot either fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
(<hi>Eccl</hi> 9. 12.) or prevent, or help themselves against them
when they come upon them: and hereby their Counsels, and
Undertakings are defeated and ruined sometimes.</p>
            <p>Prop. 5. <hi>Time and Chance which happens to men in the way of
their Vndertakings, is effectually ordered &amp; governed by the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57349:11"/>
God is the Lord of Time, and Orderer, and Governour of all
Contingences. Time and Chance that further or hinder the

               </q> The Lord makes and disposes the Lot, or Chance of
every man, whatever it is. He hath appointed all Times and
Chances in his <hi>Eternal</hi> Counsel; and in <hi>Time</hi> executes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
in the course of his Providence.</p>
            <p>Prop. 6. <hi>The great God hath the absolute and infallible Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

of created Agents &amp; Second Causes, in his own Power.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57349:12"/>
His Counsel and soveraign Will appoints what they shall be,
and his Providence (which is not determined by any Second
Cause: but is the Determiner of them all) Executes according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And it must needs be so, if you consider these two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>God is the Absolute First Cause, and Supream Lord of all.</hi>
               <q>Of Him, and to Him, and through Him are all Things, <bibl>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 36.</bibl>
               </q> He that understands any thing of God indeed, knows
this to be a Truth. Here we might be large; as they that are
acquainted with the Doctrine of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> in
<hi>Conservation</hi> and <hi>Gubernation</hi> of all Things, will readily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend:
for here we might shew you, 1. That God is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
first Cause of all the causal power and virtue that is in
Creatures. He gives them power to act, furnisheth them with
a Sufficiency for their Operations. He gives Swiftness to the
Runner; Skill, and Strength, and Courage, to the Souldier.</p>
            <p>2. That He supports, and continues the active power of
the creature. He continues Swiftness, Wisdom, Strength, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
as He pleaseth. If He withdraw, all is gone. The
Swift is lame, or slow-footed, the Strong is weak &amp; timorous,
the Wise is foolish and besotted, the man of Skill, is a meer
Bungler at any thing. 3. That He doth by a <hi>previous Influx</hi>
excite and stirre up, and actuate the active power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and set all the wheels agoing. For the most operative,
active created Virtue, is not a <hi>pure Act:</hi> but hath some <hi>Potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
mixed with it; and therefore cannot put forth it self into
Action, unless it be set agoing by the <hi>first Cause.</hi> And the
creature cannot be the absolute <hi>first Cause</hi> of any <hi>physical action.</hi>
               <q>In Him we live, and move, <bibl>
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17 28.</bibl>
               </q> Again. 4. That
He determines and applyes Second Causes to the Objects of
their Actions. When they stand, as it were, <hi>in Bivio,</hi> as it is
said of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he was marching with his Army
He <q>
                  <hi>stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes, to
use Divination,</hi> as doubting which way he had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st to march;
whether to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or some other way, <bibl>
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 21, 22.</bibl>
               </q>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57349:12"/>
Then the Lord easts the Scale and the Lot, &amp; determines them
this way, and not another. He doth not only stir up Second
Causes to act at large, and set them agoing, and leave it to
their own Inclination, whither they shall go, &amp; what they shall
do: but He leads them forth, and determines them to this, or
that Object. 5. That He <hi>cooperates,</hi> and workes <hi>jointly</hi> with
Second Causes, in producing their Effects. as He <hi>predetermins</hi>
Second Causes, so He <hi>concurres</hi> with them in their Operations.
And this <hi>Pradetermination,</hi> and <hi>Concurse</hi> is so necessary; that
there can be no real Effect produced by the Creature without it.
And it is a Truth also, that when God Improves Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for the production of any Effect, He so concurres with
them, that He doth withall most immediately, intimously, and
without Dependence upon these Causes by which He acts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Entity,</hi> or <hi>Esse</hi> of the Effect. If this be considered, it
will appear that created Agents, are as it were, God's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that act as they are acted by Him; and cannot move of
themselves. The busy, bustling, proud <hi>Assyrian</hi> was so, <hi>Is</hi> 10.
15. 6. <hi>That all the Ataxy, Disorder, Irregularity, moral Evil
that is found in the Actions of Rational Agents, is by His Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
If it were not the Pleasure of God to permit it, no Sin
should be in the World, nor in the Actions of Men. Though
there is no <hi>Legal</hi> Permission, or allowance of it; (for the Law
of God forbids it) yet there is a <hi>Providential</hi> Permission of it.
God could have kept it out of his World. 7. <hi>That He limits
and sets Bounds to the Actions of Second Causes: what they shall do,
and how farre they shall proceed in this or that way.</hi> He set bounds
to Satan, when he had Commission to afflict <hi>Iob.</hi> He limits,
and restrains the Eruptions of the Wrath &amp; Rage of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Adversaries, <hi>Ps.</hi> 76. 10. He sets bounds to the sinfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Men: He regulates and governs all the Actions of
Second Causes, as to time, place, degrees, and all manner of
Circumstances. He is not the <hi>Author:</hi> but He is the <hi>Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and blast the likeliest Undertakings of the ablest Men. In a
word: the Lord being the Absolute First Cause, and supream
Governour of all his Creatures, and all their Actions; though
He hath set an Order among his Creatures, this shall be the
cause of that effect, &amp;c. yet He himself is not tied to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but Interrupts the course of it, when He pleases. The
Lord reserves a Liberty to Himself to interpose, and to Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
matters of Success and Event, contrary to the Law and
common Rule of Second Causes. And though He ordinarily
concurreth with Second Causes according to the Law given
and Order set; yet sometimes there is in his Providence a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Digression. Though He hath given Creatures pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

and Confirmation of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE</hi> I. Of Instruction, in these Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We see what a poor dependent, nothing-Creature Proud Man
is:</hi> Depending absolutely upon God for his Being, Actions,
and the Success of them. Men of greatest Sufficiency cannot
get their own Bread, or bring any thing to effect in their own
strength. Let their Abilities be what they will (<hi>Swiftness,</hi> for
the <hi>Race; Strength,</hi> for the <hi>Battel; Wisdom,</hi> for getting their
<hi>Bread, &amp;c.</hi>) yet they shall stand them in no stead without the
concurrence and Blessing of God. Man saith, he will do this
and that: but he must ask God leave first. He saith, To day
or to morrow I will go to such a place, and buy and sell, &amp; get
gain; whereas he knows not what shall be: but it shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be as the Lord will. <hi>The way of man is not in himself, it is not
in man that walketh to direct his steps,</hi> nor perform any thing
that he purposeth, without divine Concurrence, or Permission.
He hath not the Success of any of his actions in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
nor doth he know that any thing he doth shall prosper. One
would wonder poor <hi>dependent</hi> man should be so <hi>proud!</hi> Any
little thing lifts him up. When the Souldier on such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as these, is in his Bravery, in his military Garb drest up for
the purpose, with his <hi>Buffe Coat,</hi> his <hi>Scarfe,</hi> his <hi>rich Belt,</hi> his
<hi>Arms, a good Horse under him,</hi> O what a goodly Creature is he
in his own Eyes! and what wonders can he do in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit!
and yet he hath as absolute need of God's Assistance, if he
go forth to Battel, as any naked, unarmed man He cannot
move a step, or fetch his next breath, or bring his hand to his
mouth, or leap over a straw, or do any thing, without help
from God, <q>
                  <hi>in whose hand his breath is, and whose are all his wayes</hi>
                  <bibl>Dan. 5. 23.</bibl>
               </q> It's strange to see how the hearts of men are lifted
up with nothing! <hi>O cease ye from Man: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57349:14"/>2. <hi>We see that there is, and there is not</hi> Chance <hi>in the World.</hi>
Chance there is, in respect of Second Causes: (so some things
fall out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as our Saviour speaks <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 31.) but
no Chance as to the first Cause. That piece of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and
<hi>Heathenism</hi> ascribing things to <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> is hardly
rooted out of the minds of men, that are or should be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and informed. The <hi>Philistines</hi> when they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
could not tell whether <hi>God</hi> had done it, or a meer <hi>Chance</hi>
happened to them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 9. They understood not, that
what was <hi>a Chance to them,</hi> was ordered by the <hi>Providence of
God.</hi> Truth is, Chance is something that falls out beside the
Scope, Intention, and foresight of <hi>Man,</hi> the Reason and cause
whereof may be hid from him; and so it excludes the Counsel
of <hi>Men;</hi> but it doth not exclude the Counsel and Providence of
<hi>God;</hi> but is ordered and governed thereby. And it is so farre
from being <hi>Chance</hi> to God, that there is as much (if not more)
of the Wisdom, and Will, and Power of God appearing in
matters of Chance and Contingency, as in any other Events.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>We see here something of the Power, and Greatness, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God appearing in his Efficiency, whereby He works all in all.</hi>
As He is himself Independent, so all Things have an absolute
Dependence on Him. He gives Success, or causeth Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
as he pleaseth. So that men are wholly beholden
to Him for all the good they enjoy: for Victory, for Bread,
for Riches, for Favour and Acceptance, for all. Nothing
comes to pass without his Permission, if it be <hi>moral Evil;</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout
his Concurse and cooperation, yea, Predetermination, if
it be <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>physical Good,</hi> or <hi>penal Evil.</hi> In him we live and
move, and have our Being. The Counsels of the ablest States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
how rational soever, shall not prosper without him: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
how sufficient soever, pious, learned, industrious, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
shall convert no man, edify no man, comfort &amp; establish
no man, without Him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. Though Scholars study
hard, they shall make no proficiency without the Blessing of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57349:15"/>
God. The Merchant may trade, and project rationally, and
yet shall not grow rich upon it, unless God give him success.
It is God that maketh <q>

in his Tents:</hi>
               </q> that crowns the labours of Seamen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,

               <hi>Training Days, Artillery Days,</hi> thò

Lordbless. He must instruct, and teach, and accomplish you;
otherwise the help of your expert Officers, and your own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

Souldiers come to fight; whatever Skill, an Strength, and
Courage, and Conduct, and Advantages they have; yet they
will be worsted, if the Lord do not give Success. We should
learn hence to admire the Power and Greatness of God. It is a
lamentable thing, that He that doth all, is thought to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!
He can work without Means, by insufficient Means; &amp;
blast the ablest Instruments: and yet is little minded in the

Therefore let all that fear God, comfort themselves with this

Hence also God's People are discouraged, when they see

               </q> But this is a
wrong way of judging, because <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> happens, &amp;
God may turn all a quite other way. It was a good observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mr. <hi>Caryl, </hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>When wicked men are nearest their Hopes, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men are furthest from their Fears;</hi>
               </q> because then usually God
defeats them; and their Insolence, &amp; Confidence engage Him
to do it. 3. <hi>That the Determination of all Events, is in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57349:17"/>
Hand of God in Christ, or of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> The Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is at God's right Hand, and hath all Power in Heaven, and
Earth committed to Him; all Judgment, and the Command
and Government of all Events. He governs <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance.</hi>
God is in Christ providentially ruling all Events; prospeting,
or blasting all Affairs, as He will. It is the Man upon the
Throne above the Firmament, that gives out his Orders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which the Living-Creatures (or Angels) move the
wheels of Providence, as you may see in that excellent Scheme
of Providence, which is drawn in the first Chapter of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi>
And it's well for Believers, that themselves, and their works
are in the Hand of Christ, and that all Events in the World are
determined by Him. <hi>Thàt</hi> Christ, whose Person you love,
whose Ordinances you love; whose Truth you love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose
Commands you love; whose Members you love; whose Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
you love: <hi>that</hi> Christ, that loveth <hi>you</hi> a thousand times
more than you can love <hi>Him,</hi> and loved you above his own
Life, and will love you to Eternity, <hi>that</hi> Blessed Lord Jesus
Christ hath the managing of <hi>all</hi> Affairs, and of all <hi>your</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
and Undertakings in his own Hands. And therefore we
may conclude that He will do all in <hi>favour</hi> of his Members, &amp;
it shall be <hi>well</hi> with them that fear God. <hi>Eccl</hi> 8. 12.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Labour to maintain an humble Sense of your own Insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to accomplish any thing, even in that kind wherein you seem to
be most sufficient &amp; best accomplished.</hi> Let worthy Magistrates
in Consultations for publick Good; Ministers, in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
way; Scholars, in their way, and Souldiers, in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
capacity, walk humbly with God. Truly God hath pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Contempt upon our military Men, our Artillery men, and
good Souldiers, <hi>New-England</hi> hath gloried in these Things,
Indeed, men of martial Spirits and Skill, ought to be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
these Trainings and Exercises are very commendable, &amp;
by all means to be supported and countenanced: and it is pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
that as in other things, so in this, the good Old Spirit is so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57349:17"/>
much gone: These are not Times wherein the Nations beat
their Swords into Plough-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.
War, in some cases is <hi>lawful,</hi> and at sometimes <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and sure then, Learning of War is so also. But I fear we
have trusted too much in Sword and Bow, and gloried in our
Numbers; in our Arms and Ammunition: in our Trainings,
in our expert Souldiers: and the Lord hath shewn us, that all
these things are nothing without his Blessing: and that unless
the Lord watch the Town, keep the garrison'd House, fight
the Battel, all is in vain. We have seen that a despised &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
Enemy, that is not acquainted with books of <hi>military
Discipline,</hi> that observe no <hi>regular Order,</hi> that understand not
the Souldier's <hi>Postures,</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> and <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ings,</hi> and <hi>Forms of
Battel;</hi> that fight in a base, cowardly, contemptible way, have
been able to rout, and put to flight, and destroy our valiant and
good Souldiers. And I must confess, that which determined
my thoughts to this Text, was this very Consideration. I
know not whether my Discourse upon it may seem so well le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
at the Occasions of this Day: But I know it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Times that have passed over us, and the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof. And I hope the Gentlemen-Souldiers present
will not blame any of us, if we cannot look upon their <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi>
and <hi>Artillery-Exercises</hi> with such an Eye as formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Warre: nay they are to blame themselves, if they do
not look upon them with another Eye themselves, considering
how God hath humbled us in that respect. Whether my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
be pertinent to the Day or no, yet sure I am, it is a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
God hath been teaching of us by many sad Defeats &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows
by a despicable Enemy, <hi>That the Battel is not to the
Strong, or Expert, or Valiant; nor Success always answerable to
the Sufficiency of Instruments; but determined by the Lord, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
Time, <hi>&amp;</hi> Chance <hi>according to His Pleasure.</hi> Plain it is,
that the Lord hath spoken this over &amp; over in his Providence,
and it is very proper for the Dispensers of the Word to speak it
after Him, &amp; inculcate the same humbling Lesson. Nothing's
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57349:18"/>
more apparent, than that God's Design at this day, is to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Magistrates, our worthy Patriots, to humble Ministers,
Churches, expert and valiant Military-men, Merchants, and
Husbandmen, all sorts of men amongst us. Who sees not that
God's Design is to humble <hi>proud New-England?</hi> Therefore
admit I beseech you, an <hi>humbling Discourse</hi> in an <hi>humbling Time</hi>
and suffer this word of <hi>Exortation,</hi> the drift whereof is, not to
discourage from the use of Means, or take off your edge from
military Exercises; but to press you to get &amp; keep a due Sense
of your own Insufficiency in your several Capacities, to do any
Exploits, or accomplish any good Purposes of your selves.
And may there not be need of <hi>an humbling Word</hi> on such Days
as these, when there are such Solemnities, and the Hearts of
poor men are ready to swell, and heave &amp; be puffed up strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with great Apprehensions of themselves? Well, Be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of your Insufficiency to effect any thing, whatever your
Wisdom and Strength be: that you cannot of your selves, win
the Race, or Battel; get Bread, or Wealth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 17, 18.
build the House, or keep the City, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 1, 2. Truly we
had need be put in mind that we are but <hi>weak, sorry men,</hi> that
cannot make our own <hi>Fortune;</hi> but must take what God orders
out to us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Depend absolutely upon God for all the Issues and Successes of
your Affairs &amp; Undertakings.</hi> For you see the Determinaton of
them is in His Hands. Though wicked men would shame the
Counsel of the poor People of God (deriding their Course in
this respect) because they have made God their Refuge (as <hi>Ps.</hi>
14. 6.) yet be not you ashamed of your Dependence upon
God, nor either jeered, or affrighted and discouraged out of it.
It makes for the glory of God, as well as your comfort, when
you depend upon Him. Therefore, 1. <hi>Make sure that all
your Counsels and Vndertakings be</hi> Lawful <hi>and</hi> Good. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you cannot duly depend upon Him, and expect his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Concurrence. Indeed God may shine upon the Counsels,
and way of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in respect of <hi>outward Prosperity:</hi> And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57349:18"/>
so He may give <hi>you</hi> Success <hi>in wrath,</hi> &amp; for your greater hurt,
when your Undertakings are <hi>sinful:</hi> but you have no Promise
of his <hi>gracious Concurrence</hi> in that Case, to ground Faith upon.
(2.) <hi>Do what your hand finds to do, with all your Might.</hi> As in
the Verse before the Text. Be not slothful, or neglective of
Duty, because of the uncertainty of Events. Though you have
not the Issue in your own power, yet you are to do your utmost
towards the compassing of your lawful Designs. Do your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or you cannot expect God's Blessing, and his determining
Events on your side. Great Complaints there have been from
time to time of the neglect of these <hi>military Exercises,</hi> even by
those that have freely Listed, &amp; solemnly engaged themselves
to attend them; and that such Days are spent away unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
little done to any purpose; as if they were Days to meet
on, to <hi>smoke,</hi> and <hi>carouse,</hi> and <hi>swagger,</hi> and <hi>dishonour God with
the greater Bravery &amp; Solemnity.</hi> O make a <hi>Business</hi> of it, and
not a <hi>Play.</hi> And in all your lawful undertakings, be serious &amp;
diligent. Uncertaintie of Events should not hinder from Duty
and Diligence. <hi>Eccl. 11. 6. 3. Renounce all Confidence in</hi>
Creatures, <hi>or</hi> created Sufficiency. <q>
                  <hi>I will not trust in my Bow</hi>

               </q>

<hi>Arm,</hi> nor lay too much weight upon the Ability of any Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Do not bear too much upon the sufficiency of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to instruct, convince, convert, comfort and edifie: for
<hi>Paul</hi> himself <hi>was nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7-2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. Do
not say, Wisdom and strength are for the War (as <hi>Isai.</hi> 36. 5.
and therein we will trust: For Events do not always fall out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
Let not the strong man glory in his Strength, nor
the wise man, in his Wisdom, nor rich man, in his Riches; but
in the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 23, 24. Do not trust in your own Wit,
Art, Strength, Courage, military Accomplishments, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for War, Advantages, or any Sufficiencie you have. Do
not trust in any Qualifications you have, Natural or Acquired,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57349:19"/>
Civil or Spiritual. Do not trust to the sufficiencie of received
habitual Grace. When God said to <hi>Paul, </hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>My Grace is sufficient
for thee:</hi> 
               </q>He doth not mean <hi>habitual</hi> Grace only; but <hi>actual,
effiicacious, Assisting</hi> Grace that the Lord was pleased to afford
him, the <hi>Epichoregia pneùmatos,</hi> additional Supplies of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and <hi>Increated,</hi> as well as <hi>created</hi> Grace, which <hi>Paul</hi> was to
trust to, and so might glorie in his Infirmities, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Power of God that rested on him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10. Do
not trust to your <hi>previous</hi> Dispositions and Preparations, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Duty. It is not in him that <hi>wills,</hi> or <hi>runs.</hi> Take heed of
Self-fullness, and a Spirit of Independenci in this respect.
Self-Confidence, and Creature-Confidence are inconsistent
with a due Dependence upon God. 4. <hi>Beg good Successes, &amp;
Issues of your Vndertakings of God, in the Name of Iesus Christ.</hi>
It is one of the Characters of a good Souldier, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 2. and
I am sure it is of a good Man, to be <hi>a Man of Prayer.</hi> It were
well if all our <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>military</hi> Gentlemen were men of
this Character. It is well if none of you have come forth to
day without solemn Prayer to God for his Blessing on the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and Services of this Day. Some read those words <q>
                  <hi>
                     <bibl>Isai.
36 5. </bibl>Thou saist, surely Lip-labour is Counsel &amp; Strength suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Warre:</hi>
               </q> As if <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> flouted good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for
his Confidence in God, and for saying that <hi>Prayer</hi> (which he
scoffingly calls <q>
                  <hi>words of Lips,</hi>
               </q> or <q>
                  <hi>Lip-labour</hi>
               </q>) would be in stead
of the best Policy, and Courage, and Preparations for Warre.
But if this reading be somewhat forced, yet sure it is, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Prayer to God must not exclude the use of other Means
(for how can a man pray in Faith, that doth not also use all due
Means in his power?) to get the Victorie, and win the Day.
Therefore when you come to these Exercises, beg military Skill
of God: and when called forth to real Service, beg Success of
Him. So in other Cases, Prayer is one of the best Expedients.
Our Saviour hath Instructed us to pray for our daily Bread.
Scholars should beg a Blessing on their Studies. <hi>Bene Orâsse
est bene Studuisse.</hi> So for Favour &amp; acceptance among men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57349:19"/>
beg so much as may put you into a better Capacity to do the
work of your place, and serve your Generation. When <hi>Paul</hi>
was to carry a liberal Contribution to the poor Saints at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
(which was like enough to be very welcome) He begs
the <hi>Romans</hi> to strive together with him in <hi>Prayer,</hi> that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
might be <hi>accepted</hi> of the Saints, <hi>Rom. 15. 30, 31. Pray</hi>
threefore in the Name of Christ, for the good Success of all
your lawful Undertakings. Therein you will express your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on God. 5. <hi>Cast all the Care of Events &amp; Issues of
your Affairs &amp; Vndertakings, on the Lord.</hi> Use all the good
Means in your Hand, and then leave Events quietly with God,
on whom all the Issues of things depend. <q>
                  <hi>Commit your way to
the Lord, and roll it off thy self upon Him.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Psal. 37. 5.</bibl>
               </q> Look to
Him to direct thy paths to a good Issue. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. When you
have done your Duty in the use of Means to compass your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Designs, and recommended all to God by Prayer, then
trouble your selves no further; but <q>
                  <hi>Cast your burden upon the
Lord,</hi>

It is our work to take care our Dutie be done, and the Lord's
work to take the care of Events. It was a brave Speech of that
gallant Souldier, though none of the best Men, <hi>Ioab</hi> I mean,
when he had set his Men in battel aray, and used all the Skill &amp;
Policie he could, <q>
                  <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men, for
our People, and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that
which seemeth Him good.</hi> 
                  <bibl>2 Sam. 10. 12.</bibl>
               </q> We must not govern
the World. nor encroach upon God's Prerogative (which is <hi>to
dispose of Events</hi>) by taking the care of them upon our selves.
Be <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> in your own Eyes, and commit your selves &amp;
Concernments to Him. 6. <hi>When you have thus done, then
Believe stedfastly that the Lord will give you a goud Issue of your
Vndertakings.</hi> Though not that which you may desire; yet
that which is best for you. When you have greatest Sense of
your own Insufficiencie, and the weakness of Means; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, and depend upon Him for it according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
with whom it is all one to save by many, or few; weak,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57349:20"/>
or strong, to Convert and edifie by weak, or able Ministers; to
feed his Children, and make them look fair and fat, with Pulse
and mean fare, as well as with royal Dainties. This Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon God, excludeth <hi>Presumption</hi> on one hand; <hi>Despair
and Discouragement</hi> on the other. And He that in the Sense of
his own Insufficiencie, trusts in the Power and Grace of God,
may say as <hi>Paul, </hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>When I am weak, then am I strong.</hi> 
                  <bibl>2 Cor. 12.
10.</bibl>
               </q> Oh then! Let us depend upon God, with whom are the
Issues of all Affairs. Let our Honourable Rulers depend upon
Him, in the management of publick Affairs: Let Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on God, without whom they cannot Instruct the Ignorant
enlighten the Dark, convince the Obstinate, awaken the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Sinners, convert and bring any Souls to Christ, gather
Israel, edify and build up the Faithful in the knowledg &amp; faith
of Gospel Mysteries, and in the Graces and Consolations of
the Spirit. Let Merchants depend on God for prosperous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
and good Success in their Trade and Commerce: Let
Husbandmen depend upon God for their Bread &amp; Livelihood
more than upon their own Labours, and the Fruitfulness of the
Ground. God instructs the Husbandman. <hi>Isai.</hi> 28. 26. and
blesseth his Labours, and can soon blast them, as the experience
of many Years hath sadly taught us. Let Scholars depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God for Learning, more than upon their Books, or Tutors,
or Parts and Industrie, or any other Advantages. Let milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Men learn to depend upon God. <q>
                  <hi>The Lord is a Man of Warr.</hi>
                  <bibl>Exod. 15. 3.</bibl>
               </q> He gives military Skill, and other Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Successes also in their Services and hazardous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
Let us all learn this Lesson, to depend upon the
Lord, that orders out all Successes &amp; Events according to His
Pleasure.</p>
            <p>3. Duely Acknowledge God in all Successes &amp; Events; and in
all Frustrations, &amp; Disappointments.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Acknowledge God in all good Successes and Events, so as
to be Thankful to Him for them.</hi> Whatever your own Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
may be, yet acknowledge God thankfully, as if you had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57349:20"/>
been wholly Insufficient: for your Sufficiencie is of God, and
He could have disappointed notwithstanding. The ground of
our Unthankfulness for all good Issues and Events of Affairs
and Undertakings, is, because we do not see the good Hand of
God dispensing all to us. We make too <hi>little</hi> of God, and too
<hi>much</hi> of our selves; either by thinking we deserve better than
God hath done for us (Hence a proud Heart is never thankful
to God or Man) or by thinking we have done all, or more
than we have done, toward the getting of this or that Mercy.
We put our selves too much in the place of God; as if it were
in our power to make our Endeavours Successful, and to give a
good Effect and Issue to them, according to <hi>our</hi> Desire. We
get up into God's Throne, and usurp upon his Prerogative, and
assume that which is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>liar to Him, when we presume we
can bring any thing to pass, or do any thing successfully in our
Own strength. If we make our selves the only and absolute
<hi>first Causes</hi> of our good Success; no marvel we make our selves
the <hi>last End</hi> also, and deny God the glorie. O do not ascribe
good Success to your own Wit, and Parts, and Policy, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie,
and say, my Nimbleness hath won the Race; my
Conduct and Courage hath won the Battel; my Wisom hath
gotten me this Bread; my Understanding hath heaped up this
Wealth; my Dexteritie, and Skill, and Complaisance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Conversation hath procured me the Favour of Rulers
or People; my Parts or Study hath given me this Learning.

               </q> Let not this be so much as the secret Languge of your
Hearts. Say not, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, </hi>

                  <hi>This is great Babylon,
which I have built,</hi>
               </q> and so derogate from God that works all in

of the Field, and teach you better Manners by some severe
Correction. Do not <q>
                  <hi>Sacrifice to your own Nets, and burn Incense

               </q> but ascribe all to God. There is that deep
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57349:21"/>
Wickedness in the Hearts of Men, that if they get any thing
by any Fraud, and crafty fetches, and overreaching of their
Brethren, in a sinful way, they will be too readie to attribute
<hi>that</hi> to the Providence and Blessing of God, and say, it was
God's Providence that cast it in upon them; when they have
been craftily and sinfully designing it, and bringing it about:
but when they have gotten any thing honestly, by their Wisdom
and Prudence, and Industrie, they are too ready to forget Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and ascribe all to themselves. See the Evil of this,
and remember that no People in the World have greater cause
of Thankfulness than we have to God, who hath governed

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Acknowledge God also in all your Frustrations and
Disappointments, so as to resent his Disposals and Dispensations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you in a</hi> gracious <hi>manner.</hi> We have met with manie
Disappointments in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te Warre, and in other respects. We
should see God in all. When He blasts our <hi>Corn,</hi> defeats our
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> frowns upon our <hi>Merchants,</hi> and we are <hi>disappointed;</hi>
now acknowledge the Hand of God, Ordering <hi>Time,</hi> and
<hi>Chance</hi> according to his Good Pleasure. Justifie God in all,
and bear such Frustrations patientlie. When you have done
your Dutie, be quiet, though the Event doth not answer your
Endeavours, and Hopes. Take heed of quarrelling at <hi>GOD</hi>'s
Disappointments. Do you know VVhom you have to do with?
<q>
                  <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because Thou didst it.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Psal.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9. 9.</bibl>
               </q> If we look at faultie Instruments, or at meer Chance
onely, we shall be apt to murmur. It is the observation of
One, <hi>That the Reason why men are more apt to fly out into Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and Blasphemies for their bad Luck (as they call it) in
those Vnlawful Games of</hi> Cards, and Dice, <hi>than in other Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57349:21"/>
that are governed by Art and Skill, ariseth partly from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature of those Games: because when they have tried their Lot or
Chance over and over, and their Expectation is deceived, they
think that that Power that governs the Lot or Chance, is Adverse
to them. They cannot blame their own Art or Skill, when no Art
can infallibly determine the Event; but curse their bad
Fortune.</hi> And if we look at Disappointments, as our bad <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
and <hi>Chance</hi> onely, looking no further, we shall be apt to
fret and quarrel: but if we do indeed see God ordering our
Lot for us, it may and ought to silence us. When Magistrates
have done their Duty, according to the Law of God, and of
the Country, and endeavoured faithfully to give check &amp; stop
to the Inundation of <hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Heresy;</hi> and yet the bad
Genius of the Times, and degenerous Humour of the People,
and this or that Emergency happens, that frustrates the Success
of their Counsels and Endeavours; truly they may sit down
and mourn indeed; but yet humbly submit to the All dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Providence of God. When Ministers have laboured
faithfully, and yet Israel is not gathered, and their Labours
seem to be in vain, not successful in converting Sinners; they
may weep in secret indeed; but yet patiently bear the Unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfulnes
of their Ministry from the Hand of God. When
Souldiers have shewed themselves valiant, and faithful, and
done what they can; and yet are worsted: They must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God's Hand in it, and that <q>
                  <hi>the Battel is the Lord</hi>'s. <bibl>1 Sam.
17. 47.</bibl>
               </q> who governeth the Warre, and determins the Victory
on what side He pleaseth. All men have <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi>
springing up in the way of their Callings, as well as Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and meet with Difficulties and Crosses there in. Get
the Spirit <hi>David</hi> had 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 26. and so acknowledge
God in every thing, as to submit humbly to his Disposals, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when they are Adverse, and cross to your Desies and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be always Prepared for Disappointments.</hi> Do not
promise your selves Success from the Sufficiency of Second
Causes: God may determine otherwise. We should be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57349:22"/>
and forearmed, that we may not <hi>Xenìzesthai</hi> (1 Pet.
4. 12.) strange at it when it comes to pass, or be dejected and
discouraged. Events are not in the Creatures power. The
Lord sometimes disappoints men of greatest Sufficiency, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules
and controlls their Counsels and Endeavours, and blasts
them strangely. <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> happens to them. If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had stood; though he would not have had the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Events &amp; Successes in his own hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet God would
have determined them for him according to his hearts-desire:
and he should never have been disappointed. But since the
Fall, as no Man hath power to determine Events (which is
God's Prerogative) so it is just with God that every man
should meet with Crosses and Disappointments; and this is
the Fruit of the Curse, under which all natural menly: and
as for the People of God; though they are delivered from the
Curse of the Law, in the <hi>Formality</hi> of it; so that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
them <hi>as a Curse,</hi> how <hi>cross</hi> soever it be: yet they are not
yet absolutely delivered from the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Curse, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Afflictions they meet with, and Death it self. And
indeed it makes sometimes for the glory of God, to disappoint
Men of greatest Abilities. When men do not see and own
God; but attribute Success to the Sufficiency of Instruments,
It's time for God to maintain his own Right (as Dr. <hi>Preston</hi>
speaks) and shew that He gives, or denies Success, according to
His own good Pleasure. God is much seen in Controlling the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest</hi>
Agents, &amp; blasting their Enterprizes; yea more, many times,
than in backing them, &amp; blessing their Endeavours in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Course of Providence. Herein the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God is much
seen. It is best, sometimetimes, it should be so, with respect
to God's Int'rest and Glory. His <hi>Power</hi> also appears in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Check to the Ablest Instruments, and turning all their
Designs another way than they Intended. His <hi>Mercy</hi> also
to his People, is seen herein; for it is best for them, in some
Cases, to be defeated and disappointed. His <hi>Iustice</hi> also
appears herein, in his correcting and punishing the Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57349:22"/>
sinful Creature with unexpected Disappointments.
So that it is our Wisdom, tolook for Changes and Chances,
some Occurrents and Emergencies that may blast our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
that Faith and Prayer may be kept a going, and lest
if such Frustrations befall us unexpectedly, we either fly out
against God, or faint and sink in Discouragements. At the
first going out of our Forces, in the beginning of the Warre,
what great Apprehensions were there of speedy Success and
ending of the Warre; that it was but going and Appearing,
and the Enemy would be faced down: As if the first News
from our Souldiers should be, <hi>Venimus, Vidimus, Vicimus.</hi>
And several times after, great probability of concluding that
unhappy War; and yet all disappointed, contrary to Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
VVhen there is therefore greatest Probability of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
yet remember there may be Disappointment; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for it, that you may not be surprised thereby. This may
be good Counsel to men of projecting Heads, that are wont
to be very confident that they see their way farre before them:
but they do not know what <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> may happen:
This may check the Confidence of Man, and teach us not to
promise our selves great Things, or build upon this or that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
or Enjoyment for time to come. Labour to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and provided for Disappointments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <q>
                  <hi>Fear God, and Keep His Commandments.</hi> This
is the Conclusion of the whole matter (faith <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
                  <bibl>Eccl.
12. 13.</bibl>)</q> the Conclusion of the Book, and may be very well
drawn from the words of my Text in special, and shall be the
Conclusion of my Discourse upon it, <q>
                  <hi>Fear God, and Keep His
Commandments.</hi>
               </q> Oh! Fear God, that is the Lord of <hi>Time,</hi>
and Governour of <hi>Chance,</hi> and Dispenser of all <hi>Events</hi> and
<hi>Issues;</hi> and be sure to please Him in a Course of Evangelical
Obedience. God hath the Care of <hi>Events,</hi> and we must
leave that to Him: but our Care must be to do our <hi>Duty.</hi> And
<q>
                  <hi>To Fear God, and Keep His Commands, in the whole Duty of Man.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>VVho would not fear Thee, O king of Nations? <bibl>
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 7.</bibl>

The Lord governs Nations and Kingdoms, all the Affairs
and Enterprizes of the Sons of Men: All their Lives, and
Souls, and Estates, and VVays are in His Hand: And He
can dispose of them, not onely for present, but for Eternity, as
He pleases. All the Events that be fall them, are ordered and
governed by Him. Therefore be in the Fear of the Lord all
the day long, and walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
If your ways please God, your Enemies shall be at peace
with you, or do you no hurt, if they would; but good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no. Obedience is the best way to Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9. The Lord takes Pleasure in the Prosperity of
his Servants, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 27. This was God's Promise to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,</hi>
Josh. 1. 8. While you are with God, God will be with
you. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. and then you shall have Things prosper
under your hands, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 23. Every thing shall befriend
you. Whilst <hi>Solomon</hi> trode in the Steps of his Father, and
walked in the Law of God; and neither practised <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
nor gave any Countenance, or Allowance, or Toleration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>There was no Adversary, nor evil Occurrent,</hi> or <hi>Chance:</hi>
for it is the same word with that in my Text: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 4.
When he forsook the Law of God, the Lord stirred up many
Adversaries against him. While he was with God, his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
prospered, and were attended with good Success and a
Blessing. So it was with Reforming <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 King. 18. 5,
6, 7. 2 <q>
                  <hi>Chron. 31. 20, 21. He trusted in the Lord God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
so that after him was none like him among all the Kings of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
nor</hi> any <hi>that were before him: For he clave to the Lord,</hi> and
<hi>departed not from following Him; but kept his Commandments
which the Lord commanded Moses. And the Lord was with him,</hi>
and he <hi>PROSPERED whithersoever he went forth:</hi> &amp;c.</q>Otherwise, how should men expect to Prosper? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.
20.—<hi>Why transgress ye the Commandments of the Lord, that ye
cannot</hi> Prosper? <hi>because ye have forsaken the Lord, He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
forsaken you.</hi> We find generally that when Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
walked in God's Law, and kept in with Him, their Affairs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57349:23"/>
prospered marvellously: when they departed from God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
prospered with them; unless it were to their hardening,
and Ruine. And the Lord keeps the same Tenour of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
(for the Substance) unto this day. Oh therefore!
Let us all account it our best <hi>Policy,</hi> as it is our <hi>Duty,</hi> to please
God, that hath the absolute Disposal of us, and all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
And let it be the Care of our military Men, that they
do not make Days of <hi>Training,</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> for Warre
and real Service, Days of <hi>Provocation</hi> to God. Please God,
if you would engage Him on your Side, to govern <hi>Time</hi> and
<hi>Chance</hi> to your Advantage. Take heed of making God your
Enemy in the days of your Peace and of such Solemnities, by
spending them away Idly and Unprofitably, by any unworthy
Behaviour; by Intemperance, by excessive Drinking (a Sin
grown too much in Fashion with the Generation that is risen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up;
I wish I might not say, with many loose Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)
by idle, rotten, unsavoury Communication, or by any
other way of Debauchery, and Provocation: so as to disarm
your selves, to make you naked, to lay you open to the Stroke
of Divine Vengeance, and to render you Unprosperous and
Unhappie men in all your Undertakings. It is a Shame and
a Grief to think how such Days as these are many times spent
to the Dishonour of God, and the unspeakable Prejudice of
the Souls of Men; as well as other Daies of Solemnitie on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accounts. I beseech you, look to your selves, and do
not make Warre upon God this Day, nor <q>
                  <hi>run upon the thick
Bosses of His Bucklers,</hi> 
                  <bibl>Job. 15. 25, 26.</bibl>
               </q> Do not dishonour
and displease Christ, that is God the Father's Viceroy in the
World, and governs all Affairs. If you cross Him, and (to
speak after the manner of Men) disappoint Him of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
concerning you (as the Lord hath great Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of such a People, so Circumstanced) He will have his
Time to meet with you, and to cross you in your Designs,
and to give you Shame, and Disappointment. I delight not
in any pedantick, insipid, trifling Allusions, below the Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Conversation. He was no Glutton, no Wine-bibber, no
loose and vain Companion of Sinners; though blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged with it by his malignant Enemies. He was the
greatest <hi>E X A M P L E</hi> that ever was, or will be in the
World, of Sobriety, of Gravity, of Seriousness and Diligence
in his work, of prudent and prosperous Management of his
Affairs (<hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 13.) of savoury, gracious Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and holy Conversation. Learn of Him, and follow His
Example, and you shall be Prosperous Men indeed: Yea,
let us all take this Counsel and Course. <hi>New England</hi> hath
Enemies enough on Earth, and in Hell: wo to us if we make
God in Heaven our Enemy also. <hi>The Lord help us to fear
Him, &amp; keep His Commandments, and then we need not be afraid
of evil Tidings, or solicitous about Events and Issues of Things:
For all the Paths of the Lord shall be Mercy and Truth to us, and
Goodness and Mercy shall follow us all our Days: and this we know,
that it shall be well with them that fear God.</hi>
