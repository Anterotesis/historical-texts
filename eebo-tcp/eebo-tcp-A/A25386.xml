            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I <hi>Need not tell you, Gentlemen, how many and how reſtleſs Endeavours have been uſed by the Enemies of our dear</hi> Country <hi>and dearer</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>to deſtroy both ever ſince the</hi> Reformation. <hi>You cannot but remember with due regret and concern, what deep Deſigns have been frequently laid for this Purpoſe, within the reach of your own</hi> Obſervations,
<pb facs="tcp:96003:3"/>
               <hi>(not to look back to King</hi> James <hi>the Firſt, or Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>of bleſſed and</hi> eternal memory.) <hi>Nor are you, I am confident, of ſo eaſie and implicit a Faith, as to be perſwaded by all the popular</hi> Harangues <hi>in the World to contradict your own ſenſes: And indeed, they only may inform us how much we have hitherto been the</hi> Care of Heaven, <hi>and what need there was of our being ſo, ſince we have taken ſo little of our ſelves, but with a ſort of</hi> Stupidity, <hi>which looks like</hi> Incantation, <hi>for the moſt part ſate tame and quiet, Expectants when the hanging Sword would drop on our Heads, which ſo ſlender a Thread as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view only ſupported; though we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was an</hi> Arm within the Clouds, <hi>which would not ſuffer it to wound any further than its</hi> Commiſſion: <hi>For indeed, what elſe has hitherto preſerved us under the two laſt and the preſent Reign? For whether the Throne has been filled by an open</hi> Papiſt, <hi>or a pretended</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>or one who is</hi> really <hi>ſuch: One thing is certain, that</hi> Popery, <hi>with its infeparable Companion, has been all along ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to get uppermoſt, and like a true</hi> Politician, <hi>was indeed neareſt the obtaining its deſire, when it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fartheſt from it. The</hi> Popiſh Plot <hi>in King</hi> Charles<hi>'s Reign, although it obtain not its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Deſign, yet in the Effects thereof, went a great</hi> length <hi>towards our ruine, like Gunpowder in a</hi> Vault, <hi>doing incomparably the more miſchief by being</hi> ſtifled. <hi>All know what an odd</hi> Branch <hi>was grafted upon it, and how unnatural a</hi> Fruit <hi>it bore; the</hi> Jugglers, <hi>who managed that</hi> Show, <hi>pretending to change</hi> Papiſt <hi>into</hi> Presbyterian: <hi>Juſt as effectual a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle as their turning</hi> Bread <hi>into</hi> Fleſh, <hi>while 'tis</hi> Bread <hi>ſtill. However, this is more certain, That</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96003:3"/>
               <hi>they went on ſo fairly, as to</hi> Juggle <hi>one King ('tis more than probable) out of his</hi> Life, <hi>and the other out of his</hi> Throne; <hi>for indeed he was little better than ſpirited away by the</hi> Kidnapping <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuites, the Merchandiſe of</hi> Rome <hi>being ſometimes the Bodies, as well as the Souls of Men. And one would have thought a</hi> fair riddance <hi>there had been now made for good and all, the vacant Throne being filled by the Conſent and Applauſes of all goodmen, with two Proteſtant Princes, whoſe actions as well as words have declared them as true</hi> Defenders of the Faith, <hi>as of the</hi> undoubted Rights <hi>and</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>of their Kingdoms. But neither muſt theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſit in quiet, like the ancient</hi> Heroes, <hi>they ſeem born for</hi> Troubles, <hi>and made on purpoſe to wade through</hi> Danger <hi>and</hi> Honour. <hi>And were their Enemies and the Proteſtant Religion's (whoſe Life and very Being ſeems very much bound up in Theirs) but all before 'em; Were there no danger but from the</hi> Sword <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>or the late King's</hi> Valour, <hi>there would not be ſo much reaſon for our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and concern.

            <p>Whoever were behind the <hi>Scenes</hi> in this Plot, we are certain enough who were publickly engaged in it, and the main <hi>Go-betweens</hi> and <hi>Agitat<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhton</hi> had been employ'd formerly by Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>W—,</hi> before the late King's abdication, and had married one Mr. <hi>Rigby</hi>'s Daughter, but whether or no embark'd in the ſame deſign, time may diſcover.</p>

He has been generally thought a Man of <hi>Courage,</hi> and if he appear'd to ſome more <hi>dejected</hi> than was uſual at the time of his <hi>Tryal,</hi> 'twas no great wonder when he found all his fine work unravel'd, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> ruin'd beyond a poſſibility of recovery, and his own Life at the mercy of offended Law, and injur'd Juſtice. After all, it muſt be own'd he is a great <hi>Maſter of addreſs,</hi> and his words are ſo charming, his motions ſo graceful, that a fitter perſon cou'd hardly be found out, or even
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96003:6"/>
made on purpoſe to bewitch Men from their duty and Alegience, and for my part I rather wonder ſuch a man as he, has not made <hi>more Proſelites</hi> to his Maſters In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, than that he has made <hi>ſo many.</hi> And if at his <hi>Tryal</hi> he ſhow'd not ſo great a <hi>Strength of mind</hi> as may have appear'd in other parts of his Life, I believe we may blame his <hi>Ingenuity</hi> for it, it being probable that one who knew himſelf ſo deeply and <hi>palpably guilty</hi> could hardly have <hi>Face</hi> enough to inſiſt much upon his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Add to this, that he's a reputed <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and had been formerly Embaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> from the King of <hi>England.</hi> The other <hi>two,</hi> being but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Wheels,</hi> to this great Mover, will not deſerve ſo much time, or notice, in this ſhort Paper, nor are ſo loaden with Commendations as we find he is in almoſt all the Letters, made publick at the <hi>Tryal</hi> from the Heads of the <hi>Party,</hi> nor are they of ſo fair a <hi>Character</hi> as his Lordſhip has had given him. For theſe yet <hi>behind the Curtain,</hi> time may draw it aſide and diſcover 'em, nor can any one think, that a deſign of this <hi>Nature and Extent,</hi> had only three or four Perſons imbarkt therein. Thus much therefore muſt for the preſent ſatisfie for the <hi>Characters</hi> of the chief Managers of this <hi>Conſpiracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> thereof, it can appear from nothing better, or clearer than the Original <hi>Papers and Letters</hi> of the very <hi>Conſpirators</hi> and Managers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own Hand-Writing. And indeed there need no <hi>Colours</hi> to heighten or advance it.—The <hi>Devil</hi> is ugly enough of himſelf, cou'd the <hi>Painter</hi> deſcribe him like what he really is, nor needs the addition of <hi>Tail</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96003:6"/>
and <hi>Horns</hi> to make him more terrible. The Truth is, 'twas a <hi>Home-ſtroak,</hi> and there wanted no good will, either in the deſign or management. <q>'Twas neither leſs nor more, than the overthrowing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Depoſing,</hi> if not <hi>Murthering</hi> Their Majeſties, <hi>Whom God long preſerve, to the Confuſion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> bringing in an Army of <hi>French</hi> and Strangers, and joyning them on their Invaſion, after having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the Strength and Condition of the Nation to them, and given an exact Account of our Fleet and Forts, laying Deſigns for the Deſtruction of both, and taking a particular and remarkable care to <hi>plague London.—</hi>
               </q>Which Favour the Honeſt <hi>Citizens</hi> can't be forgetful of, and ſome here at home of another Character, one would almoſt think had been aiming at, a little before the Plot was ripened.</p>
            <p>This in general—More particularly the <hi>Scene</hi> was laid as deep and as ſubtily as <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it (though the Traytors concern'd, will be apt to ſay here, as well as in the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon, 'Twas the Devil who diſcover'd it)</hi> to deſtroy in a few Weeks, or Months, all that which has been ſo long and ſo firmly <hi>building,</hi> by the wonderful <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and the united <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> of the Nation at the expence of ſo much <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> as it has already coſt us. Here at home it appears to have been carry'd on ever ſince, and before the <hi>Bravado</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> on our Coaſts the laſt Summer; for ſome of the Letters taken, mightily lament the <hi>diſappointment</hi> they met with at that time, and aſſure the Enemies of our Country, that

'twas for want of no <hi>good will, but only a handſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they lent not their utmoſt aſſiſtance to deſtroy it—</hi>But you wou'd not have Men Rebel when they can't do't, and joyn the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> or <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> when faſt in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> However they ſaved <hi>their Stakes,</hi> and by this time it ſeems were got <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dy for another <hi>Game,</hi> their only trouble being (as they expreſs it) that their <hi>Confinements</hi> had retarded the Affair, but promiſing with double vigour to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it as ſoon as diſcharged of their Impriſonment, and recover the ground which they had thereby loſt.</p>
            <p>But one grand Obſtacle, it ſeems, the Plotters met with in the proſecution of their Deſigns. They knew very well the Mortal and Unchangeable <hi>Averſion</hi> rooted in the very Souls of the generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation, and which they lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at leaſt, never the better for what knowledge they had thereof, during the ſhort <hi>viſit</hi> it lately made us: Accordingly they could not but imagine this would be a <hi>terrible Obſtacle</hi> to their deſign of <hi>reinſtating</hi> the late King <hi>James</hi> in his Throne, whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think much better or truer for having been ſo long under the <hi>French</hi> King's <hi>Pupillage,</hi> nor could believe it ſo much as poſſible, that he ſhould return without the deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> not only in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but very probably throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> This <hi>Objection,</hi> which lay ſo full againſt the very <hi>center</hi> of their deſign, they found it neceſſary to obviate e're they could proceed one ſtep further; and though all the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96003:7"/>
World elſe thinks it impoſſible that King <hi>James</hi> ſhou'd ſhould ever now return without Popery at his Heels, the <hi>Agitatars</hi> of this deſign undertake to prove it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible—which was all it ſeems they would ſo much as pretend to; tho with what Reaſon, or to what end, I can't imagine, only the cauſe would bear no more, ſcarcely that it ſelf; for tho we believe 'tis poſſible, and barely ſo, for a Man to leap over the Bridg and not be drowned, or Tumble from a <hi>precipiece</hi> and not be Cruſhed to Pieces, (of both which we have Inſtances) yet none but a <hi>Mad-Man</hi> wou'd offer to repeat the <hi>Experiment,</hi> in hopes of the ſame <hi>Event.</hi> But that the <hi>Villany</hi> might proceed <hi>Methodically,</hi> they had a formal <hi>Conſult,</hi> and <hi>Conference</hi> between divers Lords and Gentlemen: <hi>Tories as well as Whiggs</hi> (thoſe are the words of the Paper which gives an Account thereof; Seized among others in <hi>Aſhtons</hi> Boſom) wherein it was Actually prov'd; <hi>poſſible</hi> that he might return without any <hi>Injury to the Proteſtant Religion.—</hi>And wherein were ſeveral fine <hi>Chimeras</hi> propoſed, which had King <hi>James</hi> Conquer'd the Country, and Recover'd His Throne by the <hi>French</hi> Arms, would have ſignified juſt as much as his Promiſe at his firſt coming to the Crown, and his Oath at the Coronation, to protect the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as then Eſtabliſh'd, in Church and State.—But now, they tell ye, he had bit upon the Bridle, and known the ſmart on't, and if he ever came back agen, he had learnt more wit, then to take ſuch evil Courſes as had formerly Broke and Ruin'd him, Yes undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as much as any <hi>Highway-Man</hi> or <hi>Murderer</hi> Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96003:8"/>
during his happy Reign, wou'd leave the Road, or Cutting-Throats, for having been once in ſight of the Gallows. One wou'd think the former <hi>Jaunt</hi> of almoſt Twenty Years long, had been enough to have taught ſome Perſons <hi>Wit and Honeſty;</hi> if ever they wou'd have been capable of either: Or at leaſt, that the ſound <hi>Ruffle</hi> they met with from the People of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the <hi>Throne,</hi> ſhould have taught 'em, when fix'd in it, how to behave themſelves there, and what <hi>Meaſures</hi> to uſe with a Nation; who, tho 'tis not an eaſie matter to anger 'em, when once they are ſo, never <hi>Bite</hi> but their <hi>Teeth</hi> meet; and tho you cut their Heads off, won't let go their hold. There's a Proverb of a certain King, a <hi>little wiſer</hi> then him we are diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, which may be with Truth and Manners enough apply'd—at leaſt to ſome of his Old <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and thoſe inſeparable Friends, who will to he ſure alwaies have his <hi>Ears</hi> and <hi>Heart—Bray a Fool in a Morter, yet he won't depart from his Folly:</hi> Which was one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Objection, which I doubt, thoſe Men of <hi>Projects,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> forgot to anſwer at this Conference; tho it ſeems, ſeveral there preſent, who pretended great Zeal for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> (and without doubt, much according to knowledge) went away as intirely ſatisfied in the point in Controverſie, as one who has never made any experiment of Matter of Fact, is with ſome fine Hypotheſis of mounting to the World in the Moon, in a Chariot of <hi>Ganza's.</hi> In the mean while they muſt give other Men leave to <hi>doubt</hi> of what they were pleas'd to be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with, ſo long at leaſt till
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96003:8"/>
they can produce one Inſtance of a Bigotted <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> who kept his word with his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, longer then his <hi>Intereſt</hi> perſuaded him to obſerve it; or he wanted <hi>Power</hi> to break it. However, ſo much we may learn by the <hi>Title</hi> of the Conferrence before mentioned: that it is not being of one Party, or t'other, makes a Man <hi>Honeſt:</hi> That Loyalty is not Ty'd up to one ſide or Intereſt. That there are Traytors of both ſides; and that all thoſe who love the Government, ought heartily to agree in their Defence of it, tho they differ in their Sentiments, as to other things, unleſs they'd have both that and their ſelves Ruin'd by the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Conſult,</hi> we may believe they puſh'd on more vigorouſly than formerly, and have brought things to <hi>bear</hi> ſo well, that in their ſeveral Letters of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Correſpondence, they reſt almoſt ſecured of <hi>Succeſs;</hi> provided, they might be but powerfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the <hi>French,</hi> in that <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>time</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and had drawn up in a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the whole. And if they did their part, and a certain <hi>Perſon</hi> eaſie enough to be gueſt at, did but appear in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> (as they expreſs it in one of their Cants) they doubted not but <hi>before next</hi> Eaſter Term, <hi>the Cauſes would come to a Final Hearing.</hi> That is before that time, we had been all involved in <hi>Blood and Confuſion,</hi> and as miſerable as theſe Plotters and their Maſters cou'd make us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96003:9"/>
To that end, <hi>Exact Liſts</hi> were ſent of all our <hi>Naval preparations,</hi> what Ships in Repair, and what not, from the Firſt, to Sixth Rates, not omitting ſo much as the very <hi>Yatchts</hi> and <hi>Tenders.</hi> So that an Account alſo added of ſuch <hi>Commanders</hi> as were moſt likely to be drawn to the <hi>French Intereſt—</hi>So that we need now no longer puzzle our ſelves to gueſs which way ſo many <hi>French-Piſtols</hi> creep in among us; (Twenty Four of which, have within this few days been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in no larger a Sum then Forty Pound.) And yet more Villanous; <hi>Directions</hi> were prepared for the <hi>French Fleet,</hi> how, and where to <hi>Fight,</hi> and deſtroy Oars, their <hi>Numbers</hi> proportion'd, and the <hi>Time</hi> of their ſetting out, and appearing upon our Coaſt at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt in <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Dutch Fleet</hi> and Ours from <hi>Joyning.</hi> They were to <hi>look to Spithead</hi> in their way, <hi>Burn the Shipping</hi> there, and take the <hi>Town.</hi> To which end, a moſt <hi>Exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covnt</hi> was drawn up for them of all the <hi>Force</hi> in <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> The State of the different <hi>Forts,</hi> as <hi>South-Sea, Trevanion,</hi> &amp;c. As the <hi>Number</hi> of Men in Garriſon, and the Facility of putting a deſign of that Nature in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. <hi>London,</hi> to be ſure, among the reſt, is never to be forgotten Nothing is to be done till thoſe proud <hi>Citizens</hi> be humbled<hi>—Carthago eſt delenda—</hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that, or that will Deſtroy <hi>Rome</hi> or at leaſt till things are Ripe enough, and the <hi>Rebellion</hi> ſtrong enough, let <hi>French</hi> Ships alwaies lie ready on purpoſe to <hi>Plague</hi> it, as if their <hi>Fire</hi> had not been enough before.</p>

But they knew what would be moſt acceptable to the Perſon who employ'd them, who whilſt he remain'd at Helm, was ſo true a <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> who always ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lov'd the City, and between which and him there was ſo little Love ever loſt. Further if it ſhould come to a Battle, the very place was agreed on where they ſhould fight the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not ſo high as laſt Summer, near the <hi>Beachy,</hi> but rather in the Chaps of the Channel. And all this with the landing of the <hi>French,</hi> and the publick defection of his Traytors at home, who were immediately to come in to their aſſiſtance, to be put in Execution as ſoon as poſſible after the departure of the King for <hi>Holland,</hi> a Proclamation being prepared (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with as much as <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Declaration for diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament) to the ſame effect with what was diſcours'd in the Conſult before mentioned, ſetting all the Varniſh poſſible on the Cauſe; the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be as ſurely eſtabliſhed and defended as it was before, they only to have the Government, and all the poor harmleſs Catholicks to be left to nothing but their Devotions. The <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> and Prerogative to be left where it was before that Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; all Perſons being alſo required to come under the <hi>French</hi> Standard, and <hi>turn Traytors</hi> by ſuch a day, on pain of being uſed as if they were ſo. In order to effect which Deſigns, and carry on a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Enemies of the Nation, ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

               <hi>Cants</hi> being invented, under which to cover their Treaſonable Practices. Some of the Letters were writ on pretence of Trade; adviſing their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents by all means to chuſe ſuch Factors as were bold and Induſtrious, to fix probable ends, and chuſe fit means to bring them to an iſſue, which they added, was the life of Trade as well as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Above all, to be quick and expeditious as poſſible in their Reſolutions and Actions, the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now open, whereas a few Months hence 'twould be very dangerous ſailing.

            </p>
            <p>Others related to a Law-Suit, as has been already mentioned; ſome were Letters of Civility and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as from one acquaintance to another, aſſuing them that their Elder Brother and moſt of their Family were their true Friends, and would continue ſo; enquiring for their little Daughter, whom tho' they had not yet ſeen, they had heard deſcribed very pretty and Witty.

            <p>Beſides theſe they had ſeveral Characte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s and Keys affixed to them, the more covertly to carry on the main buſineſs; one wherein all the Letters of the Alphabet were made uſe of to ſignifie Perſons and things, one Letter ſtanding for the <hi>K</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>

But this was obſervable in moſt of their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that although they began with ſome of thoſe ſorts of Cants already mentioned, and carried on the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour pretty well, yet before the Concluſion, they uſed generally ſuch high and profound expreſſions of reſpect and veneration as could agree to none with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon propriety of Speech, but thoſe of the firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſuch as they thought their Soveraigns. One good Man being ſo zealous in the Cauſe, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt he could venture his hopes of Heaven upon it, or an expreſſion little below it, if not the very ſame.

the mean time it ſeems all the <hi>Luidores</hi> yet receiv'd are not ſufficient: Money is the Life of the Cauſe all the World over, which the Jacobites want as well as we, and thoſe Horſe-leeches ſtill cry, Give, Give, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ever ſatisfied. Poor King <hi>James,</hi> muſt he pay Penſions ſtill when he himſelf is but a Penſioner?

have dreamt of a Plot in't, any more than the laſt time, or that they came for any thing elſe but to fiſh for a few Herrings on our Coaſt, or make fine Lines acroſs the Channel in a Sunſhiny day?</p>
            <p>And here I ſhould have cloſed the account of this curſed Deſign, had not a new and ſtrange accident given us new confirmations thereof. No longer ſince than the laſt Week, were taken two Gentlemen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhore from <hi>France</hi> in a ſmall Sloop near <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Suſſex—</hi>Sir. <hi>R. P.</hi> who by the greatneſs of his Genius, and meer ſtrength of his own natnral Reaſon (both of 'em as weighty Motives as the Jeſuits Arguments) left the Proteſtant Religion for the Roman, in the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> and would fain have had his Children Educated the ſame way, had not their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and prudent Mother placed them out of his reach. The other Collonel M. and old experienced Officer: Both going to a great Papiſts Houſe in thoſe parts, One of theſe a Man of Intereſt and Money, might have done excellently well, lying there <hi>Perdue</hi> till the Plot had ripen'd; then to have rais'd Forces for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the deſign; and the other of more Brains and Experience, when rais'd to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. With theſe were found ſeveral Letters of dangerous conſequence, which it's ſaid, confirm exactly what has been formerly diſcover'd. And here we are like to meet with ſomething of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, tho' not much Wit, and the having been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96003:12"/>
with King <hi>James</hi> at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> (or rather running away with him there,) actually and publickly acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>It may be worth alſo to remark the ſubtle ways the Conſpirators took to prevent Diſcovery. They indeed did almoſt as much as Men cou'd do, who had no mind to be hang'd, to keep themſelves ſafe, and had provided againſt every thing but Providence. Here at <hi>Land</hi> they made uſe of Iron-heels, opening and ſhutting with a ſort of a Spring, to be cover'd with Leather, and worn in a Shoe, wherein to conceal their Treaſonable Letters and Papers. But theſe too, were diſcover'd as well as the Perſon who made 'em, who lately was ſeiz'd, and in cuſtody for the ſame. What they did at Sea to the ſame end and purpoſe, was very ſtrangely render'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and prov'd only a ſtrong preſumption againſt 'em.</p>
            <p>And from hence 'twill be an eaſy Tranſition to the wonderful Diſcovery of this ſo deep and well-laid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. In which, perhaps there may be ſome paſſages not yet ripe for publick notice. What has yet appear'd on the open Stage in relation to this great Affair, is to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After the Scene had been laid, and the Scheme of their Deſign'd fix'd as above-mention'd, and the Aſſurances and Proteſtations of the moſt confiderable Perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in engaged, given under their own hands to be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt 'em; My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and his two other Accomplices, Major <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Elliott,</hi> &amp;c. prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96003:12"/>
for <hi>France,</hi> with an account of the whole Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. In order whereunto, a Veſſel was to be hired to convey them to <hi>France,</hi> and one being found ſit for the purpoſe, the Maſter was to be bargain'd with for the price; who at the firſt meeting, wherein he engaged ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tranſport em thither, demanded 200 <hi>l.</hi> for his reward: At the ſecond Meeting, he fell to 100 l. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Elliott,</hi> agreeing with him for the ſame; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be depoſited in Mrs. <hi>Burdet</hi>'s hand till the Service ſhould be performed; accordingly 93 Guinea's and a 6 <hi>d.</hi> were paid in, the odd ſix pence being broke, and one piece left with Mrs. <hi>Burdet,</hi> the other Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had with him, which he was to deliver to the Maſter of the Ship as ſoon as ever he had landed his Paſſengers at any Port in <hi>France,</hi> and on his return and bringing that piece to Mr. <hi>Burdet,</hi> on the application and agreement thereof with the other piece in her cuſtody, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to receive the Hundred pounds. According to this Agreement, the Maſter prepared his Smack for the Voyage, and all things being ready, they came to <hi>Surry-ſtairs</hi> late in the Evening, to avoid ſuſpicion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Sculler, with whom theſe 3, the Skipper and my Lords Man row'd <hi>Through-Bridge</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt it near <hi>Pickle-herring-Stairs,</hi> went aboard the <hi>Smack</hi> there provided. But the weather being cold, the Water-man, as is uſual, lent them his Coats to keep them warm, which it being late, and he in haſte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as well as they to get rid of him, were there forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96003:13"/>
and on his recollecting himſelf, and returning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, on which he was forc'd to go home without them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Veſſel went down the River, as faſt as Wind and Tide cou'd carry it, and ſoon came to <hi>Long-Reach,</hi> where then lay the <hi>George-Frigat</hi> at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, of whom my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> had ſome apprehenſions, and therefore deſired the Maſter to hide them till they paſt that danger, which he did under the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatches on the Ballaſt, whence they return'd above-Deck, when out of ſight of the Frigat. But at the Block-houſes at <hi>Graves-End,</hi> my Lord was again for hiding, and accordingly retired to his old hole; a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace being juſt coming aboard them, which the Maſter thought was only come to Preſs, as Captain <hi>Billop</hi> who was in her, pretended all his buſineſs there was, who coming aboard with a Preſs-Warrant, humoured the buſineſs exactly, and askt the Maſter if he had any Men aboard? He reply'd, he had a Protection, which he produced: The Captain tells him he was ſorry for it, but muſt look further; and going into the Hold, found my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and the other two a top of the Ballaſt, whom he immediately ſearch'd for Papers, whilſt one of the Sea-men who came with him diſcover'd <hi>Mr. Aſhton</hi> thruſting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what into his Boſom, of which he immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Captain, who queſtioning him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96003:13"/>
               <hi>Aſhton</hi> with <hi>Preſence of Mind</hi> enough replyed, 'twas only his Handkerchief, which he immediately pull'd out of his <hi>Boſom;</hi> but the Captain not thinking fit to truſt him, clapt his Hand after, and found ſomething much more valuable, to wit, that famous Packet of Letters which did all their buſineſſes, with a ſmall leaden <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> fix'd with a Packthred, ſufficient to have ſunk it deep enough for ever <hi>telling Tales</hi> agen; which way they would ſoon have ſent it, had not their Fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd 'em to a place where it was impoſſible for them to put a thing of that Nature in execution. But there were yet found further Evidences againſt them; for exactly in the <hi>ſame place</hi> whence theſe Papers were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by <hi>Aſhton,</hi> the ſame Seaman who diſcovered him doing it, obſerved ſomething elſe lying on the Ballaſt, which proved a couple of <hi>Seals,</hi> both my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s; one the <hi>Seal of his Office,</hi> as Secretary of State to King <hi>James,</hi> the other his <hi>own Coat of Arms;</hi> both which he deliver'd to his Captain; obſerving at the ſame time my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> in great Confuſion, pale and <hi>trembling,</hi> and ſcarce able to ſpeak a Word. However my Lord and the others treated the Captain with a great deal of Complaiſance and Reſpect, deſiring him to go aſhore with them for ſome <hi>Refreſhment,</hi> who not judging that ſo convenient, yet civilly proffer'd to accompany them for that end aboard the <hi>George Frigat,</hi> which lay in their way to <hi>London</hi> (and of which they had now no reaſon any longer to be afraid.) But finding all thoſe Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges render'd ineffectual by the prudence of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they reſolve to attack him on the two other ſides, on one of which moſt of Mankind lies open, with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Profit and Honour, offering him ſome <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Guinea's</hi> only to <hi>Diſpoſe of thoſe Papers</hi> he had taken, which he might eaſily do, without giving any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96003:14"/>
ſuſpicion to thoſe about him, my Lord having another <hi>Parcel</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> of leſs concern, to which they might fix the Plummet that was on the others, and eaſily make 'em paſs for thoſe he had firſt taken: Adding further, That 'twould be a <hi>gen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us thing for the Captain to go along with them.</hi> But none of all this prevailed, he ſtill continued faithful to his Truſt, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; and the Pinnace bruſh'd away roundly towards <hi>London,</hi> which <hi>Elliot</hi> obſerving, ſwore they row'd as if they were carrying them all to <hi>Priſon.</hi> And when they came under the <hi>Bridge,</hi> wiſh'd heartily 'twould fall down and cruſh 'em all to the bottom—But 'twas the ſame thing, the Bridg was as <hi>ſtubborn</hi> as the Captain was before, and ſtood ſtill in the ſame place where it has been this two or three hundred year, while the Pinnaces were tugg'd luſtily, and ſoon brought their <hi>Fare</hi> to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> where, juſt as they were ſtepping out of the Boat, my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> clapt ſome Mony into the Hands of two of the <hi>Smack's</hi> Men, who were brought up with them, bidding 'em when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, ſay, That the Ship was <hi>bound for</hi> Flanders, <hi>not for</hi> France.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were they landed here, but Captain <hi>Billop</hi> waited on my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> with the Packet, which he had ſeiz'd, which he having open'd and look'd over, deliver'd all of 'em to the Captain again, who carried them to the Lord Preſident the Marqueſs of <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> who alſo opening and marking 'em, carry'd 'em to the King, after which my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> had them in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, wherein appearing Treaſon enough to have hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Plotters in <hi>England,</hi> my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was ſent back to the <hi>place from whence he came</hi> ſo lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the other two likewiſe committed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:96003:14"/>
'Twas not long after this, before they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their Tryal was coming on, and time given 'em accordingly to prepare for the ſame. The <hi>Bill was found</hi> againſt 'em with little heſitation on <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, January 15th,</hi> and the next day they were <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned</hi> at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> my Lord's Petition to have the Tryal <hi>put off till Monday</hi> not being granted him. For indeed 'twas already more than time to let the Enemies of the Government know, that it <hi>could be angry,</hi> and dared both bring 'em to Juſtice for their Treaſons, and puniſh 'em for the ſame. Beſides, <hi>Delays</hi> in this caſe might on many accounts be dangerous, and would ſerve only to encourage the <hi>Accomplices</hi> of theſe Traytors, and diſhearten the true <hi>Friends</hi> of the King and Kingdom. On his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> inſiſted on his fruitleſs Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, (he being only a Knight in <hi>England,</hi> though a Viſcount in <hi>Scotland)</hi> which had been prejudged in an higher place, the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> having before thrown it out, and which there was no great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood ſhould ever be allowed him, ſince his <hi>Patent</hi> was dated at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> after King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication;</hi> and had it been allowed for good here, 'tis certain, thoſe who had done it could not have cleared themſelves from ſuch conſequences as would have been moſt pernicious and invideous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Nation.—However this took up ſome time, and about an hour or two's Argument was employed therein, but after all, it was <hi>over-ruled</hi> by the Bench, as any one would eaſily gueſs it could be no otherwiſe. He moved alſo for a Copy of his <hi>Indictment,</hi> and brought <hi>Preſidents,</hi> but thoſe were <hi>anſwered,</hi> and his Requeſt not granted, but a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96003:15"/>
Copy of the Pannel he had according to cuſtom. The next day being the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>January Ann. Dom.</hi> 1691. he came to his Tryal, at which was a vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of all degrees preſent, particularly, beſides the Lords Chief Juſtices, and their Brethren, ſeveral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords of the <hi>Garter,</hi> ſeveral Lords of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt honourable <hi>Privy-Council</hi> and others, my Lord Preſident, Lord <hi>Sidny,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here I would not be miſtaken in what ſhort <hi>Reflections</hi> I intend to make on the Tryals of the petſons then accuſed and now convicted of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, as if my Intent were to foreſtal the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Accounts which will ſhortly be given of the ſame. Were this an Age like ſuch as we have ſeen which would not bear <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Tryals ſuch as wou'd force any one who ſaw or read 'em to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how ſo many <hi>Mad-men</hi> broke out of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and got poſſeſſion of the <hi>Bench;</hi> and accordingly had we no expectation of a true Account of matter of Fact, then indeed ſomething of that Nature tho' from a private hand might be both neceſſary and grateful. But now all things have been managed as becomes a <hi>Court of Juſtice,</hi> not as formerly with the <hi>Decency of a Bear-garden,</hi> no doubt but the publick will be ſoon gratified with a true and exact Hiſtory of the Tryal of the perſons lately convicted, which make ſo much noiſe in the World. All I pretend to here is from my own perſonal obſervation and knowledg to compare a little theſe <hi>Tryals</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reigns,</hi> and to ſhew the vaſt difference in the management of the whole in reſpect both of <hi>Court, Bar</hi> and <hi>Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96003:15"/>
In the opening the Evidence, here was no affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Exaggeration</hi> of Matters, nor Oſtentation of a <hi>putid</hi> Eloquence one after another, as in former Tryals, like ſo many Geeſe cackling in a row; here was nothing beſides fair matter of Fact or natural and juſt Reflections from thence ariſing. What few <hi>Witneſſes</hi> the Priſoners had were not affronted or <hi>croſs-bitten</hi> in their legal Evidence. The Priſoners themſelves were treated with that Humanity ever due to thoſe who are <hi>unfortunate,</hi> though the moſt <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> perſons in the World. There was ſo much <hi>Reaſon</hi> upon the Bench, that they had no need of <hi>Rayling,</hi> and thoſe at the <hi>Bar</hi> had ſuch uſage as if they came thither to be <hi>tryed for their Lives,</hi> not <hi>baited to death.</hi> As for the <hi>Evidence,</hi> twas the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and higheſt the Nature of the thing cou'd poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bear—Plain Proof, undeniable matter of Fact, a deſperate Plot at home, Correſpondence with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, inviting them hither, ſhewing 'em where to fall upon us, betraying the Strength of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to 'em our Ships and Forts, corrupting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thoſe at home, and taking whatever meaſures could poſſibly be thought on for our common Ruin. And this ſeized in the very <hi>Boſoms</hi> of the grand Conſpirators in their own undeniable <hi>Hand-writing,</hi> nay their <hi>Seals,</hi> even their <hi>double Seals</hi> together with it. Theſe Men had fairer play than Noble <hi>Sidny,</hi> &amp;c. who were hanged by help of a <hi>Marginal Note,</hi> for controverſial Papers of twenty years ſtanding, to which they made both <hi>Keys and Characters,</hi> abuſed the <hi>Court</hi> as much as <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Poem, and by a rare new <hi>Law-figure</hi> (for 'twou'd puzzle one to find it in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96003:16"/>
all <hi>Voſſius</hi> his Rhetorick) called <hi>Innuendo,</hi> extreamly obliged the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> by turning him into a <hi>Tarquin.</hi> No <hi>Art</hi> nor <hi>Trick</hi> was there uſed to make them plead <hi>guilty,</hi> as with—n, nor <hi>one Murder</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to facilitate <hi>another</hi> as with the great and unfortunate Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe Blood even yet in vain crys for Vengeance. Every thing here was in its due place and order; the <hi>Patriots</hi> on the <hi>Bench,</hi> and the <hi>Malefactors</hi> at the <hi>Bar;</hi> not quite contrary, as we have ſeen formerly, when the Perſons <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned</hi> have as far and as viſibly out-weighed the Judges in Senſe, as in Probity and Honour. The <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> here were neither <hi>frighted</hi> nor <hi>ſurprized,</hi> nor ſuch as would be ſo; the Defence made by the Priſoners for the moſt part ſo <hi>weak</hi> and enervate, and ſo much below themſelves, that it plainly appeared the fruitleſs Effort of a <hi>Guilty Mind,</hi> and 'twas eaſie enough to read their <hi>Sentence</hi> in their Foreheads, pronounc'd by a <hi>Judge within,</hi> greater than thoſe who fill'd the viſible Tribunal.</p>
            <p>On the whole, my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> was, after a fair Hearing, on a long and full Evidence, found Guilty, about Seven in the Evening of the ſame day he was Tryed. Major <hi>Aſhton,</hi> after a Defence which took up more time, on the <hi>Monday</hi> after, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. And on the ſame day <hi>Elliot</hi>'s Tryal was put off until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; but whether any of them will obtain or deſervk their Lives by an ingenuous Diſcovery of all the Particulars of a Plot, ſo wide and deep as this will appear to whoever hears or reads the Letters which give an Account of it, a little longer time will very probably decide: Till when, here has been ſufficient
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96003:16"/>
already brought to light, as to the reality of the <hi>Plot</hi> it ſelf, the horrid and deſperate <hi>Deſigns</hi> thereby to be perpetrated, the manner of its <hi>management,</hi> and ſtrange <hi>Diſcovery;</hi> enough, I ſhould think, to ſatisfie all perſons, who in this point really <hi>want</hi> ſatisfaction, and are not themſelves either <hi>Well-willers</hi> to the Deſign, or actually concerned therein.</p>
