            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis exposition of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is my
own invention, thou shalt not meet with it in any other
Writer whatsoever. All that I intended at the the first was
to read over those few Books which I had in my study upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
which I did for my own satisfaction, contentation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
to see what Men did say on that Subject. And I did read
of some which held <hi>Babylon</hi> to be the World, the City of the Devil,
or the City of wicked Men, but all others held it to be <hi>Rome,</hi> and
some would have it to be Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and others to be <hi>Papal.</hi>
Some have found the Revenues of the <hi>Popedome,</hi> and others the
wealth of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and if that were
once taken away, the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> would not be long after, which
perhaps might give incouragement to <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to send a
Navy to <hi>Hispaniola</hi> to fetch it away. Some have found <hi>Gustavus
Adolphus</hi> the victorious King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the house of <hi>Austria</hi>
there; and to come nearer home, some have found our renowned
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory, yea, and men
of meaner rank, Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bastwicke</hi>
there, and which I count as senseless as any of the rest, <hi>Laodicea,
England</hi> as they call it, and <hi>Philadelphia, Scotland</hi> there: And
<pb facs="tcp:55629:4"/>
if men will give their minds to mystical interpretations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the common saying, <hi>quot verba, tot mysteria,</hi> that there
be as many mysteries as words in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> what is it that
one may not find there? Some forsake our Church Assemblies, and
judge them to be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and fetch a warrant for their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
out of the <hi>Revelation, Come out of her my people, that ye
be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues, Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Yea, a great in-let to our late Civil Wars, hath
been the misinterpretation of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and some men did
believe that that War was Prophesied of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. When I
found that men were of this mind, my spirit was moved within me,
not only to read what men did Write, but to study the Prophecies of
the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as the men of <hi>Berea</hi> did the Scriptures of the Old
Testament, to see whether those things which they did write upon
this subject were so, or no. And upon serious examination of the
point, I call in question all the mystical interpretations of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
excepting those few which <hi>John</hi> himself hath delivered for
such, or are so obvious that he that runs may read them, as when
'tis said, <hi>When the Lamb ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> opened the first Seal,</hi> every Child
can tell that by the <hi>Lamb</hi> is meant <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and such as these
are mystically to be understood, but all others that be not of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are called in question by me. And I put it out of question that
our Church Assemblies be not <hi>Antichristian,</hi> nor our <hi>Bishops, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians.</hi>
A man may frequent our Church Assemblies, or be a
Minister of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not partake of <hi>Babylons</hi>
sins, and receive not of her Plagues: Yea, I make a question what
the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> is, and whatever mystical interpretations have
been made of that and other Prophecies, besides those which the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> hath made himself, or are so apparent, that every one at
first sight may know them to be such, are called in question by me,
whether they be the true meaning of the Prophecies; and I give a
new interpretation of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Writers knew not of, nor ever came into their minds. And
<pb facs="tcp:55629:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this I do, first, by way of Paraphrase, wherein I deliver the true sense
and meaning of the Prophecies, without giving reasons for my exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and next I add divers questions, wherein I first dispute against
the false opinions and conceits of other men, and demonstrate by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
arguments and reasons, that the Prophecies have not such a
meaning, were not fulfilled in such a way, such a manner, at such a
time, and in such a place as they say they were; and after this is
done, in some question or other I give the reasons for my own exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In a word, the main points wherein I differ and dissent from
other men, may be reduced to four Heads.</p>
            <p>1. Whereas other men expound the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi>
mystically, according to the common saying, <hi>quot verba, tot myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
as many mysteries as words, making them symbols, types, and
figures of other things; I for the most part, and so far as lawfully I
may, expound the words literally, without making them symbols,
types, or figures of any other things than what their usual significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will afford.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas others will have the accomplishment of the Prophecies
to be in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> I make
the Scene in which the Prophecies shall be acted and fulfilled to be <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
and other parts of <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whereas other men will not have the Prophecies commence in
order as they were revealed to <hi>John,</hi> I make them all come to pass in
order as they were revealed to him, and I make the order give light
to the exposition, and not the exposition to the order; and I say the
order teacheth how the Prophecies are to be explained and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and not the exposition in what order they shall come to pass.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas others are of the mind that the Prophecies which I
write upon, are for the most part fulfilled already; I am of opinion
that all, and every one of them are yet to be expected.</p>
            <p>If I discover the truth unto thee, as I believe I do in most
things, if not in all; give God the glory, and not me; but if thou
find that I am in an errour, as none that have written upon this
<pb facs="tcp:55629:5"/>
Subject before me are without; convince me of my errour by sound
reasons, for bare votes will not do it, and I will be of thy mind.
Read what is written at thy leasure, and consider of it; but read it
in order and without prejudice, for that will cloud thine Eyes and thou
wilt not see the truth; if thou read the Book with prejudice, weigh
one thing with another, as well the series and order of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as the words and exposition of them, and the Lord who is the
Author of the Prophecy and revealed it to <hi>John,</hi> reveal the truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, Farewell.</p>

on a white Horse, which is a sign of conquest, and that he
should be a King, and should have first a Bow, and afterwards
a Crown, and should go forth Conquering, and to Conquer;
but some things should be left unconquered by him.</p>

second living Creature say unto me, Come and see what
shall come to pass hereafter, not shortly as the things in the
Epistles to the seven Churches shall, but a great while hence,
and that not in <hi>Europe,</hi> but in <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. And I saw that there should come another man after the

Prophecy of the first Seal is ended, riding on a red Horse,
which is a sign of blood, and that he should take peace from
off the earth, or the place where he lived, and should cause
that men should kill one another by intestine Wars, and
that he should have a great Sword to commit a great and mighty
slaughter, and slay many men therewith.</p>

                  <head>The Prophecy of the third Seal.</head>
                  <p>5. And when he had opened the third Seal, I heard the
third living Creature say unto me, Come and see what shall
come to pass hereafter not long before the day of Judgment
doth begin, and that not in <hi>Europe</hi> or the Isles afar off, but in
<hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Then I looked and saw that there should come a third
man after the Prophecy of the second Seal is ended, riding on
a Black Horse, with a pair of balances in his hand, which
are a sign of Civil Justice. And I heard a voice
among the four living Creatures say,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 11.</note> that in the
time of this rider men should not live by rapine as in the
time of War, but should pay for what they took;
if any one would have a measure of Wheat,<note place="margin">2 King. 7. 1.</note> he
should pay a penny for it, and if any one would have a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Barley, he should pay a penny for it, and if any man
would have any Oyl, or Wine, he should pay good money
for it, and wrong no man therein.</p>

come to pass hereafter, not in <hi>Europe,</hi> but in <hi>Asia,</hi> a little
before the day of judgment shall begin.</p>
                  <p>8. And I saw that there should come a fourth man after the
Prophecy of the third Seal is ended, riding on a pale Horse,

                  <p>9. And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I saw the Souls
of them which had been slain for the word of God, and
for the witnessing of Jesus Christ a long time before this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
should begin.</p>
                  <p>10. That they should now cry to God for vengeance of
their blood, and it should be a loud and earnest cry, which
they should make, as if they did expostulate with God and
say, How long Lord holy and true, dost thou not judge and
avenge our blood on the bloody inhabiters of the earth? why
dost thou delay the time so long?</p>
                  <p>11. And hereupon I saw that some addition should be made
unto their present happiness; and as for the revenging of
their blood, it was said unto them, that it should be deferred
a little longer, until their fellow Servants, and their Brethren
which should profess the same Faith which they did, should
be slain as they were, and this is to be done in the time of
this Seal, before the sixth Prophecy shall begin, and when
this slaughter of their fellow Servants, and their Brethren should
be over, then God will revenge their blood all together.</p>

                  <p>12. And when he had opened the sixth Seal, I saw that
there should be a great shaking and concussion in
the Heavens,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 29.</note> and that the Sun it self should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

earth in clusters, like as unripe Figs of a latter spring fall off

from the Tree in heaps, when the Tree is shaken of a mighty
wind.</p>
                  <p>14. And black gloomy clouds should cover the face of all
the Sky, and the Heaven should depart from mens eyes and
sight, like a scroll of Parchment when it is folded up and
rolled together, and a Star should not be seen in all the Sky,
no more than a letter is discernable in a roll of Parchment
when it is folded up and rolled together: and by the many
earthquakes which should happen, every mountain in the
earth should be removed out of his place, and every Island in
the Sea.</p>
                  <p>15. And men of all sorts should be astonished at the sight
of these things, the Kings and Great men of the earth, the
Soldiers and their chief Commanders, the rich men and the
poor men, the bond-men, and the free men should be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

seek a place to hide themselves, some in Dens and Caves
that be below the earth, and some in Rocks that be upon
the Hills and Mountains.</p>

would cry unto the Mountains to fall upon them, and to
the Rocks to cover them from the presence of that angry
God which sits upon the throne, and from the face of Jesus
Christ represented by the Holy Lamb.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>It is the common and Unanimous voice of antiquity
that</hi> John <hi>received, and wrote his</hi> Revelation <hi>in the Reign of</hi>
Domitian, <hi>after the destruction of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and not in the
Reign of</hi> Claudius, <hi>which was many years before it.</hi> Irenaeus

Domitiani imperii. If the name of Antichrist ought to be
proclaimed openly now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would have been proclaimed by him who
saw the <hi>Revelation,</hi> for it was seen not any long time ago, but
almost in our age at the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign. Eusebius <hi>saith

therefore after he was banished into the Isle <hi>Patmos</hi> by <hi>Domitian,</hi>
who raised the second persecution after <hi>Nero,</hi> writ the <hi>Revelation</hi>

the Isle <hi>Patmos</hi> in which he had been banished by <hi>Domitian</hi> the
Emperor for the testimony of the Lord, the <hi>Revelation</hi> containing
infinite mysteries, concerning things to come. <hi>And there is not

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Not only ancient Writers, but our modern too Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
consent, that this Book was written in <hi>Domitians</hi>
Reign after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55629:8"/>
there be not any of another mind, except <hi>Grotius</hi> and his
followers.</p>
                  <p>3. This Book was written after <hi>John</hi> was banished into
<hi>Patmos, Rev.</hi> 1. 9. Now we read in History, that <hi>John</hi> was
banished thither by <hi>Domitian,</hi> in the tenth year of his Reign,
and in the fourteenth year he writ the <hi>Revelation.</hi> See besides
<hi>Jerom</hi> before alledged, <hi>Eusebius, l. 3. 16. 18. Dorotheus</hi> of the
Lives and Ends of the Prophets and Apostles, <hi>pag. 532. Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
in the ninth and fourteenth years of <hi>Domitian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Church was under persecution when <hi>John</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
into <hi>Patmos,</hi> and not only he but all the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
to whom he writes, felt the stroke of that persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9. but there was no persecution made against the
Church by <hi>Claudius,</hi> therefore this fell not out in his time, but
rather in <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign.</p>
                  <p>5. There was no imperial edict, for persecuting Christians
in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and if he had banished <hi>John</hi> into
<hi>Patmos</hi> for Religions sake, he would have banished <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the rest of the Apostles too, and not have suffered him to
preach so openly as he did, but we find that <hi>Paul</hi> did openly
preach the word at <hi>Corinth</hi> at the same time that <hi>Claudius</hi>
commanded all <hi>Jews</hi> to depart from <hi>Rome, Act.</hi> 18. 2.</p>
                  <p>6. If <hi>John</hi> had been banished into <hi>Patmos,</hi> in the ninth year
of <hi>Claudius,</hi> he might have returned out of exile after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
either in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> as <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> did
who were at <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Rom.</hi> 16. 3, 4. or else in the Reign of <hi>Galba, Otho, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi>
or <hi>Vespasian:</hi> but we find in History, that in the time
of <hi>Nerva,</hi> the successor of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> decreed
that the honors exhibited to <hi>Domitian,</hi> should cease, and such
as were injuriously exiled by him, should return unto their
native soyl, and that <hi>John</hi> returned then, <hi>Eusebius, l. 3. c.</hi> 18.
which plainly shews that <hi>John</hi> was banished into <hi>Patmos,</hi> not by
<hi>Claudius,</hi> but <hi>Domitian.</hi>
                  </p>

7. The Deeds and Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> were crept
into the Churches before this Book was written by <hi>John,</hi> and
he commends the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> for hating the deeds of
the <hi>Nicolaitans, Rev.</hi> 2. 6. and he blames the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
for that they had them amongst them which held the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Nicolaitans, Rev.</hi> 2. 15. but when did these <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans</hi>
first begin, and when did their Doctrine first creep into
the Churches? Not in the Reign of <hi>Claudius;</hi> for then other
Books of Scripture would have spoken of them; especially
those which were written at that time: but we find nothing
of these <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> in any Book of Scripture, save only in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> which shews they were not known in the Reign
of <hi>Claudius</hi> but came up afterward, and therefore <hi>Baronius</hi>
and others place them in the Reign of <hi>Nero. Baronius Anno

                  <p>8. This Book was written after <hi>Antipas</hi> was slain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.
and 'tis written and sent to the Angel his successour who ever
he were: But now History tells us, and our Adversaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that <hi>Antipas</hi> was slain not in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but in
the days of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Roman Emperour. See Doctor
<hi>Hammond</hi> Page 927. Menolog. <hi>April. 11. Baronii</hi> Martyrolog.
pag. 249. <hi>Baronii</hi> Annal. Anno <hi>Domitiani</hi> 10. And to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
they have not any thing to say, but that <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.
the Preter tense is put for the Future tense, <hi>Antipas</hi> was slain
for <hi>Antipas</hi> will be slain, to which I answer, 1. That the
Preter tense is not usually put for the Future tense, except it
be in Prophecies; but that part of the Epistle to the Church
of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is not a Prophecy, but a History of what was
done before the <hi>Revelation</hi> was written. 2. The proper names
of men be not usually joyned with Verbs of the Preter tense,
before the thing spoken of be done, but in the Future ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as when 'tis said of <hi>Josiah,</hi> that he shall burn dead mens
Bones upon the Altar, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2. it is spoken in the Future
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55629:9"/>
tense and not in the Preter tense. So when 'tis said of <hi>Cyrus,
He is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure, Esa.</hi> 44. 28.
it is spoken in the Future tense, and not in the Preter tense.
3. The Epistle to the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is directed and sent
to the Angel, <hi>Antipas</hi> his successour: Therefore it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
after <hi>Antipas</hi> was dead. 4. Men are not commended in
Letters in the Preter tense for what they will do hereafter,
but for what they have done already; but the Angel of the
Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is commended for that he had not denied
the Faith of Christ even in those dayes wherein <hi>Antipas</hi> was
slain; therefore this commendatory letter was written after
<hi>Antipas</hi> was dead: and because he was slain in the dayes of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi>
and not in the dayes of <hi>Claudius,</hi> therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that this Book was written in the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and
not in the Reign of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. This Book was written after the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>
were converted to the Christian Faith: But we cannot find
that these Seven Churches were converted to the Faith in
the dayes of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but 'tis more likely that <hi>Ephesus</hi> was
converted in the dayes of <hi>Nero,</hi> and that because, as Doctor
<hi>Hammond</hi> observes pag. 648. the first time that <hi>Paul</hi> disputed
at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was about Ann. Ch. 51. and it was three years after
that before <hi>Ephesus</hi> was converted, and that was Anno
Ch. 54. which was the First year of <hi>Nero's</hi> Reign. See
Bishop <hi>Vshers</hi> Annal. pag. 668. 670. 671. from whom we
may learn that <hi>Ephesus</hi> was not converted until the Reign of
<hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Suppose it were true that these Churches were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the dayes of <hi>Claudius;</hi> yet they could not be converted
any long time before his Death, and that because he Reigned
but thirteen years and nine moneths in all, and either all or
the greatest part of that time was spent in converting other
Churches, as you may read <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 16, 17, and 18. Chapters;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55629:9"/>
so that they could not be converted any long time before his
death, yea in his time it was that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to Preach in <hi>Asia, Act.</hi> 16. 6. But now the Gospel
had been Preached unto them a long time before this Book
was written, and they were not new converts, but old ones,
and of long standing in the Christian Faith, when this Book
was written to them, as these Texts of Scripture sufficiently
declare, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. 9. 13 19. 21.</p>
                  <p>11. If this Book had been written in the ninth year of
<hi>Claudius, Paul</hi> would not have gone to <hi>Ephesus</hi> to Preach the
Gospel there at the latter end of his Reign, for <hi>Paul</hi> did not
Preach the Gospel where it had been Preached before by
others, as he himself confesseth, <hi>Rom. 15. 20, 21. 2 Cor.</hi> 10.
13, 14, 15, 16. Now we find that <hi>Paul</hi> went to Preach the
Gospel at <hi>Ephesus</hi> before it was converted, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 19. and
this was at the latter end of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, for his going
thither was, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Preface before the Epistle
to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> saith, about the one and fiftieth year of Christ,
and that was at the latter end of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Book was not written then, but at some time or other
afterward.</p>
                  <p>12. Why was this Book revealed unto <hi>John,</hi> and not rather
unto <hi>Paul,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
of the circumcision, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. and <hi>Paul</hi> had the honour to
convert the Gentiles to the Christian Faith, not <hi>John,</hi> as you
may read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, <hi>c.</hi> 18. 19. and 20.
and therefore it is likely that if this Prophecy had been reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the days of <hi>Paul,</hi> that it should have been revealed unto
him, and that <hi>Paul</hi> should have been the pen-man of it, and
not <hi>John,</hi> which we know is otherwise; and therefore the true
cause, why this Prophecy was revealed unto <hi>John,</hi> and not to
<hi>Paul,</hi> was because <hi>Paul</hi> was dead, and the other Apostles
were dead when this Prophecy was revealed, and onely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55629:10"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> was then alive, whom it could be revealed unto.</p>
                  <p>13. This Book was one of the last Books of Scripture that
was written, if not the last of all, as the words <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18.
do imply: but if this Book were written in the ninth year of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and all other of <hi>Pauls</hi>
Epistles had been written after this, yea the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and all other Books of the new
Testament, except the Gospel by St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> had been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
after this, and this Book should not have been one of the
last, much less the last of all, but one of the first Books of the
new Testament that was written.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>What</hi> Irenaeus <hi>affirms concerning</hi> John<hi>'s Vision at the
end of</hi> Domitian, <hi>is not of all but particularly of that</hi> Vision <hi>of

would have been published by him who saw the Apocalypse, for it
was not seen any long time since, but almost under our age, at the
end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Empire. <hi>Where the word</hi> visum <hi>in the

at one time, and not at several distant times, as shall be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55629:10"/>
proved in the next question, and therefore for any man to think
that he had the vision of the name of the <hi>Beast,</hi> by it self alone,
at the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign, and of the rest of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>
at some other time before, is but a meer fancy at the best.
2. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> counted the name of the <hi>Beast</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> worthy to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged
at large by the Holy Ghost, and therefore it is far
from his meaning, that it was seen by itself alone from the
rest of the <hi>Apocalypse. 3. Irenaeus</hi> doth not say, <hi>nomen viderat,</hi>
that <hi>John</hi> saw the <hi>name of the Beast,</hi> but <hi>Apocalypsin viderat,</hi> that
<hi>he saw the Apocalypse,</hi> and this was seen not any long time ago,
but almost in our time at the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign. 4. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
brings the Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> to prove that <hi>John</hi> was
banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> at the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he understands <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as we do, and his opinion is, that
the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> was seen by <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and
not the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> by itself alone. 5. It is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
thing that <hi>John</hi> should be banished into <hi>Patmos,</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and see some part of the <hi>Revelation</hi> there in

yet in the <hi>Latine</hi> Copy of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the word is <hi>visa</hi> in the
Feminine Gender, and in the Margent of one of them, I find
these words, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 96. Joannes <hi>in</hi> Patmon <hi>relegatus
scripsit</hi> Apocalypsin, <hi>in the year of the Lord</hi> 96. John <hi>was banished
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55629:11"/>
into</hi> Patmos, <hi>and then wrote the</hi> Revelation. 8. Let the word
be <hi>visa,</hi> or <hi>visum,</hi> one that has but half an eye, may see what
<hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s meaning is, that if the name of <hi>Antichrist</hi> ought to be
divulged openly now, it would have been divulged by him who
saw the <hi>Revelation</hi> for it; this is, the <hi>Revelation</hi> was <hi>seen</hi> not
any long time ago, but almost in our age, at the end of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
Reign; and seeing it was not openly declared by him who
saw the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that so lately too, it ought not to be
proclaimed openly by us, as to say that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is his
proper name: this is <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s meaning, and the drift of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Lastly, be it so as they would have it, that <hi>visum seen</hi>
doth belong to the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> yet 'tis far from <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s
meaning, that the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> was seen by itself alone,
his meaning rather is, that it was seen when the rest of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse</hi>
was, and that was, as he saith, at the latter end of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitians</hi>
Reign; and so for the name of the Beast, his meaning
is, that it was not seen by <hi>John</hi> himself, <gap reason="foreign">

that is, in words at length, but in figures only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Though it should be acknowledged to be the opinion of
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> received the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and all his Visions
at the end of <hi>Domitian,</hi> yet on the other side 'tis the affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> Prophecied in the time of <hi>Claudius
Caesar,</hi> when saith he, he was in the Isle <hi>Patmos.</hi> And that
which may give authority to <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Testimony, is this.
1. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in that place, is a writing against the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanists</hi>
about the authority of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and that the later
it were seen, or written, the more it would have been for his
turn, towards confuting, or answering them, whose objection
it was that the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi>
was not yet a Church, when that was said to be revealed.
And therefore if it had been but uncertain, whether it were
written so early or no, he would without all question, have
made use of this as some advantage against his adversaries, whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55629:11"/>
he was then in confuting, 2. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is so far from
doing this, that he doth twice in the same place expresly affirm,
1. That his being in the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> 2. That his seeing these
Visions there, were in the time of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who lived so near the time
of <hi>Domitian,</hi> is far to be preferred before the Testimony of
<hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who lived above two hundred years after. 2. If
there be any truth in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Testimony, why did <hi>Jerom,
Eusebius,</hi> and others follow the Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and not
the Testimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but that they saw some fault in his
Testimony? yea, why did all our modern Writers since, as
well Papists as Protestants (except <hi>Grotius</hi> and his adherents)
follow the Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and forsake the Testimony
of <hi>Epiphanius?</hi> if there were any credit to be given to his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.
3. Either the Copy of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is corrupt, or else
he mistook and set down <hi>Claudius</hi> for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as the margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
note <hi>mendosè pro Domitiano</hi> doth imply, and he might as well
mistake <hi>Claudius</hi> for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as he did <hi>Priscilla, Maximilla,</hi>
and <hi>Quintilla,</hi> for <hi>Jesebel,</hi> for he thinks that by <hi>Jesebel</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
meant <hi>Priscilla, Maximilla,</hi> and <hi>Quintilla,</hi> which is a very
unlikely thing, for <hi>Iesebel</hi> was a woman then in being, though
of another name when the Apostle wrote the Epistle to the
Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and he called her <hi>Iesebel</hi> by a Metaphor,
for the likeness she bore to <hi>Iesebel, Ahabs</hi> Wife, in wickedness,
witchcraft, Adultery, and Idolatry, whenas <hi>Priscilla, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilla,</hi>
and <hi>Quintilla</hi> the Disciples of <hi>Montanus,</hi> were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesses
till the latter end of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> which was many
years after <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> too. 4. I find another
gross mistake in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> for he makes <hi>Iohn</hi> to be above
ninety years old in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> whenas he was not
above fifty at that time, and he lived at least forty years after
his decease, and died in the Reign of <hi>Trajan. Helvirus</hi> pag. 87. 5.
Whereas 'tis said, the later it was seen, or written, the more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55629:12"/>
it would have been for his turn, it is nothing so, for he makes
the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to be a Prophecy of a
Church then to come, and not a History of a Church that then
was, in which regard it made nothing to his turn, whether it
were written sooner, or later; for suppose it were written
sooner in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time, and that there were no Church in
<hi>Thyatira</hi> at that time, it made nothing against him, nor against
the authority of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> if the Epistle be meant Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
of a Church then to come, as he understood it; or
suppose it were written later in <hi>Domitians</hi> time, and that there
were no Church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> in his time neither, it made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against him, and his way, nor against the authority of
the <hi>Revelation</hi> neither, if the Epistle be to be understood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
of a Church to come, as he understood it: but the
truth is, there was no Church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> in the Reign of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> nor in any other part of <hi>Asia, Act.</hi> 16. 6. much less
such renowned Churches as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks of, consisting of
Elders, Bishops, and Metropolitans too, as some would have
it, and therefore this Book was not written in his days, but at
some time or other afterward. Lastly, if the Epistle to the
Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> were written in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> how
will they answer the objection of the <hi>Montanists,</hi> which was,
that there was no Church there when that Epistle was written,
as indeed there was not, if that Epistle were written in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s
days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Having said this for the confirming this assertion of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi>
to have as much authority as his Testimony can give
it, four Arguments I shall add for the truth of it. The first
Negative, to the disparagement of that relation that affirms him
banished by <hi>Domitian,</hi> and returned after his death in <hi>Nerva</hi>'s
Reign. For of the persecution by <hi>Domitian,</hi> there be but two
authors mentioned by <hi>Eusebius, l. 3. c. 20. Tertullian,</hi> and
<hi>Egesippus;</hi> but of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> he hath these words, <gap reason="foreign">

Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<hi>went about to do as</hi> Nero <hi>had done, being a part of his cruelty,
or as</hi> Tertullians <hi>words are</hi> Apol. <hi>c. 5. portio</hi> Neronis <hi>de cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitate,
a Portion of</hi> Nero <hi>for cruelty, sed facile coeptum repressit,
restitutis etiam quos relegaverat, but he ceased from it presently, and
recalled those whom he had banished,</hi> which no way agrees with his
banishing <hi>John,</hi> and not recalling him all his life, as is supposed
in the other relation, and affirmed by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20.
And therefore <hi>Baronius,</hi> that is for his banishment under <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
in the tenth year of his Reign, is forced fairly to reject
<hi>Tertullians</hi> authority in this matter, giving for it his proof out of
<hi>Dio, viz.</hi> that <hi>Nerva</hi> released those who were condemned of
impiety, and restored those who were banished. Which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Dio</hi>'s being granted as far as belongs to those who
were in exile, or stood condemned at <hi>Nerva</hi>'s coming to the
Empire, doth no way prejudice the truth of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words,
of <hi>Domitians</hi> having repressed his severity against the Christians,
and revoked the banished, (wherein he is much a more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
witness than <hi>Baronius.)</hi> No more doth his killing his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
<hi>Clemens,</hi> and banishing his Cousin <hi>Flavia Domitilla,</hi> for that
was five years after this time of <hi>Johns</hi> supposed banishment, in
the fifteenth or last year of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign. In the relation
of <hi>Egesippus</hi> a most ancient Writer that lived in those times,
there is no more but this, that <hi>Domitian</hi> had made a decree
for putting to death all that were of the linage of <hi>David,</hi> that
some delators had accused some of the Children of <hi>Jude,</hi> the
Kinsman of our Saviour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as such who were
of <hi>Davids</hi> Seed, that <hi>Jocatus</hi> brought these to <hi>Domitian,</hi> but
upon examination, being found to be plain men, and such as
believed not <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55629:13"/>
he set them free, and by Edict took off the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against the Church, and they being released, became
Bishops in the Church, and continued peaceably, and lived
till <hi>Trajans</hi> days. And this certainly agrees very little with the
other relation, not can any account probably be rendred why
when the persecution of <hi>Christians</hi> was taken off by the Edict,
and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> peace restored to the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
when the profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the Sons of <hi>Jude</hi> being by
them avowed to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> was not yet thought fit to be
punished in the least, yet <hi>Iohn</hi> should be banished, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in his exile, 'till <hi>Nerva</hi>'s Reign, for no other crime, but
that of being a <hi>Christian.</hi> Where by the way, <hi>Baronius</hi>'s artifice
much fails him, <hi>Tertullian</hi> (saith he) fell into this error by
following <hi>Egesippus</hi>'s authority, but <hi>Egesippus</hi> (saith he) spake
apparently <hi>de ea persecutione quae mota est in</hi> Judaeos, of that
persecution which was raised against the <hi>Iews,</hi> not against the
<hi>Christians.</hi> How true that is, will now appear, when the
express words are, that by that <hi>Emperors</hi> edict the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the Church (sure that was not of <hi>Iews,</hi> but <hi>Christians)</hi>
ceased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If there be no credit to be given to that relation that
affirms <hi>Iohn</hi> banished by <hi>Domitian,</hi> and returned after his death
in <hi>Nerva</hi>'s Reign, why did all Writers ever since give credit
to that relation, and forsake <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in this point, except
<hi>Grotius</hi> and his followers? 2. If <hi>Domitian</hi> presently ceased from
his cruelty, and recalled the banished, why did Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
say, that after the rebuilding of the <hi>Capitol Domitian</hi> began a
persecution against the Christians, as those which opposed the
Heathen Worship, and continued it above three years and a
half, until his death? Paraph. on <hi>Revelation 13. v. 5. pag.</hi> 967.
3. If <hi>Domitian</hi> presently ceased from his persecution of the
Church, how can he be the <hi>Beast Apocalyptical</hi> as they would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55629:13"/>
have him? for the <hi>Beast</hi> after he began a persecution against
the Church, never ceased from it, but continued it until his
dying day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20. 4. If <hi>Domitian</hi> began his perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in the tenth year of his Reign, and presently ceased
from it, how came it to pass that in the fifteenth year of his
Reign, he slew <hi>Flavius Clemens,</hi> (who had been a Consul)
for his <hi>Christianity,</hi> and banished <hi>Flavia Domitilla</hi> for being a
Christian? doth not this plainly shew that <hi>Domitian</hi> continued
his persecution against the Church, and never wholly ceased
from it? though for a while he might relent, and be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
at one time than another, as a continued feaver hath its
time of relaxation, and exacerbation, yet never wholly ceaseth.
5. If <hi>Domitian</hi> presently ceased from his persecution, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
took it up again, this had been no grand persecution, as
all the ten persecutions were, but a very light one, even the
lightest that ever was. 6. That relenting which <hi>Tertullian</hi>
speaks of, may very well agree with that which <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,
for he might cease from his cruelty for a time, and take it up
again, as a continual feaver doth relent for a time, and have a
strong fit again: but I rather think that that ceasing which
<hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of, was in the fifteenth year of his Reign,
not long before his death; and whereas 'tis said he ceased
presently, the meaning is not, that he ceased presently after
he first began his persecution, but the meaning rather is, that
he ceased presently after he heard the words of <hi>Judes</hi> Sons,
that Christs Kingdom was not earthly, but heavenly, this
was it which made him to relent, and this was done at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of his Reign, whenas his persecution began about five
years before, and this doth well agree with that which <hi>Dio</hi>
saith, that <hi>Nerva</hi> released those who where condemned of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and restored those who were banished, <hi>Domitian</hi> not
living himself to see it put in execution. Lastly, that which
<hi>Egesippus</hi> saith, doth very well agree with that which <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55629:14"/>
saith, for 'twas at the latter end of his Reign that the Sons of
<hi>Jude</hi> were brought before him, and when he found them to be
plain men, and such as believed not <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom to be of this
World, he thereupon set them free, and there were no more
set free by him than they, and more than this he did not, but
made an Edict that the persecution against the Church should
cease, and this edict reached not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, as <hi>Baronius</hi>
would have it, but the whole Church, but <hi>Domitian</hi> dying
suddenly thereupon, no more was done in his days but the
making of the edict only, all the rest was put in execution by
<hi>Nerva;</hi> in his days it was that the Sons of <hi>Jude</hi> became Bishops
in the Church, and not before; in his days it was that peace was
restored, and not before; and in his days it was that <hi>John</hi> was
released, and not before: and upon this account it is, that it
was not done in <hi>Domitians</hi> days, because <hi>Domitian</hi> died sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after he heard the words of <hi>Judes</hi> Sons, and was slain by
<hi>Stephen,</hi> and did not live to see his edict put in execution.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> About the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> were
pursued, and banisht by the <hi>Roman Powers.</hi> That at that time
<hi>Claudius</hi> banished the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> is evident by <hi>Josephus,</hi>
and acknowledged by all. And that by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are meant, appears by <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Claudius, c.</hi> 25.
Judaeos <hi>impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantes Româ expulit, he
banished the</hi> Jews <hi>out of</hi> Rome, <hi>for the tumults which they daily
raised by the impulsion of</hi> Chrestus. By <hi>Chrestus</hi> it is certain
that the <hi>Roman Writers</hi> meant <hi>Christ,</hi> calling him <hi>Chrest,</hi> and
his followers <hi>Chrestians,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 3.
And so they that were acted by the impulsion of <hi>Chrest,</hi> in
that narration must, though called <hi>Jews,</hi> necessarily be resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be <hi>Christians.</hi> And what was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> is to be
supposed to have been done also in other parts of the <hi>Emperors</hi>
Dominions. And so that edict mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 2. was
in reason to reach to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and may justly be thought to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55629:14"/>
have involved Sr. <hi>John</hi> there. And accordingly <hi>Chronologers</hi>
have placed this banishment of his to <hi>Patmos</hi> in that year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Christians were pursued, and banished by
the <hi>Roman Powers</hi> about the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> doth not
yet appear to me, for as <hi>yet there was no law made against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion,</hi> saith Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> paraph. on <hi>Act. 18. v.</hi> 15.
and a little after he saith, that Claudius <hi>set out an Edict against
the</hi> Jews, <hi>but none against Christians, any otherwise than as they
were comprehended under the name of</hi> Jews. 2. That edict set
forth by <hi>Claudius,</hi> in the ninth year of his Reign, was against
the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and not against the <hi>Christians;</hi> and <hi>the Christian
Jews,</hi> as <hi>Jews, not as Christian fell under that edict,</hi> saith the
same Doctor, notes on <hi>Act. 26. pag.</hi> 456. 3. The cause of
that edict were the tumults which the <hi>Jews</hi> made in <hi>Rome,</hi>
but <hi>John</hi> was banished into <hi>Patmos,</hi> not for any such cause,
but for the word of God, and for the Testimony of <hi>Jesus
Christ, Rev.</hi> 1. 9. 4. The Ringleader of these tumults was
one <hi>Chrestus,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 5. c.</hi> 25. but that by <hi>Chre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
is meant our Lord <hi>Christ, adhuc mihi persunadere non possum,
I cannot yet perswade my self,</hi> saith Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> in his Annals,
<hi>pag.</hi> 666. 5. What <hi>Roman Writers</hi> they be, which called <hi>Christ
Chrest,</hi> and his followers <hi>Chrestians,</hi> they do not tell us; I
find that <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Annals <hi>lib. 15. c.</hi> 6. calls them <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and our Saviour he calls <hi>Christ. Ergo abolendo rumori</hi>
Nero <hi>subdidit reos &amp; quaesitissimis poenis affecit quos per flagitia

rumour,</hi> Nero <hi>falsly accused and punished most grievously, certain
people hated for their wickedness, which the common sort called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

                     <note place="margin">I find also that <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> which is in the tenth-Book of his Epistles, calls him Christ, and his followers he calleth Christians.</note> 
                     <hi>The author of that name was Christ,
who in</hi> Tiberius<hi>'s Reign was put to death, under</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55629:15"/>
Pilate <hi>Procurator of</hi> Judaea. Yea <hi>Suetonius</hi> himself in the
life of <hi>Nero lib. 6. c.</hi> 16. calls them <hi>Christians</hi> by their right
name, <hi>Afflicti suppliciis Christiani, the Christians were put to
death;</hi> and though others call them <hi>Chrestians,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
observes they did in his time, yet since <hi>Suetonius</hi> himself calls
them otherwise, this is another Argument that by <hi>Chrestus</hi>
he doth not mean <hi>Christ,</hi> but it is very likely that that name
came up after he was dead, and that through ignorance of
the common people. 6. These tumults were raised <hi>impulsore
Chresto</hi> by the impulsion of <hi>Chrestus;</hi> now what is meant by
impulsion but <hi>verbum &amp; exemplum</hi> his winning words, and
leading example? and this also shews that <hi>Chrestus</hi> was not
<hi>Christ,</hi> but a man then alive, and one that lived in <hi>Rome</hi> at
that time, else he could not stir up these tumults, <hi>verbo &amp;
exemplo</hi> by his winning words, and leading example, as this
<hi>Chrestus</hi> did. 7. But suppose it to be true, that by <hi>Chrestus</hi>
he means <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it will not serve their turn, for the
exile which <hi>Suetonius</hi> speaks of, is of such as were at <hi>Rome</hi>
at that time, <hi>Judaeos Româ expulit, he banished the</hi> Jews <hi>out of</hi>
Rome, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath the same expression of the place,
<hi>Act.</hi> 18. 2. Claudius <hi>commanded all</hi> Jews <hi>to depart from</hi> Rome,
but how doth it appear that St. <hi>John</hi> was then at <hi>Rome?</hi> for
unless he were there at that time, how is he concerned in
the exile? 8. But let us suppose as they do, that that edict
went farther than <hi>Rome,</hi> and did reach those that were at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> how doth it appear that St. <hi>John</hi> was then at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus?</hi>
for unless he were there at that time he is still uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the exile. And here by the way the Reader may
observe that they suppose <hi>John</hi> to be at <hi>Ephesus</hi> at that time,
and that the edict did reach him there, both which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
they should prove, and make good before we can consent
unto it, that <hi>John</hi> was banished by <hi>Claudius</hi> into <hi>Patmos.</hi> 9. But
though they bring no Argument for it, I will advance an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55629:15"/>
Argument or two against it, If that edict did reach to <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
and involve <hi>John</hi> there, how came it to pass that it did not
reach to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which is nearer <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but suffer him to continue there, and
Preach the Gospel there, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. 10. If
that edict did banish <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> how came it to pass
that <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Ephesus</hi> a little afterward, and was not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
too, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 19, 20? 11. The <hi>Jews</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that edict to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> but not confined to
any certain place, as <hi>John</hi> was, and after they were gone
from thence, they were at liberty to reside where they would,
as appears by <hi>Aquila</hi>'s going to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and residing there,
where he was at liberty, to continue or remove from thence
to any other place except <hi>Rome,</hi> as he pleased, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 2, 3. 18, 19.
So was not <hi>Johns</hi> confinement unto <hi>Patmos,</hi> from whence he
had not liberty to remove to a more commodious place, but
was forced to continue there against his will. 13. The
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was planted by <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.
and confirmed by <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, l. 3. <hi>c. 3. Eusebius,</hi>
l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20. and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was there before <hi>John,</hi> and
when <hi>John</hi> came thither he confirmed what <hi>Paul</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but if <hi>John</hi> were at <hi>Ephesus</hi> at that time, when that
edict came forth from <hi>Claudius,</hi> he must have been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paul,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> had not been there at that time, but
came thither afterward, and found no Church there, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>Act. 18. 1, 2. 19, 20, 21. Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2. To which
may be added, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not Preach the Gospel, where
it had been Preached before by others, <hi>Rom. 15. 20, 21.
2 Cor.</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15. and therefore <hi>John</hi> did not Preach at
<hi>Ephesus</hi> before <hi>Paul</hi> came thither, as he must have done, had
he been there the ninth year of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Lastly, what <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers</hi>
they be, which have placed <hi>Johns</hi> banishment into
<hi>Patmos,</hi> in that ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> they do not tell us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55629:16"/>
can I tell who they be, for all that I have seen, do place
it in <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign, and they are these, <hi>Bucholcerus, Helvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
Alstedius, Calvicius,</hi> and <hi>Funcius</hi> a Papist, beside our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Writers <hi>Isaacson, Fox,</hi> and <hi>Hanmer.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> About <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time it was, that the unbelieving
<hi>Jews</hi> began, and continued to oppose and persecute the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Jews,</hi> and thereupon the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> compliances, (and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as if they were <hi>Jews</hi> to avoid persecution) are so oft taken
notice of by St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 12. and elsewhere. And by all
the Epistles, both of him and the rest of the Apostles, written
from about that time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> are every where
touched on as the pests that were creeping into the Churches,
against which they endeavoured to fortifie the believers, and
assure them that those persecutions of the <hi>Iews</hi> should be
shortly ended by their destruction, <hi>(that night of sadness far
spent, and the day of deliverance and refreshment at hand, Rom.
13. 12. Rom. 16. 20.)</hi> and that then the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> which were
so sollicitous to save their lives should lose them, i.e. should
perish with them. Acordingly to the very same purpose is
most of the Vision here that concerned the seven Churches,
<hi>c.</hi> 2. 2. 4. 9. 14. 20. and <hi>c.</hi> 3. 9, 10. &amp;c. and much of the
following Prophecy, to assure them, that God would take
revenge on those impenitent and impure professors, and rescue
the constant <hi>Christians.</hi> And that makes it very reasonable to
believe that this Vision was received about the same time also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Did not the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> persecute the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
before <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time? was not the persecutions <hi>Act. 8. 1.
Act.</hi> 9. 23. before <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time? and was not <hi>Steven</hi> stoned to
death before <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time, yea did not the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the Christian in Christs time? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 22. and did not
many of the Rulers believe in him, but because of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
did not confess him lest they should be cast out of the
<hi>Synagogue? Ioh.</hi> 12. 12. Why do they not say that this Book
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55629:16"/>
was written then? 2. Did not <hi>Christ</hi> foretel the destruction of
the <hi>Iews</hi> in his time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 2. &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 24. and
did not he say unto them, <hi>When ye see these things begin to
come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
draweth near, Luk.</hi> 21. 28. And if the <hi>Revelation</hi> were
written to comfort the <hi>Christians</hi> against the <hi>Iews,</hi> and assure
them that those persecutions of the <hi>Iews</hi> should be shortly
ended by their destruction, (as they say it was) Why do they
not think that it was written then? 3. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> take
notice of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
c.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5, 6. as well as in the Epistle to
the <hi>Galatians c.</hi> 6. 12. and were not both these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
and many others his where the <hi>Gnosticks</hi>
are taken notice of,<note place="margin">not any of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles nor of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but afterward.</note> written after the days of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius?</hi>
and why may not the <hi>Revelation</hi> be written
after his days too? 4. Did not the <hi>Iews</hi> persecute
<hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Domitians</hi> time, and were there not <hi>Gnosticks</hi> at
that time too, <hi>Menander, Basilides</hi> and others, and why do
they not think that this Book was written then? In a word,
the persecution of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the complying of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks</hi>
to save themselves from persecution, is no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to shew the time when the <hi>Revelation</hi> was revealed to
<hi>Iohn,</hi> but <hi>Iohn</hi> being in the Isle of <hi>Patmos</hi> for the word of God,
and for the Testimony of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is a characteristical note
of the time of its revealing. Now there were no imperial
edicts against the <hi>Christians,</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
as appears by <hi>Gallio</hi>'s words, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 14, 15. and by <hi>Pauls</hi>
appeal to <hi>Caesar, Act.</hi> 25. 11. and by <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 31. but in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitians</hi>
time there were edicts made against them, and 'tis
the more likely that <hi>Iohn</hi> was banished then, and the scope
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is not to acquaint the Churches with the
destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> but to acquaint them
rather with the things that are, and the things that shall be

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The eight Kings or <hi>Emperors c.</hi> 17. 10. cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be made intelligible, but by beginning the account
from <hi>Claudius,</hi> so that he and <hi>Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius</hi>
shall be the five that were fallen, and then <hi>Vespasian</hi> (in whose
time I suppose these Visions were committed to writing by
St. <hi>Iohn)</hi> being the sixth shall be the [one is] and <hi>Titus the
seventh, that is not yet come, and when he comes shall stay but a
little while,</hi> reigning but two years and two months, and then the
<hi>[Beast that was and is not, and is the eighth, and is of the seven
and goes to destruction]</hi> will fall out to be <hi>Domittan,</hi> to whom
(and to whom onely of all the <hi>Emperors,</hi> nay of all men in
any story) all those distinctive characters will appertain, as
that he exercised the office of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and was called
<hi>Emperor</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Vespasian</hi> was gone into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and
after his return became a private man again, delivered up the
<hi>Empire</hi> to him, and so was and is not, and then was the <hi>eighth</hi>
(reckoning from <hi>Claudius</hi> as the first) and the Son <hi>of one of
the seven,</hi> viz. of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and should be a bloody persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and accordingly punished, and so go to <hi>destruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is past my understanding to find a reason why we
should begin the account of the <hi>eight Kings or Emperors, c.</hi> 17. 10.
from <hi>Claudius</hi> and end it in <hi>Domitian,</hi> and so leave out all the
<hi>Emperors</hi> that were before <hi>Claudius,</hi> and all them that went
behind <hi>Domitian,</hi> for the ten first persecutions did not begin
in <hi>Claudius,</hi> but in <hi>Nero,</hi> neither did they end in <hi>Domitian,</hi>
but in <hi>Dioclesian, Maximian, Galerius,</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> neither
did any remarkable thing happen in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and
end in the days of <hi>Domitian,</hi> so as to force us to begin the
account in the one, and end it in the other. 2. It cannot
be made intelligible how the Angel could say to <hi>Iohn</hi> at the
<hi>Revelation</hi> of these Visions, <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> meaning thereby
<hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> if so be these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55629:17"/>
were revealed to <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> for
these <hi>five were not fallen</hi> then, but <hi>Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and
<hi>Vitellius</hi> did succeed him in the Throne, and were not fallen
while he lived. 3. It is past my intelligence to make it good,
that these Visions were received by <hi>John</hi> in the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and not committed to writing till the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
who began his Reign fifteen years after <hi>Claudius</hi>'s decease,
for <hi>John</hi> did write his Visions presently, as soon as he received
them, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 4. and was commanded so to do,
<hi>Rev. 1. 19. Rev.</hi> 22. 10. 4. It is past my capacity to conceive
that all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the beginning
of the sixth Chapter, to the end of the ninth, besides some of
them that follow after, were fulfilled before the destruction of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian;</hi> and yet to think (as they do) that they
were committed to writing in the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> for then
the <hi>Revelation</hi> should be written, and sent to the Churches,
after most of the Prophecies were past. Lastly, It cannot be
made intelligible unto me, that <hi>John</hi> should commit these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to writing in the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and yet see the name
of the <hi>Beast</hi> (as they say he did) in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> for
then he should write these Visions before some of them were
revealed. See more of this <hi>c. 17. q. 2. p.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether <hi>John</hi> received the <hi>Revelation</hi> at several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
times, or all at once in one day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If any one will say, that <hi>John</hi> received the <hi>Revelation</hi>
not all together at one time, but at several distant times, as the
Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> did his Visions, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1. 1. Let me request him
to tell us what Visions <hi>John</hi> received at one time, and what Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
at another time, for unless he can and will do that, why
should any one believe him?</p>
                  <p>2. If any one suppose that <hi>John</hi> received some Visions in
the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and did defer the writing of them till the
time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Vespasian</hi> when he received more Visions,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55629:18"/>
this were to do the <hi>Apostle</hi> injury, who was to write his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
presently, and send them to the Churches presently, and
not defer them till a long time after, <hi>Rev. 1. 11. Rev.</hi> 22. 10.
and <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 4. He was about to write presently what the seven
thunders had spoken, and had so done, if he had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to conceal it.</p>
                  <p>3. If any one shall think, that <hi>John</hi> received some Visions
in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and did write them then, and that
he received other Visions in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
and did write them then; this were to make two Books of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> and one of them is supposed to be written in the
time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the other in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If any man imagine, that <hi>John</hi> received the Vision of the
seven Churches first, and did write it presently, and send it to
the Churches by it self, and that afterward he received more
Visions at several times, and did write them at several distant
times as he did receive them, this were to make two or more
Books of the <hi>Revelation</hi> as was said before. And if it be said,
that when he had received all, he did write the first Visions
over again, and add the latter to them, and put them into one
volume, this were to make the Apostle do things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and write some of his Visions twice, and send them to
the Churches twice, which we cannot find that any of the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did. <hi>Besides,</hi> this is a meer imagination, and every
thing they say in this point is but meer imagination and no more:
but let them imagine what they will, I prove it was not so
by this Argument. If <hi>John</hi> were commanded at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of his Visions, to write his Visions all together, and
send them to the Churches all together, then he did not write
the first Vision by it self, and send it to the Churches by it self,
without the rest: but <hi>John</hi> was commanded at the first entrance
of his Visions, to write his Visions all together, and send them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55629:18"/>
to the Churches all together: therefore he did not write the
first Vision by it self, and send it to the Churches by it self
without the rest. The minor is proved, <hi>Rev. 1. 19. VVrite the
things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the
things which shall be hereafter:</hi> where by <hi>the things which he had
seen,</hi> is meant, the Vision of the seven <hi>Golden Candlesticks,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the first Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. by the <hi>things
which are,</hi> is meant, the things which Christ should reveal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, concerning the present state of the seven Churches,
and they are spoken of in the second and third chapters, with
which some prophecies concerning the future state of the
seven Churches are mixt; and by the <hi>things which shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi>
is meant, the Prophecies from the fourth Chapter to the
end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now had he said at this time, which
was the first entrance of his Visions, <hi>VVrite the things which
thou hast seen,</hi> and <hi>the thing which are,</hi> and no more, he might
have written the three first chapters by themselves without the
other: but in regard he saith at this time, which was the first
entrance of his Visions, <hi>VVrite the things which thou hast seen,
and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter,</hi> he
might not write any one of them by themselves, but he was to
write them all together, and send them to the Churches all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>5. If <hi>John</hi> received his Visions at several distant times, as
the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> did his, it is likely he would have told us
of it, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> doth, who <hi>c.</hi> 7. 1. tell us that the
Vision which he then saw, was in the first year of <hi>Belshasar,</hi>
and <hi>c.</hi> 8. 1. he tells us that the Vision which he then saw,
was in the third year of <hi>Belshasar;</hi> and 'tis likely, that if <hi>John</hi> had
received his Visions at several distant times, he would have told
us of it, as <hi>Daniel</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>6. There be many differences between the Visions of the
Prophet <hi>Esai,</hi> and the Visions of the Apostlical Prophet <hi>John;</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55629:19"/>
as, 1. The Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> saith expresly, that his Visions were
in the days of <hi>Vzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Kings
of <hi>Juda, Esa.</hi> 1. 1. but <hi>John</hi> makes no mention of any other
day that he received his Visions, than on the Lords day,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. 2, The Visions as well of <hi>Esai</hi> as of <hi>John,</hi> were
when both of them were in a trance; but herein they differ,
that the trances of <hi>Esai</hi> were at distant times, some in one
Kings Reign, and some in another Kings Reign, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
confesseth, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1. 1. but the trances of <hi>John</hi> were all of
them upon the Lords day, and upon no other, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.
3. The Visions which the Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> saw concerning <hi>Iuda,</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were so many Sermons which he Preached to
the people at several times, far distant one from other, and
they were so many, and so long, that he could not preach
them all in one day, therefore of necessity there was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
between his preaching of one Sermon, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another: but the Visions of the Apostolical Prophet
<hi>Iohn</hi> were not preached <hi>Sermons,</hi> but mental <hi>Revelations</hi> which
he was to write, and send unto the Churches all at once, and
they were not so many, nor so long, but they could be seen,
and be written by him too, all in one day. 4. The writings
of the Prophet <hi>Esai,</hi> be but the heads of the Sermons which
he preached, the Sermons for the words were a great deal lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Apostolical Prophet <hi>Iohn,</hi> is
the full substance of what he saw and heard, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the words. 5. The Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> was at liberty to
go and preach unto the people, Sermon after Sermon; but
the Apostlical Prophet <hi>Iohn</hi> was not at liberty to travel to the
Churches, and Preach one day to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and
another day to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and other days to the
other Churches, as he must have done, had he preached the
<hi>Revelation</hi> to them, the places being far distant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
therefore he was necessitated to write his <hi>Revelation</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55629:19"/>
the Churches, and send it all together, and his Commission was
so to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p>7. There was not any considerable intermission between
one Vision and another, excepting onely at the opening of the
seventh seal, where there was an intermission (not of <hi>Iohns</hi>
ecstasie, for he was in the Spirit all that while, but an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
of father <hi>Revelations</hi> for the space of half an hour,
and no longer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 1. but between the other Visions
there was not such an intermission, but as soon as one was
past, the other came immediately without any considerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,
as you may read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14.</p>
                  <p>8. The Book sealed with seven seals, was revealed all at
once, and not at several times far distant one from other,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 1. now that Book contained in it all the Prophecies
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as shall be proved when we come unto the
tenth chapter.</p>
                  <p>9. The seven Trumpets were presented to the Apostle all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 2. and so were the seven vials too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 7.
and he did not see one Trumpet in one year, and another
Trumpet in another year, nor one Vial in one Kings Reign,
and another Vial in another Kings Reign, but he saw them
successively all together: and because all the Prophecies in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eighth chapter downward, do belong
to these two, therefore they were revealed when they were:
The Prophecy in the eleventh chapter, which concerns the
two witnesses, doth belong to the sixth Trumpet, and was
revealed when that Trumpet was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth chapters, do
belong to the seventh Trumpet, and were revealed when that
Trumpet was; and the Prophecy concerning the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi>
in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth chapters, doth
belong to the seventh Vial, and was revealed when that Vial
was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 19. and consequently all the Prophecies in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55629:20"/>
the <hi>Revelation</hi> from the eighth chapter downward, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
all together, not at several distant times, but successively
one after another, without an interval between the Prophecy
which immediately goes before, and the Prophecy which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follows after.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Iohn</hi> received all his Visions when he was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and there is no mention that <hi>Iohn</hi> was in the Spirit any
other day than on the <hi>Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1. 10. and he saith the
<hi>Lords day</hi> in the singular number, and not the <hi>Lords days</hi> in the
plural number.</p>
                  <p>11. If <hi>Iohn</hi> received the Visions of the <hi>Revelation</hi> at several
distant times, some in one Kings Reign, and some in another
Kings Reign, then seeing he returned from exile, as they say,
in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time, I would intreat them to tell me, whether
every time he received a Vision after <hi>Claudius</hi>'s death he were
not carried by the Spirit into <hi>Patmos</hi> to receive it, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it elsewhere? and seeing he saw the name of the <hi>Beast,</hi>
as they say, in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, whether he were not carried
by the Spirit into <hi>Patmos</hi> to see that name, and recarried back
again to <hi>Ephesus</hi> after he had seen it? These inventions do not
become the Pens of learned men: but if they will suppose or
invent such things as these and deliver them for truth, it
becomes not any man to believe such feigned imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Iohn</hi> received all his Visions in a trance, and how many
trances was he in if he received them at sundry times, and
not at once? We read but of one trance that he was in, and
that was in <hi>Patmos</hi> on the <hi>Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1. 9, 10. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he received his Visions all at once before he was out of that
trance.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> shall come
to pass in <hi>Asia,</hi> or in <hi>Europe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Prophecies were written unto <hi>Asia,</hi> and not unto
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55629:20"/>
                     <hi>Europe, Rev.</hi> 1. 4. 11. therefore in all likelyhood they have
their accomplishment in <hi>Asia</hi> chiefly, if not in <hi>Asia</hi>
only.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Iohn</hi> was to write both the things which are, and the
things which shall be hereafter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 19. Now by the
things which are, is meant the things which are in <hi>Asia;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the things which shall be hereafter, is meant the things
which shall hereafter be in <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Christ himself doth make the chief scene of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
to be <hi>Asia, Rev. 22. 16. I Jesus have sent mine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to testifie unto you these things in the Churches,</hi> so we read
in the <hi>English,</hi> but in the <hi>Greek</hi> 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Churches, so that the Churches are the scene of the
Prophecies, though not the adequate scene of them all, yet
the scene of many of them, and the things he writes to them
of, are concerning the Churches, or which is all one, they
shall befall the Churches; and what is meant by the Churches,
but the Churches of <hi>Asia? Rev.</hi> 1. 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>4. To what purpose should he write to <hi>Asia</hi> the fates and
destinies of another Country, and not acquaint them with the
fates and destinies of their own? But if the scene of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
be <hi>Europe,</hi> what doth he else but acquaint them with
the fates and destinies of another Country, and neglect to tell
them the fates and destinies of their own?</p>
                  <p>5. What be the places which are named in the Prophecies,
and made the Scene where they shall be acted? be they not
<hi>Ierusalem, Sion, Babylon,</hi> the <hi>East,</hi> and the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
and where shall we find these places but in <hi>Asia?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 9. 14.</note>
though not in <hi>Asia Minor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 2. 8.</note> yet in <hi>Asia Major,</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi> is concerning both
<hi>Asia</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 1.</note> and the things spoken of in the Epistles to
the seven Churches are concerning <hi>Asia Minor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 12.</note> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
which follow afterward concerning <hi>Asia Major,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55629:21"/>
not secluding <hi>Asia Minor</hi> from having a share in them
also.</p>
                  <p>6. That which I drive at in this question, is against those
which make the chief Scene of the Prophecies to be <hi>Europe,</hi>
and will have none of them come to pass in <hi>Asia,</hi> except the
Prophecy of the sixth Trumpet, concerning the four Angels
which were bound at <hi>Euphrates, Rev.</hi> 9. 14. when as the chief
Scene of the Prophecies is <hi>Asia,</hi> and but very few of them shall
come to pass in <hi>Europe,</hi> and those few are such as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them both, such as is the Prophecy of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the dead, of the final Judgment, and of the end of
the World, which concern all persons throughout the World,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>7. The seat of the Holy War was <hi>Iudaea,</hi> yet the Soldiers
that Warred there against the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi>
and such is the case here; the main seat of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
is <hi>Asia,</hi> yet the Countries near adjoyning may feel
the smart of them, as <hi>Europe</hi> felt the smart of the Holy War
which was waged in <hi>Iudaea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. The Prophecy of the final Judgment doth concern all the
World; yet the place where it shall be managed, and to which
they shall be brought to Judgment is <hi>Iudaea:</hi> So the Prophecies of
the <hi>Revelation,</hi> may some of them concern <hi>Europe,</hi> as well
as <hi>Asia,</hi> yet the Scene in which they shall be acted, is rather
<hi>Asia</hi> than <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be of a long
continuance, or a short?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If all the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be of a short
continuance, God hath left his Church without a Prophecy
to the end of the World, for there is no Prophecy which
doth reach so far, except <hi>Daniel</hi> or the <hi>Revelation;</hi> but they say
the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> ended with the destruction of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and if the <hi>Revelation</hi> ends then too, or a little
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55629:21"/>
after, where have we a Prophecy to the end of the
World?</p>
                  <p>2. We have a Prophecy in the fifth seal, which begins
with <hi>How long Lord, Holy and true, Rev.</hi> 6. 10. therefore 'tis
a long time before that Prophecy of the fifth seal is to begin,
and consequently it is a long time before the Prophecies of
the four first Seals shall have an end.</p>
                  <p>3. We have in the twentieth chapter, a Prophecy of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years long; now a thousand years are not of a short, but
of a long continuance.</p>
                  <p>4. There is but a little space, it may be less than a year,
between the thousand years, and the last Judgment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 3.
and there is also set down what shall come to pass in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
space, to wit the insurrection, and destruction of <hi>Gog.</hi>
and <hi>Magog, Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 9, 10. therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi>
is a Prophecy reaching to the last Judgment.</p>
                  <p>5. We have in that twentieth chapter, a Prophecy of the
last Judgment it self, and a large description of it, from the
eleventh verse, to the end of the chapter, therefore the
<hi>Revelation</hi> is a Prophecy reaching not only to the last Judgment,
but takes the last Judgment in to boot.</p>
                  <p>6. We may go a little further, and say, that in the one
and twentieth, and two and twentieth chapters, we have a
Prophecy of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the eternal City of the blessed,
and of the <hi>Lake of fire,</hi> burning with Brimstone, the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
habitation of the damned; therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not only to the last Judgment inclusively, but goes beyond
it, and speaks in general of what shall come to pass after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were of short
continuance, what is the reason that <hi>Christ</hi> is not come to
Judgment all this while? is it not because the Prophecies of
the <hi>Revelation</hi> which goe before it, are not yet fulfilled? for if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55629:22"/>
they were, <hi>Christ</hi> would come to Judgment presently, and
not defer his coming a moment longer; and if <hi>Christ</hi> should
come to Judgment to morrow, the Prophecies of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which go before it, would be fulfilled before to morrow;
and if <hi>Christ</hi> should defer his coming until another year, or
until another age be over, it is because the Prophecies of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> which go before his coming will not be fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I will not take upon me to determine when the day
of Judgment shall begin, but my opinion is, 'tis farther off
than many men suppose, it may be six thousand years from
the Creation of the World shall be expired first, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
thousand shall be the day of Judgment; and he that
lives two hundred, or three hundred years hence, and finds
that <hi>Christ</hi> is not then come to Judgment, let him know the
reason is, because the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> which go
before that day, are not then fulfilled, and that <hi>Christ</hi> will
defer his coming till they be: And as when he suffered on the
Cross, he remained alive upon the Cross till all things were
fulfilled, and then gave up the Ghost, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 28. 30. so
<hi>Christ</hi> will not come to Judgment, but abide in Heaven,
where he is, until the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be fulfilled
which go before that day; and as soon as that is done, then
<hi>Christ</hi> will come to Judgment and not defer it any longer, as
we may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. And if it shall be asked of me what
Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be yet behind, and unfulfilled?
I answer, there is the destruction of <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog, Rev.</hi> 20.
8, 9. there is the thousand years in the same chapter, there
is the destruction of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>false Prophet, Rev.</hi> 19, 20, 21.
there is the destruction of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17, and 18. and for
ought we yet know, all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
from the first Seal to the end of the Book are yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But what then is the meaning of the words <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55629:22"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>things that must shortly come to pass,</hi> do not
these words imply that all the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi>
were shortly to begin, and speedily to have an end?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The words <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. are not to be extended to
all the Prophecies in the Book, but to the things spoken of
in the Epistles to the seven Churches, and no farther; and
the meaning of them is, that the things spoken of in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
to the seven Churches were shortly to begin, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to have an end, but the Prophecies which follow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the Book sealed with seven Seals, were not to begin
so soon, nor speedily to have an end. 2. There is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
opposition, between <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>things which must
shortly be done, Rev.</hi> 1. 1. and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>things
which must be done hereafter, Rev.</hi> 4. 1. now the latter of
these, that is, <hi>the things which must be done hereafter,</hi> mentioned
<hi>c.</hi> 4. 1. is the preface to the Prophecies contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
chapters; therefore the first of these, <hi>the things which
must shortly be done,</hi> mentioned <hi>c.</hi> 1. 1. is the preface to the
things spoken of before in the Epistles to the seven Churches,
contained in the three first chapters, and to end where they
do end. And I find that some are of the mind, that the
Vision of the seven Churches was written first, and sent unto
the Churches by it self before any of the rest was written,
or revealed unto <hi>John;</hi> and if that were true, it were then
out of question, that the words <hi>c.</hi> 1. 1. are a preface to the
three first chapters, and not unto the whole Book. But 3. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the words <hi>c.</hi> 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>things which must
shortly be done,</hi> are to be extended to the whole Book, as a
Preface thereunto, upon that supposition, I say, the meaning
of them is, not that all the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are
of a short continuance, but the meaning rather is, that they
shortly shall begin, but after they are once begun, they are
to be of long continuance before they have an end; for they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55629:23"/>
are to teach to the last Judgment, and beyond it too, <hi>Rev. 20.

                  <p>5. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the scope of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be to comfort
the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> against the persecution of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
by acquainting them with their destruction near approaching?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> was past before the
<hi>Revelation</hi> was made known to <hi>John,</hi> the one was in the time
of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> the other in the time of <hi>Domitian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>John</hi> knew of the destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> before he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
into <hi>Patmos,</hi> but he knew not of the <hi>Revelation</hi> till after
he was there.</p>
                  <p>3. Christ had sufficiently foretold his Disciples of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his life-time, <hi>Mat. 24. Mark. 13. Luk.</hi> 21.
and therefore there needed not a second <hi>Revelation</hi> of the same
thing to <hi>John</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>4. There is not one Syllable of the destruction of the
<hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in all the <hi>Revelation.</hi> That Prophecy <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.
13. is not meant of the destruction of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> rather, and is not yet fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>5. There is not one Syllable of consolation to the
Churches, taken from the destruction of the <hi>Iews</hi> near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</p>
                  <p>6. The Epistles to the seven Churches are not spent in
consolations taken from the destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
but in reproofs and menaces for their sins, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them with their own destruction, unless they did amend,
as you may see, <hi>Rev. 2. 4, 5, 14, 16, 20, 22, 23. Rev.</hi> 3. 2,
3, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>7. The destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not terminate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the <hi>Christians,</hi> but they were persecuted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
more than they were before, and there was but
one general persecution before the destruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and that was in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55629:23"/>
but there were nine general persecutions afterward.</p>
                  <p>8. If any will extend the destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the
time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> this will not terminate the persecutions of
the <hi>Christians</hi> neither, for there were but three persecutions
before his time, the fourth was in his Reign, and there were
six persecutions afterward.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the six first Seals were fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> at
and before the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian?</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No Prophecy is fulfilled before it be revealed: but these
six first Seals were revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi>
and therefore not fulfilled at and before the destruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
by <hi>Vespasian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. No man was ever cast into a trance to behold things
which he was told of before: but <hi>Iohn</hi> was told by <hi>Christ</hi>
in his life-time, the things which should happen in <hi>Iudaea</hi>
at and before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
therefore he was not cast into a trance for such a <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. No man did write the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Iohn:</hi> but if the six first Seals be meant: of the things
which shall happen in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at and before the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian, Mathew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> did write
thereof, as well as <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that more copiously and
plainly than is here delivered, see <hi>Mat. 24. Mark 13.
Luk.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>4. No Prophecy is of things useless, or needless: but if the
six first Seals be meant of the affairs of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at and before the
destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> this Prophecy might very
well have been spared, for it was well known before, and <hi>Iohn</hi>
might have said unto the Angel which shewed him these

things, Why am I cast into a trance, and made believe that
I should see things which no man ever saw before, and of
such concernment as no man in Heaven, or in the earth, or
under the earth was counted worthy to reveal save <hi>Christ</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?
and now I have seen the six first Seals opened, of
this so highly praised, commended, magnified, and extolled
prophetical Book, as no Book ever was the like, alas! what
am I the better for it? I have seen no more than I knew
before.</p>
                  <p>5. Let us take a view of the several Seals in order, and
we shall find that not any one of them was fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi>
at or before the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as some
would make us believe they were.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the first Seal, which is a Prophecy of a
<hi>white Horse, and he that sate thereon, had a Bow, and a Crown
was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
but no such thing was fulfilled in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at or before
the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in a literal sense, which is the
cause they fly unto a mystical, and understand the Prophecy
of the conquest of the Gospel: but it will not serve their turn,
for the Scene of the Gospel is the World, and not the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
confines of <hi>Judaea,</hi> from whence it was removed before
this Prophecy was revealed, <hi>Mat. 21. 43. Act.</hi> 13. 46.
To which may be added, that the first Seal ends before the
second Seal begins, but the Gospel shall continue to the Worlds
end.</p>
                  <p>The second Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>red Horse, and power
was given to him that sat thereon, to take peace from the earth,
and that they should kill one another, and there was given unto
him a great Sword,</hi> but when was this Tragedy acted in <hi>Judaea?</hi>
The intestine slaughters of <hi>Jews</hi> among themselves will not
amount unto a War, and if they would, yet they were not
such noted ones, nor so numerous as these shall be, to which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55629:24"/>
may be added, that the rider on this Red Horse was to
take peace from the <hi>earth,</hi> which word is too large to be
confined to the narrow compass of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the
<hi>Zelots</hi> slew their Brethren, not on Horse-back, but on Foot,
and the <hi>Sicarii</hi> had not great Swords as this Rider had, but
short Pocket Daggers to slay men with, a weapon fitter for
Thieves and Robbers, than such noted Warriers as this Prophecy
aimeth at.</p>
                  <p>The third Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>Black Horse, and he that
sate on him, had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard
a voice in the midst of the four Beasts say, A measure of
Wheat for a penny, and three measures of Barley for a penny,</hi> &amp;c.
which words are either meant of Famine, or of civil Justice;
but the broiles, and tumults in <hi>Judaea</hi> would not suffer civil
Justice to be used. And if we understand this Prophecy of
Famine, where shall we find a noted Famine in <hi>Judaea?</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that which <hi>Agabus</hi> spake of, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 28. or that
which happened in the City, in the time of the Siege: but
neither of these can be meant in this place; not the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the adequate Scene of that Famine was not <hi>Judaea</hi> but
the World, and the time when it happened, was in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which was before <hi>Iohns</hi> banishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Patmos</hi> as themselves confess; and not the second, for the
like reason, because it came to pass at the Siege of the City,
by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> which was before the Prophecy was revealed to
<hi>Iohn,</hi> which was in the Reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi> To which may
be added, that this third Seal begins when the second Seal
doth end, but the slaughters which the <hi>Zelots</hi> committed in
the City, were not ended when the Famine did begin, but
the Famine was the occasion that they slew the people
which denied them bread. Add we further that a <hi>Choenix</hi>
was no <hi>Iewish</hi> measure, and therefore the Prophecy was not
fulfilled in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the time of the Siege, but is to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55629:25"/>
be sought for in those places where a <hi>Choenix</hi> is used.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>pale Horse, and his
name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him,
and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth,
to kill with Sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with
the Beasts of the earth,</hi> but when was this Prophecy fulfilled
in <hi>Iudaea?</hi> for either this Seal is the same for substance with
the two former, or a distinct Seal from them both. If they
say it is the same for substance with the two former, then
seeing the two former were not fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> this Seal
was not fulfilled there neither, and if it be so, that this Seal
is the same with the two former, then there are but six
Seals in all, and not seven. But if they say that this Seal is
distinct from the two former, then besides the great Sword
mentioned in the second Seal, they must find out another
Sword for this Seal, and besides the Famine which they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is meant in the third Seal, they must find out another
Famine for this Seal which as yet they have not done. To
which may be added, that the Scene of this Prophecy is the
fourth part of the <hi>earth,</hi> and therefore not <hi>Iudaea</hi> which is but
a corner of the earth, much less the tetrarchy of <hi>Galilee,</hi>
which is less than the former; for though the Sword was in
<hi>Galilee,</hi> and the War began there, yet when was there a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in <hi>Galilee?</hi> when was there a Pestilence in <hi>Galilee?</hi>
and when were men slain with wild Beasts in <hi>Galilee,</hi> or in
any other Region of <hi>Iudaea?</hi> Doth not <hi>Eusebius</hi> say, that
when the City was taken, the handsomest were reserved for
triumph, the rest that were above seventeen years of age
were sent bound to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be Slaves there, others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
in the Provinces to be torn asunder by wild Beasts, so
that the Scene where this was done is not <hi>Iudaea,</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
afar off.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Seal, is a Prophecy of the <hi>Souls under the Altar,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55629:25"/>
of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which they held,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. but where shall we find any
Martyrs in <hi>Iudaea</hi> before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> except
<hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those that were slain by <hi>Paul</hi> before
his Conversion, <hi>Act. 9. 21. Act. 22. 4. Act.</hi> 26. 10.
but all these are too few to make up such a number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
as the Prophecy aimeth at, for they were without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. Besides, the Prophecy speaks of two ranks
of Martyrs, first the souls under the Altar that cried to God
for vengeance; secondly their fellow Servants, and their
Brethren upon earth, that should be killed as they were:
now if these men can find these Martyrs in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> before
the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and tell me who the first and
second ranks were, I will hearken to them. The multitude
of these Martyrs plainly shews, that they were not all slain
before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the words which
they used in their cry, <hi>How long Lord, Holy and true,</hi> do
also shew that it is a long time before they make their cry,
and longer than that before their fellow Servants, and their
Brethren suffer as they did, and longer than both before
the vengeance which they cry for comes to pass. Let men
consider what they say, doth the Prophecy speak only of the
Martyrs which were slain in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> before the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem?</hi> then it speaks but of three Martyrs, besides those
which were slain by <hi>Paul,</hi> and no more: but if they say that
others be included which were slain in other places, then
the adequate Scene of the Prophecy is not <hi>Iudaea</hi> but the World:
but take we all the Martyrs that were slain in the World,
before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the number is too
few, and the time too short to include all the Martyrs which
the Prophecy speaketh of.</p>
                  <p>The sixth Seal, is a Prophecy of Eclipses of the Sun, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55629:26"/>
Moon, for <hi>the Sun became black as sackcloath of hair, and the
Moon became as blood, v.</hi> 12. but there was but one Eclipse
of the Moon, between <hi>Christs</hi> Ascension, and the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that was in the sixth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
which was before the Prophecy was revealed, for they say
themselves it was not rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>led till the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
and we say it was not revealed till the fourteenth year of
<hi>Domitian;</hi> but take which of these you will, it comes all to
one effect as to this matter, for the Eclipse was in the sixth
year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and so before the Prophecy was revealed,
which way soever we take, and there were but two Eclipses
of the Sun, whereof the first was in the fifth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
before the Prophecy was revealed by their own confession,
the other was in the sixth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was more
visible at <hi>Rome</hi> than at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s were seen
at the time of the Eclipse, and the Eclipse it self was seen
in the midst of their Sacrifices, which the <hi>Senate</hi> caused to be
made for the death of <hi>Agrippina</hi> who was slain by her Son
<hi>Nero;</hi> so that if it portended any thing at all, it was rather
against <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But every one of these Eclipses
were but natural, such as come to pass now a days every year
by the natural course of the Sun and Moon, and Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
can Prognosticate of them before hand: but it is more
likely that the Eclipses which the Prophecy speaks of be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural,
such as that was at our Saviours passion, where
the Sun was Eclipsed, the Moon being at the full, when as
a natural Eclipse doth always happen at the change of the
Moon. It follows in the text, <hi>And the Stars of Heaven fell
unto the earth, even as a Fig Tree casteth her untimely Figs
when she is shaken of a mighty wind,</hi> but if this were done in
<hi>Iudaea,</hi> at or before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who took up
these Stars, and shewed them to <hi>Vespasian?</hi> They cannot say
that these Stars are <hi>mystically</hi> to be understood, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55629:26"/>
understand them literally of meteors: but that there did
such meteors fall from Heaven upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> and in such a
Multitude as the Text speaks of, either at or before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> History is too lame to
bring us tidings of it. <hi>And the Kings of the earth hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
but there were no Kings in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the time of
the Siege, <hi>and the great men, and the rich men, and the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the free-men</hi> that were in it at that time hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not for fear of <hi>Christ</hi> and his wrath, as the men whom
the Prophecy speaks of shall, but for fear of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his
Army. The conclusion therefore is, that this Prophecy was not
fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> either at or before the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> but is yet to be expected.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the first Seal be a Prophecy of the Preaching, and
prevailing of the Gospel?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. No good reason can be given for such an expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>2. The Gospel was preached in all the world for a witness
to all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prevailed very much among them before this
Prophecy was revealed, <hi>Mat. 24. 14. Mark</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>3. There is nothing in the Prophecy which is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
or symbol of the Gospel, but of War and Victory very
fitly.</p>
                  <p>4. By this reckoning this Seal shall never have an end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Church on earth hath an end, for the Gospel, and the
preaching of it shall continue unto the Worlds end, and the
Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Mat.</hi>
16. 18.</p>
                  <p>5. By the Lamb which opened the first Seal, is meant
<hi>Christ;</hi> therefore by the Rider on the white Horse is meant
some other person. Christ was the revealer, and he that sate
upon the white Horse, is the person revealed, the executioner
of the Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55629:27"/>
6. Christs Crown was given unto him before this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was revealed to <hi>John,</hi> but this Rider on the white Horse
who ever he be, was to receive his Crown afterward by virtue of
this Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>7. What Christ doth undertake, he doth bring to pass, and
not desist before the work be finished, but this Rider who ever
he be, <hi>went forth conquering, and to conquer,</hi> that is, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
some, and had a mind to conquer more, but did not finish
the work.</p>
                  <p>8. Christ did threaten the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to take the
Gospel from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. therefore he doth not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in this Seal, that the Gospel should continue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
among them, the event doth shew the contrary at this
day, for the Gospel is removed from thence, and from all the
seven Churches to whom this Prophecy was sent.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> VVhether the third Seal be a Prophecy of Famine, or
of civil justice?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Famine is Prophecied of in the next Seal, therefore
not in this.</p>
                  <p>2. Balances are not an emblem or symbol of Famine, but of
civil Justice rather.</p>
                  <p>3. To eat bread by weight is a sign of Famine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 16.
but if a measure of the finest grain be to be bought for a penny,
and of courser three measures, men should not be afraid of such a
Famine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> p. 316, 319.</p>
                  <p>4. A measure of fine flour for a Shekel, and two measures
of Barley for a Shekel was a Prophecy of plenty in the Gates
of <hi>Samaria, 2 King.</hi> 7. 1. Why may not a measure of Wheat
for a penny, and three measures of Barley for a penny be a
Prophecy of plenty too, or at least of sufficiency if not of
plenty? It is certain that a Shekel was much bigger than a
penny, for a penny was but seven pence half penny of our
money, but a Shekel was fifteen pence at least: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the measure 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 1.
more than the measure <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 6. or how much bigger it was is
very uncertain.</p>
                  <p>5. The word <hi>Choenix</hi> which we translate measure, was as
well a great measure as a small. Now they which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Prophecy of Famine, say that <hi>Choenix</hi> was a small
measure, and did contain so much Wheat as would suffice a
man for one day and no more, and they say a penny was as
much money as a man could earn in one day, and no more.
Now as for the word penny, it is true, it was as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as a man in those times could earn in one day, as may
appear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 2. but as for the word <hi>Choenix</hi> it was no
certain measure, but varied in respect of Nations, places, and
men, and was as well a great measure as a small, of which
see Mr. <hi>Mede Comment. Apocal p.</hi> 21. Yea <hi>Crispin</hi> in his
<hi>Lexicon,</hi> makes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to be half a bushel, and the <hi>Septuagint
Ezek.</hi> 45. 10, 11. make it to be as much as the Hebrew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which
is as much as half a Bushel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Suppose <hi>Choenix</hi> be a small measure and to contain a
quart as some would have it, and no more, yet here is no
great Famine for all that, as was in <hi>Jacobs</hi> time, when there
was no Corn to be had for money in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
but they were forced to travel into <hi>Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> to buy them Corn,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 2. Here be also three measures of Barley for a penny,
and that would serve a man three days, and here be three
measures of Barley for another penny, and that would serve a
man three days more, and if he had a mind to eat wheaten bread
there were four days more in the week, wherein he might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to provide him wheat and other commodities which he
wanted.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> VVhether the Prophecy of the sixth Seal be literally to be
understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Where a literal sense may stand, an allegorical
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55629:28"/>
may not be used: but here a literal sense may stand: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>Revelation</hi> cannot be a <hi>mystery,</hi> nor a <hi>mystery</hi> a <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
they are as contrary each to other, as light is to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
but the Prophecy in this Seal, and all others in this book
are a <hi>Revelation:</hi> therefore not a <hi>mystery,</hi> nor <hi>mystically</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
                  <p>3. Where things are <hi>mystically</hi> to be understood, they are
afterward interpreted in this Book, or in other Texts of
Scripture which speak of the same or the like matter, as
<hi>Rev. 1. 20. Rev.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 17. 23, 24. but here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no such interpretation, the Holy Ghost hath left it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
literally.</p>
                  <p>4. The same or the like things in other places are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be understood, as <hi>Ioel 2. 31. Mat. 24. 29. Mark. 13. 24, 25.
Luk.</hi> 21. 25, 26. and why may they not as well be literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

end? or whether they be already past, or yet to be expected?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is said in the beginning of the fifth Seal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>How long
Lord, Holy and true,</hi> therefore 'tis a long time ere the fifth
Seal is to begin, and consequently it is a long time before the
four first Seals have an end.</p>
                  <p>2. It is said in the close of that Seal, that they <hi>should rest
yet for a little season, until their fellow Servants, and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
which should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled,</hi>
therefore that Seal is to continue but a little season after the cry
of the souls is over, and consequently the seven Trumpets which
contain Gods Judgments on their persecutors are to come short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. The sixth Seal is a Prophecy of the signes which Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate
the day of Judgment, and the second coming of <hi>Christ</hi>
to be near at hand, <hi>Mat. 24. 30. Mark 13. 26. Luk.</hi> 21. 27, 28.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55629:28"/>
therefore the fifth Seal is to continue, and the Saints to
suffer under it till those signs begin; and because those signs
are not yet begun, therefore the fifth Seal is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>4. From the coming of those signs unto the day of Judgment
is but a short time, as our Saviour also saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 33.
therefore all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the sixth
Seal, to the nineteenth chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 11. where the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth commence, are to continue but a short time, and
consequently it is a long time before the four first Seals do end,
and for ought we know, it is a long time before any of them
shall begin.</p>

               <p>1. ANd after these doleful sights were over, I saw farther what
should come to pass in the time of this Prophecy before
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55629:29"/>
the seventh Prophecy should begin, to wit that four Angels
should stand upon the four corners of the earth, upon each
corner one, which should have power over the four winds
that be in the earth to let them loose,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 31.</note> or to keep
them in, that they should not blow upon the earth,
nor upon the Sea, nor upon the Trees, but as they pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>2. And I saw that another Angel should then come
with a Commission from the East, and bring the Seal of the
living God along with him, and that he should cry with a loud
voice to the four Angels which had power to hurt the earth,
and the Sea.</p>
               <p>3. Saying. That they should not hurt the earth,
nor the Sea,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4, 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> nor the Trees, until we have sealed
the Servants of God in their fore-heads.</p>
               <p>4. And I heard the number of them which were to be
Sealed, and they were a hundred and fourty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
young men of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, which are to be reckoned
in this manner.</p>
               <p>5. Of the young men of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> shall be sealed
twelve thousand, of the young men of the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi>
shall be sealed twelve thousand, of the young men of the tribe
of <hi>Gad,</hi> shall be sealed twelve thousand.</p>
               <p>6 Of the young men of the tribe of <hi>Aser,</hi> shall be sealed

               <p>The Prophecy of the blessedness of the not sealed Martyrs after death.</p>
               <p>9. But lest any should be discouraged from suffering for the
cause of Christ, because they be not sealed, and secured from
suffering as the other were, there was presented unto me the
great felicity, and transcendent bliss, which the Martyrs should
enjoy in Heaven at the same time that the sealed ones should
be secured on earth; and I saw they should be more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than the other were, to wit an exceeding great multitude
which no man could number, of all Nations, and kindreds, and
people, and tongues, which should stand before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of God, and before the Lamb in white robes of Glory, and
Palms of triumph in their hands.</p>
               <p>10. Where they shall laud, and praise the Lord for that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Glory, and felicity which they shall be in at this time,
acknowledging, and saying, Salvation proceedeth from the
Lord our God which sits upon the Throne, and from Jesus
Christ the Holy Lamb, and to them be it ascribed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>11. And not only they themselves, but also all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
which are in Heaven, shall laud, and praise the Lord for
that Heavenly bliss and happiness which the Martyrs shall have
in Heaven at that time when the sealed ones are sealed on
earth.</p>
               <p>12. Saying, Amen, Blessing, and Glory, and Wisdom, and
Thanks, and Honor, and Power, and Might be ascribed to the
Lord our God for evermore.</p>
               <p>13. And that I might understand the meaning of the Vision,
one of the four and twenty Elders asked of me, saying,
What be these comely persons, whom thou seest arrayed in
white robes of Glory, and Palms of triumph in their hands,
and from whence came they to that blessed State, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55629:30"/>
degree of happiness which thou seest them now to
have?</p>
               <p>14. And I said, Ah Sir, thou knowest who they are, and
I would learn of thee who they be, and from whence they
came to that blessed State, and transcendent degree of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which I see them in at this time, and what it was that
brought them hither. Then he said unto me, These be the
Holy Martyrs of the Church which were in great affliction
in the World, and suffered death for the cause of Jesus Christ,
and shed their blood for professing of his Gospel, for this
cause it is that they be now in white robes of Glory which were
made so by his blood, and are given them as a reward for their
suffering for him.</p>
               <p>15. For this cause it is that they be now before the Throne
of God, and serve him in the Church Triumphant, as in their
life-time they did in the Church Militant, and God shall dwell
with them, and be their God.</p>
               <p>16. They suffered hunger heretofore, but now they suffer it
no more, they suffered thirst heretofore, but now they shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it no more, they suffered persecution heretofore, but they
shall suffer it no more.</p>
               <p>17. For Jesus Christ shall feed them with his Heavenly Food,
and give them drink of his Heavenly Well, and God shall wipe
all tears from off their eyes, so that no sorrow shall come near
them.</p>

are distinctly reckoned by their names, of the tribe of
<hi>Juda,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. Where the tribes of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

from the <hi>Gentiles, v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>4. If by the tribes of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> be not meant
the <hi>Jews</hi> only, how shall we know when they are only spoken
of in Scripture? and when not? or whether they be onely
spoken of by that name at all?</p>
                  <p>5. I find that the word <hi>Israel</hi> is sometimes put for <hi>Jacob,
Gen.</hi> 32. 28. sometimes for the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,
Exod.</hi> 5. 2. sometimes for the ten tribes only, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 15. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Godly People of that Nation, and no more, <hi>Rom.
9. 6. Gal.</hi> 6. 16. But if any one can find, that by that word
is meant the Godly <hi>Gentiles</hi> only, or the Church of God in
general consisting both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> let him cite the
place, and prove it so to be, and I will be of his mind.</p>
                  <p>6. The tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> is not the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> nor the tribe
of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> &amp;c. and if by these words we
understand the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what Nation shall we understand by
the tribe of <hi>Juda?</hi> what Nation by the tribe of <hi>Reuben?</hi> and
what Nation by the tribe of <hi>Gad?</hi> and so of all the rest. And
if it be said, That by the tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> is meant the tribe that
doth confess God, and by the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the tribe that
doth behold the Son, and by the tribe of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Aser</hi> a bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
company, what is this but to turn the propet names of
men into appellatives, and to confound the tribes one with
another? and make no distinction at all between them? For
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55629:31"/>
                     <hi>Reuben</hi> doth confess God as well as <hi>Juda,</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Son by Faith as well as <hi>Reuben,</hi> and both of them
are a blessed company. Yea, it were to make but one tribe
of all the twelve, for all the twelve tribes do confess God,
and behold the Son by Faith, and all the twelve tribes are a
blessed company, and not one or two only. And if we should
translate the Hebrew proper names of men, and put them
into appellative, as the first of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the third of
<hi>Luke,</hi> and as some would have it the nine first Chapters of the
first Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> we shall make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mad translation of
the Bible, and meer nonsence of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>7. If by the tribes of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> be meant the
Church in general, then by the tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> is meant some
Church or other in particular; and if so, then let me request
them to tell me what that Church is? what Church is meant
by the tribe of <hi>Juda?</hi> what Church by the tribe of <hi>Reuben?</hi>
and what Church by the tribe of <hi>Gad?</hi> and so of all the
rest. But to these questions they have hitherto held their
peace.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the definite number of the Sealed be definitely
to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If the definite number of the sealed be put for an
indefinite, how shall we know when such a number is definitely
to be understood? and when not?</p>
                  <p>2. A whole number, such as 10. 20. 30. 40. and the like,
may be taken indefinitely, and is so taken in this Book,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. but a broken number, such as 120. 130. 140. and
the like, are never so taken. Now the number of the sealed
is a broken number 144000, and so is 42 a broken number,
and 1260 a broken number, and such numbers are never taken
indefinitely. See Annotations of certain Learned Divines,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
                  <p>3. Where a number is opposed to an indefinite, it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55629:31"/>
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e understood; but the number of the sealed is opposed
to an indefinite, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>4. Where a number is exactly told, and total'd it is definite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be understood: now the number of the sealed is exactly
told, and total'd, and when he saith, <hi>v. 4. I heard the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them which were sealed,</hi> his meaning is, he heard the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
number of them, after they were told, and the total num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was 144000, neither more nor less: and when afterward
he saith, <hi>I beheld, and lo a great multitude which no man could
number,</hi> his meaning is, they were not told, and summed up
as the former were, and therefore he could not set down the just
number of them, as he had done of the other.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether all the <hi>Jews</hi> were sealed, or but some on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The number of the sealed were one hundred
fourty and four thousand, and no more; but if all the <hi>Jews</hi>
were told, and total'd, they would far exceed that number,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>2. There be as many sealed of one tribe as of another,
but it is not likely, that at the execution of the Prophecy,
there shall be no more person living of one tribe than of
another. We read <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 21. 23. 25. that when the tribes
were numbred, the Children of <hi>Simeon</hi> were more than the
Children of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> were more
than the Children of <hi>Gad</hi> at that time, and so of other tribes
there spoken of some were more than others; and so of every
tribe that shall be sealed at the execution of this Prophecy,
it is likely, that some tribes have more than others living
upon earth, and not that every tribe hath just twelve
thousand persons living at the time of sealing, and no
more.</p>
                  <p>3. All the <hi>Jews</hi> cannot be sealed because the whole
tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is left out, and not any one of them sealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55629:32"/>
4. It is likely that in the opposite number to the sealed,
there be some <hi>Jews</hi> among them, and that they likewise are
included under <hi>all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues</hi>
mentioned <hi>v</hi> 9. and not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>5. If all the <hi>Jews</hi> should be sealed at this time, then from
the time of this sealing none of them could suffer Martyrdom;
but we find afterward that many of them suffer Martyrdom
for the Faith of <hi>Christ</hi> under the Beast, <hi>Rev. 12. 17. Rev.</hi>
13. 7.</p>
                  <p>6. The first Fruits are less than all; but these sealed ones are
the first Fruits and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                  <p>7. It may well be thought that these sealed ones be men,
and not women, and that for these reasons. 1. Because it is
not usual in Scripture, to count the number of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but of men only: thus when they went into <hi>Egypt</hi> the
men are counted, and not the women, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 8, 9, &amp;c.
and again when they came forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the men were
counted, and not the women, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2. 20, 21. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
so the like in other places, the males are counted, and not
the Females, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.
and therefore these that are counted here, be only Males,
and not Females. 2. The first Fruits that were dedicated to
God of men, and of Beasts, were the Males only, and we
may not think that the first Fruits were only of vegetables,
for then these sealed ones could not be first Fruits, as they
are said to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. but the first born of men and
Beasts were first Fruits as well as vegetables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 29, 30.
and such were males only, <hi>Exod. 34. 19, 20. Exod.</hi> 13. 2. 12. 15.
Now these sealed ones are called the first Fruits of God, and
to the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. not in respect of sanctification, as
all believers are, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18. but by peculiar dedication to
God, and to the Lamb, as the first born were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be Males only. 3. Because these are said to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55629:32"/>
redeemed from among men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. Now what redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is this? not the common redemption, by the blood of
Christ from sin, and condemnation which belongs to all the
elect in general, but the peculiar redemption of the first born
which belongs to the Males only, <hi>Exod. 13. 2. 12. 13. 15.
Exod.</hi> 34. 19, 20. Lastly, because it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4.
These are they which were not defiled with Women, and
therefore they be men, and not women; and what kind of
defilement doth he mean? not a spiritual defilement with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;</hi>
which is as much as to say, that these men be not <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
nor yet a carnal defilement with <hi>Harlots,</hi> which is as
much as to say, that these men be not <hi>Adulterers:</hi> but a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
defilement with <hi>VVives,</hi> which is as much as to say,
that these men be <hi>Virgins,</hi> and unmarried persons, and had not
known a woman, of which kind of defilement see <hi>Exod. 19. 15.
1 Sam. 21. 4, 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> VVhat kind of Seal is meant in this place? whether the
Seal of Sanctification, or of corporal preservation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The seal of sanctification is not committed to the
Angels, but to the Spirit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. but the seal here
spoken of, is committed to the Angels, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>2. The seal of sanctification is chiefly inward in the
heart; but this here spoken of, is only outward in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>3. They are called the Servants of God before that they be seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>v.</hi> 3. and therefore they are sanctified before this seal is given
unto them.</p>
                  <p>4. The seal of sanctification is a common seal, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to all believers; but this is peculiar to the persons here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
                  <p>5. The seal of sanctification doth not exempt from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
danger, <hi>Rev. 11. 7. Rev.</hi> 13. 7. But this is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given them, that their bodies might not be hurt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55629:33"/>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4. see the like <hi>Ezek. 9. 4, 5, 6. Exod. 12. 13. Gen.</hi>
4. 15.</p>
                  <p>6. The seal of sanctification is given successively in all
ages of the World; but these are sealed all at once in one
day.</p>
                  <p>7. The seal of sanctification is given by degrees to some more,
to others less; but these are all sealed alike, one as far forth as
another.</p>
                  <p>8. The seal of sanctification doth admit degrees after it is
given, and a man is sanctified more at one time than another,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. but these were sealed as much at one time as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
and as the mark which <hi>Cain</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 15. and which
the men in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. did not diminish or increase,
so the seal which these men had, continued in the same condition
all their life afterward.</p>
                  <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> VVhether the great multitude mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 9. were
sealed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is not said that they were sealed, and therefore
we may not think they were, unless we have some reason for
it.</p>
                  <p>2. They are a distinct company from the sealed, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. They are more in number than the sealed, and therefore
they could not all be sealed, for the number of the sealed is
but finite, one hundred fourty and four thousand, and no more;
but this great multitude were so many that no mortal man could
number them, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew the sealed who they were, and what their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was, <hi>v.</hi> 4. but he knew not these who they were, nor the
number of them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                  <p>5. The sealed were preserved from destruction, and the
seal was therefore given, that they might be secured, <hi>v. 1, 2,
3. Rev.</hi> 9. 4. But <hi>these are they which came out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
and have washed their robes, and made them white in

the blood of the Lamb v.</hi> 14. and therefore these be Martyrs,
but the others are not.</p>
                  <p>6. The sealed be the men which are to live in the time
of the seven Trumpets, but are not to suffer under them,
<hi>Rev. 9. 4. Rev.</hi> 14. 3, 4. but these latter be the men which
shall suffer for the Faith of Christ before the Trumpets shall
begin; and the reason why they are introduced in this place,
is not to shew the time or causes of their sufferings, but to
shew the blissful state, and happiness which they have in
Heaven at this very time, when the other shall be sealed
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>7. The sealed be the men which are to get the Victory
over the <hi>Beast,</hi> and over his mark, and over the number of
his name, <hi>Rev. 14. 2, 3. Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3. but these latter
be the men which shall die for the Faith of Christ before
the <hi>Beast</hi> begins his Reign, and shall be then in Heaven, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable
bliss and happiness, when the other shall be sealed
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>8. The sealed be some eminent members of the Church
Militant, which shall be in jeopardy of their lives in the
time of the ensuing Prophecies, but are therefore sealed that
they might be preserved from suffering in the time of those
dangers: the latter be some eminent members of the Church
Triumphant, which suffered while they lived, but when the
sealed ones are sealed, they shall be in Heaven secured from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any more.</p>

                  <head>The Prophecy of the seventh Seal, divided into seven Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
called seven Trumpets.</head>
                  <p>1. ANd when he had opened the seventh Seal, it did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
appear what the Prophecy of that Seal should
be, there came nothing forth of that Roll as there did out of
the other Rolls to shew the Prophecy thereof, whereupon there
was silence in Heaven for the space of half an hour, every one
expecting what would happen, and shew the Prophecy of this
seventh Seal.</p>
                  <p>2. And after the space of half an hour, I saw there were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the seven mighty Angels which stood before the Throne
of God, seven Trumpets, whereby I understood, that these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Trumpets contain the Prophecy of the seventh Seal.</p>
                  <p>3. And when they had received their Trumpets, another
Angel came and stood at the Altar, where the Souls were that
prayed to God for Vengeance of their bloud, with a Golden
Censer in his hand, and much sweet Incense in it, that he might
add it to the prayers of the Saints which were under the Altar;
that as they prayed for Vengeance of their bloud, before their
fellow Servants and their Brethren were slain, so now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
slain, take up the same Request again, and their fellow
Servants and their Brethren joyn with them therein, and the
Angel offers Incense upon the Altar at the same time.</p>
                  <p>4. And the Incense which the Angel offered was added to
the prayers of the Saints, so that the prayers of the Saints
which were under the Altar did not ascend alone, but the
smoke of the Incense which the Angels offered, ascended with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55629:34"/>
them, and both of them made a sweet perfume before Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God.</p>
                  <p>5. And when the Incense was consumed, the Angel took
the fire which remained upon the Altar, and filled the Censer
with it, and cast it to the ground, in token that the Offering of
the Incense with the prayers of the Saints was ended: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after that there was a great Noise of Thundering, and
Lightning, and a very great Earth-quake, denoting God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Judgments which were now to fall upon the World for the
wrong they did to his Saints, and for the bloud of his Saints
which they had shed till this time, and many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <head>The Prophecy of the first Trumpet.</head>
                  <p>6. Then the seven Angels prepared themselves to sound their
Trumpets successively one after another.</p>
                  <p>7. So the first Angel sounded,<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of his Trumpet was,<note place="margin">Ps. 105. 32, 33.</note> that it should rain
Hail, and Fire, and Blood upon the Land of
<hi>Asia,</hi> as heretofore there rained Hail and Fire upon the Land
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so that the third part of Trees should be burnt
up, and all the green Grass should be burnt up, and this is to
be done not in <hi>Europe,</hi> but in <hi>Asia.</hi>

                  <head>The Prophecy of the second Trumpet.</head>
                  <p>8. And after the first Angel, the second Angel sounded,
and the Prophecy of his Trumpet was, that a Sulphureous
Mountain burning with Fire, should be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea of <hi>Asia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 19, 20, 21.</note> and the third part of that Sea
should be turned into Blood, as the Waters of <hi>Egypt</hi>
sometimes were.</p>
                  <p>9. And thereupon the third part of the fish that shall be in
the Sea shall die, and the third part of the Ships shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <head>The Prophecie of the third Trumpet.</head>
                  <p>10. And after him the third Angel sounded, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of his Trumpet was, that a great blazing Star should fall
from Heaven, burning and flaming like a Torch, and that in
burning, it should part asunder, and fall into the third part of
the Rivers, and into the third part of the Springs of waters
throughout the Land of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. And the Name of the Star from that day forward shall
be called Worm-wood, and the third part of the waters shall be
as the juyce of Worm-wood, and many men shall die by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Waters,<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 23.</note> because they be made exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <head>The Prophecy of the fourth Trumpet.</head>

Trumpet was, that the third part of the Sun should be smitten
with darkness, and the third part of the Moon, and the third
part of the Stars, and the day should want the third part of
that Light it had before, and the Night likewise.</p>
                  <p>13. And before the fifth Angel sounded, I saw an Angel
flying through the midst of Heaven, and I heard him say as he
fled along, Wo, wo, wo, to the Inhabitants of the Land of <hi>Asia,</hi>
by reason of the plagues of the three other Angels which are yet
to sound their Trumpets more grievous and calamitous than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the former were.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether the four first Trumpets were fulfilled in <hi>Judaea</hi>
before the Siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and be meant of the
Seditions and Slaughters that were there?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No Prophecy is fulfilled before it be revealed; but
these four Trumpets were revealed to <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55629:35"/>
therefore not fulfilled in <hi>Judaea</hi> before the Siege of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
by <hi>Vespasian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. No Prophecy is fulfilled before it be written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and made known unto the people, for then it is a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and not a Prophecy; but these Visions in their Opinion were
written in the Reign of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> therefore not fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which began in the Reign of
<hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The seventh Seal is not fulfilled before the sixth; but if
these four Trumpets be meant of the seditions and slaughters in
<hi>Judaea,</hi> before the siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a good part of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Seal, even so much of it as is comprized in the four
Trumpets, will be fulfilled before the sixth; for the sixth Seal in
their opinion is a Prophecy of the siege <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it self, and by the
Kings, and the great Men, and the rich Men, which hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Dens, they understand the men that hid themselves in
Caves at the taking of the City.</p>
                  <p>4. If these Trumpets be meant of the seditions and slaughters
of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> what is the difference
between these Trumpets and the second Seal? For they
say the second Seal is meant of the slaughters and seditions of
the <hi>Jews</hi> by one another before the siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and if
these Trumpets be meant of them too, what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them?</p>
                  <p>5. If these Trumpets be a Prophecy of the seditions of the
<hi>Jewes;</hi> why do they not tell us what sedition is meant by the
first Trumpet, what sedition by the second, and what sedition
by the third? And if it be said that they are meant of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in grosse, what is this but to make a <hi>Chaos</hi> of the
<hi>Revelation?</hi> To which may be added, that they told us before,
<hi>Chap. 6. vers.</hi> 1. that the things which <hi>Christ</hi> foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 24. are set down in gross in the sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more particularly as they have their Execution in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55629:36"/>
Chapters following; and now I am come to the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
here be no particulars neither, but the seditions of the
<hi>Jews</hi> in gross, what is this but to gain-say here what they said
before?</p>
                  <p>6. The Angels be not the Authors or Executioners of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but four Angels be the Authors or Executioners of the
four first Trumpets, and the prime Agents under God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they come to pass, as appears not only <hi>vers.</hi> 7. 8. 10. but also
<hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>7. Where shall we find in all the Scripture, that by <hi>Fire</hi> is
meant sedition? I find it sometimes taken for affliction, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and temptation, <hi>Psal. 66. 12. Zach. 13. 9. Mal. 3. 2.
1 Pet.</hi> 4. 12. but for sedition never.</p>
                  <p>8. If by <hi>Fire</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> these Trumpets be meant sedition, what
is meant by <hi>Hail</hi> in the first Trumpet? is that sedition
too? where have they a president for that? How is it that
men interpret Scripture, and have no Scripture for what
they say? To which may be added, that Fire is hot and
dry, but Hail is cold and moist, and how can these two
be symbols of the same thing in one, and the same Prophecy?
surely if the Fire be sedition, the Hail must be some other
thing.</p>
                  <p>9. If by <hi>Fire</hi> be meant sedition, what is meant by <hi>Trees</hi>
and <hi>green Grass</hi> which the Fire burnt up, <hi>v.</hi> 7? Here they
tell us that by <hi>green Grass</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous,</hi> but
what is meant by <hi>Trees</hi> they do not tell us, perhaps they
think that by <hi>Trees</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous</hi> too? but this
is not so, for but the third part of the Trees was burnt
up, but all the green Grass was burnt up, and none left,
and therefore the Grass is one thing, and the Trees another
thing.</p>
                  <p>10. Where shall we find in all the Scripture, that by <hi>green
grass</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous?</hi> True it is, that <hi>green trees</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55629:36"/>
taken for the <hi>righteous, Luk.</hi> 23. 31. but <hi>green Grass</hi>
never.</p>
                  <p>11. The green Grass is opposed to those which have the seal
of God in their foreheads, <hi>Rev. 7. 3. Rev.</hi> 9. 4. now by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is meant the righteous, therefore by the former is meant
some other thing.</p>
                  <p>12. If by <hi>Fire</hi> be meant sedition, what is meant by <hi>Sea</hi>
in the second Trumpet, where 'tis said that a <hi>great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
burning with Fire, was cast into the Sea?</hi> here they tell
us that by <hi>Sea</hi> is meant the <hi>Land of Galilee,</hi> why do they
not also say that by the <hi>earth</hi> in the first Trumpet, upon
which also <hi>Fire</hi> was cast, is meant the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Galilee?</hi> If
this be not to wrest the Scripture, I know not what is; for
if by <hi>Sea</hi> be meant the <hi>Land,</hi> why may they not as well
say, that by <hi>Land</hi> is meant the <hi>Sea?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. If by <hi>Sea</hi> be meant the <hi>Land,</hi> what is meant by <hi>Ships,</hi>
when 'tis said <hi>the third part of Ships were destroyed?</hi> be
there any <hi>Ships</hi> upon the <hi>Land?</hi> Here they tell us that by
<hi>Ships</hi> is meant the <hi>Cities,</hi> why do they not also say that by
<hi>Cities</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is meant the <hi>Ships?</hi> And when 'tis
said <hi>Rev. 16. 19. the great City was divided into three parts,</hi>
why do they not say the meaning is, the great Ship was
divided into three parts? And when 'tis said, <hi>Rev. 17. 18.
the woman which thou sawest is the great City which Reigneth
over the Kings of the earth,</hi> why do they not say the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, the woman is the great Ship which Reigneth over
the Kings of the Sea? But let them tell me indeed, be <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
meant by <hi>Ships?</hi> then when 'tis said <hi>v. 9. the third
part of Ships were destroyed,</hi> the meaning is, the third part
of Cities were destroyed; but History will tell us, that not
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> only, but all the Cities were destroyed by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> except some few only which yielded to them of
their own accord, and there was not one of three, much
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55629:37"/>
less two of three left remaining, which was not destroyed
by them, and the time when this was done, was after the
siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> whenas 'tis here according to
their exposition of the Trumpets set before it, for they will
have the destruction of the Cities be the meaning of the
second Trumpet, and the siege of the City by <hi>Gallus</hi> the
meaning of the fourth Trumpet, which cannot be, because
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> was besieged first by <hi>Gallus,</hi> and the Cities were
destroyed afterward, of which see Bishop <hi>Ussers Annal.
p.</hi> 691, 692.</p>
                  <p>14. If by <hi>Sea</hi> be meant the <hi>Land,</hi> and by <hi>Ships</hi> the <hi>Cities,</hi>
what is meant by the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters</hi> in the
third Trumpet? Here they tell us, that by <hi>Rivers,</hi> and
<hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> is meant the <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>Villages.</hi> Alas
wit, whither wilt thou go? From <hi>Sea</hi> to <hi>Land,</hi> from <hi>Ships</hi>
to <hi>Cities,</hi> from <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> to <hi>Towns</hi>
and <hi>Villages,</hi> and when all this is done the Text will not
bear it, for men died <hi>in the Towns and villages,</hi> but not <hi>of the
Towns and Villages,</hi> but in the Text it is said men died <hi>of
the Waters, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the Waters,</hi> not <hi>in the Waters,</hi> and
the death which they died, was a sickly death, as they that
drink poisoned water do, but the death which the <hi>Jews</hi> died
was a bloody death.</p>
                  <p>15. What is the meaning of the fourth Trumpet? Here
they tell us that the fourth Trumpet is a Prophecy of the
siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the time doth not agree
with their exposition of the Trumpets, for this siege of his
was before the War began in <hi>Galilee,</hi> when as by their
exposition of the Trumpets it is made to succeed it.</p>
                  <p>16. The smiting of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are used in
Scripture, to prefigure an utter desolation of a City or
Country, and not a bare siege and no more, <hi>Ezek. 32. 7.
Esa. 13. 10. Joel 2. 10. 31. Joel</hi> 3. 15. but here they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55629:37"/>
make the smiting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars to denote a
bare siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus</hi> without the taking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of it.</p>
                  <p>17. If the fourth Trumpet be a Prophecy of the siege of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> what is meant by the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and
<hi>Stars</hi> which that Trumpet speaketh of? Here they tell us
that by the <hi>Sun</hi> is meant the <hi>Temple,</hi> by the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>City,</hi>
and by the <hi>Stars</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> but by their leave, the <hi>Sun,
Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are said to be smitten in the Prophecy, so
was not the <hi>Temple, City,</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> by <hi>Gallus:</hi> but rather
as when the <hi>Syrians</hi> left the siege of <hi>Samaria</hi> and fled, <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
had the Victory against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> so when <hi>Gallus</hi> raised
the siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Victory against the
<hi>Romans.</hi> But why may not these things be understood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally?
Do not they themselves understand the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night</hi>
in the fourth Trumpet literally? Why not the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
<hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> also? But of this more in the next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecies of the seven Trumpets be lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What necessity is there to understand them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise?
We may not forsake the literal sense of Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
necessity do enforce us.</p>
                  <p>2. How is this a <hi>Revelation,</hi> if all the Prophecies of the seven
Trumpets be mystically to be understood?</p>
                  <p>3. Where have we an interpretation of the mystery as
we have in other places where things are mystically deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
as <hi>Rev. 1. 20. Rev.</hi> 17. 7, 8. Is there not as much
need of an interpretation here, as there is there? And is it
not likely that the Holy Ghost would afford us an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
here, as well as there, if these things were mystically
to be understood.</p>
                  <p>4. What text of Scripture doth the literal interpretation cross?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55629:38"/>
5. What iniquity is there in the literal sense?</p>
                  <p>6. What absurdity doth follow therefrom? Unless these
things be made manifest (as indeed they cannot be,) let
no man find fault with me if I understand the Prophecies of
the seven Trumpets literally.</p>
                  <p>7. We may not make the Scripture a nose of Wax, and
turn it whither we please; but if we understand the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
mystically, what do we else, but make the Scripture a
nose of Wax, and turn it whither we please? Yea, every
one takes the liberty to interpret it as his private fancy and
affection leads him, and there be well nigh as many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of the Trumpets, as there be Writers on them:
and from whence doth this proceed, but from the false
preconceived opinion that the Prophecies of the seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
be mystically to be understood?</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy of the first Trumpet be literally
to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. All the reasons in the former question prove
it.</p>
                  <p>2. This Trumpet is less grievous and calamitous than the
fifth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13. But if we understand this Trumpet to be
meant of Wars which destroy the body, or of Heresies which
destroy the souls of men, this Trumpet will be more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and calamitous than the fifth, and that because the
Locusts in the fifth Trumpet, do not hurt the soul but the
body only, and they do not kill the body outright as Wars do,
but hurt it only, and put it to pain, and that for five moneths
and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>3. This plague is the same for kind with the seventh plague
of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 9. 18, 19. 22, 23, 24. and what man will say
that that <hi>Egyptian</hi> plague is mystically to be understood? and if
that be not, why is this?</p>
                  <p>4. The Holy Ghost doth as good as say, that the <hi>Trees,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55629:38"/>
and the <hi>green Grass</hi> be not men, for the Locusts were to hurt
men, but not the Grass, nor any green thing, nor any Tree,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4. And Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself doth confess, that the
Trees, and green Grass may be so expounded, <hi>Comment. Apoc.
p.</hi> 92.</p>
                  <p>5. Good men cannot be meant by <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>green Grass,</hi>
for these plagues were not to fall on good men, but on bad
only; and bad men cannot be meant by them, for the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs
were to hurt the bad, but to let all the Trees, and all
the green Grass alone, and not to hurt any of them,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
                  <p>6. Mighty men cannot be meant by <hi>Trees,</hi> for there be
little Trees as well as great, and the Hail spared neither of
them, but fell on Trees indifferently without excepting any
sort: and though by <hi>Cedars,</hi> and Oakes of <hi>Bashan, Esa.</hi> 2. 13.
some understand mighty men, yet Trees in General cannot
point out one sort of men more than another, for there be little
low Trees, as well as great and tall, and little Trees cannot
note out mighty men, though great Trees such as Cedars, and
Oakes of <hi>Bashan</hi> sometimes may.</p>
                  <p>7. Mean men cannot be meant by <hi>green Grass,</hi> for then
all mean men should be destroyed by this Trumpet, and
only two parts of mighty men be left alive to be the
objects for the other Trumpets to play their parts
upon.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecies of the second, third, and fourth
Trumpets be literally to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. All the reasons in the second question may be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hither.</p>
                  <p>2. There is not such a woe Prophesied of in these Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
as in those which follow, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13. But if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these Trumpets mystically of Wars, Heresies, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
the wo of these Trumpets will be far greater than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55629:39"/>
of the other, for the Locusts in the fifth Trumpet did
spare the life, and but hurt the body only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 5.
But Wars, Heresies, and seditions destroy the body and soul to
boot.</p>
                  <p>3. What mystical interpretation soever is put upon one
Trumpet, the same may be put upon the other Trumpets
also, and then what difference is between them? For if we
understand the second Trumpet to be meant of Wars and
seditions, we may as well understand the first, third, or
fourth to be meant of Wars and seditions too; or if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the second Trumpet to be meant of Heresies, we
may as well understand the other Trumpets to be meant
of Heresies too, and then what difference is between
them?</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>Ships</hi> mentioned in the second Trumpet, are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be understood, for they are never taken otherwise
in Scripture; and therefore the <hi>Sea,</hi> and all that follows
in that Trumpet after it are literally to be understood
also.</p>
                  <p>5. The second Trumpet is the same for kind with
the first Plague of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 7. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
and what living soul will say that that Plague of <hi>Egypt</hi>
is mystically to be understood? and if that be not, why is
this?</p>
                  <p>6. The judgment on the <hi>Rivers, and Fountains of
Waters</hi> mentioned in the third Trumpet, is the same
which befel the waters of <hi>Marah, Exod.</hi> 15. 23. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as that is literally to be understood, so is this
also.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Darkness</hi> in the fourth Trumpet, is of near affinity
with the darkness which befel the Land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 10. 21,
22, 23. and therefore as that is literally to be understood, so is
this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55629:39"/>
8. The judgments Prophesied of in these Trumpets, are
not contained in the first words, but in the last; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the judgment foretold in the first Trumpet is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in these words. <hi>And the third part of the Trees was
burnt up, and all green Grass was burnt up;</hi> and <hi>the Hail,</hi>
and <hi>Fire mingled with Blood which fell upon the earth</hi> was the
natural cause thereof. So the judgment in the second Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
is expressed in these words. <hi>And the third part of the
Creatures which were in the Sea, and had life, died,</hi> and <hi>the
third part of the Ships were destroyed;</hi> and <hi>the Mountain bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with Fire, and cast into the Sea, and turning it to Blood</hi>
was the cause thereof. So the Judgment in the third Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
is expressed in these words. <hi>And the third part of the
waters became Wormwood, and many men died of the waters,
because they were made bitter;</hi> and the <hi>Star which fell into the
Rivers burning like a Torch</hi> was the cause thereof, and the
<hi>Star</hi> is called <hi>Wormwood,</hi> not formally, as if the Star it self
were bitter as Wormwood is, but efficiently, because it made
the waters bitter as Wormwood is. Lastly, the judgment
in the fourth Trumpet is contained in these words. <hi>And
the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise;</hi>
and the smiting of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> with <hi>darkness</hi> was
the true cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But when were these things literally fulfilled?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The like question may be asked by me, when
were these Trumpets fulfilled mystically? Shew me this he
that can. 2. The same things for kind were fulfilled in
the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that in a literal sense. But if the
Question be, whether these Trumpets in particular be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
already, my answer is, they are yet to be expected,
and I prove it thus. The sixth seal is yet to be expected,
therefore the seventh seal succeeding it in which the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
are, must be expected also. Again, the sealing of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55629:40"/>
Servants of God in their foreheads is yet to be expected,
therefore the Trumpets which follow after it, are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
also. And if we can have Faith to expect our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Prophecy, <hi>Mat. 24. 29. Mark, 13. 24, 25. Luk.</hi>
21. 25, 26. which is the same in special, if not in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
with the sixth seal,<note place="margin">In specie <hi>if not</hi> in indiv iduo.</note> and shall be fulfilled
in a literal sense, why can we not have Faith
to wait on God for the fulfilling of the Trumpets
also?</p>

be given into his hand.</p>
                  <p>2. And he shall open the bottomless Pit, and upon the

of the Pit, like the smoak of a great Furnace, and the air
shall be darkned with the smoak, and it shall be so thick
that the Sun shall not be able to break through to give light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <head>The Prophecy of the sixth Trumpet, reaching from the thirteenth
Verse of this Chapter, to the fourteenth Verse of the eleventh
Chapter, or the first part thereof.</head>
                  <p>13. And the sixth Angel sounded, and the Prophecy of his
Trumpet was,<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 2.</note> that a Command should come
from God from the four Corners of the Altar,
upon which the Angel offered Incense before the Throne of
God.</p>
                  <p>14. Saying to the sixth Angel which did sound the sixth
Trumpet, that he should go and loose the four Angels, which
should be then bound or restrained from doing Hurt at the
great River of <hi>Asia,</hi> called <hi>Euphrates;</hi> but now they should
be loosed to execute God's Judgments on the people that dwell
there.</p>
                  <p>15. Then the sixth Angel shall go and loose the four Angels
which before were bound at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but ready upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to slay the third part of Men that shall be dwelling
there, and that in as little time as an hour, or in as little time
as a day, or in as little time as a month, or in as little time as
a year, waiting for a Command to put their power in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>16. And the number of the Army of Horse, that under

Hundred thousand thousand; for the number of them was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

17. But these Horses shall not be usual Horses, nor their
Riders Men properly so called, but either Angels or
strange kind of Creatures,<note place="margin">Wisd. 11. 18, 19.</note> newly created for this
purpose, and never known in the World before;
and thus I saw the Horses in the Vision, and they that sat on
them, what ever they be, shall have Corslets of a fiery colour,
and of a blew jacinth colour, and of a pale Brimstone colour,
and the heads of their Horses shall be in shape like the Heads of
Lyons, and out of the mouths of every one of them shall come
forth fire, smoak and brimstone, literally to be understood.</p>
                  <p>18. Of these three shall the third part of Men be killed,
which shall be dwelling at <hi>Euphrates</hi> at that time, some shall
be killed by the fire, and some by the smoak, and others by the
brimstone which shall come out of the Horses mouths.</p>
                  <p>19. For the power of these strange Beasts shall be in their
mouths, and which is yet the more strange, they shall have
mouths in their tayles, for their tayles shall be like a Serpents
body, and have Heads at the end of them, and in their Heads
a mouth, with which they slay the third part of Men which be
dwelling at <hi>Euphrates</hi> at the Execution of the Prophecy.</p>

this repent of their former wickedness, that they should not
worship Devils, nor Idols which are the work of Mens hands,
and are made of Gold, and of Silver, and of Brass, and of Stone,

Trumpet be literally to be understood?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All the reasons in the former Chapter Quest. 2.
may be reduced hither.</p>
                  <p>2. No Text of Scripture is mystically to be understood
without sufficient reason or warrant from Gods word; but
Men are so far from giving a reason of the mystical sense of these
Locusts, that they never so much as go about it. It is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before-hand and must not be questioned nor denied, for if
it be, they are undone, and know not what to say unto it; it
is supposed (I say) that the Text is mystically to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and then they interpret it as they please. <hi>Non amo te</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>nec possum dicere quare, Hoc tantum possum dicere, non
amo te</hi>
                  </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>O literal sense I love thee not, the cause I cannot tell.</l>
                     <l>This one thing I can say of thee, I love thee not, Farewel.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>3. The Trees, the Grass of the Earth, and the green
Herbs are literally to be understood as was proved before,
Chap. 8. Q. 3. why not the Locusts also? Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself
doth confess that the Trees may be so expounded Comment.
<hi>Apoc. pag.</hi> 92.</p>
                  <p>4. Men are not made of smoak but <hi>ex humano semine</hi> of the
seed of Man, but these Locusts were made of smoak, for out of
the Pit came forth smoak, and out of the smoak came forth
Locusts, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>5. Wicked Men were to be hurt by these Locusts, <hi>v.</hi> 4. but
if the Locusts should be such themselves, what wicked Men
be there left for them to hurt, the Locusts be so many?</p>
                  <p>6. All sorts of wicked men were to be hurt by these Locusts,
no whole sort excepted; but if the Locusts should be wicked
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55629:42"/>
Men themselves, one sort would be excepted, for the Locusts
by this supposal are one sort themselves.</p>
                  <p>7. The description of the Locusts doth not agree to Men,
neither can it in any wise be applied unto Men, but unto
strange hideous Creatures never known in the World before
very fitly, and such these Locusts be as appears by the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>8. Onely the faces of these horrid Locusts, were as the faces
of Men, and their hair like the hair of Women, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. but the
rest of their bodies was like to other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>9. The shapes of the Locusts were like Horses prepared unto
Battail, <hi>v. 7, &amp;c.</hi> but it is not likely that Men should have
such monstrous hideous shapes as be here described from the
seventh Verse to the middle of the tenth, neither is it likely
that this is a description of the Locusts, <hi>quoad mores,</hi> in respect
of manners, but <hi>quoad externam formam &amp; figuram,</hi> in respect
of outward form and figure and composition of their bodies.
And when 'tis said they were <hi>like Horses prepared unto Battail;</hi>
the meaning is not, that they shall have such Flesh or Armour
as Horses have, but that they shall have such shapes as War
Horses have. And when 'tis said, that on their heads were, <hi>as
it were Crowns of Gold;</hi> the meaning is not, that the matter of
these Crowns shall be Gold, but that they shall be in shape and
colour like Crowns made of Gold. And when 'tis said that <hi>their
Faces were as the Faces of Men;</hi> the meaning is not, that they
shall have such flesh in their Faces as Men have; but the meaning
is, that their Faces shall be in shape and figure like the Faces of
Men, though the matter whereof they are made, be such matter
as insects have.</p>
                  <p>10. Men have reason to guide them, and direct them in
their doings, but these Locusts wanted reason, and therefore
they have an Angel to direct them, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>Saracens</hi> are supposed to be the Men that should be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55629:43"/>
meant by these Locusts, others think the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi>
and some of late the <hi>Zelots,</hi> and seditious Persons in <hi>Judaea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the taking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus:</hi> But that none of these
be meant, I prove by these Reasons following. 1. The <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>
had a being in <hi>Arabia,</hi> before this Trumpet was revealed
to <hi>John,</hi> and so had the <hi>Zelots</hi> in <hi>Judaea;</hi> but these Locusts have
no being in the World until this Trumpet is put in Execution.
2. Some of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> were good Men, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Christian Faith; of which number <hi>Dietricus de Berna</hi>
was one, and <hi>Totilas</hi> another; but none of the Locusts were
good Men. 3. The Locusts were not to hurt the Grass of the
Earth, nor any green Herb, nor any Tree but only Men, <hi>v.</hi> 4.
But it were very strange if none of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> none of the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and none of the <hi>Zelots,</hi> at any time should
hurt the grass of the Earth, nor any green Herb, nor any Tree
but Men only. 4. The Locusts did only hurt the body, but
did not kill it out-right, <hi>v.</hi> 5. But the <hi>Saracens, Goths,</hi> and
<hi>Vandals</hi> killed Men out-right, and the <hi>Zelots</hi> in <hi>Judaea</hi> by the
help of the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> slew eight thousand Men in one Night.
See Bishops <hi>Ussers Annal.</hi> pag. 693. 5. The Locusts were not
to hurt the good, but the bad only, <hi>v.</hi> 4. But the <hi>Saracens,
Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Zelots</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> made a prey of
both. 6. The Locusts were to hurt but five Months and no
longer, <hi>v.</hi> 5. But whether we understand the five Months li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally,
as they ought to be understood, (for Moneths are never
taken otherwise in Scripture) the <hi>Zelots</hi> in <hi>Judaea</hi> did continue
longer, for they began in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> after that <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi>
had subdued <hi>Galilee,</hi> and continued all the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e of <hi>Galba,</hi>
which was seven Moneths, all the time of <hi>Otho,</hi> which was
three Moneths, all the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> which was eight
Moneths, and all the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> until the taking of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
by <hi>Titus,</hi> which was above a year; or whether we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the five Moneths mystically for one Hundred and fifty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55629:43"/>
years, the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> continued longer, and the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>
remain to this day. 7. This Trumpet is not yet begun, as
hath been proved in the former Chapter, Q. 4. But if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of the <hi>Zelots</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> or of the <hi>Saracens, Goths,</hi> and
<hi>Vandals,</hi> it should be past long ago. 8. The Locusts have a
King over them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and this King is not an evil Angel (as
is generally supposed) but a good, and a Destroyer of wicked
Men for their sins, as shall be proved in the next Question;
and therefore the <hi>Saracens, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Zelots</hi> in
<hi>Judaea,</hi> be not the Locusts mentioned in this place; for they
were rather led by <hi>Satan</hi> than by such a King. 9. The <hi>Zelots</hi>
had unusual and unheard of ways to torture Men; and that
was by stopping the passage of their privy members with the
Seeds of <hi>Orobus,</hi> and by horrid and painful Torments in their
Fundaments, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> writeth of them, <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 6. but yet
the Instruments which they used to do the latter Villany, were
artificial and external, such as pricks, and sharp twigs; but
these Locusts had another way to torture Men, and that was
not by external Instruments, as the <hi>Zelots</hi> did, but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of their own bodies; and that was by the sting in their
tayles, for they <hi>had tayles like to Scorpions, and there were stings
in their tayles,</hi> and with these stings did they torment Men,
<hi>v.</hi> 10. and the pain that came of these Torments, was like the
<hi>pain that cometh of a Scorpion when he hath stung a Man,</hi> v. 5. and
this was a way of torturing which the <hi>Zelots</hi> could not use, nor
did the <hi>Saracens, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> nor any other men, for they
have not stings in their bodies to torment men with, as the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs
have.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Angel of the bottomless Pit, whose Name
in Hebrew is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and in Greek <hi>Apollyon,</hi> be a good Angel,
or a bad?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Angel shall come from Heaven at the
Execution of the Prophecy, so shall not <hi>Satan</hi> at that time;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55629:44"/>
for he was never there since his Fall, nor ever shall be.</p>
                  <p>2. The Angel shall come from Heaven in the likeness of a
Star; but <hi>Satan</hi> fell from thence at the beginning of the world
in the likeness of a Devil.</p>
                  <p>3. The Angel shall come from Heaven willingly, but <hi>Satan</hi>
fell from thence against his will; it is true he sinned willingly,
and that in Heaven too, but he was driven forth of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>4. The Angel hath Commission from God, to do what
he doth at this time; but <hi>Satan</hi> when he acts his Wickedness,
goes without Commission to act what he doth.</p>
                  <p>5. The Angel hath the Key of the bottomless Pit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, <hi>v.</hi> 1. but that Key is not committed unto
<hi>Satan,</hi> but to a good Angel only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>6. The Angel hath power to open the bottomless Pit,
which it seems was shut before, <hi>v.</hi> 2. but <hi>Satan</hi> is to be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in that Pit, and hath no power to open it at all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.
3. 7.</p>
                  <p>7. The Angel hath command over the bottomless Pit,
and he is therefore called the Angel of the bottomless Pit,
because he hath command over it, as the Angel of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is so called because he hath command over them, <hi>Rev.</hi>
16. 5. but <hi>Satan</hi> is to be a Prisoner in that Pit, and hath no
more command over it, than a Fettered Prisoner hath over a
Jail.</p>
                  <p>8. The Angel is called a <hi>destroyer, v.</hi> 11. but where
shall we find <hi>Satan</hi> called by that name? I deny not but
he is such a one, for he destroyed <hi>Jobs</hi> Children, <hi>Iob.</hi>
1. 19. and he is called a murtherer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. but he is
never called a <hi>destroyer</hi> in direct terms as the Angel is
here.</p>
                  <p>9. Suppose <hi>Satan</hi> be called a <hi>destroyer</hi> in direct terms, be
not the good Angels called so too? Were not the Angels
that destroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> good Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 13?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55629:44"/>
was not the Angel that destroyed <hi>Israel</hi> with the Pestilence,
a good Angel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 15, 16? and was not the Angel
that destroyed <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army a good Angel, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.
35? and is not a good Angel called a <hi>destroyer, Exod. 12.
23. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 10? And if every one of these were good
Angels, why should any one think that the Angel the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer</hi>
in the fifth Trumpet is not a good Angel but a
bad?</p>
                  <p>10. Is there not a grand difference between a spiritual
<hi>destroyer</hi> of the souls of men, and a corporal <hi>destroyer</hi> of the
body only? Now <hi>Satan</hi> is a Spiritual <hi>destroyer</hi> of the souls
of men by infecting them with sin; but the Angel here spoken
of, is a Corporal <hi>destroyer</hi> of the body only, as appears
<hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>11. Is there not also a great difference, between a <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of good men, and a <hi>destroyer</hi> of wicked men? Now <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
is a main <hi>destroyer</hi> of good men, as when he moveth
Tyrants to persecute the Church of God, his aim is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
good men, and them only, and if it were in his power
he would not leave a good man alive upon the earth,
his malice is so great, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 12, and 13. but the
Angel here spoken of is a <hi>destroyer,</hi> not of good men for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, but of wicked men only for their sins, <hi>v.</hi> 4,
5. 20.</p>
                  <p>12. Is there not a vast difference between a <hi>destroyer ex
Officio,</hi> out of Office, and Duty towards God, and a <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ex Malitia,</hi> out of Malice, both to God and man? Now
<hi>Satan</hi> is a <hi>destroyer</hi> in the latter sense; and is therefore called
a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> because he destroyes men out of malice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.
44. but the Angel here mentioned is a destroyer <hi>ex Officio</hi> out of
Office, and Duty towards God, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the sixth Trumpet be a Prophecy of <hi>Vespasians</hi>
Army, marching to besiege <hi>Jerusalem?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55629:45"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We have already proved that <hi>John</hi> received the
<hi>Revelation</hi> not in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but in the Reign of
<hi>Domitian</hi> the Roman Emperor, <hi>Disp.</hi> 1. Q. 1. therefore this
is not a Prophecy of <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army marching to besiege <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
which was past some years before the revealing of the
Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>2. They that be of this mind, do hold withal that these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were written by St. <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
therefore this Prophecy is not meant of the marching of
his Army to besiege <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was before his Reign
began.</p>
                  <p>3. The fifth Trumpet is before the sixth, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 12.
but the fifth Trumpet in their opinion, is a Prophecy of what
the <hi>Zelots</hi> did in the time of the siege, therefore the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
which follows after it both in Vision and Execution, is not
meant of the marching of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and his Army to begin the
siege.</p>
                  <p>4. To what purpose should our Saviour shew <hi>John</hi> in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the besieging or destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was so
plainly told him before, <hi>Mat. 24. 2. Luk.</hi> 19. 43, 44?</p>
                  <p>5. Here is no mention nor intimation of the besieging of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
nor of besieging any other City, but of killing the
third part of men without besieging of them.</p>
                  <p>6. The Army here spoken of, came from <hi>Euphrates, v.</hi> 14.
which is a River in <hi>Asia,</hi> but <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army came from <hi>Rome,</hi>
which is a City in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The Army here Prophesied of, were two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thousand, but <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army were nothing near so many.</p>
                  <p>8. The Army here meant, be only Horse, and no Foot, <hi>v.</hi> 16.
but <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army were Foot as well as Horse.</p>
                  <p>9. The Army here spoken of, did slay men with Fire, Smoak,
and Brimstone, but <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army slew the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
with the Sword, according to our Saviors Prophecy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55629:45"/>
10. The Army here spoken of, slew the third part of men,
and no more; but <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army slew well nigh all the <hi>Jews</hi>
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and they that escaped were but few to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the slain.</p>
                  <p>11. They that escaped, and were not slain by these plagues,
<hi>repented not of the works of their own hands, that they should not
worship Devils and Idols of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 20. But the <hi>Jewes</hi> that
lived in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time, and were not killed by him, were
not guilty of these sins, for they never worshipped Idols, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they nor their Fathers, since their Transportation into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. There is no express nor implicite mention of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
in all this Prophecy, nor in the next Chapter, nor in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
Chapter, except it be <hi>v.</hi> 2. and 13. where it is said,
that <hi>the tenth part of the City fell,</hi> and not the whole City, and
it fell by an <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> and not by the hands of Men, as it did
in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time; and it fell too upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were
there, and not upon the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and in the <hi>Earth-quake were
slain seven thousand men, and the Remnant that escaped, gave glory
to the God of Heaven:</hi> none of which things do agree to <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
and his Army, nor to any other since, but are yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>13. If this Trumpet be a Prophecy of the Marching of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi>'s
Army to besiege <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> where have we a Prophecy
of the taking and Destruction of the City? Or is it likely that
here should be a Prophecy of the marching of <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Army
to besiege <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and no Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the
taking of it? To this they have no other answer, but that the
things which the seven Thunders spake in the next Chapter,
are a Prophecy of the Taking and Destruction of the City; but
this is a very unlikely thing, for the things which the seven
Thunders spake, were to be concealed, and <hi>John</hi> was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to write them; but the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55629:46"/>
not to be concealed but revealed rather, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> might
have Notice of it; yea, and it was revealed by <hi>Christ</hi> to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and committed unto Writing before it came to pass, as
appears, <hi>Mat. 24. 2. Mark 13. Luk. 19. 43, 44. Luk.</hi> 21. 24. To which
may be added, that the godly people that were in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> knew
thereof before-hand, and fled to <hi>Pella</hi> to save their lives; yea,
and<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us of the signs that went before the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the City, foretelling the Destruction of it;
as that a Star stood over the City like a Sword, and
a Comet, enduring the space of a whole year.
An Army of Souldiers was seen marching in the Clouds, and
compassing the City round. A Voyce was heard in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
saying, <hi>Eamus hinc,</hi> Let us go hence. One <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son
of <hi>Ananias,</hi> a Country-man of mean birth, four years before
the War, at a time when all was in deep Peace and Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cryed on a sudden, and said, <hi>A voyce from the East, a voyce
from the West, a voyce from the four Winds, a voyce against</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<hi>and the Temple, a voyce against Bridegrooms and Brides,
a voyce against all the people.</hi> Thus he went about all the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Lanes, crying Night and Day, and being apprehended
and scourged, he still continued the same Language under the
blowes without any other word. And they on this supposing
(as it was) some Divine Motion brought him to the <hi>Roman Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
and by his appointment being with Whips wounded, and
his flesh torn to the bones, he neither intreated, nor shed tear,
but to every blow in a most lamentable mournful Note cried
out, <hi>Wo, wo to</hi> Jerusalem. This he continued to do till the
time of the Siege seven years together; and therefore for any
man to think that the concealed things which the seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
spake, were concerning the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is a
ridiculous thing.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the four <hi>Angels</hi> mentioned in the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<hi>v.</hi> 14. be literally to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55629:46"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I know no reason to the contrary, neither doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Writer that I have met with give me any; they take it for
granted, that the four <hi>Angels</hi> are Mystically to be understood, and
then they interpret them of whom they please. <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit
pro ratione voluntas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>My Will of me Commander is, to Reason it sayes nay,</l>
                     <l>My Will is such, obey I must, let Reason go away.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Angels</hi> are never put for Men, except they be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or Preachers of the Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Angels</hi> are never put for bad Men, but for good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>4. These <hi>Angels</hi> were prepared to slay the third part of men,
and that in an hour at least, or in a year at most, <hi>v.</hi> 15. but
four men have not power so to do in so short a space.</p>
                  <p>5. The number of the Army of Horse, <hi>v.</hi> 16. doth agree to
<hi>Angels,</hi> but not to men, they were so many, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11. but
of this more in the next question.</p>
                  <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Army of two hundred thousand thousand
Horse-men, mentioned in the sixth Trumpet, <hi>v.</hi> 16. be <hi>Turks</hi> or
any other men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans. 1. Arias Montanus</hi> reads the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the Armies of Horse, and if that be the right reading, here is
no mention made of <hi>men</hi> in this verse.</p>
                  <p>2. Suppose the reading be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which we translate
<hi>Horse-men,</hi> and that right enough; but whether they be <hi>men</hi>
in truth, or in appearance only, that the word doth not declare
of it self, but must be gathered from the circumstances of the
text where the word is used.</p>
                  <p>3. The three men which appeared unto <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 2.
and the two men which appeared unto <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. 1, 2.
were not <hi>men,</hi> but <hi>Angels</hi> in the shapes of <hi>men,</hi> and the bodies
which they took were true bodies, but they wanted souls to
make them men, and why may not these Horse-men be such
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55629:47"/>
too? that is, not <hi>men</hi> indeed, but either <hi>Angels,</hi> or strange
kind of Creatures, or both, in the upper part like men, in the
lower part like Horses, newly created for this purpose, and never
seen nor known in the World before?</p>
                  <p>4. The Horses, and Chariots that were round about <hi>Elisha,
2 King.</hi> 6. 17. were not <hi>men,</hi> but <hi>Angels;</hi> and therefore these
Horse-men may be such too, either <hi>Angels</hi> or strange kind of
Creatures, or both as was said before.</p>
                  <p>5. The Angels can assume to themselves true bodies, the
body of a man on Foot, or the body of a man on Horse-back,
and they were wont so to do heretofore in cases extraordinary,
as appears <hi>Gen. 18. 2. Gen. 19. 1, 2. Luk. 24. 4. 2 King.
6. 17. 2 King.</hi> 7. 6. and therefore they may do so again in
such a business as is here before us. And if it be asked of me,
whence they had these bodies which they did assume? To this
I answer that the Angels cannot create them out of nothing, for
that is only Gods work, and therefore they had them from God,
who did either create them out of nothing, or else did make
them out of matter preexistent, as the Locusts in the former
Trumpet out of smoak, <hi>v.</hi> 3. And if it be asked again, what
became of these bodies when they laid them down? To this I
answer, that they returned into their former principles again,
and in case they were created out of nothing, they returned
into nothing, and in case they were made of matter preexistent,
they returned into it again: but whatever became of these
bodies afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is certain out of Scripture, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
can assume them, and lay them down again, for they have
done so heretofore, and therefore they may do so again, in the
case that is now before us.</p>
                  <p>6. The Angels can make use of living bodies that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
created, and leave them when they have done, as <hi>Satan</hi>
made use of the Serpent to beguile the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1, 2.
and the good Angel made use of <hi>Balaams</hi> Ass to speak unto his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55629:47"/>
Master, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 28. and the <hi>Angel</hi> in the former Trumpet,
made use of the Locusts to torment men with their stings: so
the <hi>Angels</hi> in this Trumpet, may make use of these Creatures
to destroy the third part of men, though they assume them
not.</p>
                  <p>7. If we read the fifteenth verse, we shall there find that the
<hi>Angels</hi> have a special hand in this business, for they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to slay the third part of men which this Army were to
slay; and therefore we have reason for to think that either these
<hi>Horse-men</hi> be <hi>Angels,</hi> or else had the guidance of the <hi>Angels</hi> in
this work; and we need not say that there were as many <hi>Angels</hi>
imployed in this work, as there be Horse-men mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 16.
but four <hi>Angels</hi> besides the <hi>Angel</hi> that did sound this Trumpet
may suffice to guide these Creatures in this work, as one
Angel did suffice to guide the Locusts in the former Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                  <p>8. The Book sealed with seven seals, of which this Prophecy
is a part, was such a special Book of Prophecy, as no man in
Heaven, or on earth, or under the earth was counted worthy
to open the Book, and look into it but <hi>Iesus Christ, Rev.</hi> 5. 3.
therefore we may not think that this Book of Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
only things ordinary, usual, or accustomed, such as
Church Heresies, and <hi>Turkish</hi> Wars are, which though they
be grievous and calamitous while they last and continue, yet
they be common, usual, and accustomed things, which the
World and Church of God is well acquainted with. We must
rather look that in this Book of Prophecy, should be things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
unusual, rare, and unaccustomed, such as the plagues
of <hi>Egypt</hi> were, which were never known before nor since, and
such as the Locusts were in the former Trumpet, and the Horses
and Horse-men in this sixth.</p>
                  <p>9. The Horses be not usual Horses, such as men use in War,
and therefore they that sit on them, be not men, for how should
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55629:48"/>
men come by such Horses as be here described, and what men
will adventure for to ride them in case they could come by
them? First it is said, that they had heads as the <hi>heads of Lions,</hi>
and out of their mouths issued <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,
v.</hi> 17. 2. They had <hi>tailes like to Serpents</hi> bodies, <hi>v.</hi> 19.
3. They had heads behind at the end of their tailes. 4. They
had mouths in their heads, so that they had two mouths, as
well as two heads, one before, and another behind, and the
head before was like a <hi>Lions head, v.</hi> 17. and the head behind
in the tail like a <hi>Serpents</hi> head, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 5. Out of both their
mouths issued <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimstone.</hi> 6. By this <hi>Fire,
Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> were the third part of men slain, <hi>v.</hi> 18.
Never any men did ride such Horses as these were, nor ever will
do.</p>
                  <p>10. The Army here spoken of, was <hi>two hundred thousand
thousand;</hi> but the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armies never were so many at one
time, nor ever will be. They say <hi>Bajazet</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> was once
in the Field, with five hundred thousand, and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the
<hi>Tartar,</hi> with thirteen hundred thousand, but what be all
these to two hundred thousand thousand? There never
was such an Army in the Field at one time, nor ever will
be.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Armies do consist of Foot, as well as Horse,
though most of them be Horse; but the Army here spoken of,
be only Horse, and no Foot.</p>
                  <p>12. The Army here spoken of, did send <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and
<hi>Brimstone</hi> out of their Horses mouths, and slay the third part of
men therewith, this the <hi>Turks</hi> never did, nor ever will or can
do. And as for those who think that this is meant of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,</hi>
in which there is <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> when
they shoot, I think it fit to tell them that <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi>
were not invented by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but by <hi>Bertholdus Niger,</hi> alias
<hi>Swart,</hi> a <hi>German Alchymist,</hi> and a <hi>Franciscan Monk,</hi> about the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55629:48"/>
year of Christ 1380. And <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi> are used not
only by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but by other Nations in their Wars all the
World over. And 'tis not the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> which doth slay men
of it self, but the Bullet which it driveth forth. And the <hi>Turks</hi>
shoot not <hi>Gunpowder</hi> out of their Horses mouths and tails, but
out of their Iron, and their Brasen <hi>Guns,</hi> and that at one end
only: so that <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi> are not intended in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
but <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> to kill the third part
of men therewith, and that without <hi>either Gunpowder, Guns</hi> or
<hi>Bullet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. By this Army were the third part of men slain which
were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Now the <hi>Turks</hi> be the men
which dwell there, and therefore it is likely, that the <hi>Turks</hi> be
the men which shall be slain by this Army, and not the Army
which shall slay the third part of men; so that the <hi>Turks</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this Prophecy, not as <hi>Agents,</hi> but as <hi>Patients,</hi> not as
<hi>killing</hi> others, but as <hi>killed</hi> by others, and God hath shewed in
this Prophecy, how the third part of <hi>Turks</hi> shall be destroyed,
not by <hi>Jews,</hi> nor by <hi>Tartars,</hi> nor by any other men, but by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
in a fearful manner, and yet not by them alone, but by
strange kind of Horses, newly created for this purpose, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

them, come down from Heaven in a cloud, having a

his face was as the Sun for beauty, and his feet as Pillars of

               <p>2. And he had in his right hand, a little Book or Schedule,

cry of his as upon a call, seven claps of Thunder uttered their
voices in my hearing.</p>
               <p>4. And when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices, I
was about to write what the seven Thunders had spoken, for
they spake things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

have spoken, and write them not, for they are too terrible to be

               <p>5. And the Angel whom I saw standing with his right

               <p>8. And the voice which I heard from Heaven before, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me seal up the things which the seven Thunders had
spoken, and write them not, spake to me again the second
time, and said unto me, Go take the little Book or Schedule,
which is wide open in the hand of the Angel which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>9. So I went unto the Angel as the voice commanded me,
and I said unto him, Give me the little Book or Schedule which
is wide open in thy right hand; and he said unto me, Take and

               <p>10. So I took the little Book or Schedule out of the Angels

in my mouth as sweet as Hony, but when I had eaten it, my
belly was bitter.</p>
               <p>11. And he told me the meaning of it, and he said unto me,

               <head>Disputation VI.</head>
               <p>1 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the little Book had any Prophecy written
in it?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not said in the Text, that it had any Prophecy
written in it, and therefore they which say it had, do it upon no
ground at all?</p>
                  <p>2. It was wide open, and not shut nor sealed, therefore there
was not any secret thing therein.</p>
                  <p>3. It was but one Schedule or piece of Parchment, and that a
little one too, and therefore too little to contain all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
from the eighth verse of the tenth Chapter, to the end of
the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It was far less than the other Book which had seven rolls,
and seven seals to them: But if all the Prophecies from the eighth
verse of the tenth Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> should
be comprised in it, it would be far bigger than the other Book
which had seven rolls and seals to them.</p>
                  <p>5. The other Book which had the seals is commended for its
Prophecies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. but this Book is no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for any Prophecy it had.</p>
                  <p>6. The Prophecies in the following Chapters be of higher
note, and far more excellent, and of more concernment
than the Prophecies in the former Chapters be, and therefore
they belong not to this little Book which is no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for its Prophecies, but to the other Book with seven
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55629:50"/>
seals which hath so high a commendation as not any Book the
like, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>7. There should be by this reckoning, two Prophetical
Books of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the seventh verse of the tenth
Chapter, should be the last verse of the first Book, and the
eighth verse of the tenth Chapter, should be the first verse
of the second Book: but St. <hi>John</hi> makes but one Book of
all the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and he writes it all in one Volume
without division, and calls it a <hi>Revelation</hi> in the singular
number, and not two <hi>Revelations</hi> in the plural number,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>8. By this reckoning the Prophecies of the other Book
with seven seals, should be mingled with the Prophecies of
the little Book without seals, for they say that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eighth verse of the tenth
Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> belong unto the little
Book. Now if you look into the eleventh Chapter, you shall
there find the ending of the sixth Trumpet, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and after
that the seventh Trumpet, or some part thereof, from the
fifteenth verse to the end of the Chapter, both which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto the other Book with seven seals, and namely to
the seventh seal thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 2. and after this come in
the Prophecies, as they say, of the little Book again. What
a mingle mangle have we here of those two Books one in
another? Surely as St. <hi>John</hi> eat up the little Book, so they make
the little Book swallow the Prophecies of the other Book into
his Belly.</p>
                  <p>9. The sixth Trumpet doth not end with the seventh
verse of the tenth Chapter, but goes onward to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
verse of the eleventh Chapter, and there ends, and
not before; so that all that Prophecy in the eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the fourteenth verse, doth belong unto the other Book
with seven seals, and the seventh Trumpet doth not end
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55629:51"/>
with the eleventh Chapter, for if it did, a close would have
been put unto it at the end of that Chapter, to distinguish
it from the Prophecies that follow; but there being no period
put unto it there, as there is to the former Trumpets where
they end, it is an Argument sufficient that it doth not end
there, but is to be extended farther, even to the twelfth
Chapter, and to all the Chapters following inclusively until
a Period be put unto it, which is no where to be found, so
that the seventh Trumpet hath no end at all, nor any close
put unto it, as the fifth and sixth Trumpets have, <hi>Rev. 9. 12.
Rev.</hi> 11. 14. and seeing the seventh Trumpet doth belong unto
the Book with seven seals, the Prophecy of the twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and of all the rest that follow, doth belong unto that other
Book also.</p>
                  <p>10. If the little Book had the following Prophecies written
in it from the eighth verse of this Chapter, to the end of
the <hi>Revelation,</hi> what's the reason that the Angel doth acquaint
<hi>John</hi> with them afterward? A man would think that after
he had taken the Book, and eaten it up, he should have known
what the Prophecies had been which were contained in it
without any further help, or any further <hi>Revelation:</hi> but we
find, that in the next Chapter after this, the Angel doth
acquaint <hi>John</hi> with the Prophecies of that Chapter, and tells
him what they be from point to point; and therefore the
little Book, though eaten up by him, did not acquaint
him with them before, nor tell him what they were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But why was <hi>John</hi> commanded to eat the little Book, if it
had no Prophecy written in it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. To acquaint him with the sweetness, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness
of the Prophecies which follow; for by eating of the
Book which was sweet in his mouth, and bitter in his belly,
he thereby knew that the Prophecies which follow should be
be sweet in the beginning, but bitter afterward. 2. To sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55629:51"/>
unto him that he had not made an end of Prophecying,
and in particular, that the Prophecy of the sixth Trumpet
was not fully ended, there was a little more behind, not
yet revealed to him, which he was to add to the former
part thereof, and therefore it is said, <hi>thou must Prophecy again,</hi>
not begin a new Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo</hi> from the first Original,
but Prophecy <hi>again,</hi> (that is) of the other part behind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the sixth Trumpet, which was not spoken of
before; but what that other part was, was not written in
the little Book, but reported to him by word of mouth, and
it belongs all of it to the sixth Trumpet, and the little Book it
self to boot.</p>
                  <p>From hence it follows, 1. That the whole Prophetical
part of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> doth not consist of two main Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
both of them beginning their race at the same Epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
(or <hi>terminus à quo)</hi> of time, and concluding together like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at the same goal or <hi>terminus ad quem.</hi> The first of these
(as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it) is <hi>prophetia sigillorum</hi> reaching
from the fourth Chapter unto almost the end of the tenth.
The second is <hi>prophetia libri,</hi> beginning at the eighth verse
of the tenth Chapter, and reaching to the end of the Book.
But herein Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is exceedingly out, for there is but one
Prophetical Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> as hath been proved in this
Question, and this Book is <hi>Prophetia sigillorum</hi> the Prophecy
of the seals reaching from the fourth Chapter, or rather
from the sixth Chapter to the end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 2. That
the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> shall come to pass in order,
as they came forth out of the sealed Book, seal after seal,
Trumpet after Trumpet, Vial after Vial, and so of all the rest
in order as they were presented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in Vision, of which
more in the next Question.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> shall come to
pass in order as they were revealed to <hi>John?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55629:52"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Things revealed at once, and not at several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
times, come to pass in order as they be revealed; as
for instance: The Prophecy of the four Monarchies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.
was revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> all at once, and it did, and shall come
to pass in order as it was revealed; so the Prophecy of the
<hi>Ram,</hi> and <hi>Hee-Goat, Dan.</hi> 8. was revealed to him all at once,
and it came to pass in order as it was revealed; and so give
instance where you will, it never failes. But now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> all at once,
and not at several distant times as was proved at large <hi>Disp.
1. q.</hi> 2. therefore they shall come to pass in order as they
were revealed. It is otherwise where things are revealed at
several distant times, here no such order is observed; as for
instance: The Prophecy of the fourth beast, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to him above a year before the Prophecy of the <hi>Ram</hi>
and <hi>Hee-Goat</hi> mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. but yet the Prophecy of
the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>Hee-Goat</hi> came to pass before it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
had the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> been revealed to
<hi>Iohn</hi> at several distant times, as some of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies
were, we could not conclude from thence that they shall
come to pass in order as they were revealed; but in regard
they were revealed to him all at once, or at one continued
time without ceasing or intermission of his ecstasie, we may
and must conclude from thence that they shall come to pass
in order as they were revealed, and presented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in
Vision.</p>
                  <p>2. The Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were written all of
them in one Book, and not in two, and that was the Book
sealed with seven seals, <hi>c.</hi> 5. But as for the little Book, <hi>c.</hi> 10.
it had not any Prophecy written in it, as was proved at large
in the former Question. Now had the Prophecies of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> been written in two Books, and not in one, it
might be possible that the Prophecies of these two Books
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55629:52"/>
might begin their race at the same Epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (or <hi>terminus à quo)</hi>
of time, and conclude together likewise at the same goal or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
ad quem:</hi> but in regard they were all of them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in one Book, and not in two, here is no colour at all for such
a groundless imagination.</p>
                  <p>3. Histories write of things in order as they come to pass,
as if a man were to write a <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
he would not put King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and his
Reign, before King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, but set down the
Kings in order as they Reigned. And no other is the case here,
the prophetical part of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is a History of things
to come, as a <hi>Chronicle</hi> is a History of things past, and therefore
it sets down things in order, as a <hi>Chronicle</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>4. It is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others of his mind,
that all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (except that of the
Palm-bearers <hi>Rev. 7. 9.)</hi> from the beginning of the sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the middle of the tenth shall come to pass in order as
they were Revealed, but the grand Question is of those which
follow after. Now that the Prophecies which follow after
from the beginning of the eleventh Chapter to the end of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> shall come to pass in order as they were Revealed,
shall be proved severally of them all when I come to write on
those Chapters, see <hi>Ch. 11. q. 1. ch. 12. q. 1, 2. ch. 13. q. 1.
ch. 16. q.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>5. First, second, third, fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all of them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
numbers and not cardinal, and they are so called because
they shew not only the number of things spoken of, but the
order also. Now the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> do all of them
consist of these numbers, seven Seals, seven Trumpets, seven
Vials consisting all of them of ordinal numbers, whereof the
seven Trumpets are the issue of the seventh Seal, and therefore
shall come to pass in order after the sixth Seal is ended, and the
seven Vials are the issue of the seventh Trumpet (though not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55629:53"/>
the immediate nor the adequate issue of it,) and therefore they
shall come to pass in order after the Prophecy of the fourteenth
Chapter doth determine and not before.</p>
                  <p>6. What Man will say that King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Henry</hi> the sixth? such an absurdity do they run into which
interpret the sixth Seal of the day of Judgment, and make
the seventh Seal which contains the seven Trumpets to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it. It is as if a Man should say that King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh
was before King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and the reason why King <hi>Henry</hi>
the sixth is set before King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh in the <hi>English Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>
is because he was first revealed unto the Writer, but in
order of Reigning King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh was before him.</p>
                  <p>7. If the seven Trumpets shall come to pass before the sixth
Seal, what's the reason that the sixth Seal was revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi>
before them? And so of other Prophecies, if that which
was revealed first, shall come to pass after that which was
revealed afterward, why was it revealed first, and not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
God could have revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> the seven Trumpets
before the sixth Seal, and doubtless would have done so, if
the seven Trumpets were to come to pass before it; but
now we find 'tis otherwise, the sixth Seal was revealed to
<hi>Iohn</hi> before the seven Trumpets were, and what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it? but because it shall come to pass before the seven
Trumpets shall, and no other reason can be given for it. But
if any one think otherwise, that the sixth Seal shall come to
pass after the seven Trumpets, let him tell me why was it
revealed before the seven Trumpets were, and not tather
after them. And so of other Prophecies it may be asked, if
that which was revealed first, shall come to pass after that which
was revealed afterward, why was it revealed first? Give an
answer he that will.</p>
                  <p>8. Unless the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> shall come to
pass in order as they were revealed, what a confused <hi>Chaos</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55629:53"/>
is the <hi>Revelation?</hi> It is as if a man should write a History
of the affairs of <hi>England,</hi> but in such a mingled and confus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
manner, that no man can find any order in it, no man
can tell by reading of it, whether such a Parliament were
in such a Kings Reign, and such a Parliament in another
Kings Reign, nor which King did Reign first, and which next,
the Book is such a mingle mangle, a mess of altogether,
that no man can tell what Accidents were in one Kings Reign,
and what Accidents in another Kings Reign. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<hi>Chaos</hi> do they make of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> no man can tell
by reading of it, where to begin, nor where to end, nor
where to find the middle of it, whether the Seal shall come
to pass first, and the Trumpets next, and the Vials next,
or whether some of the seven Seals shall come to pass first,
and some of the seven Trumpets next, and some of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Vials next, or in what order things shall come to pass
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> no man can tell.</p>
                  <p>9. Where no instance can be given to the contrary, there
things shall come to pass in order as they were revealed,
and such are the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> no instance
can be given of any Prophecy that shall come to pass before
or after the order of its <hi>Revelation,</hi> and therefore they shall
come to pass, Prophecy after Prophecy, as they were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and presented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in Vision.</p>

                  <p>

                        <p>The first Synchronism of the woman remaining in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of the seven headed beast restored, of the outer Court troden
under foot by the Gentiles, of the witnesses in the mean time Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
in Sackcloth. <hi>All which he will have Synchronise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be of</hi> equal times.</p>
                        <p>To which I answer, that the month of <hi>April</hi> hath as many
days as the month of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the month of <hi>Iune</hi> hath as
many days as the month of <hi>September,</hi> yet these three months
succeed one another; and no other is the case here. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
of the <hi>witnesses</hi> in Sack-cloth, hath as many days
as the <hi>woman</hi> hath in the Wilderness, and that is 1260 days,
and the <hi>woman</hi> hath as many days in the Wilderness as
the 42 months of the <hi>Beast</hi> amount unto, yet they succeed
one another, as the month of <hi>Iune</hi> succeeds the month of
<hi>April,</hi> and the month of <hi>September</hi> succeeds them both. But
as for the conculcation of the outer Court 42 months, and
the Prophecying of the witnesses in the mean while 1260
days, I confess that they Synchronise, but none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> saw the weakness of his first Argument, and in
the close thereof confesseth that it is not necessary that equal
times should Synchronise, howbeit, for confirmation of it, he
adds in his Parenthesis, that in Visions shewed at the same time,
it is very likely that they do.</p>
                        <p>To which I answer, that this doth no way strengthen nor
add any confirmation to his Argument, for equal times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
all at once, at one view, may and do succeed one
another, as appears in a leafe Almanack wide open, where
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55629:54"/>
all the months of the year (many of which are equal one
to another, and have as many days, one as another,) are
presented to my eye all at once at one view, yet they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
one another, the month of <hi>March</hi> succeeds the month
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> though equal in duration to it, and the month
of <hi>May,</hi> (though of equal duration too) succeeds them both.
So put the case that these Prophecies were presented unto
<hi>Iohn</hi> the same time at one view, yet may they succeed one
another for all that. But the case is not so in the point in
hand, for these Prophecies were not presented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> at
one view, as the Image was to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in his dream,
but successively one after another, the Prophecy of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in the eleventh Chapter first, the Prophecy of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Wilderness, in the twelfth Chapter, next, and
the Prophecy of the Beast, in the thirteenth Chapter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
And because they were presented unto him succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
therefore we conclude that they shall come to pass
successively, the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter first,
the Prophecy in the twelfth Chapter next, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in the thirteenth Chapter, afterward. And thus much
for the first Argument.</p>
                        <p>2. He undertakes to prove that the times of the <hi>Beast,</hi>
and of the womans being in the Wilderness, begin at the
same instant of time, to wit the Conquest of the red Dragon,
and the thrusting him out of Heaven unto the earth, but he
mightily fails in the probation of it. 1. In that he makes
the Dragon cast out a flood of water after her, before she
came into the Wilderness as she was flying thither, but it
is not so, for the woman gets into the Wilderness first, as
appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. and then he sends a flood of water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her to drive her out from thence, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 15.
2. He thinks that by the <hi>remnant of her seed,</hi> is meant the
Children which the woman should bring forth in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55629:55"/>
and that the Dragon makes War with them in that
place, but this is nothing so, but by the remnant of her
seed is meant, those which did remain behind, and were
not fled into the Wilderness with the woman, for if they
had been there, they had been safe as the woman was, <hi>v.</hi> 14.
and the Dragon could not War with them, nor get the
Victory over them in that place. Briefly then, the order of
the Prophecy is this: 1. The Dragon persecutes the woman,
and that as soon as he was cast forth of Heaven unto the
earth, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 2. The woman flies and gets safe into the
Wilderness from his persecution, <hi>v.</hi> 14. 3. The Dragon
casts forth a flood of water after her, to drive her out from
thence, <hi>v.</hi> 15. 4. The earth opens her mouth, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
up the flood of water, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 5. The Dragon seeing
that, leaves the woman in the Wilderness, and departs from
thence (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) to make War with the remnant of her
seed, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and who be they, but those which were not
fled into the Wilderness where the woman was? This is the true
sense, and order of the Prophecy, and I wonder that any man
should set his wit against it.</p>
                        <p>3. He would have the times of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and of the
witnesses end together at the <hi>exit</hi> of the fixth Trumpet, and
this he thinks to prove from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15. but all
in vain, for though the times of the witnesses do end at the
<hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, and we hear no more of them
afterward, yet the times of the <hi>Beast,</hi> do not, as may appear
if these things be considered. 1. The City there spoken of
is not <hi>Babylon</hi> the Royal City of the <hi>Beast,</hi> but <hi>Ierusalem,
v.</hi> 2. and 8. 2. The whole City doth not fall, but the
tenth part only, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 3. That tenth part of the City fell
by an earth-quake, but <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be consumed by fire,
and not by an earth-quake, <hi>Rev. 17. 16. Rev.</hi> 18. 8.
4. Seven thousand men are slain, and no more, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55629:55"/>
what is so small a number to the ruine of the <hi>Beast?</hi> 5. Though
at the sound of the seventh Trumpet, <hi>the Kingdoms of this
World become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and his Christ,</hi> yet
this is but <hi>in fieri</hi> at that time, and not <hi>in facto esse,</hi> it is
then a doing, and not intirely done, it is then <hi>in esse inchoato,</hi>
in inchoation only, not <hi>in esse completo,</hi> in complete perfection,
it is then in the bud, and in the blossom, but not come to
full maturity till afterward, and as long as it is so, and no
more, the <hi>Beast</hi> may have a being in the World, after the
seventh Trumpet sounds, until the Kingdom of Christ be
brought to full perfection. In a word, the seventh Trumpet
is to sound more days than one, as the Angel saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7.
Now the first day that Trumpet sounds, the Kingdoms of
the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his
Christ <hi>inchoative</hi> inchoatively, but when the seventh Trumpet
hath sounded many days, and when all the Prophecies of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eleventh Chapter to the twentieth are
fulfilled, then the Kingdom of Christ shall be brought to
full perfection, and then the <hi>Beast</hi> shall have a final end, and
not before. And here it is to be noted, that the <hi>Beast</hi> which
Wars against the Witnesses, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. is not the same with the
<hi>Beast</hi> which overcomes the Saints, <hi>ch. 13. v.</hi> 7. of which more
hereafter in its proper place.</p>
                        <p>4. He will have the times of the witnesses, and of the Court
or Holy City possessed by the Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2, 3. to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
and this I grant to be true, for the 42 months of the
Gentiles in which they shall tread the Holy City under foot,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. and the 1260 days in which the Witnesses shall Prophecy,
<hi>v.</hi> 3. are the same.</p>
                        <p>5. He concludes the Synchronism with an inference. <hi>If
the treading underfoot of the Court, and Holy City, do contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with the Prophecy of the Witnesses, it will also contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the Beast.</hi> And this I deny, for the Witnesses do
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55629:56"/>
not contemporate with the <hi>Beast,</hi> only the two first do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate,
<hi>viz.</hi> the 42 months of the Gentiles, and the 1260
days of the Witnesses, but the rest succeed one another, the
woman in the Wilderness succeeds the times of the Witnesses,
and the <hi>Beast</hi> succeeds them both. And thus much in answer to
the first Synchronism.</p>
                        <p>The second Synchronism, is of the two horned Beast, (who is also
the false Prophet) with the ten horned Beast, who is also called the
Image of the Beast.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> And this is true, if meant of the time which succeeds
his restauration; for as soon as the wounded Beast is healed,
the other Beast is raised to counsel and assist him, and from
that time forth they Synchronise. But whereas he thinks
they were raised, the one out of the Sea, and the other out
of the earth both together, it is nothing so, for the ten
horned Beast is raised first, and in that respect is called the
first Beast, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and after he is raised, he is wounded,
and when his wound is healed, then the other Beast is
raised, and not before. And thus much of the second Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronism.</p>
                        <p>And as for the Appendix, because it makes nothing to
the Synchronism, whether it be true or false, I omit to
speak unto it; only I think it not amiss to acquaint the
Reader, that the ten horned beast is not the <hi>Image</hi> of the
<hi>Beast,</hi> as he would have it, but the <hi>object</hi> represented by the
<hi>Image.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third Synchronism is of the great Where, or mystical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
with that same Beast which hath seven heads and ten
Horns.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> If this were meant of the <hi>Beast ch.</hi> 17. it were
true, and not to be denied, but it being meant of the <hi>Beast
ch.</hi> 13. it is false, for that <hi>Beast</hi> outlives the Whore, and
Wars <hi>against him that sate upon the White Horse,</hi> that is, against
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55629:56"/>
Christ, after the Whore is destroyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20. And the
Synchronism doth suppose these Beasts to be all one, of which
more hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Synchronism, is of the 144000 Sealed Virgins, with
the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beast.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Five Arguments are brought to prove their Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nising.
The three first as he confesseth are insufficient to make
up a full and entire contemporising, for they may all consist
but with a partial. The fourth Argument is brought to prove
a total contemporising, but it comes short of it, as the three
other did, for though these Virgins be <hi>antistoechal</hi> to the
<hi>Beast,</hi> and all his followers, yet this is only at his declination,
and not before; and though they be the Servants of God,
and wear his Livery, and have his name written in their
foreheads, yet God had other Servants besides these which
had to deal with the <hi>Beast,</hi> and he with them before these
had, and they be the remnant of the womans seed, <hi>Rev. 12. 17.
Rev.</hi> 13. 7. but these Virgins advance against him afterward,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 2. It is true if God had had no more Servants
to oppose the <hi>Beast</hi> but these only, then must these have
been <hi>antistoechal</hi> to the <hi>Beast</hi> throughout from his first breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to his last gasp; but God had other Servants to oppose
the <hi>Beast</hi> before these did, and they are the remnant of the
womans seed, as was said before, therefore these are actually
<hi>antistoechal</hi> to him afterward, when the other have done their
work, and not before. The last Argument speaks expresly
of a final contemporising, and no more, which I grant to
be true, though I dislike the <hi>medium</hi> which is brought to
prove it. The truth of the Synchronism which we have
in hand, is this, the Virgin company of the Sealed are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedaneous
to the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> for they are Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the time of the sixth Seal, which is before the times
of the <hi>Beast</hi> and false Prophet do commence, but yet they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55629:57"/>
advance not against him, nor have to deal with him, nor
he with them, until his 42 months be ended, and then they
step forth against him, and get the Victory over him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2.
And as for the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we have a Prophecy of her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ruine, which is to come to pass in the time of the seventh
Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1. but of her first beginning, when she began to
be a Whore, we want a Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation</hi> to inform us
of it.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is a consectary of the general Synchronism of all hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mentioned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> His inference is, that they all Synchronise; my infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is from what I have said and proved, that only the
conculcation of the holy City 42 months, and the Witnesses
in the mean time Prophecying in Sackcloth 1260 days are
Synchronals, but all the rest succeed one another. The whole
Prophecy of the twelfth Chapter, shall succeed the Prophecy
in the eleventh Chapter, the Prophecy in the thirteenth
Chapter, shall succeed the Prophecy of the twelfth Chapter,
the Prophecy of the fourteenth Chapter, shall succeed the
Prophecy of the thirteenth Chapter, and the Prophecy in the
seventeenth Chapter, concerning the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> shall be
the last that shall come to pass of all that have been hitherto spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
                        <p>The sixth Synchronism is of the inner Court measured with the
Reed of God, and of the lying in wait, and the Battel of the seven
headed Dragon with <hi>Michael,</hi> concerning the Childbirth of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in travel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That they are not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Antecedents of contemporaries, for the <hi>woman</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. the <hi>Beast</hi> with ten Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5.
and the outer Court, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. do not contemporate, but
succeed each other, as hath been proved in my answer to
the first Synchronism. 2. Though it be true that the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55629:57"/>
Travel, and the Dimication of the <hi>Dragon</hi> with <hi>Michael</hi>
do contemporate, and the flight of the <hi>Woman</hi> into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
immediately succeed them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6, 13, 14. yet the
seven headed <hi>Beast</hi> restored doth not immediately succeed the
<hi>Duel,</hi> in which <hi>Michael</hi> over-threw the <hi>Dragon;</hi> for the <hi>Dragon</hi>
doth not immediately raise the <hi>Beast</hi> so soon as he is cast out of
Heaven unto the Earth, but before he attempt such a Work,
he first of all persecutes the <hi>Woman,</hi> Rev. 12. 13. then the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
flies into the Wilderness, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. after that he sends a
Floud of Water after her to carry her away, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. then the
Earth swallows up the floud of Water, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. and when all
this is done, then he leaves the Wilderness, and goes into the
Sea, from whence he raises up the <hi>Beast</hi> to War against the
Remnant of the Womans Seed and not before, <hi>vers. 17, 18.
Rev.</hi> 13. 1. 3. That the measuring of the inner Court shall
precede the conculcation of the outer Court I grant, and that
the forty two Months in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall tread it under
foot, begin when the measuring of the inner Court is ended;
but that the measuring of this inner Court shall synchronise
with the <hi>Womans</hi> Travel, and the Dimication of <hi>Michael</hi> with
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> I deny, and that because the conculcation of the
outer Court, and the Habitation of the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
do not synchronise, but succeed each other, as hath been
proved in my Answer to the first synchronism; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the measuring of the inner Court shall precede the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation
of the outer, so they both shall precede the <hi>Womans</hi>
Travel; and as the <hi>Womans</hi> Travel shall precede her flight, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in the Wilderness, so the habitation of the <hi>Woman</hi> in the
Wilderness shall precede the <hi>Beast,</hi> and all his Actings against
the Remnant of her Seed. Lastly, Whereas he talks of a repeated
Prophecy, he should have first proved a repeated Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had said so much of it, or built an Argument upon it, for
there is no repeated Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And when the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55629:58"/>
Angel saith, <hi>Oportet te iterum prophetare,</hi> thou must prophesie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 11. the meaning is not that he must begin a new
Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> from the first Original, repeating the same
times over again; but the meaning is, that he must prophesie
of other things, and of other times, which shall succeed the
former, and which he had not spoken of before.</p>
                        <p>The seventh Synchronism is of the seven Vials, and of the Beast

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> And this Synchronism I grant to be true, for the
seven Vials are the seven last plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1. and they fall
upon the men which have the Mark of the <hi>Beast,</hi> Rev. 16. 2.
and upon his Throne and Kingdom, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and upon <hi>Babylon,</hi>
vers. 19. and they never leave her, till they bring her, and the
<hi>Beast</hi> to a final end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and 18. and 19. 20.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> And thus I have gone over the first part of his Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronisms,
and as I believe have given fit Answers to them
all; what is true I have confessed to be true, and what is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
I have given Reasons for my denial and dislike of it.
I proceed now with the like Candor and Ingenuity, to speak
unto the rest of the Synchronisms which follow; but before I
begin, I must premise a few things in answer to his Prologue.
1. That the little Book had not any Prophecy written in it as
hath been proved in the former Question. 2. That upon this
account the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or the prophetical part thereof may not
fitly be divided into two main Prophecies, as he would have it,
whereof the first is <hi>Prophetia sigillorum,</hi> the prophecy of the
Seals, reaching from the fourth Chapter (or rather from the
sixth Chapter) to almost the end of the tenth; the second (as
he would have it) is <hi>Prophetia libri,</hi> the prophecy of the little
Book beginning at the eighth Verse of the tenth Chapter, and
reaching to the end of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> I say, that this may not
fitly be done, because there is but one prophecy of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55629:58"/>
and that is <hi>Prophetia sigillorum,</hi> the prophecy of the Seals
which begins at the sixth Chapter, and reacheth to the end of
the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for as for the little Book, it had not any prophecy
written in it, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> should have proved, that the little
Book had all the prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eighth
Verse of the tenth Chapter to the end of the Book, written in
it, and not have supposed it so to be. 3. That because there is
but one Book of prophecy and not two, therefore the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the eleventh Chapter, and so onwards, which are subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to the little Book, shall not begin their race at the same
Epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> that the Seals do, and so run along with them <hi>ad eandem
metam,</hi> to the same Goal, for this were to make two Books of
prophecy, when there is but one. 4. Suppose it to be true (as
he saith) that the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth consist of too main prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and the first of them to be <hi>Prophetia sigillorum,</hi> the prophecy
of the Seals, reaching from the fourth Chapter to almost the
end of the tenth, the other to be <hi>Prophetia libri,</hi> the prophecy
of the little Book, beginning at the eighth Verse of the tenth
Chapter, and reaching to the end of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> Yet it no
way follows, that these two prophecies must contemporate, or
begin their race at the same Epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of time, and conclude toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the same Goal, for the latter may begin where the other
left for all that. 5. Suppose the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> might
fitly be divided into two Tomes, and the second Tome to begin
at the eighth Verse of the tenth Chapter, at these Words, <hi>And
the voyce which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again;</hi> yet by
that voyce is not meant, the voyce mentioned <hi>Chap. 4. vers.</hi> 1.
but the voyce mentioned <hi>Chap. 10. vers.</hi> 4. and by the Words,
<hi>Thou must prophecy again,</hi> is not meant, that he must begin a
new prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> from the first Original, but rather that
he must begin where he left before. As if a man were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to write a History of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> in two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes;
the first Volume beginning with the Reign of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55629:59"/>
and ending with the Reign of <hi>David;</hi> the other Volume begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ending with the Reign of
<hi>Zedekiah;</hi> doth not this last Volume begin where the other left?
And no other is the case here. Suppose the prophecies of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
to consist of two Tomes, the one reaching from the
fourth (or sixth) Chapter, to the eighth Verse of the tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the other from thence to the end of the Book, this last tome
doth not contemporate with the former, but succeeds it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to Prophecy where the other left. 6. We read not that
the voice <hi>ch. 10. v.</hi> 8. was as the sound of a Trumpet, and
therefore not likely to relate to the voice, <hi>ch. 4. v.</hi> 1. but
rather to the voice, <hi>ch. 10. v.</hi> 4. for that voice, <hi>ch. 4. v.</hi> 1.
is said to be as the sound of a Trumpet, but this not. But to
what purpose he would have the Reader take notice of this,
I cannot tell; Is this an <hi>Index</hi> that the Prophecy of the little
Book, (as he calls it) doth contemporate with the Prophecy
of the Seals? No more than the voice, <hi>ch. 4. v.</hi> 1. is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
that the Prophecy of the Seals doth contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with the Vision of the seven Churches;<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 10.</note> for
both these,<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 1.</note> as well that <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. as that
<hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 1. had a voice as of a Trumpet before them, yet
they do not contemporate each with other. Lastly, you
may be sure that it is not so as he saith, that the second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
or the Prophecy of the little Book doth begin at the
eighth verse of the tenth Chapter, and reach from thence
to the end of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> because <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. you have the Period
of the sixth Trumpet, and the beginning of the seventh, from
the fourteenth verse to the end of the Chapter, both which
belong (not unto the little Book) but to the Prophecy
of the Seals, as you may see if you look into his scheme.
And thus much by way of answer to his Preface I come now to
the Synchronisms themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55629:59"/>
The first Synchronism which is the principal one, is of the
seventh Seal, so far as the six first Trumpets reach with the
ten horned, and two horned Beasts, and the rest contemporisers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer first in general, that the beginning of
the Beast doth not contemporate with the beginning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Seal, as he would have it, nor the end of the Beast contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, therefore here is no
Synchronising. 2. I answer to each branch of the Argument in
particular, and</p>
                        <p>1. I say that the beginning of the Beast, doth not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with the beginning of the seventh Seal, but is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the seventh Trumpet, and comes forth into the
World after the seventh Trumpet is begun, <hi>Rev. 11. 15.
Rev.</hi> 13. 1. 2. One opposite may be before another, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> who were deadly opposites one unto
another, yet <hi>Goliah</hi> was the elder, and <hi>David</hi> was the younger,
and did outlive <hi>Goliah:</hi> so though these Sealed Virgins be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Beast Reigning, yet the Virgins are the elder
Company, and are Sealed by the Angel before the Beast has
a being in the World. Opposition implies a partial contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
not a total. 3. In what respect are the Sealed Virgins
opposite to the Beast, but in respect of Religion, and warlike
persecution for Religion? And how either of these severally,
or both of them joyntly, can cause a total contemporation, I
am yet to seek. For instance, The Christians, and the <hi>Turks</hi>
are opposites in respect of their Religion, and who knows
not but that the Christian Religion, was before the <hi>Turkish?</hi>
And they be also opposite in respect of War, and yet this
made them not contemporate, but come behind the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
So what if these Virgins be opposite to the Beast in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Religion, is not their Religion before his? And what
if difference in Religion produce a War betwixt them, doth
not this War succeed Religion, and the Beast that is raised
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55629:60"/>
to begin this War, succeed it too? 4. If you look into the
text, you shall find that these Virgins, though they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Beast in respect of their Sealing, yet they actually
oppose him not in his Wars until his declination; then it is
that they actually advance against him, and not before. And
if it be asked of me, who they were that opposed him in his
Wars before his declination? I say, they were the remnant of
the womans seed whom he warreth with, and overcomes,
<hi>Rev. 12. 17, 18. Rev.</hi> 13. 7. but the Sealed ones advance
against him afterward, and get the Victory over him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2.
5. The Sealed ones are Sealed at the sixth Seal, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the seventh Seal begins, and therefore they be more
ancient than the Beast who hath no being in the World till
the seventh Trumpet is begun, and so much thereof as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the twelfth Chapter past before he riseth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1.
6. The contemporation he hath proved in the fourth Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronism
of his first part, is but a partial contemporation,
and comes far short of a total; for which see the Synchronism
it self, and my answer to it. 7. The Sealed ones are the
Servants of God before that they be Sealed, for the Seal doth
not make them such, but find them so to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 3. And
in this respect too they are more ancient than the Beast, and
do no otherwise contemporate with him, than as an elder
contemporates with a younger man. 8. The reason why the
Seal is put upon them in the sixth Seal, is not to call them
forth against the Beast, but to preserve them against the storms
of the ensuing Trumpets. And this is a sufficient answer
to the first branch of the Synchronism, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Beast doth not contemporate with the seventh
Seal.</p>
                        <p>2. I say that the end of the Beast doth not contemporate
with the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet; for though it be true,
that the 1260 days of the two Witnesses do end at the <hi>exit</hi>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55629:60"/>
of the sixth Trumpet, yet that the 42 months of the Beast
do end at that time too, I deny. 2. Instead of proving that the
42 months of the Beast are ended at the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth
Trumpet, he saith, that <hi>it is demonstrated already, part 1.
Synch.</hi> 1. §. 3. whither I refer the Reader for better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
And by the answer which I have given to it he shall
find, that it is no more proved there, than it is here; for if you
look into the Text, you shall find that the great City did
not fall at the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, but the tenth part
of it fell, and no more: and by the City in that place is not
meant the Throne of the Beast, but the holy City which the
Gentiles trample under foot 42 months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. 3. He
saith; <hi>by reason of the destruction which he then felt, the Beast was
at the last gasp or giving up the Ghost;</hi> but if you look into the
Text, you shall find that seven thousand men are slain in
the earthquake, and no more, and what is so small a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the expiration of the Beast, or to his last gasp? No
more than the loss of seven thousand men is to the ruine of
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire. For suppose the <hi>Turk</hi> should send an
Army from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to slay the <hi>Jews</hi> and
Christians that be there, and after this is done, seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of his men should be slain by an earthquake, what is this
to the ruine of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire? And no other is the case
here; The Beast sends his Soldiers to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which slay the
two Witnesses which Preach the Gospel there, and after this
is done, seven thousand of his men lose their lives by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
what is this to the ruine of the Beast? No more than
the loss of seven thousand men, is to the ruine of the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Empire. 4. He saith, <hi>that we might know in what time of the Seals
and Trumpets this should happen, the spirit immediately joyned the
second Wo, that is, the sixth Trumpet even then to be past:</hi> but
he should have proved that the Beast was then past, and
not that the second Wo was then past; which last I grant
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55629:61"/>
to be true, but the other I deny. Lastly, he saith, <hi>lest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
it should raise a scruple in any that those things which are
related in the Text concerning the overthrow of the Beast, the
fall of the City, and the slaughter of men caused by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
ought not to be understood of the utter destruction of the Beast,</hi>
he saith <hi>that it is not requisite to the Synchronism in hand, but
that they be means at least of the ending of the time of his power and
reign.</hi> But if you look into the Synchronism, the Words of
the Synchronism are, <hi>Finis lestiae contemporat cum exitu tubae
sextae,</hi> the end of the Beast doth contemporate with the <hi>exit</hi> of
the sixth Trumpet, not the end of the time of his Power and
Reign; and if you look into the sacred Text, there is nothing
at all of the ending of his Power and Reign, nor of the time of
their ending; all we find there is, that <hi>there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and the tenth part of the City fell, and in the Earthquake
were slain seven thousand Men:</hi> But what is this to the ending of
his Power and Reign, or the ending of the time thereof? No
more than the loss of so many Men is to the abolition of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi>
Power and Kingdom. We read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12. that <hi>the rest of
the Beasts had their Dominion taken away, yet their lives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
for a season:</hi> But we read not <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. that the Beast
hath his Dominion taken away at the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and his Life prolonged till the seventh. In a word, the
Synchronism doth suppose things which are not to be granted.
1. That the sealed Virgins, and the two Witnesses be all one
Company. 2. That the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. is the same with the
Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 3. That the one Thousand two Hundred and
sixty Dayes of the Witnesses <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 3. are the same with
the 42. Moneths of the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 5. 4. That the whole
time of the Beasts Reign is determined in those 42 Moneths;
all which must be proved before the Synchronism can be
made good. And thus much in Answer to the first Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55629:61"/>
The second Synchronism is of the contemporating inner Court,
and the battail of <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, about the birth of the
Child, with the six first Seals.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer. 1. That the measuring of the
inner Court, and the battail of <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, about
the birth of the Child, do not contemporate each with other;
and therefore not contemporate with the fix first Seals. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they immediate Antecedents of contemporating Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneans;
for though the six first Seals be the immediate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
of the seventh Seal, yet the measuring of the inner
Court, and the Dimication of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon, are
not the immediate Antecedents of the Beast, and the sealed
Virgins. 3. The seventh Seal, or (which is all one) the six
first Trumpets, and the company of the sealed, and the
Beast, are not contemporants, therefore here is no Synchroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
                        <p>The third Synchronism is of the Vials, with the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer. 1. That the seven Vials are the
seven last plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1. and therefore they do not begin
the ruine of the Beast, but end it. 2. The Kingdom of the
Beast is not brought to such a ruine in the sixth Trumpet, as to
put an end to his forty two Moneths; all that is done in that
Trumpet, is the falling of the tenth part of the City, and the
loss of seven Thousand men, and what is that to the ruine of the
Beasts Kingdom, or to the ending of his forty two Moneths.
3. The Beast shall have a far greater loss than that, before any
of the Vials be effused, for the Harvest <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. is a far greater
loss than that in the sixth Trumpet, and the Vintages far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Harvest, and both of them shall come upon the Beast
before any of the Vials be effused. 4. The fifth Vial is poured
out upon the Throne of the Beast, but that the Beasts Throne
is touched in the time of the sixth Trumpet, I deny. For
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55629:62"/>
by the tenth part of the City, is not meant the Throne of the
Beast, but <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> 5. The seventh Vial is a consummating
Vial, and the seventh Trumpet a consummating Trumpet: but
this doth not make them to contemporate; for the one takes
up more time in consummating than the other doth, as having
more things to consummate than the other hath; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<hi>Chap.</hi> 16. and consummates the things from thence unto
the end, the other begins <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and reaches from thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the Revelation.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Synchronism is of the thousand years of Satans being
bound with the seventh Trumpet or the space from the destruction of
the Beast.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer that the thousand years of Satans
being bound are shorter than the seventh Trumpet, both <hi>à


parte ante,</hi> and <hi>à parte p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>st.</hi> 1. They are shorter <hi>à parte ante,</hi>
for the thousand years begin <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1. but the seventh
Trumpet begins <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. and all the Prophecies between
that Chapter, and the twentieth belong unto the seventh
Trumpet, and not unto the little Book which had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
written in it. Again the thousand years expire at
the enlargement of the Prisoner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7. but the seventh
Trumpet goes beyond it, and contains under it, not only
that enlargement, but the insurrection and destruction of <hi>Gog</hi>
and <hi>Magog,</hi> the resurrection of the dead, and the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
so that the thousand years are much shorter than the
seventh Trumpet, both <hi>à parte ante</hi> on the fore part, and <hi>à


parte post</hi> on the hinder part. To that which follows in the
Synchronism I have no more to say, but what has been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to already, the rest not spoken to I leave to others to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that have a mind unto it, for my opinion is, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> shall come to pass in order as they were
revealed.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Synchronism is of the thousand years of the Soveraign
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55629:62"/>
Reign of Christ, and of the seventh Trumpet, or the space from the
destruction of the Beast.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer that the seventh Trumpet, and
the space of time which succeeds the destruction of the Beast
are not all one, for that space begins with the twentieth
Chapter, but the seventh Trumpet begins before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
not that space alone, but all the Prophecies besides,
from the eleventh Chapter to the twentieth. The rest that
follows in that Synchronism I leave to others to answer that
be so minded, for my opinion is, that the Prophecies of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> (what ever the meaning of them be) shall come to
pass in order as they were revealed.</p>
                        <p>The sixth Synchronism is of the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Lambs</hi> Bride
with the seventh Trumpet, or the space from the destruction of the
Beast.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer. 1. In general that the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
doth not begin at the destruction of the Beast, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate
with the thousand years, but succeed them. 2. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to each Argument in particular.</p>
                        <p>To the first, I say that the marriage of the Lamb,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. and the marriage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. 9. are not the
same. The first is the personal marriage of Christ, with the spouse
in grace; the other is the personal marriage of Christ, with the
spouse in glory.</p>
                        <p>To the second, I deny that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
City which <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> shall environ after the
thousand years are ended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9. for this latter is the Church
in the full state of grace, but the other is the Church in the full
state of glory.</p>
                        <p>To the third, <hi>factum est,</hi> it is done, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17. is not the
same <hi>factum est</hi> with that <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6. By the first is meant
that the seven last plagues were then expiring, that being
the last which then was pouring out, and the full state of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55629:63"/>

                        <p>The fourth Argument proves no more than this, that the
new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall succeed the utter exstinction of the <hi>Beast,</hi>
and <hi>Babylon:</hi> but that it shall succeed immediately, I deny.
The order shall be this, <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be destroyed first, the <hi>Beast</hi>
and false Prophet next, then shall be the thousand years, after
them the insurrection and destruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> after
that the last Judgment, then the Lake of fire for the cursed, and

                        <p>The seventh Synchronism of the Palm-bearing multitude of the
numberless triumphants out of all Nations, Tribes, People, and

                        <p>Ans. <hi>Two Arguments are brought to prove this, the first is
to this effect,</hi> The Palm-bearing multitude immediately succeeds
the Company of the Sealed, and that company ended with the
Beast, at the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, therefore the Palm-bearing
multitude followeth both.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> But if you look into the seventh Chapter, you shall
there find they immediately succeed the time of their Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
not the race of the Sealed, but the time of their Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Now their Sealing is in the time of the sixth Seal,
before any of the Trumpets do begin, therefore these
Palm-bearers precede the seventh Trumpet, and the first to
boot.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The second Argument is,</hi> that they be Citizens of the new
<hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> But in the sixth Seal, under which they are presented
unto <hi>John,</hi> they are not come to that estate at that time, their
bodies being not then raised from the Grave, their Souls being
then in Heaven in the state of bliss, at such time as the Sealed
ones are Sealed on earth.</p>

Other things there be in these Synchronisms, which for
brevity sake I omit to speak unto. By that which hath been said
the Reader may perceive there be no such Synchronisms as he
would have, except those which belong to one and the same
Prophecy; as the two <hi>Beasts</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter do: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the Prophecies succeed one another, and shall come to
pass in order (not as they be written) but as they were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and this is as sure rule to go by, and gives great Light to
the Exposition of the Prophecies; for such an Exposition must
be put on each Prophecy, as to make it succeed the Prophecy
that went before, and precede the Prophecie which follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the same order to be observed in Execution, as was in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
                        <p>And here the Reader may take notice. 1. That every one of
these Synchronisms is to be understood of a total, not of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Contemporation; for some of them are true of a partial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporation,
(as that the sealed Virgins do contemporate with
the <hi>Beast)</hi> but none of them of a total. 2. That for the most
part things are set down in writing, in such order as they were
revealed; and there be but very few things that be set down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and they be such as belong to one and the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and were presented to <hi>John</hi> both together, but could
not be set down in writing both together, but immediately one
after another: As for instance, the Travel of the Woman with
Child, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. and the watching of the Dragon to devour
her Child as soon as it was born, were presented unto <hi>John</hi> both
together, and shall come to pass both together; but he could
not set them down in writing both together, but immediately
one after another: So the watching of the Dragon, and the
Battail of <hi>Michael,</hi> with him, were presented to <hi>John</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and shall come to pass both together, but could not be
set down in writing both together (but immediately one after
another) unless it were in Colums in this manner.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter, from
the first Verse to the end of the fourteenth, doth belong to the sixth
Trumpet, and be a part thereof?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The sixth Trumpet doth not end with the ninth
Chapter, nor at the sixth Verse of the tenth Chapter, but reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
onward to the fourteenth Verse of the eleventh Chapter,
and there ends, and not before, as appears from the words of
that Verse, <hi>The second woe is past, and behold the third woe cometh
quickly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The close of the sixth Trumpet is not set down at the
end of the ninth Chapter, nor at the sixth or seventh Verse
of the tenth Chapter; but at the fourteenth Verse of the
eleventh Chapter: Therefore whatever comes between the
seventh Verse of the tenth Chapter, and the fourteenth Verse of
the eleventh Chapter, doth belong unto the sixth Trumpet, and
is a part thereof.</p>
                  <p>3. Look into the former Trumpet, and you shall not find
any thing interposed between the end of that Trumpet, and
the close thereof; and why should any Man think that so
large a Prophecy, as is contained between the seventh Verse
of the tenth Chapter, and the fourteenth Verse of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Chapter, is interposed here?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55629:67"/>
4. Of all the six Trumpets, none have a remarkable close
added to them, but the fifth and the sixth Trumpets only; and
wherefore were these closes added to them, but that we might
exactly know as well where they end, as where they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?
Now the fifth Trumpet ends where the close thereof is
set, and that is <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 12. and therefore also the sixth Trumpet
ends where the close thereof is set, and that is <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. and
not before.</p>
                  <p>5. St. <hi>John</hi> when he wrote the <hi>Revelation,</hi> did not distinguish
it into Chapters and Verses, as now it is, but did set down the
sixth Trumpet, and all the rest of the <hi>Revelation</hi> joyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any such Partition, or Division; and if they
which did at first distinguish the <hi>Revelation</hi> into Chapters, and
Verses, had made but one Chapter of the sixth Trumpet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the thirteenth Verse of the ninth Chapter, and
ending with the fourteenth Verse of the eleventh Chapter, as
they might have done, the matter had been more clear, perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and evident to the eye than now it is. <hi>It cannot be denied</hi>
(saith Mr. <hi>Mede) but the Division of Chapters, especially in the
New Testament, being but</hi> Humani instituti, <hi>is sometimes so ill
ordered, that it doth much prejudice the Reader in understanding
the meaning of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Remains <hi>pag.</hi> 5. And if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this Trumpet had been ordered into one Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the thirteenth Verse of the ninth Chapter,
and ending with the fourteenth Verse of this eleventh
Chapter; what man would have doubted, but that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the eleventh Chapter, to the fourteenth Verse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
did belong unto the sixth Trumpet, as the Prophecy in the
ninth Chapter, from the thirteenth Verse, to the end thereof
doth.</p>
                  <p>6. Had it been said in the tenth Chapter, at the end of the
sixth Verse, <hi>The second Woe is past;</hi> here had been an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Argument, that the Prophecy of the sixth Trumpet, did

not reach so far as the eleventh Chapter: Or had it been said in
the eleventh Chapter, <hi>The first Vision of the little Book is past, and

that the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter to the
fourteenth Verse, did belong unto the little Book, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sixth Trumpet. But in regard it is not said in the tenth
Chapter, <hi>The second Woe is past,</hi> nor in the eleventh Chapter,
<hi>The first Vision of the little Book is past;</hi> but in the eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>vers.</hi> 14. it was said, <hi>The second Woe is past,</hi> and <hi>behold
the third Woe cometh quickly:</hi> Here is an irrefragable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter to the
fourteenth Verse, doth belong unto the sixth Trumpet, and
not unto the little Book, which had no Prophecy written
in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> In the tenth Chapter, at the sixth Verse, is the end
of the sixth Trumpet; for there 'tis said, that Time shall be no
more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> By time is not meant the time of the sixth Trumpet;
as if the time thereof were past: but the meaning is, as <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
well Expounds it, <hi>Exiguum admodum jam superesse tempus
ad consummationem,</hi> that there is now but a very little time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
to the seventh Trumpet, in which the Mystery of God
shall be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> In the same Chapter, at the seventh Verse, comes in the
seventh Trumpet, which plainly shews, that the sixth Trumpet ended
at the Verse before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But if you look into the Text, you shall there find,
that the seventh Trumpet is then to be expected, and 'tis there
spoken of to signifie so much. <hi>But in the dayes of the Voyce of the
seventh Angel, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> when he shall be ready to sound,</hi>
Quando futurum est ut clangat, saith Brightman, <hi>when his
turn shall come to sound;</hi> which plainly shews, that the time for
the seventh Trumpet was not yet come to sound, and that the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55629:68"/>
time of the sixth Trumpet was not yet expired, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer, even to the fourteenth verse of the eleventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Prophecy of the little Book is no part of the sixth
Trumpet, but the Prophecy of this eleventh Chapter, from the
first verse to the fourteenth doth belong unto the little Book, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny the Major, for a little Book may be the issue
or Daughter of a great Book, and as out of the seventh Seal
came forth seven Trumpets, so out of the sixth Trumpet came
forth the little Book, whether any thing were written therein
or no, and if there were, it doth belong unto the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and to no other. 2. I deny the minor, for the little Book
had not any Prophecy written in it, as hath been shewed in
the former Chapter; and when the Angel said to <hi>John</hi> in the
former Chapter; <hi>Thou must Prophecy again,</hi> his meaning is not
that he must begin a new Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> and so begin a
new Book, repeating the same times over again, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
would have it, <hi>clavis Apoc. p. 13. Remaines p.</hi> 4, 5. but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that he must go forward with the former Prophecy of
the Seals and Trumpets, and in particular, with the Prophecy
of the sixth Trumpet, and make know the other part thereof
which was yet behind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> By 42 months mentioned ver. 2. is meant Prophetical
months, and by 1260 days ver. 3. is meant Prophetical days,
that is 1260 years, as appears Numb. 14. 34. Ezech. 4. 6.
but it is not likely that the sixth Trumpet should continue half so
long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Look into the Prophets he that will, he shall never
find a Prophetical month any more than a natural month,
and that is thirty natural days, and no more; and as for the
word <hi>dayes,</hi> it is very seldom, if ever at all put for years,
unless it be typically, as <hi>Numb. 14. 34. Ezech.</hi> 4. 6. but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55629:68"/>
not elsewhere. 2. What if <hi>Numb. 14. 34. Ezech.</hi> 4. 6. a
day be put for a year? Is it therefore so here? Or is it so in
all other Prophecies of the Scripture beside? If it were, it is
very likely it should be so here; but look into the Prophets
while you will, you shall hardly find it taken for a year in
other places, therefore not likely it should be so taken in the
<hi>Revelation.</hi> 3. Is the same number, or the same matter spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of <hi>Numb. 14. 34. Ezech.</hi> 4. 6. as is here? If it were,
no doubt they should be taken all alike in all the three places;
but compare the words together, you shall not find the same
number, nor the same matter spoken of <hi>Numb. 14. 34.
Ezech.</hi> 4. 6. as is here. 4. What if I should shew you a
Text of Scripture, where the self same number that is here
used, is taken literally for 1260 natural days, and no more?
Is not this a more probable Argument, that it is so taken here?
Look then into the next Chapter following, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. and ask
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself, and others of our Protestant Divines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
1260 days be any more than three years and a half,
<hi>Comment Apoc. pag. 174. Moulins</hi> Accomplishment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
<hi>pag. 194. 200, 201. Piscator</hi> in <hi>Apoc. cap. 12. v.</hi> 6.
and then judge of it. 5. What if <hi>Numb. 14. 34. Ezek.</hi> 4. 6.
days be not put for years absolutely, but typically? Read
the words, and you shall find that to be the meaning. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the number of the days in which ye searched the Land, even
40 days, each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities, even
forty years:</hi> be not days here, types of years? So again,
<hi>Ezech. 4. 5, 6. According to the number of the days, 390
days, so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the House of</hi> Israel. <hi>And
when thou hast accomplished them, lye again on thy right side,
and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the House of</hi> Juda 40 <hi>days,
I have appointed thee each day for a year:</hi> is not this typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
to be understood? And if days be not put for years in
neither of these places unless it be typically, why should any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55629:69"/>
man think that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> they be put for years abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely?
For typically they cannot be, unless a man will say, that
<hi>John</hi> was three years and a half in receiving this Prophecy, as
the men of <hi>Israel</hi> were forty days in searching the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> which I think no man will affirm. Briefly then, if
days be put for years in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> 1260 days for 1260
years, it is either absolutely, or typically. If absolutely, shew
me the like in other places: If typically, shew me the analogy
between the type, and the Antitype, as it is plainly to be seen in
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> As ye were forty days in searching the Land,
so shall ye bear your iniquity in the Wilderness forty years; and
as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to lye on his right side forty days, so God would
wink at their iniquity forty years, and then the captivity should
be brought upon them. This is the analogy beteen the type,
and the Antitype, in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> shew me the analogy
in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for if no analogy can be found, there is no
type, nor Antitype to be had. Again, if days be put for years
absolutely in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then neither that place, <hi>Numb.</hi>
14. 34. nor that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 6. will prove it, for in both
these places, they be put typically, not absolutely. And if it be
said, that they be put typically in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then as <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
was to lye on his right side forty days in his ecstasie, so the
Angel was three years and a half in revealing this Prophecy
unto <hi>John,</hi> and three years and a half more in revealing the
Prophecy of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and three years and a half more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
the Prophecy of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> was so long in his
ecstasie, when as the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> was revealed to him in
one day, and that was the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. See <hi>Disp. 1.
q. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>2.</hi> 6. What if these 1260 days of the Witnesses, and the
1260 days of the Womans living in the Wilderness, and the
42 months of the <hi>Beast</hi> do not contemporate, but succeed one
another? Is not this an Argument that they are literally to be
understood? Now that the 42 months of the <hi>Beast,</hi> shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55629:69"/>
the 1260 days of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and the 1260 days of the
woman shall succed the 1260 days of the Witnesses, hath been
proved already in the former Chapter, <hi>q.</hi> 2. and shall be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther in the twelfth and thirteenth Chapters following.
7. What if these days of the Witnesses be days of safety and
security, is it likely that they shall be in safety or security so
many years? Now that these days of the Witnesses be days
of safety and security, the fifth, sixth, and seventh verses of this
Chapter do plainly teach, <hi>And if any man will hurt them,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
before the 1260 days be ended) <hi>fire proceedeth out of
their mouth, and devoureth their Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. so that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
be in danger all that time, but the Witnesses be in safety.
8. To this may be added what the Angel saith in the former
Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. that <hi>there should be time no longer, but in the
days of the voice of the seventh Angel when he shall begin to sound,
the mystery of God shall be finished,</hi> which words imply that there
is but a very little time from thence to the sounding of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet, as <hi>Brightman</hi> well expounds it, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the 1260 days of the two Witnesses which comes between
that time, and the sounding of that Trumpet, is but a short
time. To which likewise may be added that these two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
be two men, and no more, and therefore they cannot
live so long as to Prophesie 1260 years. And if it be said that
these two Witnesses be put for all the Prophets that suffered for
the name of Christ all that time, and that they be called two
because they be but few, to this I answer. 1. That if this were
the meaning, the word [two] might very well have been left out,
and it had been sufficient to have said, <hi>I will give power to my
Witnesses, and they shall Prophesie 1260 days,</hi> and this would
have took them in all, and the sense had been compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the word [two,] but the wisdom of God thought it fit to
put it in, and that no less than four times in this Prophecy,
once <hi>v.</hi> 3. twice <hi>v.</hi> 4. and the fourth time <hi>v.</hi> 10. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55629:70"/>
was it done but to shew that these two Witnesses be two
men, and no more, like as when 'tis said, <hi>Mat. 27. 38. And
there were two Thieves crucified with him,</hi> wherefore was the
word [two] put in, but to shew the Thieves were two men,
and no more? So when 'tis said, <hi>I will give power to my two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
wherefore is the word [two] put in, but to shew that
these two Witnesses be two men, and no more? 2. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say that all the Prophets which suffered for the name of
Christ in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days were but few, or that they which
suffered since in <hi>Ireland</hi> were but few, or that they which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of late days in <hi>Savoy,</hi> were but few, much less can we say
that all the Prophets which suffered in 1260 years space, were
but few. And though the Prophets which suffered in some
Kings Reigns were but few, or none at all, yet count we the
number of them all which suffered in 1260 years space, and
we cannot say that they be few. 3. We cannot
say that all the Prophets which suffered for the
name of Christ in 1260 years space (call them few
or many) did begin and end their Prophecy together,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 9. 14.</note> but
some at one time, and some at another time. We cannot say
that they did all dye in one day, and in one place, but some in
one year, and some in another year, some in one place, and
some in another place: but of these two Witnesses we may say,
that they did both begin and end their Prophecy together, they
both suffer death in one day, and in one place, and they both
return to life in one hour. And therefore these two witnesses be
not all the Prophets of the Lord which have suffered for his
name 1260 years together, for they dyed successively at distant
times, and in distant places, but these died both in one day, and in
one place too, and therefore they be two men, and no more, and
the 1260 days be three years and a half, and no more. And this is
more than I need have said to this objection, but if any doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more, let him read what is said <hi>ch. 12. q.</hi> 2. and he shall find
something more said unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:55629:70"/>
2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in <hi>Adrians</hi>
time?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The measuring of a Temple and an Altar, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the building of two Holy places at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for the People
of the <hi>Jews</hi> to worship in, the one in the place where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stood, the other in the place where the Altar stood, but we
read not of any such places built in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but we read
in some Books of History, that <hi>Adrian</hi> would have built a Church
for <hi>Christians</hi> without Images, if some about him had not told
him that it would be dishonourable to all the rest of the Gods,
which was the cause he did it not. See <hi>Prideaux History,</hi>
pag. 199.</p>
                  <p>2. The not measuring of the <hi>Court which is without the Temple</hi>
doth imply the not building of it, therefore the building of a
new City at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Adrian</hi> in the place where the outer
Court did stand, cannot be meant thereby.</p>
                  <p>3. After the building of the Temple, and the Altar, the
outer Court shall be given to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Holy City
shall they tread under Foot 42 months after the Holy places be
provided, and no longer: but since the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to this
day has been more than 42 months which way soever we take
them, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> has been troden under foot by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
all this while.</p>
                  <p>4. The two Witnesses be not two Bishops at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the
one of the <hi>Jewish,</hi> the other of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Congregations, for
there was but one Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at one time, and there
were but fifteen Bishops in all, until the destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi>
by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and all of them were <hi>Jews,</hi> whereof the first was
<hi>James</hi> the Brother of the Lord, and the last was <hi>Judas;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the City was destroyed by him, there were no more Bishops
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the first of them was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
See <hi>Eusebius l: 4. c. 5. l. 5. c.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>5. The two witnesses be Prophets extraordinary, as appears
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55629:71"/>
by their description, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. and by their miracles, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.
now there were no Prophets extraordinary in the days of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and there were not any that could do such miracles as these
had power to do <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, nor in any time
since.</p>
                  <p>6. When the two Witnesses shall have <hi>finished their testimony,
the Beast that cometh out of the bottomless Pit, shall make War against
them, and overcome them, and slay them,</hi> v. 7. Now there
was no <hi>Beast</hi> in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, except <hi>Adrian</hi> himself, and he
did not make War against the <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> but against
the wicked and Rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> only: but they with whom I
deal in this question, will not allow <hi>Adrian</hi> to be the <hi>Beast</hi>
here spoken of, but one <hi>Barchocheba</hi> a Rebellious Captain of
the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Adrians</hi> time. Now by the <hi>Beast</hi> is meant some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
King or other that had ten Kings under him, or to joyn
with him, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12, 13. 17. but <hi>Barchocheba</hi>
was no King, nor had any King under him, or to joyn with
him.</p>
                  <p>7. After the two Witnesses had been dead three days and a
half, <hi>the Spirit of life from God entred into them, and they stood
upon their feet,</hi> v. 11. but there were not any that were raised
from death to life in the days of <hi>Adrian,</hi> nor in any time since.
And if it be said, that this is meant of their successours, to this
I answer. 1. That the two Witnesses had no successours, for
there were no such Prophets in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, nor at any time
since, and there were not any that could do such miracles as
these had power to do <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. in <hi>Adrians time,</hi> nor in any
time since. 2. The Souls of men after they be dead, do not
enter into other mens bodies, but into their own bodies only,
now 'tis said, <hi>the Spirit of life,</hi> (that is their Souls) <hi>entred into
them,</hi> v. 11. therefore this is not meant of their successours,
but of their own bodies; for if the Spirit of life did enter into
their successours, it did not enter into them, but into others,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55629:71"/>
and they did not stand upon their feet, that is their own feet,
but upon the feet of others, 3. <hi>They heard a voice from Heaven
saying unto them, Come up hither; and they ascended up to Heaven
in a Cloud, and their enemies beheld them,</hi> v. 12. Now, what
man did ever ascend to Heaven in successours? And what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
were it to him if he did? We read that <hi>Christ</hi> ascended
thither, and so did <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> but of any that went to
Heaven in successours, we read not in all the Scripture. And
if these two Witnesses did ascend to Heaven, as were made alive
in successours, what became of their dead bodies? The Text
saith, <hi>they shall lye in the street of the great City, and they shall see
their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their
dead bodies to be put in Graves,</hi> v. 8, 9. but if the Spirit of life
did not enter into them, what became of their dead bodies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward?
Did they lye in the street still? Or did the Ravens eat
them, or the Dogs devour them, or were they buried in the
earth-quake? Or what became of them, let them tell me if
they can? And let them tell me too, whether <hi>Barchocheba</hi> and
his complices, whom they suppose to be the enemies of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
here spoken of, were not dead before the Christians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi>
time were advanced to peace, and Halcyonian days in
<hi>Iudaea?</hi> And if they were, how can it be said that their enemies
did behold their ascension into Heaven, seeing they were dead
before? And lastly, if the Witnesses were made alive in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
why do they not also say that the Widows Son of
<hi>Naim</hi> was made alive in a successour? And if they ascended up
to Heaven in successours, why do they not also say that <hi>Enoch</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> ascended thither in successours? Yea, why do they not
say that <hi>Christ</hi> himself ascended thither in a successour? And
why do they not say that all the Texts of Scripture which speak
of the Resurrection of the dead, be meant of the rising of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours?
And if they can have Faith to believe that the Texts
of Scripture which speak of the Resurrection of the dead, be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55629:72"/>
meant of the Resurrection of the same bodies that were dead,
why can they not have so much Faith as a grain of Mustard
Seed, to believe that the enlivening of the Witnesses, is
meant of the enlivening of the same bodies that were
dead?</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>The same hour</hi> that this was done, <hi>there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi>
v. 13. but we read not of any earth-quake at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but in <hi>Iulians</hi> time there was.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>The tenth part of the City fell,</hi> v. 13. Now in <hi>Adrians</hi>
time the whole City was destroyed, and the Plough passed over
it, and a new one built by <hi>Adrian</hi> on its ruines, which he called
<hi>Aelia,</hi> after his own name <hi>Aelius.</hi> And here we are to take
notice, that this new City was not built by <hi>Adrian</hi> before the
Rebellion of the <hi>Iews</hi> began, as the Temple and the Altar were,
<hi>v.</hi> 1. before the Witnesses began to Preach, but this new City
was built by him after the Rebellion of the <hi>Iews</hi> was over. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
l. 4. c. 6. Carion. Chron. l. 3. p.</hi> 229.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>And in the earth-quake were slain of men seven thousand,</hi>
v. 13. but the <hi>Iews</hi> that were slain in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, were far
more in number, and they were also slain by the <hi>Sword,</hi> and not
by an <hi>earthquake,</hi> as these in the Text were; so that there is
scarce any thing in the Text that doth agree to <hi>Adrians</hi> time
or Person. But that which makes men run into these errors, is
partly because they turn the literal sense into a mystical, and
partly because they make a History of that which is yet a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and seek for things future in ages past, where they shall
never find them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If this be a Prophecy of what was done in <hi>Adrians</hi>
time, what's the reason we have not a Prophecy of what was
done in <hi>Iulians</hi> time? For remarkable things were done in his
time, and there was not a total destruction of the Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
then, at which time there was such an earth-quake at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
that the very Foundations of the Temple were destroyed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55629:72"/>
thereby, which was not done before. Yea, what's the reason
we have no Prophecy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> who have tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> under foot many hundred years, and not only it,
but all the Churches in the East beside, is not this more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than what was done in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, or in <hi>Iulians</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And is it likely that so many Prophecies should be spent
about the affairs of <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and not a word of this?
Is not this an indication that the Prophecies have some other
meaning? And that this Prophecy of the two Witnesses was not
fulfilled in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but is yet to be expected?</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether, what is done by the two Witnesses in this
Prophecy be not an inchoation or preparation to the <hi>Jews</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What did the Angel mean when he said that time
should be no more, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 6. but the time of the <hi>Iewish</hi> blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Or else we may with <hi>Brightman</hi> and some others translate
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the word <hi>delay,</hi> and then the meaning is,
the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be no more delayed, <hi>but in the
days of the seventh Angel, when he shall sound his Trumpet, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of God,</hi> that is, the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be brought
to pass, and therefore here is a preparation for it before the sixth
Trumpet endeth.</p>
                  <p>2. What is it to <hi>measure the Temple of God, and the Altar</hi> but
to build two Holy places at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for the <hi>Iews</hi> to worship
God in? And what is it to build two holy places at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for
them to worship God in, but to begin the conversion of that
Nation?</p>
                  <p>3. It is said, <hi>v. 3. And I will give power to my two Witnesses,
and they shall Prophesie 1260 days cloathed in Sackcloth.</hi> Now what
is it to Prophesie in Sackeloth, but as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist did, to
prepare the way of the Lord by Preaching of Repentance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> before the Lord come? And where
shall this be done, but at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where the <hi>Iews</hi> dwell, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55629:73"/>
in the Temple, and the Altar that is the inner Court, which is
to be provided for this end and purpose that the Witnesses may
Prophesie therein.</p>
                  <p>4. Look into the History of their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
you shall find they began their restauration with the building of
the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron. 26. 22, 23. Ezra</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. they did not
build their own Houses first, (as men have done in our days,)
and the Temple afterward, but they built the Temple first, and
their own Houses afterward: and no other course do they take
here; we read not of the building of their own Houses in this
place, but of the building of a Temple, and an Altar at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
to worship God in, and no more.</p>
                  <p>5. Look into the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> and you shall find that the
Vision of a <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and of two <hi>Olive Trees</hi> is presented to the
Prophet, to signifie unto him the building of the Temple at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and restoring the worship of God to that Nation, <hi>Zach. 4.
2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> and for no other reason are these two Witnesses called
two Olives, and two Candlesticks, than that they restore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in some measure to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>6. Wherefore doth the <hi>Beast</hi> make War against the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
but because they Preach the Gospel to the <hi>Iews</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and endeavour the conversion of that Nation, which the <hi>Beast</hi>
and all that be of his mind cannot endure to hear of, the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Iews</hi> is such an eye-sore unto them, and to <hi>Satans</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that they had rather hear of any thing than of it.</p>
                  <p>7. We read in History, that the <hi>Iews</hi> heretofore have attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to rebuild a Temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in <hi>Iulians</hi> time to restore
their former worship, but God did not approve thereof, and
therefore it suddenly came to nought: but such a Temple, and
such an Altar shall be built in this place as is approved of by God
and <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded for to measure it, and therefore it is not
done to restore the old worship and ceremonies of the law, but
the true worship of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:55629:73"/>
8. The place where this is to be done is <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and therefore
that people are concerned in this Prophecy; and the thing that is
aimed at by the two Witnesses, is the conversion of that Nation,
&amp; what is here done by them, is a tendency or preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and not only the <hi>Jews</hi> which are then dwelling at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
shall come unto them and hear them preach, but other <hi>Jews</hi> also
which dwell in other Countries hearing what is done at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
&amp; what success the Witnesses have there, will resort thither,
hoping to see their Restauration brought to pass at this time, or
to learn of them what they should do in order to their Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is the place where these things shall be
fulfilled, may appear by these Reasons. 1. It is called the Holy City,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. Now <hi>Babylon</hi> is never called a Holy City, but <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is, <hi>Mat.
4. 5. Mat.</hi> 27. 53. To which may be added, that the Hebrew Tongue
is called the Holy Tongue, &amp; the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called the Holy
Land, and the War against the <hi>Turks,</hi> for regaining of that Land,
is called the Holy War; &amp; it is remarkable that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is now
called by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are the Possessors of it, <hi>Kuddish,</hi> which is
in their Language a Holy City; &amp; who can tell whether the Holy
Ghost might not use this Expression in this place for that Reason?
2. It is the City which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall tread under foot 42
Months, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and what is that City but <hi>Ierusalem? Luk.</hi> 21. 24.
3. It is Spiritually called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> now <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is called
<hi>Sodom,</hi> Esa. 1. 10. 4. It is the City <hi>where our Lord was crucified,</hi> and
what should that be but <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> 5. It is called the great City,
and that City is distinguished too from <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 16. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Here is no mention of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Prophecy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is mention of a <hi>Temple,</hi> and an <hi>Altar</hi> to be built
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which none can be supposed to do at this time but
the <hi>Iews</hi> only. 2. Here is mention of an outer Court unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
because given to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> therefore the inner Court
called the Temple, and the Altar is measured, because given to
the <hi>Iews</hi> to worship God in, and for the two Witnesses to preach
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55629:74"/>
the Gospel in. 3. Wheresoever ye find mention of Prophets,
there is still a Reference had unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom only it was
peculiar, and their great priviledge to be furnished with Prophets
extraordinary: Now here is mention of such Prophets, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.
And if it be said that <hi>Ionah</hi> was a Prophet extraordinary, and sent
to <hi>Ninive,</hi> to this I answer, that he was sent unto the <hi>Iews</hi> first, and
did peculiarly belong to them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 25. and that he was sent
to <hi>Ninive</hi> at all, was a case extraordinary, and not usual to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> By the measuring of the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> is meant
a spiritual Building, and not a material.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If that spiritual building be the <hi>Iews,</hi> 'tis as much as I
labour for in this Question. 2. Here is both a material build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and a spiritual in this place. A material in the words <hi>(Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and <hi>Altar)</hi> and a spiritual in the words which follow <hi>(those
which worship therein)</hi> 3. A spiritual building cannot well be
without a material, nor a material without a spiritual; for if
there be a material House or Chappel, it is for the use of the
spiritual, and if there be a spiritual building, it is requisite that
there should be a material, I mean a Holy place for them to meet
together to worship God in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> By <hi>Altar</hi> is not meant a material <hi>Altar,</hi> but a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
for no such <hi>Altars</hi> are to be made in the time of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> A material Altar properly so called, is to offer a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Sacrifice, such as the Sacrifices of the <hi>Iews</hi> were in the time
of the Law, and such a one shall not be built at this time; but
a material Altar improperly so called is a Holy place, Church, or
Chappel, or some such thing to worship God in, and such a one
shall be built at this time. See this meaning of the word Altar,
<hi>Rev. 14. 18. Rev.</hi> 16. 7. See <hi>Mede</hi> Comment. <hi>Apoc. p.</hi> 125.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is not likely that the same City, in the same Prophecy,
should be called a Holy City, and spiritually <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> too: but
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> is called a Holy City, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and therefore <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Egypt,</hi> vers. 8. is some other place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55629:74"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not likely that the <hi>Holy City,</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>
should be two distinct places; neither is it likely that the two
Witnesses should prophesie in one place, and be slain in another
place, remote from the place where they prophesied: Now the
place where they prophesied is <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Temple, and
the Altar, that is the inner Court, are given them to that end
and purpose; and the place where they be slain is the City,
<hi>where our Lord was crucified;</hi> so that every thing agrees unto
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and he that hath but half an Eye may see it. 2. One
and the same place is called <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Bethaven</hi> in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 5, 15. so is <hi>Ierusalem</hi> called a faithful City, and
a Harlot too in one and the same Prophecy, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1. 21. And we
read of the <hi>Abomination of Desolation standing in the Holy place,</hi>
Mat. 24. 15. And therefore no marvel if a Holy City be made
unholy, and yet retain the Name of Holy from its first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
3. The reason why <hi>Bethel</hi> was called <hi>Bethaven,</hi> is because it
was the place of Idol Worship, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 29. and the reason why
it retained the Name of <hi>Bethel</hi> still, is because it was the ancient
place of Gods Worship, before the Idol Worship came thither,
<hi>Gen. 28. 17, 19. Iud. 2. 18. 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 3. So the reason why
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> at this time, is because the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> which are in it at this time are as unclean as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and
as cruel to the people of God as <hi>Egypt</hi> was heretofore; and the
reason why it retains the Name of the Holy City still, is because
it was the ancient place of God's Worship before the <hi>Sodomites</hi>
came thither, and shall be so again when the <hi>Sodomites</hi> are
gone from thence, <hi>Ioh. 4. 20. Esa.</hi> 2. 2, 3. Or else we may
say, that the reason why it was called a Holy City, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Temple was in some part thereof; and the reason
why it is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> at this time, is because the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> are in another part thereof, as bad as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>
were.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> Christ was not crucified in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but without, <hi>Heb.</hi>
13. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The word <hi>(where)</hi> has not reference to the word
<hi>(street)</hi> but to the word <hi>(City)</hi> and the meaning is, that their
dead Bodies shall lye in the street of the great City, <hi>(where)</hi> that
is <hi>(at which)</hi> not <hi>(in which)</hi> our Lord was crucified. 2. Let
it be supposed that the word <hi>(where)</hi> has reference to the
word <hi>(street)</hi> and that it signifies as much as <hi>(in which)</hi>
yet this will do them no good; for part of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> doth
now stand on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> at this day, and what may be
hereafter when this Prophecy comes to be fulfilled, who can
tell?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Christ was crucified at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in the <hi>Roman
Empire</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> What then? The first is meant in this place, and not
the last; for Christ was not crucified all the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> over,
but in one only place thereof, and that was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
no where else. 2. If a man should ask of these men where our
Saviour Christ was born, they would not answer at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
and in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> too? For they know very well, that
the Question is not meant of the place in general, but of the
place in particular; so when 'tis said <hi>(where our Lord was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)</hi>
it is not meant of the place in general, but of the place in
particular, and the general is included in the particular, and is
sufficiently known by naming the particular; so that they need
not say at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> too, for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is included in the former, and is sufficiently known by
naming of the former, unless there had been two <hi>Ierusalems</hi> in
the World, one in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the other without,
as there were two <hi>Bethlehems</hi> heretofore, one in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which is the cause that the Gospel saith, in
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> Mat. 2. 1. to distinguish it from the other
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> which was in <hi>Galilee:</hi> So if there had been two <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salems</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55629:75"/>
in the World, one within the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the other
without, one might have said at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
too; but in regard there was but one <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the World,
and that was within the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> one may not say at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> too, unless he hath a mind
to speak nonsense, which the wisets man may too often
do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Christ was crucified by the authority of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
in that respect may be said to be crucified at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny the sequele. For Christ told <hi>Pilate, thou couldest
have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above,</hi>
Joh. 19. 11. yet no man will conclude from thence, that
Christ was crucified in Heaven, because <hi>Pilate</hi> had authority
from Heaven; no more ought any man to say that Christ was
crucified at <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Pilate</hi> had authority from thence.
<hi>Herod</hi> had authority from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the young
children which were slain by him, were slain at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and
not at <hi>Rome, Mat.</hi> 2. 16. Yea, we may go a little farther, and
say that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was not guilty of their death, nor of
Christs neither, for the authority which <hi>Herod</hi> had, was only
in the general, and that is not sufficient to make the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> guilty of their blood, it must be a special warrant, order
or authority from <hi>Rome</hi> that must do that, and this <hi>Herod</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so did <hi>Pilate</hi> too. Yea, let us go a little farther, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that <hi>Pilate</hi> had a special order or authority from the City

for the <hi>Roman cause.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It was a pretended cause, and not a real, for <hi>Pilate</hi> did
acquit him, and said he found no fault in him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 4. and
the reason why he put <hi>Jesus</hi> to death, was for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and not for any other cause, <hi>Mat. 26. 27. Luk.</hi> 23. 22, 23. But
secondly, let the cause be what it will, it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for the cause is not here spoken of, but the place only,
and they which understand the (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) the <hi>(ubi)</hi> or the <hi>(where)
our Lord was crucified</hi> to be meant of the cause, and not of the
place, are as far from the meaning of the Prophecy as <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
is from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Christ has been crucified in his members at <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Is this indeed the meaning? Why, Christ has been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in his members at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as well as in his own body,
so that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> may be the City in that sense too. 2. I deny
that to be the meaning, for it is not said in every City, <hi>where
our Lord was crucified,</hi> but <hi>in the street of the great City,</hi> pointing
out but one City, and no more. 3. These words <hi>(where our
Lord was crucified)</hi> were added to declare what City 'tis where
the Witnesses shall be slain; and if we understand them of the
City where Christ was crucified himself, we can quickly tell
what City 'tis that is meant in this place; but if we understand
it of the crucifixion of his members from time to time, Christ
has been crucified in so many places, that we cannot tell by this
description, what City 'tis is meant here. 4. Who be the
members in which you say Christ was crucified? Be they the
same with the two Witnesses? Or be they other members of
his? If othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

members be, we cannot tell by this answer what the City is, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55629:76"/>
which the two Witnesses shall be slain. But if you say the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
be the same with the two Witnesses, what is this but a
meer Tautology? It amounts to no more than this, the
two Witnesses shall be slain in the City where they shall be
slain.</p>
                  <p>That which makes men run into these errors, and mistake
the meaning of the Prophecy, is because they put no difference
between the seat of the Witnesses, and the seat of the <hi>Beast,</hi> in
which respect the Protestants are as far remote from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Prophecy, as the Papists; for the Papists make the
seat of the Witnesses to be <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the same the seat of
the Beast too, but the Protestants make <hi>Babylon</hi> the seat of both.
And both of them are out in this particular, for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is the
seat of the Witnesses, but not of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> is the
seat of the <hi>Beast,</hi> but not of the Witnesses: and it is altogether
unlikely, and inconsonant to reason that the Witnesses should
Prophesie in <hi>Babylon</hi> where the Beast hath his Throne, or that
the <hi>Beast</hi> should let them Prophesie before his own door three
years and a half before the War against them. But it is very
likely and consonant to reason that the Witnesses should Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> some hundred miles distant from the City of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> for some space of time before the <hi>Beast</hi> hear thereof;
and it is also likely, that as soon as he doth hear thereof he will
send his Soldiers forth of <hi>Babylon</hi> to march unto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to
War against the Witnesses, and put an end unto their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying,
which Soldiers of his may come thither at that nick of
time, in which the three years and a half allotted for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
shall be ended. So that the Witnesses are not slain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compass of that time, or before that time be ended, as
some would have it, but immediately when that time is over.
This is my conception of this Prophecy, which I shall adhere
unto until a better shall be shewn me. And here the Reader may
perceive, that I follow neither Papist nor Protestant in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55629:77"/>
of this Prophecy, but the truth only, which if it please God
to discover by my weak endeavours, it is as much as I look after
in writing what I do.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> How long the six first Trumpets shall continue?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> did continue but a little while,
as the learned Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> hath proved in his <hi>Annals,
pag.</hi> 20, 21. and most of these Trumpets are the same with
them.</p>
                  <p>2. The fifth Trumpet is to last but five months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 10.
which wants a month of half a year.</p>
                  <p>3. The Sealed ones were Sealed before any of the Trumpets
did begin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 3. and the same persons are all of them alive, after
all the six Trumpets are ended, and a good part of the seventh
Trumpet also over, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
                  <p>4. All the time from the sixth Seal, unto the day of Judgment
mentioned <hi>Rev. 19. 11. &amp;c.</hi> is but a short time, as hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
already, <hi>ch. 6. Disp. 2. q.</hi> 5.</p>

               <head>The Prophecy of the Woman and the great Red Dragon, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conversion of the Jews, and the opposition and persecution of
the Devil.</head>
               <p>1. AND I saw a great wonder in the Starry Heaven, prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring
what should be done upon the earth, and the
wonder which I saw, was a woman representing the Nation of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> cloathed with the Sun, in token of her future Glory,
and the Moon beneath her Feet in token she should
change no more,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 9, 10.</note> and a Crown of twelve Stars upon
her head, which are the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55629:77"/>
2. And their conversion shall be like the pains of a woman
in Travel, which hath hard labour, and strong pains, and throws
before she be delivered; even so they of this Nation that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
first, shall have hard labour, and Travel to convert the
rest.</p>
               <p>3. And I saw another wonder in the Starry Heaven, and
it was a great Red Dragon representing the Devil, and his
mighty Agents upon earth, which shall oppose the Church
of <hi>Israel</hi> in her Travel, and hinder their conversion what
they can, and they be seven Heathen Kings, which shall
have Crowns upon their Heads, and ten Heathen Kingdoms
which shall have no Kings of their own in them at this
time.</p>
               <p>4. And he shall be in a great rage to hear of the conversion of
this Church and Nation, and in this rage of his shall with his
tail (in which as some say his main strength doth lye) seek to
overthrow the frame of nature, and had rather Heaven and
Earth should have an end, than the conversion of that Church
be brought to pass. Or else his tail may represent the vulgar
people that be in his Kingdoms, as his seven heads do represent
his Kings, and by the help of this vulgar people, he shall turn
aside some part of that Nation from minding their conversion
at the present, and draw their hearts away from Heavenly
things to earthly, or else do some other hurt unto them, and
he himself shall stand before the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> now ready to
be converted to the Faith of Christ, threatning to devour
them and their Children so soon as they become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>5. Yet for all this they shall be converted to the Christian
Faith, and the Child that shall be born of them is Jesus Christ,
who is then said to be born spiritually, whenas a Church or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is brought to believe in him, and after their conversion he
shall subdue all Nations that War against them with the Sword,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55629:78"/>
but he himself shall sit in Heaven at Gods right hand, and on his
Throne.</p>
               <p>6. And when they be converted, a great part of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall flee into the Wilderness, especially they that be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to convert the rest, where they shall have a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them by the Lord their God, as their
forefathers had,<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 14, 15.</note> when they came forth of <hi>Egypt</hi>
that they may be nourished, and preserved there
three years and a half, from the fury of the Devil and his
Agents.</p>
               <p>7. But before that this is done, there shall be a great battel in
the Church, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels shall fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Devil in behalf of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 10. 13. 21.</note>
that they may be converted to the Christian Faith,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 1.</note>
and the Devil shall fight against <hi>Michael,</hi> and his Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the others Angels, that they may remain in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>8. But <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels shall prevail, and the Devil and
his Angels shall be overthrown, and there shall be no place for
them any more in the Church of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. And the great Red Dragon, that old malicious Serpent,
otherwise called the Devil and Satan, who deceived our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
at the first and the whole race of mankind ever since, shall
be cast forth of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, and all his evil Angels cast
forth with him.</p>
               <p>10. And there shall be great joy in the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi>
and loud acclamation and Thanksgiving, saying, Now is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
come to the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> from the Lord our God, he is
the Author of it, and to him be it ascribed for evermore. And
the might and Kingdom of our God shall now be seen and made
known unto the World, and the power of his Christ, for the
accuser of that Church and Nation is cast forth, who before their
conversion, accused them of their unbelief before our God, day
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55629:78"/>
and night, but from henceforth shall accuse them of that crime
no more.</p>
               <p>11. But they shall overcome him by the merits of his blood,
who died for them, and by their Faith which they have in him,
and the open profession of the same, and they shall not love their
lives more than they love their Christ, but expose them unto
death, rather than remain in unbelief, and deny their Faith in
him, and for this it is that Satan shall be cast forth of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>12. Rejoyce ye Church of <hi>Israel</hi> because Satan is cast forth of
your Nation, and from ruling any more therein, but wo be to
the unbelieving Gentiles after this is done, for the Devil will be
among you altogether, and have great wrath, as knowing he
hath but a short time to stay among you.</p>
               <p>13. And when Satan shall perceive that he is cast forth of the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, he shall set himself to persecute that Church
and Nation, especially those members of them which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
first, and shall be instrumental to beget the rest to the
Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>14. But power and opportunity shall be given to those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Church, to fly into the Wilderness, to the place
prepared for them, where they shall be nourished and preserved
three years and a half from the power of the Devil and his
Angels.</p>
               <p>15. And when the Devil shall perceive that they are fled
into the Wilderness, he shall send a flood of Water after them,
to drown them in the Wilderness, or drive them out from
thence.</p>
               <p>16. But God shall cause the dry and thirsty earth to open
her mouth, and swallow up the flood of Water which the Devil
shall send after them, and the Water thereupon shall do them no
hurt.</p>
               <p>17. At which the Devil shall be very wroth, and thereupon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55629:79"/>
shall leave the Wilderness where they be, and make War with
the remnant of that Church and Nation which shall not flee
into the Wilderness as the other shall, but keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord their God, and profess the faith of Jesus
Christ in their known and open dwellings.</p>
               <p>18. And to accomplish this design of his, he shall stand upon
the sea shore, representing the heathen people and Nations of
the World, out of whom he shall raise a beastly Tyrant to make
War against that part of the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> which shall flee
into the Wilderness as hereafter followeth.</p>

               <head>Disputation VIII.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy doth belong to the seventh
Trumpet, and be a part thereof?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The seventh Trumpet doth not end with the former
Chapter, but reacheth onward to the end of the Book; and
whereas the other Trumpets have a close added to them, this
Trumpet hath no close at all, and therefore hath no end at all
before the Book be ended. You will say the four first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
have no close to them. <hi>Answ.</hi> They had other Trumpets
to succeed them, but this Trumpet is the last of all, and hath
no Trumpet to succeed it. Again the two first Woe Trumpets
had a close set unto them, <hi>Rev. 9. 12. Rev.</hi> 11. 14. But this
Trumpet is the third Woe Trumpet, and therefore should in all
likely-hood have a close set unto it as the other have, if there
were any to be set.</p>
                  <p>2. This Prophecy doth not belong to the little Book, but to
the Book sealed with seven Seals, for that Book had something
written in it, but the little Book had nothing written in it,
now there is no part of that Book to which this Prophecy can
belong but to the seventh Trumpet only.</p>
                  <p>3. The Prophecy of the seven Vials doth belong unto the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55629:79"/>
seventh Trumpet, therefore that which comes between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the seventh Trumpet, and the seven Vials doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the seventh Trumpet also. Now that the seven Vials
do belong to the seventh Trumpet may appear from hence, that
as the seventh Seal doth contain seven Trumpets, so the seventh
Trumpet by the like proportion doth contain seven Vials, and
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Remains, pag. 10. doth implicitly confess this
Argument to be good, in case there be but one Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and this I have already proved in a select question on the
tenth Chapter concerning this subject.</p>
                  <p>4. The mystery of God doth belong unto the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
as the Angel plainly saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. but the parturiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Woman is the mystery of God there spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> In the former Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 15. 17, 18. there is mention of
the Kingdom of Christ, and of the time of the dead that they should
be judged, and shall this Prophecy succeed that?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No, it shall not succeed it but begin it. The conversion
of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the inchoation of the Kingdom there spoken of
as appears v. 10. and the time of the dead in which they shall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e judged or avenged, shall follow thereupon as appears v. 12.
but more particularly ch. 14. 7. 13. 15, 16. ch. 15. 1. ch. 16.
throughout, ch. 18. 6. 20. 24. ch. 19. 2. 20, 21. all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto the seventh Trumpet, and is the execution of what
was spoken of in general in the former Chapter, in which the
seventh Trumpet is set down in gross, but in this and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
following at retail. To which may be added that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet is a Woe Trumpet, and there be no Woes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that Trumpet in the former Chapter, but only in
the general, therefore the particulars are in the Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy doth contemporate with the
Prophecy of the two witnesses, or succeed it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55629:80"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The seventh Trumpet doth succeed the sixth, but
this Prophecy belongs to the seventh Trumpet, and that of the
two witnesses to the sixth.</p>
                  <p>2. That which gave occasion or an opportunity to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Temple, and the prophecying of the witnesses, and
removed the impediment thereof, was the slaughter of the third
part of men which were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and that which
gives occasion or an opportunity to the parturition of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and removeth the impediment thereof, is the fall of the
tenth part of the City, and the judgment on the <hi>Beast; Rev.</hi>
11. 13. and as the slaughter of the third part of Men which
were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> goes before the prophecying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the
witnesses, as being the occasion of it by removing
the impediments,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 6, 7.</note> and affording an opportunity
thereunto, so the fall of the City, and the judgment on the
<hi>Beast</hi> goes before the Travail of the Woman, as being the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of it, by removing the impediments, which were or
might be a hindrance to it, and affording an opportunity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
whereby it might be brought to pass.</p>
                  <p>3. The Church in building is before the Church builded,
but during the prophecying of the witnesses, the Church is in
building, and when the Woman has brought forth her child,
the Church is then built.</p>
                  <p>4. Persecution and freedom from it cannot contemporate
each with other, but in the time of this Prophecy, the Church
is under persecution, and during the prophecying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
the Church is free therefrom until the 1260 days be
ended, and then the <hi>Beast</hi> doth war against the witnesses, but
not before, and though the outer Court be given to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
during the prophecying of the witnesses, yet the inner court
where the Church is, they dare not meddle with.</p>
                  <p>5. Good success, and bad success cannot contemporate each
with other, but in the former Prophecy the enemy hath some
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55629:80"/>
success against the Church, for three days and a half, as appears
<hi>v.</hi> 9. 11. but in the time of this Prophecy the Dragon hath no
success at all.</p>
                  <p>6. The beginning of this Prophecy doth not contemporate
with the beginning of the former, nor the end of this Prophecy
with the end of the former, therefore the middle, which is the
1260 days in each Prophecy, do not contemporate each with
other. First, I say the beginning of this Prophecy doth not
contemporate with the beginning of the former, for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Prophecy, the Church is under the opposition
and persecution of the Dragon, but in the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
while the Temple is in building, the Church is free.
Again, in the end of the former Prophecy, the Church is worst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the enemy for three days and a half, but in the end of
this Prophecy, the Dragon has the worst of it, and the Church
the better.</p>
                  <p>7. Other differences there be, which shew they do not Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronise,
as first the Church in this Prophecy flies away, in that
she stands to it and flies not. Again, in this Prophecy the Church
is in the Wilderness, in that she is without in an open place. And
thirdly, in this Prophecy the Church is invisible, and none but
the Dragon knew where she was; but in the other Prophecy the
Church is visible, and the <hi>Beast</hi> knew where she was, all which do
shew that they do not Synchronise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The days of the two Witnesses, and the days of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
being in the Wilderness, are equal in duration, for they be 1260
days a piece, therefore they Synchronise and contemporate each with
other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The month of <hi>January,</hi> and the month of <hi>March</hi> are
equal in duration, for they be one and thirty days a piece, yet
they succeed one the other, and the month of <hi>February</hi> comes
between; and no other is the case here: the 1260 days of the
Prophesying of the Witnesses, and the 1260 days of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55629:81"/>
being in the Wilderness are equal in duration, yet the
last of these succeeds the former, as the month of <hi>March</hi> doth
the month of <hi>January,</hi> and that which follows in the former
Prophecy, from the seventh verse to the end of the chapter,
comes between.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But these Visions were presented both at one time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing or intermission, therefore seeing they be equal in duration,
they contemporate each with other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Things presented all at once, at one view, or at one
time, may succeed one another, witness <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and the seven heads of the <hi>Beast, Rev.</hi> 17. 3. 9, 10.
2. These Visions were not presented both at once, at one view,
or at one time, as <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image was, <hi>eodem tempore
simultaneo,</hi> but successively and immediately one after another,
as <hi>Daniels</hi> four <hi>Beasts</hi> were <hi>eodem tempore successivo, Dan.</hi> 7.
and look in what order they were revealed, in the same shall
they come to pass, that is successively and immediately one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, as <hi>Daniels</hi> four <hi>Beasts</hi> do, <hi>Dan. 7. 3. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Womans slight into the Wilderness was presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>John</hi> before the Battail betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>v.</hi> 6. but it shall come to pass afterward, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny the Antecedent, for the sixth verse shews that
the womans flight into the Wilderness, was when her Travel
ended, and she had brought forth her Son, and the fourteenth
verse also shews that her flight into the Wilderness was when
the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon ceased, and he was
cast forth into the earth, therefore the womans Travel, and the
battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> ended both together, and
were presented unto <hi>John</hi> both together, but could not be set
down in writing both together unless it were collaterally, as
was shewed <hi>pag.</hi> 118. but successively as it is one after another,
which is the reason that the womans flight is set down <hi>v.</hi> 6. after
her Travel ended, and repeated again <hi>v.</hi> 14. after the Battel end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55629:81"/>
2. Suppose it to be true that the womans flight into the
Wilderness was presented unto <hi>John</hi> before the Battel betwixt
<hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> did begin, if this were so, then the sixth
verse is meant of the beginning of the womans flight into the
Wilderness, and the fourteenth verse of the ending of it, and if
this be so, the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> is not <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
puerperio</hi> during the time of the womans Travel, but <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
fuga</hi> during her flight into the Wilderness, and if this
latter hold good, then things are set down in writing as
they were revealed, and shall come to pass accordingly in such
order as they be written in the Book, no Book of Scripture equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lising
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Three years and a half may succeed one another, but
1260 days mentioned in these two Prophecies, be so many years,
and it is not likely that so many years should succeed one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not my opinion only, but <hi>Piscators</hi> in <hi>Apocalyp.
Cap. 12. v. 6. Peter Moulins</hi> in his accomplishment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<hi>pag.</hi> 194. 196. and the late Annotators on <hi>Daniel c. 7.
v.</hi> 25. who all of them do understand by these numbers, three
years and a half, and no more. Again, the Church is in the
Wilderness 1260 days together, but the Church never was, nor
ever will be in the Wilderness so many years together. 3. The
Church is in safety 1260 days, but the Church never yet was,
nor ever will be in safety from the enemy so long a time as 1260
years amount unto. 4. When days be put for years in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
it is usually expressed or intimated in the Text, as
<hi>Numb. 14. 34. Ezek.</hi> 4. 6. but here is no mention nor intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any such thing; had not God told <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that
a day goes for a year, neither of them would have so understood
it; but now in the <hi>Revelation</hi> God doth not tell us that a day is
put for a year, therefore we may not so understand it. 5. In
other Prophecies of Scripture where days are mentioned, we
do not understand years thereby, as <hi>Numb. 11. 19, 20. Dan. 8.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55629:82"/>
13, 14. Jona 3. 4. Mat. 12. 49. Joh.</hi> 2. 19. and that because
God doth not bid us: so then where God doth not bid us by
days understand years, we may not so understand it; but now
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> God doth not bid us by days understand years
as he doth in <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> therefore we may not so
understand it. 6. 1260 days be no more than time, times,
and half a time, and that is no more than three years and a half,
as the Annotators on <hi>Daniel,</hi> in their first Edition do confess,
and it may be proved by reason, for time is one year, times two
years, and half a time is half a year, and seven times in the Book
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is seven years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 16. Again it is said in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
that <hi>he shall wear out the Saints, and they shall be given into his
hand until a time, times, and half a time, Dan.</hi> 7. 25. but now
the Saints were never wearied out so long together, neither
were they ever given into the enemies hand so long a time as
1260 years, nor ever will be. And thirdly, there is an Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
proportion observable in these times, for times is double
in quantity to time, and time is double in quantity to half a
time. But now if by time we understand a thousand, and by
times two hundred, and by half a time sixty, we destroy the
proportion, for by this reckoning, time is more than times
which ought to be less by half, and half a time is less than half a
time, which ought to be just so much. You will say that there
is the like inconvenience in applying this number to 1260 days.
I answer no, for time, times, and half a time is not 1260 days
formally but vertually, neither is it so many days <hi>divisim,</hi> but
<hi>conjunctim,</hi> my meaning is, time is not a thousand days, times
two hundred days, and half a time sixty days, but time is a year,
times two years, and half a time is half a year, that is, three
years and a half in the total. Now because in three years and a
half, there be just 1260 days, hence it is that these times be even
in the total, but not in each several part, as hath been shewed.
And fourthly, to make these times of <hi>Daniel</hi> to amount to 1260
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55629:82"/>
years, they take a strange course, for they turn years into days,
and days into years again, first they turn three years and a half,
into 1260 days, and this they may do, for it is all one in the
total, but this will not content them, but when they have so
done, they turn these days into so many years, and say that
1260 days is 1260 years, and this they may not do, for it is not
all one in the total. Others take a stranger course, and by time,
times, and half a time, they understand three years and a half,
as we do, but then by years they mean mystical years, and
what that is they do not tell us, neither can they tell us, for if
a mystical year be a thousand years, two mystical years must be
two thousand years, and half a mystical year half a thousand
years, and then we are gone beyond the number, but if by a
mystical year be meant a hundred years, then two mystical
years must be two hundred years, and half a mystical year half
a hundred years, and then we are far short of the number. Such
inconveniences do they fall into, which turn the Scripture into
mysteries, and make a mystical sense of a <hi>Revelation.</hi> Lastly, a
thousand years and upward, is a long time, but by 1260 days
is meant a short time, yea the whole time of Satans abode upon
the earth from the time he is cast out of Heaven, is but a short
time, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 12. and yet that time is much more than the
1260 days we speak of.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in the Reign of
<hi>Nero?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Prophecy was not revealed to <hi>John</hi> till after
<hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> one of his successours as
hath been proved ch. 6. <hi>q.</hi> 1. therefore it doth not prophesie of
what was done in his Reign.</p>
                  <p>2. This Prophecy doth belong unto the seventh Trumpet,
in which the mystery of God shall come to pass as hath been
proved <hi>q.</hi> 1. but <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign did not reach unto the seventh
Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:55629:83"/>
3. This Prophecy shall succeed the Prophecy of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
as hath been also proved; <hi>q.</hi> 2. but that Prophecy of the
two witnesses is long after the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> as they with
whom I dispute in this Question do confess, for they say it came
to pass in the Reign of <hi>Adrian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. By the parturition of this Woman, is meant the national
conversion of some people or other. Now there were some
persons converted to the Faith in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> but what
is that to the national conversion of a people? The national
conversion of the <hi>Romans</hi> came not to pass till the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
which was long afterward.</p>
                  <p>5. The first general persecution of the Church was in the
days of <hi>Nero,</hi> and if this Prophecy should be meant of it, the
persecution spoken of in this place should be the first, but the
persecution in the fifth Seal was before this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>6. In <hi>Nero</hi>'s persecution many were slain for professing of
the Faith, and amongst them <hi>Peter</hi> was one, and <hi>Paul</hi> another,
but in the persecution here spoken of, not any one was slain,
the <hi>Dragons</hi> power was too weak, as appears <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6. 13,
14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, after the parturition of this Woman, the <hi>Dragon</hi>
knowes he hath but a short time, but since the days of <hi>Nero</hi>
to this day the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath had a long time, and how much
more is yet to come before the day of Judgement, who can
tell?</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy be meant of the conversion of
the <hi>Jews?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Woman here spoken of had upon her head a
Crown of twelve Stars, and who should they be but the twelve
Tribes of <hi>Israel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The national Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which some suppose to be
the Woman here meant, was not converted till the days of
<hi>Constantine,</hi> all the time before that she was in Travail, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55629:83"/>
when she was converted in his time, she did not flie into the
Wilderness as the Woman here doth, but was advanced to great
honour and prosperity in the World, and the head of that
Church was the Emperour himself.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Dragon</hi> with seven heads and ten horns, which some
suppose to be the Pagan Roman Empire, did no more persecute
the Roman Church after she was converted in the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
but as soon as that Church was converted, that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
wholly ceased as Pagan and became Christian, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
ceased with it, but here the case is otherwise, for as
soon as the <hi>Dragon</hi> is cast forth of Heaven to the Earth, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the Woman doth begin.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>We read</hi> Dan. 12. 1. And at that time shall <hi>Michael</hi> stand
up, the great Prince which standeth for the Children of thy people,
and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there
was a Nation, even to that same time, and at that time thy people
shall be delivered, <hi>&amp;c. Now who be meant by</hi> Daniels <hi>people
but the</hi> Jews, <hi>and who is meant by the Woman here spoken of
but</hi> Daniels <hi>people whom</hi> Michael <hi>standeth for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. What doth the Angel mean by the mystery of God,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. but the conversion of the <hi>Jews?</hi> And when shall
that mystery be finished, but when the seventh Angel begins
to sound? And when doth this Woman fall in Travail, but
at the same time too? And if it be said that by the mystery of
God is meant the <hi>end of the world,</hi> and the <hi>second coming of
our Lord,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Mayer</hi> doth expound it: To this I answer.
1. That the mystery of God there spoken of is the conversion
of some Church or other, and wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Church can we imagine
is left unconverted till the seventh Trumpet, but the <hi>Jews</hi> only?
2. The conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is called a mystery, <hi>Eph. 3. 3.
4. 6. Col.</hi> 1. 26. and so is the conversion of the <hi>Jews</hi> too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
25. But now the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is already, and the
Apostle speaks of it in both those places as a thing then in being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55629:84"/>
but the conversion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is yet to come, and when shall
it be finished, but at the beginning of the seventh Trumpet,
which is the time the Woman here spoken of falls in Travail?
3. The conversion of the <hi>Jews</hi> goes before the coming of our
Lord, and that which hinders or keeps back the coming of our
Lord, is the non-conversion of that Nation, and that which
expedites and hastens the coming of our Lord is the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that Nation as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith in two places, <hi>Act. 3. 19,
20, 21. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 12. and seeing in this Prophecy
of the seventh Trumpet is mention made of the
coming of Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, hastning the coming.</note> 
                     <hi>Rev. 19. 11. &amp;c.</hi> We may
well conclude the conversion of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be meant in this
place which is to go before it. 4. Where shall we find the end
of the world, or the second coming of our Lord, called a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery?
The Incarnation is so called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. but where
the end of the world, or the second coming of our Lord is so
called, it concerns them to shew which do affirm it. 5. The
mystery which the Angel meant is declared by God to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets in the Old Testament, and what do they
speak of more than the conversion of the <hi>Jews, Esa. 11. 11, 12.
Esa. 14. 1, 2, 3. Esa. 27. 12, 13. Jer. 23. 7, 8. Jer. 31. 27, 28.
Jer. 32. 37, 38. Jer. 46. 27, 28. Ezek. 37. 16, 17. Hos. 3. 4, 5.
Joel. 3. 1. Amos 9. 11. 14, 15. Zach.</hi> 8. 20, 21, 22. with many
more the like. 6. The Objection doth suppose the seventh
Trumpet is to sound but one day, and that one day is to be the
end of the world; but the Angel saith, the seventh Trumpet
is to sound more days than one, and the mystery of God is to
be at the beginning of them,

                  <head>The Prophecy of the first Beast, and his rising and success against
the Jewish Nation.</head>
                  <p>1. THEN I saw a wild Beast representing a new Empire
which shall be raised by the Devil out of the people
and Nations of the world which shall be then in arms, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same seven Kingly heads that the <hi>Dragon</hi>
had,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 4.</note> and the same ten horns, but with Crowns added
to them which they had not before.</p>
                  <p>2. And this Empire shall be as cruel against the Christian
<hi>Jews,</hi> as ever the Greek, or Persian, or Babylonian Empires
were heretofore to that Nation, and cannot sufficiently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered
by one cruel Beast alone, but by variety of cruel Beasts
made up together in one, for it shall have the body of a speckled
Leopard, as the Greek Empire had, and the feet of a cruel Bear,
as the Persian Empire had, and the mouth of a devouring Lion,
as the Babylonian Empire had, and to the making up of this
Empire, the Devil shall resign unto him his <hi>Militia,</hi> his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Throne, and secular authority.</p>
                  <p>3. But before he be established in his Throne, there shall be
some opposition made against the setling, and uniting of this
Empire, and in the opposition one of his seven heads shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a wound by a sword, to all mens thinking unto death,
but his deadly wound shall be healed, and after that there
shall be no more opposition, but all the Country far and near
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55629:85"/>
shall admire at it, and yield subjection to the Beast without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
                  <p>4. And they shall worship the Beast as the substitute of the
<hi>Dragon,</hi> and in so doing they shall worship not the Beast only,
but the <hi>Dragon</hi> also, and in worshipping of him they ascribe
unto him titles of transcendent honour, saying who is so potent
as the Beast, who is able to war with him?</p>
                  <p>5. And he shall take upon him, and it shall be permitted to
him to speak great and proud things amounting
to blasphemy,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 8. 11. 25.</note> and he shall have power to continue
three years and a half in great prosperity,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36.</note> and after
they are past, he shall decay from day to day and never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prosperity any more.</p>
                  <p>6. And he shall open his mouth wide unto blasphemy, and
shall not be afraid to blaspheme the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and his name
and his Church and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>7. And he shall be permitted by God to make War against
the remnant of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> that shall not flie into the
Wilderness with their brethren, and to overcome them in the
War and he shall have power over all kindreds, and tongues,
and nations, far and near to make them joyn with him, and
assist him in this War.</p>
                  <p>8. And all the Inhabitants of the Earth both far and near,
shall worship him and yield subjection to him, and they that
shall so do, are such whose names were never written in the
Book of life, which Jesus Christ hath purchased by his Blood
for all that believe in him.</p>
                  <p>9. Let every man take heed how he joyneth with the Beast,
and taketh part with him against the Saints whom he warreth
with.</p>
                  <p>10. He that leadeth any of Gods Saints into captivity shall

great encouragement thereunto, and they need not use unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55629:86"/>
of the other Beast; and one of these wonders whereby he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Molten, or a Carved Image in honor of the Beast which had
the mortal wound of a Sword, and did live.</p>
                  <p>15. And he shall have power to give not life,
but breath to the graven or molten Image of the
Beast,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 5, 6, 7. 10, 11, 12. 14, 15. 18.</note> in so much that the Molten or Graven

appoint, and command, that as many as will not fall down and

                  <p>16. And he shall cause all, both small and great, rich and

in their right hand, or in their foreheads, whereby it may be
known that they have so done.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in the former Chapter, or succeed it?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Prosperity cannot contemporate with adversity, nor
the Church in safety with the Church in danger; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the former Chapter, is in prosperity, or at least in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the Wilderness, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16. and the
Dragon cannot hurt her in that place: but in this Prophecy
the Church is in adversity, and the Beast is in prosperity, and
doth War with her, and overcome her 42 months together,
<hi>v.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. The Beast is not raised by the Dragon till he went to make
War with the remnant of the womans seed, and he went not
from the Wilderness to make War with the remnant of her
seed, till his attempts against the woman in the Wilderness
proved frustrate, and succesless, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17.</p>
                  <p>3. The true order of the Prophecy is this. 1. The woman
falls in Travel, and the Dragon stands before her to devour her
child as soon as it was born, <hi>v. 2, 3, 4. 2. Michael</hi> and his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55629:87"/>
Angels fight against the Dragon, and cast him forth of Heaven
to the earth, that he might not hinder the Nativity of the
Child, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. 3. The woman bringeth forth, and the
Dragon persecutes the woman, and she flies into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. 13, 14. 4. The Dragon sends a flood of Water
after her, to drown her in the Wilderness, or drive her out
from thence, and the earth opens her mouth, and swallows
up the flood of water, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. 5. the Dragon is angry with
the woman, and goes away from the Wilderness to the Sea,
with an intent to make War with the remnant of her seed,
<hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. 6. The Dragon raiseth up the Beast mentioned
in this thirteenth Chapter, to be his Captain General in this
War, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 7. The War begins, and the Saints are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
42 months, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 7. 8. After this the Beast prevails
no more, but decays every day more and more until he come
unto his end, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 16. and 19. this is the order of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and it is to be admired at, that men should set their wits
against it.</p>
                  <p>4. They which hold this Prophecy to contemporate with
the former, think that by the remnant of the womans seed
whom the Dragon Warreth with, is meant the Children which
she bringeth forth in the Wilderness; but this cannot be so, for
the woman in the Wilderness is in safety, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 14.
and the Dragon cannot War with her nor her Children in that
desolate place: and therefore by the remnant of her seed, is not
meant the Children which she bringeth forth in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but the Children which were left behind and were not
fled into the Wilderness with the woman, and these be
they whom the Dragon Warreth with, but the other are in
safety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The 1260 days of the woman, and the 42 months of the
Beast are all one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 30 days in <hi>April,</hi> and 30 days in <hi>June</hi> are all one in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55629:87"/>
quantity, yet they succeed one another: so the 1260 days in
the former Chapter, and the 42 months in this Chapter be all
one in quantity, yet they succeed one another; as <hi>June</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
<hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 1260 Days be so many years, and 42 months be so many
years too, and it is not likely that times of so long continuance should
succeed one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This objection hath been answered twice already, first <hi>ch.</hi>
11. and secondly <hi>ch.</hi> 12. and now I will answer it the third time,
and say something else unto it. 1. I might say that <hi>theologia sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolica
non est argumentativa,</hi> mystical Theology is no sufficient
Argument to build our Faith upon; and if men have nothing
else to say for themselves but mystical expositions of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
it is a sign that their cause is very bad. 2. Times of
equal length may succeed one another, as appears in the months
of the year. So put the case that these 42 months, and the 1260
days, be so many years, yet 'tis possible they may succeed one
another, though not in whole, yet in part; as <hi>Solomon</hi> and
<hi>David</hi> reigned fourty years a piece, yet some part of <hi>Solomons</hi>
Reign was with <hi>David</hi> his Father before his death, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part after his death. 3. Where shall we find in all the
Scripture that a month is put for thirty years? I find in many
places where 'tis put for thirty days, as <hi>Jam. 5. 17. Heb. 11. 23.
Luk.</hi> 1. 56. but for thirty years never. 4. The <hi>Revelation</hi> it
self doth put a difference between a day, a month, and a year,
<hi>Rev. 9. 15. which were prepared for an hour, a day, a month, and
a year,</hi> where a day is less than a month, and a month is less
than a year. 5. These 42 months is the time of the Beasts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
and of the Churches great adversity, but the Church
never was nor ever will be in adversity so long, and the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Beast that ever was, was never in prosperity so many years
together, nor ever will be. 6. By this interpretation of 42
months, one may find out the day of Judgment, and some
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55629:88"/>
men have been very bold in this point, for they make these
42 months to last unto the day of Judgment, so that by this
reckoning the Church will be in a sad and calamitous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
until the day of Judgment; and if they can but tell us one
thing more, and that is, when these 42 months begin, we
may easily calculate the day when Christ shall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which no modest man will adventure once to do, seeing
Christ saith of it, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not
the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only, Mat.</hi> 24. 30. And
yet such inconvenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es do follow from this interpretation.
7. Will you know the truth of this matter, and be no more
deceived with mystical expositions, then take it briefly thus:
These 42 months be three years and a half, and no more, and
all this time the Beast is in prosperity, and makes War against
the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> with good success; but as soon as this is
over, the Beasts adversity doth begin, and in the fourteenth
Chapter the Angels make a slaughter of him, and in the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter the Vials of Gods wrath fall upon him in his
own Dominions, and in the nineteenth Chapter Christ comes
himself in person, and destroyes him, and makes a final end of
him, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The sixth Trumpet is before the seventh, but the Beast here
spoken of, doth War against the Witnesses in the sixth Trumpet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prophecy of the Woman and the Dragon doth begin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is not raised in the seventh Trumpet, after the Prophecy of
the Woman and the Dragon have an end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This objection were something, if the Beast that Wars
against the Witnesses, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. and the Beast spoken of in this
Chapter were the same, but what if they be not the same?
what's become of the objection then? Now that these Beasts
be not the same, may be proved by these reasons. 1. That Beast
<hi>ch.</hi> 11. ascends out of the bottomless Pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. but this
in the thirteenth Chapter out of the Sea, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55629:88"/>
Pit in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is never taken for the Sea, or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water, but for a deep hole in the element of the earth,
<hi>Rev. 9. 1, 2. 11. Rev.</hi> 20. 1. 3. 2. That Beast hath seven heads
and five of them fall and never rise again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10. and this
Beast hath seven heads too, and but one of them is wounded,
and that wound is healed again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. 3. That Beast hath
ten horns, but no Crowns upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3. and this
Beast hath ten horns too, and ten Crowns upon them which
the other hath not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. 4. That Beast hath a woman
riding on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3. but this Beast arose out of the Sea,
but no woman riding on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. 5. This Beast hath
another Beast with two horns to assist him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11, 12.
but that Beast hath no other Beast that we read of to assist him.
6. That Beast is red, of a Scarlet colour all the body over, <hi>Rev.</hi>
17. 3. but the body of this Beast is speckled like a Leopard,
the feet like a Bears feet, and the mouth like a Lyons mouth,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. 7. That Beast is raised twice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. but this
Beast though wounded yet doth rise but once, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1.
8. The Throne of that Beast is <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17. 5. but the
Throne of this Beast is some other place, as may appear if we
compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10. 19. 9. This Beast hath a puissant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and that immediately after <hi>Babylon</hi> is destroyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.
19, 20. which cannot well be, if the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Beast and this
Beast be all one. 10. That Beast hath an eighth head, which
in some respects is to succeed the seventh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 11. but this
Beast hath no such eighth head which in any wise is to succeed
the seventh. Compare we these things together, and it may
very well be questioned whether the Beasts be the same or
no.</p>
                  <p>2. Suppose the Beast be the same in both places, yet unless
the head be the same too, the objection fails in that respect
also, for the Beast hath seven heads in all, and one of them
may War against the Witnesses in the sixth Trumpet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55629:89"/>
head be raised in the seventh Trumpet. Yea, let us go a
little further, and suppose the head be the same too in both
places, yet this will not prevail neither, for that head may be
deposed in the sixth Trumpet before the Prophecy of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and the Dragon doth begin, and be raised again in the
seventh Trumpet to War against the womans seed, after the
Prophecy in the former Chapter hath an end. Look into <hi>ch.
17. v.</hi> 8. and you shall find the Beast is raised twice. <hi>The Beast
which thou sawest was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Pit, and go into perdition.</hi> Here you see is a time in which
the Beast <hi>was,</hi> and this time may be the sixth Trumpet. Here is
next a time in which the Beast <hi>is not,</hi> and this time may be at
the beginning of the seventh or at the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth before
the Prophecy of the woman and the Dragon doth begin. Here
is thirdly a time when the Beast <hi>shall ascend out of the bottomless
Pit,</hi> and be again, and this may be the time spoken of in this
chapter, after the Prophecy in the former chapter hath an end.
Now of these two answers the Reader hath his liberty to choose
which he liketh best, but were I to choose my self, I would
choose the first before the second, and that for that very reason
which is urged in the objection, for the Beast hath a being and
doth War against the Witnesses in the sixth Trumpet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is not raised or begins to be in the seventh. So that it
doth not follow that the Prophecies shall not come to pass in
order as they were revealed, or that the Prophecy of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
shall not succeed the Prophecy in the former chapter: but
it rather follows that the Beasts be not the same, as was said
before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Kingdom of the Beast hath a final end with the sixth
Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. and therefore the Prophecies shall not come
to pass in order as they were revealed, nor the Prophecy of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
succeed the Prophecy of the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It may be questioned whether this Beast and that in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55629:89"/>
                     <hi>ch.</hi> 11. be the same as was said before. 2. Whether they be
the same or no, I deny the Kingdom of the beast hath a final
end with the sixth Trumpet, and that for these reasons. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we read of his Acts afterward, <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 2. Because <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
is not destroyed till then. 3. Because the City spoken of
<hi>ch.</hi> 11. is not <hi>Babylon</hi> but <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it is not the seat of the
beast, but of the two Witnesses. 4. The tenth part of the
City falls, and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. 5. Seven thousand
men are slain, and no more, and what is that to a final destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the beast? 6. It is not said that the beast was among
them. 7. Suppose he were among them, and also slain with
them, yet all this will not put an end to the Kingdom of the
beast, but to one head only, for the beast hath seven heads in
all; and put the case that one of them doth die in the time of
the sixth Trumpet, yet another may succeed him in the seventh,
there being some interval between, I mean between the death
of the one, and the rising of the other, and so that which is
spoken of the beast, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. belongs to the account of the sixth
Trumpet, and that which is spoken of him in the chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
to the account of the seventh.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in the Reign of
<hi>Domitian?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Prophecy was not revealed to <hi>John</hi> till the
Reign of <hi>Domitian</hi> was well nigh over, as both <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and
<hi>Jerom,</hi> and others do testifie, and therefore it doth not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of what was to be done in his Reign, for if it did, it would
have been revealed sooner, for <hi>Domitian</hi> did not live two years,
much less three years and a half after this Prophecy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p>2. This Prophecy doth belong unto the seventh Trumpet,
and therefore shall succeed all the Prophecies of the former
Trumpets, but <hi>Domitian</hi> did not live to see any of the former
Trumpets finished, and they with whom I deal in this question
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55629:90"/>
confess themselves that the Prophecy <hi>ch.</hi> 11. was not fulfilled
till the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who began his Reign after <hi>Domitian</hi>
twenty years.</p>
                  <p>3. By the beast is not meant the Idol Worship as they would
have it, but a Kingdom with its King, for by that word is
meant both, and sometimes that word denotes the King, as
<hi>Rev. 17. 11, 12. Dan.</hi> 7. 17. and sometimes besides the King
it denotes the Kingdom, as <hi>Rev. 17. 3. Dan.</hi> 7. 23. and so 'tis
taken in this place: and besides this the Idol-worship was set up
at <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign began, and therefore <hi>John</hi> doth
not Prophesie of the rising of it in the time of his Reign; to
which may be added that the beast was to continue 42 months,
but the Idol-worship did continue longer.</p>
                  <p>4. The head which <hi>John</hi> saw as it were wounded to death,
is not the Capitol as they suppose, but one of the Kings of the
Empire, as appears by the acception of that word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10.
And besides this the head was wounded by a Sword, <hi>v.</hi> 14. but
the Capitol was burnt by fire, and that fire was caused by
Lightning from Heaven. To which may be added, that the
head here wounded, was wounded but once, but the Capitol
was burnt in the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and rebuilt in the time of
<hi>Vespasian,</hi> and after that burnt again in the time of <hi>Titus,</hi> and
rebuilt by <hi>Domitian;</hi> and this healing of the beasts wound, was
a matter of admiration, but the rebuilding of the Capitol after
it was burnt, was no matter of admiration, but a feasible
thing.</p>
                  <p>5. It was given to this beast to make War with the Saints,
and to overcome them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. which words do imply resistance
on the Saints part, but in the persecution of <hi>Domitian</hi> there was
no resistance on the Saints part, the Christians in his days thought
it better to fly than to fight.</p>
                  <p>6. By the second beast <hi>v.</hi> 11. is meant some famous witch
or other, such a one as the Devil never had the like since he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55629:90"/>
was a Devil, but this witch cannot be <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> as
they suppose, for neither he nor any other since his time
could do such feats as this witch is said to do, <hi>v. 12, 13,
14, 15, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Domitianus Apollonio infestus fuit, &amp; Apollonius Domitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
saith <hi>Grotius de Antichristo, pag. 77. Domitian</hi> was a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enemy to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Domitian,</hi> but the
false Prophet here spoken of was the chiefest Friend the beast
had, and used all the art he could to establish him in his throne,
<hi>v. 12. 14, 15, 16, 17. Rev.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
                  <p>8. Neither the beast nor the witch here spoken of do die a
bodily death as other men do, but are both cast into Hell alive,
as appears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, 20. but <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> died both
of them a bodily death, and <hi>Domitian</hi> died first, and <hi>Apollonius
Tyanaeus</hi> afterward, the one died <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 98<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 99. according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> see <hi>Prideaux History,
pag.</hi> 198.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy of the first Beast be fulfilled in the
Papacy, and be meant of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The first beast is a secular power, but the Pope is an
ecclesiastical person.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Pope be the seventh head of the first beast, who then
is the seventh head of the Dragon? for he had so many heads
before the beast began, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>3. If the Pope be the seventh head of the first beast, who be
the other six? Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Tribunes, and Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> till <hi>Constantines</hi> time were
all of them Pagans; but if the Prophecy were fulfilled in the
Papacy, all the seven heads should be Papists, else the Prophecy
cannot be fulfilled in them. 2. If the six first heads be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
and the seventh head be Popes, the beast is more Pagan
than Papist, and the Prophecy is not fulfilled wholly in the
Pagans, nor wholly in the Papists, but partly in the one, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55629:91"/>
partly in the other, but most of all in the Pagans. 3. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be that the six first heads of the beast should be Kings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
Dictators, Decemvirs, Military Tribunes, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
for five of these were past before the Prophecy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
the Emperours then were, but the beast which <hi>John</hi>
saw rise out of the Sea, had seven heads, whereof none of them
were past, none of them were present, but all of them were
then to come, for after the Visions in the three first chapters,
<hi>John</hi> had no more Visions of things present, much less of things
past, but only of things that were to come, as the Angel told
him, <hi>Rev. 4. 1. Come up hither, and I will shew thee things
which must be hereafter,</hi> therefore not heads which were then
past, nor heads which were then present, but heads which
were then to come, and if five of these heads were then past,
one were then present, it had been sufficient to have presented
unto <hi>John</hi> the head that was then to come, and no more. And if
it be said that the Angel speaking of these heads, <hi>ch.</hi> 17. saith, <hi>five
of them are fallen, one is, and the seventh is not yet come,</hi> to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that the rising of that beast is not presented unto <hi>John</hi> in
that Vision, but the destruction of the Whore which sits upon
him; and when 'tis said that <hi>five of them are fallen,</hi> this is not to be
understood Historically of what was past before the Apostles
days, nor of what was present in his days, but prophetically
of what should be past before, and what should be present at
the execution of that Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>4. The beast hath not only seven heads, but also ten horns,
and ten crowns upon them, and that at one time, and not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
one after another; but where shall we find so many
horns in the Papacy, and ten crowns upon them at one time,
and not successively one after another.</p>
                  <p>5. The beast <hi>was like a Leopard, and his feet as the feet of a
Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon,</hi> Rev. 13. 2. Now a
Leopard was the emblem of the Greek Monarchy, a Bear the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55629:91"/>
emblem of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, and a Lyon the emblem of
the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6. and therefore this
beast is made up of all the three, partly of the <hi>Greek,</hi> partly of
the <hi>Persian,</hi> and partly of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empires, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
doth consist of none of these, for they were secular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
in the East, but the Papacy is a spiritual Monarchy in the
West.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>One of the Beasts heads was as it were wounded to death, and
his deadly wound was healed,</hi> Rev. 13. 3. but when was any head
so wounded in the Papacy, and afterward healed, and who
should that Popish head be? It cannot be said that this was done
when the Dragon was dethroned, and cast forth of Heaven,
for the beast was not then in being, and not one head only but
all the Dragons heads were cast out of Heaven with him. It
cannot be said that this was done when <hi>Constantine</hi> became
Christian, for that was before the Papacy did begin, and there
was not any Popish head wounded then, nor any Popish head
healed at that time. And thirdly the meaning is not that one
head was wounded, and another head was healed, but the
meaning is, that one head was wounded, and the same head
was healed. Now the Emperors were one head, and the Popes
another head, and it cannot be said that the Emperors were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the Popes came up in their room, no more than it can
be said that the Kings were healed when the Consuls did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them, or that the Consuls were healed when they were
put down, and the Dictators did succeed them; and suppose
the Popes should be put down, and the Emperors come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it cannot be said that the Popes wound was healed by
that means.</p>
                  <p>7. The beast was to continue 42 months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5. that
is three years and a half, as hath been proved in the former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.
Now these 42 months are not the time of the beasts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
but the time of his prosperity, and no more: but the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55629:92"/>
Pope hath lived in prosperity more than 42 months, and many
more he is like to live, and therefore he is not the beast that here
is spoken of.</p>
                  <p>8. They that understand this Prophecy of the Papacy, do
confess that the Pope is not the first beast but the second, and
they understand by the first beast the secular power of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and by the second the Ecclesiastical, and yet in reckoning up
the seven heads of the first beast they make the Pope one, and
who the seven heads should be and leave the Pope out they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy of the second Beast be fulfilled in
the Papacy, and be meant of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The second beast is a secular power, as the first beast
is, and a beast in Scripture is never taken for any other power
than a secular, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 17. 23. but the Pope is an
Ecclesiastical power, not a secular.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Pope be the second beast, who then is the seventh
head of the first beast, for they be two distinct persons, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>Rev. 13. 11, 12. Rev. 16. 13. Rev. 19. 20. Rev.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
                  <p>3. The second beast <hi>doth exercise all the power of the first beast
before him,</hi> or in his behalf, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Now that power is a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
power, for that beast is a secular beast, as all confess. Now
what beast is there in the World whose secular power the Pope
doth exercise in his behalf? This the Pope never did, it is too
mean for his supremacy who thinks himself above all Kings
and Princes in the World, to exercise the power of another in
his behalf, neither will he ever do it, except he cease to be a
Pope, and become a Lay-man.</p>
                  <p>4. The second beast <hi>doth great wonders, so that be maketh fire
come down from heaven upon earth in the sight of men,</hi> v. 13. and
when did the Pope do this, and what should this fire be? It
cannot be the holy Ghost, as some would have it, for he is not at
the beasts command as this fire is, and 'tis a wicked thing for any
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55629:92"/>
man to think that this wicked Beast can bring the Holy Ghost
down from Heaven when he will. It cannot be meant of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
as others would have it, for that is no wonder
as this fire is, but a common thing, and a spiritual duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on the Bishops and Pastors of the Church which are not
Papists. It remains then that this fire is true material fire as
that which fell on <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel was, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 16. and this may be
done by art Magick, and is one of the great wonders of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Beast that he can make fire come down from Heaven upon
earth in the sight of men to bring them in subjection to the first
Beast, which was never yet effected nor attempted by the Pope
and his Clergy to bring men in subjection to a secular power, for
which end it is effected here, but is yet to be expected.</p>
                  <p>5. The second Beast <hi>saith to the Inhabitants of the earth, that
they should make an Image to the Beast which had the wound of a
Sword and did live. And he had power to give breath unto the Image
of the Beast, that the Image of the Beast should both speak, and cause
that as many as would not worship the Image of the Beast should be
killed,</hi> v. 14, 15. And when did the Pope do this? What Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
is there in the World whose Image the Pope caused to be
made unto him? When did he give breath to such an Image?
And when did he make such an Image speak, and command that
as many as would not worship it should be killed? and what
should this Image be but a Molten or a Carved Image, as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>
Image was? Look we all the Scripture over, and
we shall never find an Image made by man (as this Image of the
Beast is) taken for any other Image than a Molten or a carved I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image was, <hi>Dan. 3. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> and because
the Pope never did this, the Prophecy is not fulfilled in him.</p>
                  <p>6. The second Beast <hi>causeth all both small and great, rich and poor,
free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark or
the name of the Beast, or the number of his name,</hi> v. 16, 17. And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55629:93"/>
vvhen was this fulfilled in the Papacy? To this 'tis said that this
mark is nothing else but the promise of obedience; to which I
answer. 1. That the Beasts mark is something else besides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of obedience to the Beast, for the promise of obedience is
a common thing between King and Subject all the World over,
but the mark of the Beast is peculiar to the Beast alone. 2. The
promise of obedience is made unto the Beast, but the mark of
the Beast is received from the Beast, not imposed on the Beast,
<hi>v.</hi> 16. 3. Suppose a man hath promised obedience to the Beast
how shall it be known that he hath so done? And when he
comes into a Market or a Fair to buy or sell, how shall it be
known that he hath promised obedience to the Beast, except
he have his mark to distinguish him from others? For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the mark is given, is that such persons may be known
from others, and no man is to buy or sell that is without it, and
this is a course which the Pope never took as yet, nor is ever
like to do, and if he should do such a thing hereafter, yet he were
not the Beast, for the Beast did it at his first rising out of the earth
which the Pope did not.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast,
for it is the number of a man, and his number is</hi> 666, v. 18: But what
is this to the Papacy? Count the number while you will, and see
whether you can find the Papacy therein? Some think to find
the number in the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55629:93"/>
And if a man were to write 666 in Greek letters, he would not
set it down in the letters of the word <gap reason="foreign">

this to the purpose? for what Pope or Popish Emperor was
ever called by this name? 2. When was any man marked
with this name, as they are with the Beasts name? 3. Men do
not mark their Cattel with all the letters of their names, but
with the first letters only, and the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which
is here used doth signifie such a mark as men put upon their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
now the first letter in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is the Greek let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     </gap>, and no more.
4. We are not bid to count the Beasts name to find out his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but to count his number to find out his name thereby. Now
they that count the letters in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, take a contarry
course, they suppose the Beasts name to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and when
they have so done, they count his name to find out his number,
and not his number to find out his name as they ought to do, and
how know they that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the Beasts name? A Papist may
as well say that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is his proper name, for that is as much 666
as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 5. It is a point of understanding, or of
excellent skill in numeration to count the number of the Beast,
but to count the number of the letters in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is no
such excellent skill in numeration, a young Scholar in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
may do that, and yet have no excellent knowledge in that
Art. 6. To count the number 666 is to extract the root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for it can be done no other way, as was shewed in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase;
but to count the number in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is to do
it by addition, and it can be done no other way, no nor that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55629:94"/>
way neither, for it can be done no way at all. 7. Will you know
the mark of the Beast, and the name of the Beast, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>you must go another way to work than
hitherto hath been gone, and the way that you must go, is this,
666 is not <hi>numerus numeratus,</hi> the number of the Beast counted
to our hand, but <hi>numerus numerandus</hi> the number to be counted
by us. Now the way to count this number is, not by addition or
subtraction, for here is no other number which this number can
be added to, or subtracted from, neither is it to be done by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
or division, for here is no other number which it can
be multiplied or divided by; therefore to count that number, is
to extract the root thereof. Now what is the root of 666 but 25
or 26, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Greek letters?
And when you see a Beast with seven Heads, and ten Horns,
and another Beast with one head and two Hornes, like a Lamb,
to exercise all his civil power and authority in his behalf, and
cause his Subjects to be marked in their right hand, or in their
foreheads with the Capital or Acrostick Letters of his name, and
the letters of that mark be in numeration, 25 or 26, then he is
the Beast that here is prophesied of, and because this hath not
been done in the Papacy, this Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecy is not fulfilled in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but is yet to be expected. Hitherto I have shewed you who
the Beast is not, I will now discover unto you who the Beast is.</p>
                  <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy be meant of the persecution of the
<hi>Jews</hi> after their Conversion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Prophecy is to come to pass in the time of the
seventh Trumpet, as hath been proved, <hi>q.</hi> 1. and the mystery of
God, by which is meant the Conversion of the <hi>Jews</hi> shall come
to pass at that time too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. What is meant by the woman in the former Chapter but
the Nation of the <hi>Jews?</hi> and wherefore is this Beast raised by the
Devil, but to make War against the remnant of her seed, <hi>Rev.</hi>
12. 17?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:55629:94"/>
3. We read in <hi>Daniel</hi> that the little Horn who is thought to
be the Beast here spoken of, <hi>made war with the Saints and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against them, Dan.</hi> 7. 21, 22. 25. Now who are meant
by the Saints in <hi>Daniel</hi> but the <hi>Jews?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. VVe read in the same Book that <hi>Daniels</hi> people shall <hi>be
in great trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation, Dan.</hi> 12. 1.
Now from whom shall they have this trouble if not from the
Beast here spoken of?</p>
                  <p>5. VVe read in the Prophet <hi>Micah, According to the days
of thy coming out of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>will I shew unto him mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
things, the Nations shall see and be confounded,</hi> &amp;c. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah
7. 15, 16. Now the plagues which shall fall upon the
Beast are many of them the very same for kind with the
plagues of <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore as the plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> fell upon
them for the wrong they did unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> so the plagues
which shall light upon the Beast, shall fall upon him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for the persecution of that Nation.</p>
                  <p>6. After the partu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ition of the woman in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>v.</hi> 12. the Devil knows he hath but a short time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Beast who is raised by him afterward has but a short
time too. Now if we look upon the Beasts which are in the
world at this time whether <hi>Turks</hi> or any other, they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a long time, and therefore this prophecy is not meant
of any of them, but remains to be expected upon the <hi>Jews</hi>
Conversion.</p>
                  <p>7. The Beasts which now are in the world came to their
height and eminency by long and tedious wars and by the
ruines of other Nations, but this Beast is raised on a sudden by
the Devils art and policy, as you may read <hi>v.</hi> 2. 4. and there
are such strange courses taken, such witchcraft and inchantment
used, such signs and wonders shewed, such cunning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
tricks invented, and such a strange mark imposed by
the second Beast to make men adhere unto the first Beast, as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55629:95"/>
you may read <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. as never yet was known
take them all together at the rising of any Beast since the world
began to this very day, nor will be till the <hi>Jews</hi> Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the rising of this enemy of theirs, the Beast here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion therefore is, The Antichrist of St. <hi>John,</hi>
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Man of sin, and the Beast here spoken of be not all
one. The Antichrist of St. <hi>John</hi> be the false Christs that our
Saviour speaks of in the Gospel <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. which should
start up before and after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem, 1 Joh.</hi> 2.
18. 22. and 4. 3. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. The Man of sin spoken of by
St. <hi>Paul</hi> is avouched by some and denied by others to be the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which see those that have written on that
subject. But the first Beast here spoken of is a Heathen King
or Emperour raised by the Devil to war against the <hi>Jews</hi> after
their Conversion, and the second Beast is a Witch as <hi>Balaam</hi>
was, raised by the Devil and imployed by the first Beast as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>

                  <p>1. THen was presented unto me in a Vision what shall come
to pass after the three days and a half allotted to the
Beasts prosperity shall be ended, and I saw a Lamb represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jesus Christ stand on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and with him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55629:95"/>
forty and four thousand of the Jewish Nation (spoken of
before but to another purpose in the seventh Chapter,) who
notwithstanding the power and prevalency of the Beast shall
boldly profess the Name of Christ and have it and his Fathers
Name besides legibly written in their Foreheads.</p>
                  <p>2. And I heard a voice out of Heaven as the sound of many
Waters and as the found of a great and mighty Thunder, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the voice of Harpers making pleasant Melody with their
Harps.</p>
                  <p>3. And they sung a new Song before the Throne of God, and
before the four living Creatures, and before the four and twenty
Elders, which Song shall be sung by none that be upon the
earth but by the one hundred forty and four thousand which
shall be redeemed from the rest that be upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>4. These be they which shall not be defiled with Women for
they shall be Virgins and unmarried Persons; these be they
which shall wait and attend upon the Lamb as a Lifeguard doth
upon their Prince whithersoever he shall go, these shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from the rest of men as being the first Fruits to God and
to the Lamb of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>5. These be they which shall be without guile, fraud,

God.</p>

                  <head>The Prolcamation of the first Angel.</head>
                  <p>6. And I saw an Angel flie in the midst between the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and the Earth, with a commission to preach, proclaim,
and make known and publish the everlasting Gospel of Jesus
Christ to the inhabitants of <hi>Judaea</hi> and to every Nation and
Kindred and Tongue and People that shall be therein.</p>
                  <p>7. Saying and proclaiming with a loud voice as he shall flie

saying, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, is fallen, meaning thereby that she shall
shortly fall and come to nought, because she made all Nations
drink of the bitter Wine of her spiritual Fornication.</p>

saying with a loud voice, If any worship the first Beast or his
carved Image, or take an Oath to be true and faithful unto him,
and receive a mark in their right hand or in their Foreheads in
token that they have so done.</p>
                  <p>10. The same shall drink of the bitter VVine of the wrath
of God without mixing any thing therein to allay the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, and shall be tormented with Fire and Brimstone in
the sight and presence of the Holy Angels, and in the sight and
presence of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p>11. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever, and
never have an end, and they shall be tormented Day and Night
without ceasing or intermission, which worship the first Beast
or his carved Image, or take an engagement to be true and
faithful unto him and receive the print of his Name in token
that they have so done.</p>
                  <p>12. Here will be the tryal of the patience of the Saints which
are living in <hi>Judaea</hi> when the Beasts engagement comes among
them, then it will be known who they be which keep the
Commandments of the Lord their God and the Faith of Jesus
Christ, and will not engage unto the Beast though they perish

the spirit of truth, and cannot lye, and herein their blessedness
doth consist, they shall rest from their labours, miseries, calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

in the former Chapter, or succeed it?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Prosperity cannot contemporate with adversity,
but in the former Chapter, the beast is in prosperity, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and in
this Chapter the Beast is in adversity, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
therefore,</p>
                  <p>2. Good success in War, and bad success therein cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate
each with other, but in the former Prophecy the Beast
hath good success in War for 42 months together, and in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
the Beast hath bad success therein, and a lamentable slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is made of him two times one after another, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>3. Rising, growing, and increasing, cannot contemporate
with dying, falling, and decaying; but in the former Chapter
the Beast is rising, growing, and increasing, till he come unto
his height, and in this Chapter and those which follow, the Beast
is dying, falling, and decaying, till he come unto his end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Virgin company are so called because they were not defiled
with Harlots, v. 4. therefore they fall into the meretricious-times of

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether they be called Virgins for that reason, or
because they were unmarried persons as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> thinks, I list
not to inquire at this time; it is sufficient to say, that this Chapter
speaks not of the first times of the Virgin Company, nor of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Be they of the Virgin Company or no which Proclaim
the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it makes no matter? be it so or otherwise, it
is not done by them at <hi>Babylons</hi> first and prospering times, but in
her latter and declining days only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> These be the called, and chosen, and faithful Soldiers of the
Land, and (if I may so say) his life guard, by whom he wageth War with
the horns of the Beast, and at length gets the Victory against them, <hi>v. 4.
and</hi> ch. 17. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This Victory is not gotten in the first and prosperous
times of the beast, for then he gets the Victory of the Saints,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. but in his latter and declining times only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Virgin Company be the bands of Faithful Soldiers, which
opposed the Beast, and adhered unto the Lamb when others of the World
forsook him, and received the Character of the Beast; therefore either
these opposed the Beast at his first beginning, or else the Lamb had none
on his side to oppose him at that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The beast was raised to make War against the remnant
of the womans seed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. so that they be the men which
opposed him at the first, and were overcome by him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7.
but the Virgin Company are they which oppose him in his latter
and declining days, and get the Victory against him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The beast and the Virgin Company do contemporate in their
ends, for they both end together, and that is, when the History of the
Palm-bearers doth begin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. 14.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether the History of the Palm-bearers doth begin or
no, when the History of the beast and the Virgin Company doth
end, I think it needless to inquire at this time, for the present
I confess that the beast and Virgin Company do end their race
together, but I deny that they begin their race together, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they doe or no, this Chapter speaks not of it, for it speaks
only of the first declining of the beast, and not of his first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
nor of his final end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Virgin Company are sealed, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. before any of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
do begin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>herefore are they sealed at that time, but that
they might set themselves against the beast at his first beginning?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> They are not sealed for that end that they might set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the beast at his first beginning, for there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to oppose him then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17. but that they might be
preserved from the storms of the ensuing Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4. and
they are not called forth against the beast till his declining age
doth come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> By this reckoning the Virgin Company are before the beast, and
before any of the Trumpets too, for they are sealed under the sixth seal
<hi>ch.</hi> 7. before the Trumpets do begin, and six of the Trumpets are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
before the beast in the former Chapter doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In respect of their sealing they are before the Trumpets,
and so before the Beast too, but in respect of their actings spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in this Chapter, they succeed the 42 months of the former
Chapter.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy be a prediction in gross of what
should come to pass from <hi>Domitians</hi> time to <hi>Constantines?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Prophecy in the former Chapter is not a predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what should come to pass in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> as hath
been shewed, <hi>ch. 13. q.</hi> 2. therefore this Prophecy is not a
prediction of what should come to pass from <hi>Domitians</hi> time to
<hi>Constantines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Prophecy in the former Chapter is a prediction of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55629:98"/>
persecution of the <hi>Jews</hi> after their Conversion by the Beast and
false Prophet there spoken of, as hath been also shewed, <hi>ch. 13.
q.</hi> 5. therefore as the persecution of the <hi>Jews</hi> is yet to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so is the fulfilling of this Prophecy to be expected also.</p>
                  <p>3. Here is a prediction of a hundred fourty and four thousand
Sealed persons, standing altogether on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with the
Lamb having his and his Fathers name written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
but there were no such men so qualified as these were in

                     </gap>ry point in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> nor betwixt his time and
<hi>Domitians;</hi> read what is said of these men, <hi>ch. 7. q.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and
in this Chapter, <hi>q.</hi> 3. and tell me where shall we find such men
so qualified as these were in every point, and so many of them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in one body as these were, since the days of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
to this day.</p>
                  <p>4. This Prophecy is to be fulfilled in the time of the Beast, as
appears, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 10, 11. Now this Beast as they interpret the heads
thereof, doth not reach beyond <hi>Domitian;</hi> for the Beast hath
but seven heads, and no more, and the first of these, as they say,
is <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the last is <hi>Domitian,</hi> and therefore it doth not
extend so far as to the days of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Here is no persecution Prophesied of in this Chapter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 13. Now this persecution is to be in the time
of the Beast for refusing his Mark, and not Worshipping his
Image, and therefore not between his time and <hi>Constantines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Here is an immense effusion of the Enemies blood Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
of, <hi>v. 20. And the Wine-press was troden without the City,
and blood came out of the VVine-press, even unto the Horse bridles,
by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</hi> But there was
no such slaughter in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Maxentius;</hi>
yea take we all the Souldiers of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and add we <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
unto them, and suppose we every man of them to be slain
on both sides, it will not amount nor come near to so vasta
slaughter as here is spoken of. To which may be added, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55629:99"/>
the destruction of <hi>Maxentius</hi> and his Army was in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the
Wine-press here spoken of, is without the City, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Jerusalem in Iudaea,</hi> and the blood that came out of the Wine-press,
was up to the Horse-bridles in height, for the space of a

                  <p>3 <hi>Quest.</hi> VVho be meant by the Virgin Company, and for what
cause be they spoken of in this place?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The two Witnesses of which before <hi>ch.</hi> 11. be not
any of the Virgin Company here spoken of, for both of them
were slain at one time by the beast there spoken of, but none of
these were slain by him; yea they were therefore Sealed that
they might be preserved, <hi>Rev. 7. 3. Rev.</hi> 9. 4. Again the
Prophesie of the Witnesses is ended before the seventh Trumpet
doth begin, but these are all alive, and sing a song on Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> after the seventh Trumpet is begun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. The Woman in the Wilderness is not the Virgin Company
mentioned in this place, for the woman was not converted till

the Servants of God, before any of the Trumpets did begin,

                        </gap>ews</hi> converted
to the Faith, but these are but the first fruits of that Nation,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. 3. The woman is a Church of men, women, and
Children, but these are all of them young men which never knew
a woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. 4. The woman fled into the Wilderness
for safety, but these were never in the Wilderness, but stand
on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lamb, without fear, what the beast can
do unto them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. 5. The woman has to deal with the

they are spoken of again in this place is, to shew what became

it is said that they were Sealed, and this was done before any of

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Notwithstanding this text of Scripture, I cannot think

1 <hi>Sam. 21. 4, 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 5. and it is opposed to carnal Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

neither did he err in that he was a married man, as his words

they were less discernable, and little notice taken of them in the
former Trumpets, and there is nothing spoken of them in those
Trumpets, save that they were Sealed and preserved from harm:
but this is the first time that they were bodied into an Army,
which the Beast hearing of, he presently makes against them,
where he is well rewarded for his pains; and the first time his

the World, as great and marvellous as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and methought I saw seven Angels, with seven other plagues,
which were to fall upon the World, but chiefly upon the Beast
and his obsequious Servants; and they be the last Plagues that
shall fall upon them, because in them the wrath of God is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
to the full.</p>
               <p>2. And methought I saw a Sea of Glass, or something like
unto it, mingled with fire, and the 144000 that obtain Victory
over the first Beast, and over his Image, and over his mark, or
which is all one, over the number of his name, stand at the Glassie
Sea as the <hi>Israelites</hi> heretofore, when they had gotten Victory
over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoast, stood at the red Sea with the harps
of God in their hands, to praise the Lord therewith.</p>
               <p>3. And they shall sing a song of praise for their Victory over
the Beast, after the Pattern of the song, which <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
did sing upon their Victory over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoast,
and they shall add to that song, the song of Jesus Christ, in which
they shall praise God to this effect. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy

with pure and white linnen, and girt about the paps with Golden
Girdles.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy of the seven Vials shall succeed
the Prophecy of the Harvest, and the Vintage, in the fourteenth
Chapter?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The last Plagues succeed the first, but the seven
Vials are the seven last Plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1. and therefore the
Harvest and the Vintage of the fourteenth Chapter, are the
first.</p>
                  <p>2. The Virgin Company obtain Victory over the Beast, before
any of the Vials do begin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15 2. and therefore the seven Vials
do not begin the ruin of the Beast, but it was begun before, and
the seven Vials are added to it to bring up the rere, and put a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
end unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The sixth Trumpet puts an end unto the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. and
therefore the seven Vials which put an end unto him too, do contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny the Antecedent, for the seventh Trumpet puts
an end unto the Beast, and not the sixth, <hi>Rev. 11. 18. Rev.</hi> 19. 19,
20, 21. Secondly that destruction <hi>ch. 11. v.</hi> 13. is but of 7000
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55629:104"/>
men, and no more, and therefore 'tis but a partial destruction of
the Beast, and not a total.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But whether it be total, or partial, it is before the Harvest,
and the Vintage of the fourteenth Chapter, and therefore the Harvest,
and the Vintage are not the first Plagues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This is very true, if the Beast be the same, and the heads
the same in both places, but it may be questioned, whether the
Beast <hi>ch</hi> 11. be the same with the Beast, <hi>ch. 14. v.</hi> 9. and if they
be, yet the destruction <hi>ch.</hi> 11. may befal the Beast in the time of
one head, and the Harvest, and the Vintage, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. in the time
of another head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The wound which the Beast received, <hi>ch.</hi> 13. v. 3. is before
the Harvest, and the Vintage, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. and therefore they be not the
first Plagues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That wound doth not belong to the ruine of the Beast,
but was a stop and a hinderance to his setling for a time, but no
part of his destruction after he is risen. 2. That wound is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 42 months of his prosperity, but after they are ended,
the first beginnings of his ruine are the Harvest, and the Vintage,
<hi>ch.</hi> 14. and the seven Vials which follow after, are the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Harvest is the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The general Harvest at the day of Judgment is the end
of the World, and that is the Harvest Christ means, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39.
but the Harvest <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15. is a particular Harvest of the Beasts
men, and no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The Harvest, and the Vintage are both one, and therefore
they succeed not one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The general Harvest, and the general Vintage are both one,
and the reapers are the Angels in general, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39. but the Harvest
<hi>ch.</hi> 14. is a particular Harvest, and the Vintage, a particular Vintage,
and one Angel has a hand in reaping of the harvest, and another
in gathering of the Vintage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. 17.</p>

2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Prophecy of the seven Vials be literally, or
mystically to be understood?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. A <hi>Revelation</hi> cannot be a mystery, for
a <hi>Revelation</hi> is a manifestation of things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were hidden and secret,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 28.</note> but a mystery is,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 26.</note> when
things are hidden,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 17.</note> and secret still,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 25, 26.</note> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the seven Vials,<note place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 1. 26.</note> is a special part of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Where there is a mystery in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is usually
interpreted, as the first Chapter, and the seventeenth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
but here is no interpretation of any mystery in the
Vials.</p>
                  <p>3. No Scripture is mystically to be understood, <hi>sine evidente
necessitate,</hi> without evident necessity, but here is no necessity,
much less an evident one, so to understand it.</p>
                  <p>4. Where a literal sense may stand, that which is furthest from
the letter is the worst, but here a literal sense may stand. For 1. It
is not repugnant to any Text of Scripture. 2. It is not contrary
to any Article of the Christian Faith. 3. There is no iniquity
therein. 4. There is no absurdity at all doth follow therefrom,
therefore it is literally to be understood.</p>
                  <p>5. The Plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> are literally to be understood, but
the seven Vials are for the most part the same for kind with the
Plagues of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The first Vial answers to the
Boyl breaking forth with blaines upon man and Beast,<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 9.</note>
throughout all the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and what man will say that
that Boyl is mystically to be understood? The second and third
Vials answer to another Plague of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where all the Water
in the River was turned to blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 20, 21. and what
living soul will say that that is mystically to be understood? The
fifth Vial answers to the darkness, which fell upon the Land of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55629:105"/>
                     <hi>Aegypt</hi> for three days together, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 21, 22, 23. and
what understanding is so dark, as to understand that darkness
mystically? The last Vial answers to the hail which fell upon the
Land of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 9. 22, 23, 24. and who will say that
that hail is mystically to be understood? only the fourth and
sixth Vials differ in kind from the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the
rest that are mentioned in this Chapter, are the same with
theirs.</p>
                  <p>6. From the mystical interpretation of the Vials, many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
will follow. As 1. It makes the Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecy but a
common Prophecy, and to speak of things ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ary and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed;
when as the literal sense makes it a Prophecy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and to speak of things not usual nor accustomed, such
as never were but in the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and they that were in
<hi>Aegypt</hi> though the same for kind were not so grievous as these
Vials are like to be. 2. It makes the Scripture a nose of Wax,
which a man may turn which way he will, one may turn it one
way, and another may turn it another way, and there be well
nigh as many interpretations of the mystical sense, as there be
writers on the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 3. It subjects the Scripture to our
vain lusts, and humours, and gives every one liberty to interpret
it as his humour leads him. 4. It makes the Scripture mean not
what it speaks, but what men would have it mean. 5. It makes
men interpret the <hi>Revelation</hi> of themselves or of their own party,
and of the times wherein they live, and the good things they
think are spoken of themselves, and the evil things of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
6. It turns the Scripture into nonsense, what sense is it
to say, that by the <hi>earth</hi> in the first Vial, is meant the lowest of
the People, as if an Ulcer could not fall upon the highest, as
well as upon the lowest? What sense is it to say, every living
soul died in the <hi>Sea,</hi> that is, in the extent and compass of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
power and Jurisdiction, when as there be five Vials to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some men afterward? What sense is it to say, that the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55629:106"/>
in the fifth Vial is meant of spiritual darkness, as if they were
not spiritually dark before that or any other of the Vials did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?
What sense is it to understand by the Kings of the <hi>East</hi> in
the sixth Vial the Kings of the West, and by the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
which is a River in the East to understand the Popes revenues in
the West, and by the drying up of that River, to understand the
draining away the Popes revenues in the West? these and many
more absurdities do follow from the mystical interpretation of
the Vials.</p>

7. 20, 21. and was not this more prejudical to the
<hi>Aegyptians,</hi> then to the <hi>Israelites?</hi> So thirdly did not
<hi>Moses</hi> stretch forth his hand toward Heaven, and
there was a thick darkness in all the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
three days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 22, 23. and was not this
more prejudicial to Gods enemies then his Friends?
And Lastly, did not <hi>Moses</hi> stretch forth his hand
toward Heaven, and the Lord rained hail upon the
Land of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 9. 23. and was not this
more prejudicial to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> then the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites?</hi>
And if God could do all this, and much more in <hi>Aegypt</hi> in
a literal sense, why can he not do the like in other Countries
without prejudice to his own People? 2. Whereas 'tis said (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55629:106"/>

a miracle, as he did in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and we further say, that God
hath promised to do the like again in other Countries, <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Micah. 7. 15, 16. 3. Whereas 'tis said that they partake of
the benefit of these in common with the other, it is nothing so at
this time, for the Saints do not live in the Beasts Dominions at

like as the matter of a History was the matter of a Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55629:107"/>
it was fulfilled, the difference many times is not in respect
of matter, but in respect of time. A Prophecy is the relating of
a thing to come, and a History is the relating of a thing past, but
the thing related may be materially the same in both, 2. The
Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> is both a History, and a Prophecy; for the words
in <hi>Exodus</hi> 7. 20, 21. are a History of turning the waters into
blood, but the words, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. are a Prophecy of it before
hand. So again the words in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 9, 10, 11. are a History
of the Boyl which fell upon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but the words <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.
are a Prophecy of the Boyl before it came to pass. So thirdly
the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds in <hi>Exodus</hi> 10. 22. are a History of the darkness that
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the words <hi>v.</hi> 21. are a Prophecy thereof,
and therefore the comparison in all the three places with the
Vials of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is very fit and suitable each to other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> How can a Vial be poured on the Sun, and not on the Saints
which live under it? or how can the Sun torment men with fervent
heat, and the Saints not be tormented by it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The fire which flew the men which-cast the three
Children into the midst of the burning fiery Furnace, did no hurt
to the three Children which were cast therein, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 22 25.
2. The Lightning from heaven may slay one man, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yea, two men may Travel in the Field together; and one
of them be slain by Lightning, and the other not; one House
may be set on fire by Lightning, and not another; and one Tree
may be blasted at such a time, and not another. 3. One man
and his Family may be visited with a Feaver in a hot Summer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and his next neghbours House or his Family may escape.
4. The Psalmist saith, <hi>the Sun sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l not smite thee by day, nor the
Moon by night,</hi> Ps. 121. 6. this strikes the objection quite dead,
one man may be smitten by the Sun, and not another, though
they live both of them near together. 5. The Sun is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
in one Country then another, so that the Beast and his
men may be scorched by the Sun, and the Saints which are fled
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55629:107"/>
out of his Dominions, may escape. 6. The Beast would not
suffer any of the Saints to live in his Dominions in peace, he slew
as many of them as he could come by, and after they were dead,
and the rest fled away, these Vials fell upon them. 7. They

of men is meant, by the <hi>Sea</hi> another, by the <hi>Rivers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Waters</hi> a third, and by the <hi>Sun</hi> a fourth, yet all of these
be wicked men: now if the Vials can distinguish between one
wicked man, and another, so that one wicked man is punished
under one Vial, and not another, why can they not as well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between a wicked man, and a good, though under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in a literal sense? 8. The Angels are the pourers forth of
these Vials, and they can so order and dispose of them, that they
shall fall only on the wicked, and not upon the good. 9. And
lastly the persons plagued in these Vials be not expressed in the
first words, but in the last; for instance, <hi>the first Angel poured
out his Vial on the earth,</hi> the persons plagued be not denoted in
these words, but in the next, <hi>and there fell a noisome and grievous
sore upon the men which had the mark of the Beast.</hi> So in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Vial, <hi>the second Angel poured out his Vial on the Sea, and it
became as the blood of a dead man,</hi> the persons plagued, be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in these words, but in those which follow, <hi>and every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
soul died in the Sea,</hi> and so onward of the other Vials except
the fifth, the last words express the persons plagued, and the first
express the Creature or the Instrument which it pleased God to
use in bringing of the Plague upon them.</p>

2. The King of the South is so called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 6. because he
lives and Reigns in the South, and the King of the North is so
called in the same place, because he lives and Reigns in the North,
and therefore the Kings of the East are so called, because they
live and Reign beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the East: now the <hi>Jews</hi> do
not Reign there, neither do they live there at this time, for
<hi>Judaea</hi> where they now are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. I mean at the execution
of this Prophecy) is not beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the East, but on this
side of <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the West, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>3. The Kings of the East, as the words import, be many
Kings of many Nations, but the <hi>Jews</hi> are but one Nation, and
no more.</p>
                  <p>4. The Kings of the East are in prosperity, but the <hi>Jews</hi> are
in adversity at this time, and shall not be setled in prosperity until
the Battel of the great day of God Almighty shall be over.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>We read</hi> Ezekiel 38. 8, 9. After many days thou shalt be
visited, in the latter years thou shalt come into the Land that is brought
back from the Sword, and is gathered out of many People against the
Mountains of <hi>Israel</hi> which have been always wast, but it is brought
forth out of the Nations, and they shall dwell fafely all of them, thou
shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a Cloud to cover
the Land, thou and all thy bands, and many People with thee. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings of the East be not the</hi> Jews, <hi>but rather they be
some of those Kings, that shall joyn with</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog <hi>against
the</hi> Iews <hi>after their Conversion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>We read</hi> Joel 3. 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. I will also gather all Nations,
and will bring them down into the Valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> and will
plead with them there for my People, and for my Heritage <hi>Israel,</hi> whom
they have scattered among the Nations, and parted my Land. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
ye this among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> prepare War, make up the mighty
men, let all the men of War draw near, let them come up. Beat your
Plow-shares into Swords, and your Pruning hooks into Spears, let the
weak say I am strong. Assemble your selves, and come all ye Heathen,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55629:108"/>
and gather your selves together round about: thither cause thy mighty

to the Valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> for there will I sit to Judge all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
round about. <hi>And this doth also shew that the Kings of
the East be not the</hi> Jews, <hi>but they be the</hi> Gentiles <hi>that shall set
themselves against the</hi> Jews <hi>after their Conversion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. We read <hi>Rev. 19. 19. And I saw the Beast, and the Kings of
the earth, and their Armies gathered to make war against him that
sat on the Horse, and against his Army.</hi> Now against whom
were these Kings gathered but against the <hi>Jews?</hi> Therefore the
Kings of the East be not the <hi>Jews,</hi> but they be the Kings of the
Earth that shall joyn with the Beast and false Prophet, against the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the last expedition they shall make against them.</p>
                  <p>8. I urge the Text where the Kings of the East are expresly
spoken of, <hi>Rev. 16. 12. And the sixth Angel poured out his Vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and the water thereof was dryed up,
that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.</hi> Now who
be these Kings of the East? Read the next verses and they will
tell you. <hi>And I saw three unclean Spirits like Frogs, come out of the
mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the
mouth of the false Prophet. For they are the Spirits of Devils, working
miracles, which go forth unto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole
World, to gather them to the Battel of that great day of God Almighty.
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue</hi>
Armageddon. Therefore the Kings of the East be not the <hi>Jews,</hi> but
they rather be the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, or
some of them whom the Frogs are sent unto, to gather them to the
Battel of the great day of God Almighty. And it is likely that the
case may stand thus. The Armies of the Beast and false Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overthrown in two onsets, which they made against the Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Jews</hi> in the latter end of the fourteenth Chapter; they know
not how to raise another Army to make a third onset but by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other Kings to help them, therefore as soon as they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55629:109"/>
that the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> are dried up, they send in all
hast to the Kings of the East which are beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> to assist
them, who finding a commodious passage throug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the
waters of the River being dried up, they consent unto it, and
joyn with the Beast and false Prophet, against the <hi>Jews</hi> in this last
expedition.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>But against this exposition of the Kings of the East one objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be made, and it is this, the Prophet</hi> Esai <hi>saith, that they
which pass over</hi> Euphrates, <hi>be the</hi> Jews, Esa. 11. 15, 16. And the
Lord shall utterly destroy the Tongue of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sea, and
with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e River, and
shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry
shod. And there shall be a high way for the remnant of his
People which shall be left from <hi>Assyria,</hi> like as it was to <hi>Israel</hi> in
the day that he came up out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt. Now is not
this Prophecy the same with St.</hi> Johns? <hi>Is not this River which</hi> Esai
<hi>speaketh of, the River</hi> Euphrates? <hi>Be not the men which shall pass over
dry shod, the remnant of his People that shall be left from</hi> Assyria? <hi>And
who be they but the</hi> Jews?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This Argument were something worth if this Prophecy
of <hi>Esai</hi> were the same with St. <hi>Johns?</hi> Or if the River which <hi>Esai</hi>
speaketh of were <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but we have cause to think that that
River is not <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> as may appear part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the seven streams which <hi>Nilus</hi> is known to have, and
partly from joining it with <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where 'tis known that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is, so that the meaning of the Prophecy is, that the River
<hi>Nilus</hi> shall be dried up in the seven streams thereof which run
through the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Tongue of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Sea, that is, of the Red Sea near unto the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> shall be
dried up too, as it was in the days of <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 14. 29. to this
end and purpose that the <hi>Jews</hi> which are in those Countries may
pass into <hi>Judaea</hi> without impediment, so that this Prophecy is
not the same with St. <hi>Johns,</hi> but is very likely to come to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55629:109"/>
pass before St. <hi>Johns</hi> doth, and before any of the Vials shall
begin.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Throne of the Beast be all one?
If they be, whether the Beast be in possession of it at the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Throne of the Beast came in remembrance
before God, at the execution of the fifth Vial, but <hi>Babylon</hi> came
not in remembrance before God, till the execution of the seventh
Vial.</p>
                  <p>2. The words in the seventh Vial. <hi>And great</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
<hi>came in remembrance before God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is likely that the Throne of the Beast mentioned in the fifth Vial, is a City beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the East: <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is a City on this side of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in the West.</note> 
                     <hi>to give unto
her the cup of the VVine of the fierceness of his wrath.</hi>
v. 19. imply that no Plague fell on <hi>Babylon</hi> till the
seventh Vial, and the words <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7, 8. imply
the same, but a Plague falls on the Throne of the
Beast in the time of the fifth Vial, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and
therefore <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Throne of the Beast be
not the same.</p>
                  <p>3. The great City mentioned in the seventh Vial, and <hi>Babylon</hi>
there mentioned likewise, are two distinct places, and it is
very likely that the great City is the Throne of the Beast men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the fifth Vial, and <hi>Babylon</hi> is some other place.</p>
                  <p>4. The Beast that is mentioned in the fifth Vial, and the
Beast that is mentioned, <hi>c.</hi> 17. are not the same Beast as
hath been shewed by probable Arguments, <hi>c. 13. q. 1. pag. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
and therefore it is likely that their Thrones are not the
same.</p>
                  <p>5. But suppose the Beasts be the same, and their Thrones the
same, yet a Question may be made, whether <hi>Babylon</hi> be in the
Beasts Possession at the time of the destruction of it, and that for
these reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55629:110"/>
1. The Friends of a King are not enemies to the Kings Throne
and Possessions, but the ten Kings who are the Beasts Friends, are
enemies to the City of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. The Friends of a King, do not War against the Kings
Throne and destroy it, but the ten Kings, who are the Beasts
Friends shall make War against the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and destroy
it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
                  <p>For answer whereunto I think the case may be determined
thus: The Beast may be considered in three distinct points of
time, <hi>was, is not, and shall ascend, Rev.</hi> 17. 8. Now in the first
point of time, when the Beast <hi>was,</hi> it is likely, or rather out of
Question, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is in the Possession of the Beast menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
<hi>c.</hi> 17. in the second point of the time when the Beast <hi>is
not, Babylon</hi> is not in the Possession of the Beast while he is not,
in the third Article or point of time when the Beast shall ascend
out of the bottomless Pit; the Beast shall seek to have his
Throne again, but the City shall oppose it, and by that means
shall be destroyed, of which more largly in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> How long the Vials shall continue?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Vials be the last Plagues of all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1.
therefore they be long in comming, and quick in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>2. All the time of the Dragons abode on earth after his cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of Heaven, is but a short time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
are but part of that short time.</p>
                  <p>3. The Plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were of short continuance, and
were all executed in a month, as Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> hath shewed in his
<hi>Annals pag.</hi> 20, 21. and Doctor <hi>VVillet,</hi> on <hi>Exodus c. 7. q. 29. p.</hi> 72.
Now the Vials for the most part are the same in kind with the
Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therefore are of short continuance, as
the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:55629:110"/>
4. Miracles are but for a short time, but in every one of these
Vials, God doth work a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>5 The men which were Plagued with a noisome sore in the first
Vial, are alive, and complain of the pain of that sore in the time
of the fifth Vial.</p>
                  <p>6. The last Seal is the longest Seal of all, for it contains under
it all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the beginning of
the eighth Chapter, to the end of the Book: so the seventh
Trumpet is the longest Trumpet, and comprehends under it all
the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the fifteenth verse of the
eleventh Chapter to the end of the Book; and so thirdly, the last
Vial is the longest Vial, and all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
from the seventeenth verse of the sixteenth Chapter, to the end
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> belong unto it; and when I say the Vials are of
short continuance, it is to be understood of the six first Vials,
and of so much only of the seventh, as reacheth from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
verse of this sixteenth Chapter, to the beginning of the
twentieth.</p>

Vision, and talked with me, saying, come hither, and I will

2. With whom the Kings of the earth shall commit Idolatry,
and the Inhabiters of the same shall be made drunk with her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
and also with her corporal Fornication.</p>
               <p>3. So he took me aside, and carried me in a Vision of my mind
into the Wilderness, where I saw a woman representing not what
was then in being, but what shall be hereafter, sitting upon a
Scarlet coloured Beast, full of names of Blasphemy many ways
committed against God and Jesus Christ, and the Beast had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
heads, and ten Horns, representing what should be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>4. And the woman which I saw, was arrayed in costly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of Purple and Scarlet colour, and decked with Gold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Stones, and Pearls, and she had a cup of Gold in her hand,
(representing still what should be hereafter) full of abominable
sins and wickedness, and also most grievous and loathsome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>5. And in her forehead she had a name written, declaring what
manner of City she should be, not perspicuously, but in a mystery;
<hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Whoredoms, and vile abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the earth.</p>
               <p>6. And besides all this, I saw the Woman exceeding drunk
with the blood of the Saints of God, and of the Martyrs of
Jesus Christ; and when I saw she was such a one, I wondred
greatly, with exceeding admiration, what this Woman should
mean.</p>
               <p>7. And as I was thus wondring in my mind, the Angel said
unto me, wherefore didst thou wonder and continue in so doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I will tell thee what is meant by this wicked woman, and what
is meant by the Beast that beareth her, which hath seven heads
and ten Horns.</p>
               <p>8. The Beast which thou sawest, is a King which shall have a
Crown, and loose it, and obtain his Crown again, and then go
into Perdition, and never have a being any more; he shall have a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55629:111"/>
Crown before the seventh Vial shall commence, he shall loose it
a little after the commencement of it, and obtain the same again,
and go into Perdition too, before this seventh Vial shall be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all the Inhabitants of the earth, which were not elected to
Salvation, shall wonder at it, when they see the Beast which
shall have a Crown, and loose it to obtain his Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>9. And this is the sense and meaning of the Vision, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
heads, be seven Mountains, upon which the City shall be
built.</p>
               <p>10. And they do also signifie seven Kings, five of them shall
fall and be dead, and gone before the seventh Vial shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence;
the sixth shall be alive at the commencement of that
Vial, and the seventh is then to be expected, and when he
cometh to the Crown, he shall enjoy it but a little while.</p>
               <p>11. And the Beast which shall have a Crown and loose it,
he shall be the eighth King, and succeed the seventh, and yet be
of the number of the seven too, and go into Perdition, and be no
more forever.</p>
               <p>12. And the ten Horns which thou sawest the Beast to have,
do also signifie ten Kings, which as yet have not received a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor shall have any one before the Beast hath lost his, and
recovered it again, and then they shall receive power to Reign as
Kings in one Kingdom one hour with the Beast, and this shall be
when the seventh Vial shall commence, and in the time of it, and
not before.</p>
               <p>13. And though they be ten, yet they shall have but one mind,
and adhere unto the Beast with one consent, and give their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
power and strength to the assistance of the Beast, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
City be destroyed.</p>
               <p>14. And yet we may not think that they be Christian Kings,
for after this is done, they shall fight against the Lamb, and the
Lamb shall overcome them in the War, and though they be Kings
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55629:112"/>
themselves, yet he is a greater King then they, even the King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords, and they that be with him, and on his
side be chosen, and better Souldiers then any the ten Kings have,
and also Faithful to him too.</p>
               <p>15. And the Angel also told me, what is meant by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon which the woman sitteth, and he said unto me, that they
do signifie multitudes of People, and Nations of divers Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>16. And the ten Horns which thou sawest the Beast to have, be
they which shall hate the Whore, not for her Religion, but for
her Rebellion against the Beast, and make her desolate and naked
without Inhabitants, and slay her People with the Sword, and
burn her Houses with fire.</p>
               <p>17. And that which shall make them do it is, because God shall
put it into their hearts to fulfill his mind and will, and agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give their Kingdom to the Beast, until the City be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no longer.</p>
               <p>18. And the woman which thou sawest, doth signifie the great
imperial City, which at the commencement of this seventh Vial,
shall have Dominion over the Kings and Nations of the earth, and

                     <p>And these be the Arguments for the Affirmative, which to my
thinking, are very fair ones, and somewhat probable, insomuch
that the <hi>Jesuites</hi> themselves have confessed, that by <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi>

                     <p>1. This Prophecy was written in behalf of <hi>Asia,</hi> and should
in all likelihood belong to them, but what hath <hi>Rome</hi> to do with
<hi>Asia?</hi> it neither stands in <hi>Asia,</hi> nor on the borders of it, nor
hath any thing to do therewith, and if it be said that <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had so many, whose names are reckoned in the
former Section, but besides these, there were three more added
to the City afterward, whereof the first was called <hi>collis hortulorum</hi>
the Hill of Gardens, the second <hi>mons aureus</hi> the Golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the third <hi>Paticanus</hi> the <hi>Vatican</hi> Mountain, so that <hi>Rome</hi> first
and last had ten in all, and as for Papal <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, it hath
but two, and no more.</p>
                     <p>3. Is there no City in the world which hath seven Hills, but
<hi>Rome,</hi> if there be as indeed there is, for <hi>Constantinople</hi> stands on
seven Hills at this day, and so ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

know, therefore let not men be too peremptory in this point, but
consider what they say.</p>
                     <p>4. The seven heads be seven Kings, but where shall we find
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55629:113"/>
so many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more? For if we take Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and understand thereby so many Monarchs as the ten
Kings, <hi>v.</hi> 12. are taken properly for so many Monarchs, where
shall we find so many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more? Heathen
<hi>Rome</hi> had Kings and Emperours before Popes began, but they
were more then seven, and Papal <hi>Rome</hi> hath not one.</p>
                     <p>5. Suppose by seven Kings be meant seven kinds of Governours,
as 'tis commonly interpreted, where shall we find so many kinds
in <hi>Rome?</hi> For Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had not so many, and Papal <hi>Rome</hi>
hath but one, and it is not likely that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> and Papal
too, should be meant in this place.</p>
                     <p>6. But let us joyn them both together, and take <hi>Rome</hi> in its la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
as it compriseth Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and Papal too, yet where
shall we find so many kinds of Governours in <hi>Rome? Kings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
Dictators, Decemvirs, Military Tribunes, Emperours,</hi> and
<hi>Popes</hi> make not up the number. For the Dictators

                        </gap>rours but in name, and if these
three be but one kind of Governours, where then be the other
six?</p>
                     <p>7. There is a great difference between the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast, and
the <hi>Roman</hi> State; now 'tis true, the <hi>Roman</hi> State had many heads,
but the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had but one, and
that is the Emperours, and no more.</p>
                     <p>8. None of the seven heads which the Prophecy speaketh of
did live and rule together, but the Dictators lived
and ruled with some of the Consuls while they stood,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Helvicus,</hi> pag. 60. 68.</note>
and also with some of the Tribunes while they
stood, and therefore the Dictators and the Consuls be none of the
heads which the Prophecy speaketh of.</p>
                     <p>9. Every one of these heads which the Prophecy speaketh of, be
long lasting heads, and of long continuance, except the seventh,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55629:114"/>
but the Dictators were but for half a year, and they were never
chosen, but when the common-weal was in some great trouble
or danger, and at half a years end under pain of Treason, they
yielded up their office.</p>
                     <p>10. Every one of these heads, be the heads of a Beast, that is,
of an Empire, for thats the meaning of the word Beast, as appears
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 17. 23. but the Consuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and
Military Tribunes were not the heads of an Empire, but of a
Common-weal, for <hi>Rome</hi> was not an Empire till the Emperours
began, and the first of them was <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. Every one of these heads were supreme heads, and not
subject to the power and authority of others, but the Consuls,
Dictators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were subject to the Senate, and under their
Command; and therefore they be not the heads here spoken
of.</p>
                     <p>12. None of these heads did rise again after they were fallen,
except the eighth; but the Consuls whom they reckon for the
second head did rise again after they were fallen: For first, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirs
did succeed them for two years or thereabout, and when
they were ended, the Consuls rose again: next the Military Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
came up in their places, and that more then once or twice,
and as often as they fell, the Consuls rose again. See <hi>Helvicus, pag.
66. 68. Sleidan de quaetuor Summis Imperiis, lib. 1. pag.</hi> 45. 47.
48.</p>
                     <p>13. It is said, <hi>v. 10. Five are fallen,</hi> that is, say they the first
five, and that in the Apostles time, before he was in <hi>Patmos,</hi> but
this is not so, for the Consuls were not fallen in his time, for
when <hi>Domitian</hi> was Emperour there were Consuls still, as <hi>Helvicus</hi>
sets them down by name, <hi>pag.</hi> 86, 87.</p>
                     <p>14. What if the Words <hi>five are fallen</hi> be not meant of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles

he is to be understood Prophetically, and not Historically, thus
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55629:114"/>
when 'tis said, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, Rev.</hi> 14. 8. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, not that it was fallen in the Apostles days, for that is false;
but the meaning is, that it shall fall hereafter in the time of the
seventh Vial, and therefore <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 21. the same thing is spoken of
in the future tense, <hi>with violence shall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be
thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</hi> In like manner
when 'tis said <hi>five are fallen,</hi> the meaning is, not that <hi>five are fallen</hi>
in the Apostles days, but the meaning is, that <hi>five are fallen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the seventh Vial shall begin, and so whatever is spoken in
that verse, hath reference to the seventh Vial, and not to the
days in which the Apostle lived.</p>
                     <p>15. The seventh head is to <hi>continue but a short space, v.</hi> 10.
now the Pope whom they reckon for the seventh head hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a long time, and how much longer he shall continue, who
can tell? And if it be said that this time is called short in the sight
of God, or in respect of eternal happiness; to this I answer, that
it cannot be the meaning of it, for the other six heads did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
but a short space in the sight of God, or in respect of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

happiness, but of none of the seven heads is it said that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a short space but only of the seventh, and therefore the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that the seventh head shall continue a short space in respect
of the other heads, but now the Popes have continued a long
time, much longer then any of the other heads, and therefore
they be not the seventh head.</p>
                     <p>16. The Beast here spoken of, is not the seventh head, but the
eighth; now the Pope is usually counted for the seventh head,
and therefore he is not the Beast that here is spoken of, and
if he be not the Beast, where shall we find the Beast at <hi>Rome?</hi>
Some to salve the matter, say that the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kingdom is the
seventh head, and the Pope is the eighth, but this doth marr
the matter quite; for if the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kingdom be the seventh
head, the Pope must have a <hi>quietus est,</hi> for then he is none of the
seven heads that here be spoken of, and if he be none of the seven,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55629:115"/>
then he is not the eighth, for the eighth is one of the seven, as
appears <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>17. One of the seven heads fell and rose again, and so became
the eighth head, <hi>v.</hi> 11. but of none of the former mentioned
heads can it be said that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ey fell and rose again, and so became
the eighth head, and therefore they be not the heads here spoken
of. The Popes did not fall and rise again, and so become the
eighth head, neither did the Emperours fall and rise again, and
so become the eighth head, and as for the Consuls it is true, they
fell and rose again, but they be not the eighth head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where shall we find the eighth head at <hi>Rome?</hi> And if the
eighth head be not there, <hi>Rome</hi> is not the City that is meant in
this place.</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>The ten Horns be ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as
yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast,</hi> v. 12. but
where shall we find ten Kings belonging to the Pope, and rising
when he did? Divers men have stretched their wits to find them
out, but with very ill success; for what one saith another doth
reject, and what another saith, a third doth contradict, so that
none can tell who they be, and if this cannot be done, why may
not men suspend their Judgments, and take more time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
before they give their verdict against the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> so
peremptorily as they do. And if it be said that they of the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part can no more tell who these ten Kings be, then they of
the Affirmative, to this I answer, that the case is not alike, for
they which are for the Affirmative do hold the Prophecy, <hi>v.</hi> 12.
to be past already, and that the ten Kings have received a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with the Beast already, and therefore it concerns them to
tell who these ten Kings be, but they which be of the Negative
part, do hold the Prophecy <hi>v.</hi> 12. to be Future, and that the
ten Kings have not yet begun to Reign, and therefore it cannot
be expected that they should tell who these ten Kings be, before the
Prophecy come to pass.</p>

time, but of the time of the seventh Vial, so that we are not to

                     <p>21. <hi>Babylon</hi> is not to tast of the cup of Gods wrath till the seventh
Vial doth begin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 19. but <hi>Rome</hi> hath tasted of that cup
many a time, but especially in the time of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> by
whom it was taken four times, and brought to such a desolation
by them, that not a man woman or child could be seen therein
for fourty days together, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> on the thirteenth Chapter
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth confess, <hi>pag.</hi> 35.</p>
                     <p>22. <hi>Babylon</hi> is one of the greatest Cities in the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17,

and that for three reasons. First because
<hi>Constantinople</hi> stands on seven Hills at
this day, as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<hi>lect. de Antichristo pag.</hi> 178.
2. Because <hi>Rome</hi> though heretofore it
had but seven Hills for a long time, yet
in process of time there were three more added to them, which
made the number ten. 3. Because the City of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is,
stands on two Hills, and no more, and 'tis this new City which
men count for <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not the old.</p>
                     <p>To the second, one may deny both the Maior, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
First one may deny the Maior, for as the seven Mountains,
be not seven kinds of Mountains, but seven individual Mountains,
and no more; so the seven Kings be not seven kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
but seven individuals of one kind of Governours, and no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55629:116"/>
more. 2. One may deny the Minor, for the Dictators, Kings,
and Emperours made but one kind of Governours, differing in
name, but not in form of Government, and therefore all that
be reckoned in that Argument, be but five, and where t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>en be
the other two.</p>
                     <p>To the third, one may deny the Maior, for the Apostle doth
not mean that five were fallen in his time, for the Consuls were
not fallen then, but the meaning is, that five are fallen before the
seventh Vial shall begin, so that what is spoken in that verse hath
reference to the execution of the seventh Vial, and not unto the
Apostles time.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth, one may deny the Maior, for the Apostle doth
not write a History but a Prophecy, and therefore he speaks not
of the City which reigned over the Kings of the earth in his time,
but he speaks of the City which is to Reign over the Kings of
the earth at the time of the seventh Vial, and look what City that
is which reigneth over the Kings of the earth at the execution of
that Vial, that's the City which is meant by <hi>Babylon</hi> in this
place.<note n="*" place="margin">The present tense in Prophecies hath the signification of the future, as appears Rev. 11. 7. the Beast that <hi>ascendeth,</hi> that is, which <hi>shall ascend.</hi> so v. 8. of this Chapter. the Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, that is, <hi>shall be not,</hi> and afterwards shall be again, so v. 11. he is the eighth, that is, <hi>shall be</hi> the eighth, and is of the seven, that is, <hi>shall be</hi> of the seven, and <hi>goeth,</hi> that is, <hi>shall go</hi> into Perdition. so v. 12.

for the Negative, as well as for the Affirmative, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so many men, and they as well Papists as Protestants, have
and do hold that <hi>Babylon</hi> is the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are of this mind
to this day: I will not positively determine of the point, but leave
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55629:117"/>
it to thy Sager Judgment to consider of it, and weigh the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on both sides impartially, and the Lord give thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to take the right.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether <hi>Babylon</hi> be Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> past, and the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
here Prophesied of, be meant of it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> In the former Question, I disputed whether <hi>Babylon</hi> were
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> or no, and though I would not adventure to say
it is not <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I will be bold to say, it is not Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> past,
and that for these reasons.</p>
                     <p>1. No destruction did befall the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> till after the death
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> now in the days of <hi>Constantine, Rome</hi> ceased to be
Heathen, and became Christian.</p>
                     <p>2. The City here to be destroyed hath seven heads, that is, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Kings or Emperours, and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3 9. but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Rome</hi> had more then seven Pagan Emperours, whereof <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi> was the first, and <hi>Maxentius</hi> was the last.</p>
                     <p>3. When should the destruction here spoken of come to pass,
but in the time of the last head? Now there was no destruction of
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and yet he is reckoned
by some, for the last head here spoken of.</p>
                     <p>4. If this be a Prophecy of the destruction of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi>
when should it come to pass but in the time of the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours?
Now the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of <hi>Rome</hi> was so far from destruction in the
time of the Heathen Emperours that it was neither taken nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
during their time, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a Queen, and saw no sorrow.</p>
                     <p>5. Such a destruction is here Prophesied of, as makes the City
desolate, and never to be Inhabited any more, <hi>Rev. 17. 16. Rev.</hi>
18. 2. 8. 21, 22, 23. but in the time of the Heathen Emperours the
City was Inhabited by Pagans, and since that time it hath been
Inhabited by Christians, and remains a stately City to this day.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, no destruction of any City is like the destruction of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55629:117"/>
this City, and the wrath of God is not so heavy upon any City,
as on this, <hi>Rev. 18. 18. Rev.</hi> 16. 19. therefore the destruction
here spoken of, is not a partial destruction of the third part of
the City only, nor a temporal destruction for a time only, but a
total destruction and a final, which is not yet come to pass.</p>
                     <p>Ob. <hi>The ancient Fathers by</hi> Babylon <hi>understand Heathen</hi> Rome,
Aug. de civ. Dei. lib. 18. c. 2. Tertul. adversus Mar. l. 3. c. 13. Jerom
ad Algas. q. 11. <hi>and</hi> Ep. 47. ad Marcellam.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> They that lived in the time of Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> before the
Emperous were Christians, might perhaps so understand it, but
they that lived since and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aw the Emperours become Christians,
their own eyes might teach them to understand it otherwise.
2. But what of all this? The <hi>Jesuites</hi> by <hi>Babylon</hi> understand Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Rome,</hi> yet withal, they hold that the destruction here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, is yet to be expected.</p>
                     <p>Ob. <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>by</hi> Babylon <hi>means Heathen</hi> Rome, 1 Pet. 5. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not likely that St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of the same <hi>Babylon</hi>
that St. <hi>John</hi> doth, seeing he writ his Epistle before the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was revealed to <hi>John,</hi> and therefore there want not some
which say that St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks literally, and St. <hi>John</hi> mystically.
Certain it is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of that <hi>Babylon</hi> which the
Church was acquainted with when he wrote his Epistle, but
neither he nor <hi>John,</hi> nor any other knew what mystical <hi>Babylon</hi>
meant at that time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. 7. but there were two other <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi>
in the World which the Church was acquainted with, the
one in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> the other in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from either of which
St. <hi>Peter</hi> might write his Epistle, and not from <hi>Rome,</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and we have cause to think that he writ it from <hi>Babylon</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> because St. <hi>Mark</hi> who was then Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is joined with him in the Salutation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
5. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> The seven heads, be seven Kings of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55629:118"/>
are to be counted in this manner, <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,
Vitellius,</hi> be the five that were fallen, <hi>Vespasian</hi> in whose time these
Visions were committed unto writing, is the sixth, and <hi>Titus</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
that was to stay but a little while, reigning but two years, and
two months, and the <hi>Beast</hi> which <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and is the eighth,
is <hi>Domitian,</hi> who exercised the office of the Emperour, and was called
Emperour at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Vespasian</hi> was gone into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and after
his return, became a private man again, delivered up the Empire to
him, and so was and is not, and is the eighth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This were something to the purpose, if these were all
the Emperours that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had, but we find that <hi>Julius
Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula</hi> were Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi>
before <hi>Claudius,</hi> and therefore <hi>Claudius</hi> was not the first; and if
it be said that they had not to do with Christians, and upon that
account are left out: to this I answer, that <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi>
had not to do with Christians neither, and should be left
out upon the same account too, which we see they are not.
2. <hi>Nerva, Traian, Adrian,</hi> and others down to <hi>Constantine,</hi>
were Emperours of Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Domitian,</hi> and therefore
he was not the last, and if it be said that St. <hi>John</hi> recknons only
those that had to do with Christians, to this I answer, that <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Adrian,</hi> and others of the persecuting Emperours had to do
with Christians, as well as <hi>Domitian</hi> or any other that went before
him, and therefore he was not the last on that account neither.
3. These Visions were not committed unto Writing in the time
of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as hath been proved before, <hi>Disp. 1. q.</hi> 1. and
therefore he is not the sixth, or the <hi>One that is. 4. Galba</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but seven months, <hi>Otho</hi> but three months, <hi>Vitellius</hi> but eight
months, and therefore <hi>Titus</hi> who reigned two years and two
months, cannot be the seventh King, who was to stay but a little
while, in respect of the other Kings, seeing he reigned longer
then three of the former, though we put them altogether.
5. <hi>Titus</hi> the elder Son, was saluted Emperour after his Victory in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55629:118"/>
                        <hi>Judaea,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth in his life, yet this made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im not
Emperour at that time; and so, though <hi>Domitian</hi> were called
Emperour at <hi>Rome</hi> upon <hi>Vitellius</hi> death, yet this made him not
Emperour at that time, and if it did, <hi>Vespasian</hi> was not the next
Emperour to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> as the objection makes him, and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
say he was. 6. If <hi>Domitian</hi> did exercise the Office of the
Emperour upon <hi>Vitellius</hi> death, yet this doth not argue that he
was the Emperour at that time, it argues rather that the place
was void and undetermined; and it argues too that <hi>Domitian</hi> was
an arrogant and ambitious man, and did usurp the Office, and
took upon him more then became him, or was allowed him to
do, to which may be added, that the objection makes <hi>Vespasian</hi>
the next Emperour to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and not <hi>Domitian.</hi> Now <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
did not usurp the Office of the Emperour after his Father
was setled in the Empire, but before, as may be gathered out of
<hi>Tacitus, lib. 3. c.</hi> 15. &amp; <hi>lib. 4. c.</hi> 1. and <hi>c.</hi> 16. but be it before or afterward,
the objection makes <hi>Vespasian</hi> the sixth head, and not <hi>Domitian;</hi>
and if he were not the sixth head, he is not the eighth; for
the sixth head and the eighth head are both one. 7. When
'tis said <hi>v. 8. The Beast was, and is not, and shall ascend out of
the bottomless Pit,</hi> this doth imply some extraordinary way or
means whereby he came unto the Empire after he had lost it,
but <hi>Domitian</hi> came unto it but once, and that was in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way upon his Brother <hi>Titus</hi> death, and as his Brother <hi>Titus</hi>
did. 8. For the Beast to fall and rise again, to be and not to
be, and after that to be again, was a matter of admiration and
astonishment, and indeed a miracle, <hi>v,</hi> 8. but for a man to be
saluted Emperour, and exercise the Office of the Emperour in
the <hi>inter regnum</hi> or time of vacancy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to miss of the place
for that bout, and be made Emperour twelve years afterward or
thereabout, is no ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ter of admiration, but may come to pass by
ordinary means, and no other is the case here: <hi>Vitellius</hi> being
dead, and a successour not chosen in his room, <hi>Domitian</hi> is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55629:119"/>
Emperour at <hi>Rome,</hi> and executes many things belonging
to the Emperours Office, as <hi>Mutianus</hi> and <hi>Antonius Primus</hi>
also did until <hi>Vespasian</hi> was come home, and chosen Emperour
indeed, some nine years after this <hi>Vespasian</hi> dies, and <hi>Titus</hi> is
made Emperour in his room, and reigneth two years and two
months; then <hi>Titus</hi> dieth too, and <hi>Domitian</hi> is made Emperour
indeed, what admiration is there in all this? 9. Upon the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
which they make <hi>Domitian</hi> shall be the ninth head,
and not the eighth, as appears thus: <hi>Claudius</hi> the first, <hi>Nero</hi> the
second, <hi>Galba</hi> the third, <hi>Otho</hi> the fourth, <hi>Vitellius</hi> the fifth, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
the first time he was Emperour, the sixth, <hi>Vespasian</hi> the
seventh, <hi>Titus</hi> the eighth, <hi>Domitian</hi> the last time he was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
the ninth. 10. When should the destruction here spoken
of come to pass, but in the time of the last head? now there
was no such destruction as here is spoken of in the time of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
and therefore what they talk of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> is a meer
<hi>Chimaera</hi> and no more.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the
time of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They that be of this mind do hold that <hi>Babylon</hi> is a

was not a Heathen City, for she ceased to be Heathen in the

                     <p>4. The destruction here spoken of shall come to pass on a
sudden, like a Milstone that is cast into the Sea, and sinks to the
bottom on a sudden, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 10. 17. 20. but the destruction by
the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> came not to pass on a sudden; for <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

did besiege the City a long time before he took it, see <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>
p. 287.</p>
                     <p>5. The destruction here spoken of is a total destruction,
and not a partial, and by <hi>Babylon</hi> we are to understand the
whole City, and not a part only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 2. 4. 10. 11. 17. 10.
21. but the destruction by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> was a partial

did not destroy it quite, but left a part remaining still, see <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi>
p. 294.</p>
                     <p>6. The destruction here spoken of is a final destruction, which

                     <p>Lastly, No City like to this City, no destruction like to
this, and the wrath of God is not so heavy on any City, as on
this, <hi>Rev. 18. 6, 7, 8. 18. Rev.</hi> 16. 19. but the destruction of

the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and yet neither of them comes

of <hi>Rome</hi> besides <hi>Alaricus, Odacer, Gensericus,</hi> and <hi>Totilas,</hi>
and where be the other six to make up the number ten?
4. Who can believe that the Kings which the Apostle speaks
of, had a Kingdom in the Apostles time on the North of the
<hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and of <hi>Danubius,</hi> and of the <hi>Rhine?</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that they be called Kings prophetically, because they were

a Kingdom, and to receive power as Kings were not all
one? 7. Who can believe that to receive power as Kings
with the Beast, is to joyn, and comply, and act with the Beast
in persecuting Christians, and not rather to have Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
bestowed on them, which they had not before? 8. Who
can think that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>e Beasts doth? and it will be a hard matter for these
men to find out ten Kings, whose Kingdom did begin the same
hour with the Beasts. Lastly, If to receive power as Kings,
be to joyn, and comply, and act with the Beast in persecuting
Christians, when should this be done? here they cannot find
a time when this should be, but in the days of <hi>Dioclesian;</hi> but
how comes <hi>Dioclesian</hi> to be the Beast now, which in the former
question was <hi>Domitian?</hi> these things are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> The destruction here spoken of, is of the third part of the
City only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 19. and so much as this came to pass in the time
of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Much more than this came to pass in the time of the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and therefore the dividing of the great City
into three parts, cannot be meant of them. 2. To be divided
into three parts, doth not note a destruction of the parts,
but a partition only, the parts remaining still, <hi>Math. 27. 35. 51.
Mark 1. 10. Act.</hi> 7. 56. 3. There be three degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in that Verse, whereof that which shall befall <hi>Babylon</hi>
is the greatest, and that which shall befall the great City is the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55629:121"/>
least. First, It is said <hi>the great City was divided into three parts,</hi>
this the least degree of punishment, it doth not betoken a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the City, but a partition only, or a separation of the
parts each from other. Secondly, It is said <hi>the Cities of the
Nations fell,</hi> this is a greater punishme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> than the former, it
notes a sudden downfall of their Cities, no parts of them stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thirdly, It is said that <hi>great</hi> Babylon <hi>came into remembrance
before God, to give her the Cup of the Wine of the fierceness of his
Wrath,</hi> this is the sorest punishment of all, it note, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
evil to befall her, no pitty to be taken on her. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
these three degrees of punishment do also differ in respect
of time, for they shall not come to pass altogether in the same
moment, but the great City shall be divided into three parts first,
and the Cities of the Nations shall fall next, and great <hi>Babylon</hi>
is reserved to the last, that she may have a punishment far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all the rest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oo.</hi> The burning here is an allusion to <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11. his Body
destroyed and given to the burning flame, which yet signified no more
than the translating of the Monarchy from the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and proportionably here the subduing this Heathen City
to the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> which was the effect of this blow that befell
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That by the Beast, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11. is meant the Monarchy
of the <hi>Seleutidae,</hi> I deny. 2. But what ever Monarchy be meant
thereby, when 'tis said <hi>his Body destroyed and given to the burning
flame,</hi> a total destruction is meant thereby, and not a partial.
3. The City of <hi>Rome</hi> was a <hi>Christian</hi> City in the days of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
before the War of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> did begin. 4. By
the damnation of Cities and Kingdoms in the Scripture, is not
meant the subduing of them to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of them in their corporeal substances, and that either
of the Inhabitants by a corporal death, or else of the buildings
of the City by consuming fire, and both of these are meant in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55629:121"/>
this place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16. See <hi>Pareus</hi> disputing against <hi>Alcazar</hi> in
this point, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 8.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> The throwing the great stone into the Sea, <hi>Vers. 21.

                        </gap> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi>
and say, Thus shall <hi>Babylon</hi> fall, and not rise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
yet <hi>Babylon</hi> long continued a great City, though the Dominion of it
was translated from the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to the <hi>Medes.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> But who told them, that no more is meant by that
Prophecy of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> then was acted against the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> by the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> Read the 26, 29, 37, 43, 62, 64. Verses;
and read also <hi>Jere.</hi> 50. 3, 13, 39, 40. and you shall find much
more, and that is a perpetual desolation of the City; which
though it were not quite fulfilled by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
yet it came to pass afterward, and we see it verified at this
day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> The voice of the Harpers, <hi>&amp;c. V. 23. alludes to</hi> Jere. 25.
10. I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the voice of the Bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride; the
sound of the Milstones, and the light of the Candle, and yet <hi>Judea,</hi>
of which that is spoken, still had people inhabiting it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Judea</hi> had a few poor people remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it still after the captivity; but yet <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of which,
that is spoken, had not any. 2. Compare the Prophecies both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and you shal find a great deal more in the <hi>Revelation</hi> then
in <hi>Jeremy;</hi> for in <hi>Jeremy</hi> it is said, <hi>I will take from them the voice
of the Bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride, the sound of the
Milstones, and the light of the Candle;</hi> but he doth not say, that
this shall be for ever, yea, it is said in the next Verse for seventy
years; but in the <hi>Revelation</hi> he saith, <hi>The voice of Harpers,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no Craftsman of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
craft he be, shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of
a Milstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; and the light of a
Candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55629:122"/>
and of the Bride shall be heard no more at all in thee.</hi> And
therefore a perpetual desolation is spoken of in this place, never
to be repaired any more. 3. If as much be intended in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> as was done by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> or by the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> this Prophecy was nothing near
fulfilled by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> for the Civil Polity of the
<hi>Jews</hi> was quite taken away by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> for seventy
years, and the Monarchy of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> was quite demolished
by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and never restored afterward; but
the Civil Polity of the <hi>Romans</hi> was not quite extinguished by
the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> nor their Monarchy quite destroyed, but
the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories were shreudly wasted, and their City
fired for the greatest part of it, yea, and their Monarchy ceased
in the West, but continued in the East, and their Territories
were regained afterward out of the hands of the <hi>Goths</hi> and
<hi>Vandals,</hi> and their City was repaired and remaineth to this day.</p>
                     <p>4 <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the Beast himself may not hate the Whore,
and destroy the City in the time of the eighth head; and what may
be the cause thereof?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is said <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. that the ten Kings <hi>shall give their
power and strength unto the Beast,</hi> but we do not read that they
shall give their power and strength unto the Whore; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is possible, if not probable, that the Beast and the Whore
may be at odds.</p>
                     <p>2. It is said <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. that they shall hate the Whore, but we
do not find that they shall hate the Beast at all; and therefore
the Beast and the Whore may be parted each from other.</p>
                     <p>3. We do not read that the ten Kings shall revolt from the
Beast, as Men do think they shall; but on the contrary we read,
<hi>Vers. 17. That they shall give their Kingdom to the Beast, until the
words of God shall be fulfilled:</hi> Which words do not imply a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55629:122"/>
but an adhearing to the Beast, and a cleaving to him still.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Until the words of God shall be fulfilled,</hi> they give their
Kingdom to the Beast; but the words of God are not fulfilled
until the City be destroyed, and therefore they shall give their
Kingdom to the Beast, until the City be destroyed; and how
can that be done, unless the Beast and the City be at odds at
that time?</p>
                     <p>5. What is the cause, why they hate the Whore? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they love the Beast, and give their Kingdom to the Beast;
as <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. compared with <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. doth declare: And doth
not this demonstrate, that the Beast and the City be at odds?
To make this plain by a comparison: Suppose a Man should
say, The <hi>Scotchmen</hi> shall hate <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Army, for
God hath put in their hearts to give their Kingdom to the King.
Doth not this imply, that the King, and <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his
Army be at odds? In like manner, when it is said, <hi>The ten horns
shall hate the Whore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For God hath put in their hearts, to give
their Kingdom to the Beast.</hi> Doth not this imply, that the Beast
and the Whore shall be at odds; so that the cleaving to the one,
doth cause the hatred of the other.</p>
                     <p>6. The Beast which carries the Whore, and is in love with
her, doth not reach unto the eighth head, but to the seventh,
and no further, as appears <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. And therefore it may well
come to pass, that all the seven heads may carry the Whore,
and be in love with her; but the eighth head (which is the
Beast we speak of in this Question) may hate her, and not carry
her at all: And if it be said, that the eighth head is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the seven. To this I answer: So long as he is of that
number, and under that notion or relation, he is one of them
that carries the Whore, and is in love with her; but when he
comes to be the eighth head of the Empire, he hath then a new
relation, though he be the same man, and doth not carry the
Whore at that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:55629:123"/>
7. It is likely, that the sixth head is the same person that the
eighth head is, and shall be deposed by the City, while he is
the sixth head, and the seventh head shall be placed in his
Throne; and in this respect it is, that the <hi>Beast was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi>
and <hi>shall be; he was,</hi> in the time of the sixth head; <hi>he is not,</hi>
in the time of the seventh, for he is desposed by the City, and
the seventh placed in his room. And from hence it is, That
the Beast, and the City be at odds, the ten Kings shall take part
with the Beast against the City, and the City shall take part
with the seventh head against the Beast, but the Beast, and the
ten Kings shall prevail and destroy the seventh head, and the
City both together.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone a way which no man went before, that I
know of, if I be in the right, it is thy part gentle Reader to go
the same way that I have gone; but if thou find, that I am in
an error, and gone out of the right way, and canst discover a
better to me, I will follow thee therein.</p>
                     <p>5 <hi>Quest.</hi> What use may be made of this Exposition of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
in respect of War and Peace with Papists?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> We may not begin a War with Papists, thinking
thereby to fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and see an
end of them, and their Religion in our days, and that upon a
trebble account.</p>
                     <p>First, We have proved already, <hi>Disp. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 3. That the chief
scene of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is not <hi>Europe</hi> but <hi>Asia;</hi>
and therefore we may not look for the whole or chiefest accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the Prophecies in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Papists are,
but in <hi>Asia</hi> rather, where the Papists are not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We have also shewed by divers Reasons, <hi>Chap. 17.
q.</hi> 1. That it is very uncertain, whether <hi>Babylon</hi> be the City of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or no; and therefore we may not begin a War with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55629:123"/>
thinking thereby to fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
upon that account: For put the case, that such a War were
begun, and it should prove, in the end, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is not the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we thought it was, would we not be ashamed
of such a War? Do not the Kings of the Earth bewail her,
and lament for her; when they see the smoke of her burning;
and would not this be our case, if we should begin a War with
<hi>Rome,</hi> thinking her to be the <hi>Babylon</hi> which the <hi>Revelation</hi>
speaketh of, would we not be sorry, if in the issue, it should fall
out otherwise? Hear what the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saith, <hi>Prov. 20. 18. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
purpose is established by counsel, and with good advise make
War.</hi> Prov. 24. 6. <hi>For by wise counsel shalt thou make thy War,
and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.</hi> Let us therefore
consider of the matter, and examine the point a little better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we begin a War upon an uncertain ground, and repent
thereof when it is done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Suppose it to be true, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> indeed; yet for all this, we may not begin a War with
Papists, thinking thereby that we fulfil the Prophecies of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> and shall see an end of them and their Religion in
our days; and that for these Reasons.</p>
                     <p>1. We are commanded to pray for the Peace of <hi>Jerusalem,
Psal.</hi> 122. 6. But how can we pray for her Peace, if we will have
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> begin a War with <hi>Babylon?</hi> Are not these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
each to other? For when we pray for Peace, we are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
against War; but if we will have <hi>Jerusalem</hi> begin a War
with Papists, we are really for War, and not for Peace, which
two ought not to be.</p>
                     <p>2. Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, Matth. 5. 9. <hi>Therefore cursed are the War-makers,
for they be the children of the Devil,</hi> 1 King. 22. 20, 21, 22, 23.
Revel. 16. 13, 14. &amp; 20. 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55629:124"/>
all men, Rom.</hi> 12. 8. But how can we live peaceably with all
men, if we begin a War with Papists? And how can it be said
that we be for Peace, as much as lieth in us, if we be the first
beginners, fomenters, and contrivers of a War, and will not
be at Peace when we may?</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Follow Peace with all men, and Holiness; without which, no
man shall see the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12. 14. But how do we follow Peace,
if we begin a War with Papists, thinking thereby that we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> before we know what the
true meaning of them is? To which I will add another saying
of the same Apostle, <hi>Rom. 14. 9. Let us therefore follow after the
things which make for peace.</hi> Therefore Peace is not only to be
admitted, when it may be had, or when it is offered to us and
brought unto our doors; but we are to follow and seek after it
our selves, when it is gone away from us; and not only so, but
we are also to follow after the things which make for Peace,

eschue evil, and do good, let him seek Peace, and ensue it. 1 Pet. 3.
10, 11. Psal.</hi> 34. 12, 13, 14. But how can we love life, and think
to see good days? If we be the first that begin a War, and will
not leave it off, till either all or most part of Christendom be

Therefore, though men pretend the accomplishment of the

<hi>libido dominandi,</hi> a desire to rule is the cause of War, and a

man of sin? You will be ready to say it is the Pope, but what
is meant by the spirit of his mouth? But the Preaching of the
Gospel, <hi>Isai. 11. 4. Hos. 6. 5. Heb. 4. 12. Revel.</hi> 2. 16. Therefore
the man of sin shall not be consumed by War, but by Preaching

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55629:125"/>
the two witnesses do not begin a War with the Beast, but he
begins with them and prevails therein; this were enough to
deter us from seeking or beginning War with Papists, lest we
meet with the same Catastrophe that the two Witnesses are said
to meet with in this Prophecy; for if God delivered them into
the Beasts hands, who were his peculiar Prophets and had such
eminent power to work Miracles as they had, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 5. 6. What
hope or ground have we to think that he will not deliver us if
we begin a War with Papists, and will not be quiet when we
may? To which may be added, that when the two Witnesses
revived and returned to life again, they did not renew the War
with the Beast, neither was the Beast or any of his men slain by
them, or by their procurement that we read of; but by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
which it pleased God to send amongst them, and when
the tenth part of the City fell, it fell by reason of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and not by their means or procurement, and in the
Earthquake were slain seven thousand men and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

which makes not a total nor a final destruction of the Beast, but
a partial and a temporal only.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>And it was given him to make War with the Saints, and to
overcome them,</hi> Rev. 13. 7. Here you see the Beast begins a
War with the Saints, and not the Saints with him; and there
is a time set by God in which the Beast shall prevail against the
Saints, and this time is said to be forty two moneths, <hi>v.</hi> 5.
but can we tell that this time is over, for if it be not over we
may not think to prevail, and if we think it is over, what
ground have we for that? we had need be sure of it before
hand, lest instead of overcoming we be overcome. Perhaps it
may be said that the Vials are begun already, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd that is some
ground to think that the forty two moneths are ended; to this
I answer, no, following their own interpretation of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
for they think themselves (but falsely) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

their miracles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 5. 6. and yet they were slain after
that; so put the case that the Vials be begun already, yet the
forty two months according to their interpretation may not be
ended for all that. It were more material to the business, if
they could shew us that the Vials were expiring, for then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the Beast were near at hand indeed; but where have they
any certainty of the near expiring of the Vials? how far they

with any, either with Papists or any other, since so little bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
comes thereby, and the success is so various and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
he that hath the best of it at one time, hath the worst of
it at another time, which may be the cause that the Saints are
exhorted unto patience in the same Verse, <hi>Here is the patience

but by War he shall have none; put the case he prevail at one
time, yet mischief may befall him at another time; therefore

Revel.</hi> 20. 7, 8. Therefore Satan is the procuring or fomenting
cause of War, and not the true Religion; and sometimes he
stirs up wicked men to begin a War against the Church, as is
evident in this place; and in that other place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 13,
14. And sometimes he excites the Church to begin a needless
War against the enemies thereof, as is plain in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Case,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22, 23. And which of these ways soever he
takes his aim, is to destroy the Church of God thereby: And
we may not think that God is the cause of War in any other
sense, then as he is the cause of death; and that is only as the
punishment or effect of sin; and if there had been no sin, there
had been no death, and, because no Death, no War; for God
made not death, as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saith. <hi>Wisd.</hi> 1. 13. And Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Scripture saith so too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. And because he made
not death, he made not War, which brings death inevitable
both on good and bad; but ungodly men with their works
and words, have called it to them. Here is the true cause of
Death, and of War too; but God is the first original cause of
neither, but will destroy them both in his appointed time.
When Sin and Satan are destroyed, then Death and War shall
be destroyed together. These are my Reasons for the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

for some particular victory which they obtained against him:
And this victory doth not import, that they begun the War

them: And so stands the case with us, if the Papists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a War with us, we may defend our selves; and if it please
God to give us victory, we may, and must rejoyce, and praise
the Lord as these men did; but to begin a War with them, and
expect to see an end of them, and their Religion, before the
day of Judgment, is more then can be gathered from this

So that here is no Commission for the

Kings which are without the Church,
shall joyn with the Beast and False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and war against the Church to their

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55629:127"/>
yet we are to know, that this destruction of the Whore, who
ever she be, shall not come to pass in our days, but in the time
of the seventh Vial, not long before the day of judgment; and
they which think it shall be accomplished in our days, and begin
a War on that account, may do well with the men of <hi>Issachar,</hi>
to understand the times a little better, before they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on such a hazard, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 32. I knew a Divine, an
old Man, not far from the place where I live, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in his life time, That the Pope should have an end in
the year 1654. And he would wager half the estate he had,
that it should come to pass; but he lived to see his Prophecy
come to nought: So they which thought the Beast should have
an end in the year 1666. did the like. And they which expect
the destruction of the Whore, in our days, thinking that they
shall live to see it done, may look till their eyes be out, and not
see it come to pass. 2. Who ever the Whore be, yet this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
shall not put an end to the Whores Religion; for after
this is done, the Kings which committed fornication with her
are alive still, and bewail her ruine, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 9. Which they
would not do, if they were not of her Religion still; and because
they cannot commit fornication any more in that particular
place, they shall seek to do it elswhere. 3. Though this destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
puts an end unto the Whore, yet it shall not put an end unto
the Beast; for after this is done, the Beast shall continue still,
and find another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est, as the Popes have done already; some of
whom, had their seats at <hi>Avignion</hi> in <hi>France</hi> for seventy years
together, and yet were Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> while they were in that
place; yea, after this is done, the Beast shall have a puissant
Army still, which shall put the Church in such a hazard, that
Christ himself shall come in person and destroy him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.
20. 4. Suppose we all this to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Babylon</hi> is
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope, the Beast that here is spoken
of. Suppose we also, that this destruction shall come to pass in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55629:128"/>
our days, and put an end unto the Beast, in respect of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Ecclesiasticks too; yet when all this is granted, a
Question may be made, What Commission had these Kings to
patronise this War, and what they do therein, for this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
gives them none: It is a Prophecy, what shall be <hi>de facto,</hi>
not what shall be <hi>de jure;</hi> it tells us what shall come to pass
<hi>actually,</hi> by main force and violence, not what shall come to
pass <hi>legally,</hi> according to the Law of God. And when it is
said <hi>Vers. 17. That God hath put into their hearts to fulfil his will.</hi>
We may not think that this is meant of his commanding will,
but of his decreeing will, and so the original words do signifie,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> his pleasure, sentence, or decree. Now it is the
first of these, which gives Commission for the doing of a thing,
and not the second; and it is the first of these, that we must
walk and act by, and not the second. <hi>Deut. 29. 29. Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
did fulfil the Will of God, that is, The decree of God
in destroying of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but yet he sinned against God in
doing it, for want of a Commission from the Will of Precept.
And no other is the case of these Kings, for God hath put into
their hearts to fulfil his will, that is, his decree; but as for his
Will of Precept, they fulfil it not. 5. This War is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by the ten Kings, in behalf of Religion, but for some
politick end or other; and it may be questioned, Whether the
Beast himself hath not a hand in this War, and whether the
Beast and the City may not be at odds at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> time; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ten Kings shall not give their Kingdom to the Beast on
that occasion, and so destroy the City upon that account. Read
the 16 and 17 <hi>Verses,</hi> and consider of it. 6. The Churches
troubles are not ended, when this War against the Whore is
over. Is not the <hi>Turk</hi> as great an enemy to Religion as the
Pope, and as potent too? And put the case the Pope were
dead, and the City burnt to ashes, what shall we do unto the
<hi>Turk</hi> when this is done? Shall we think to destroy him too, as
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55629:128"/>
we do the Pope? Let us consider first, which shall be destroyed
first; for if the <hi>Turk</hi> shall be destroyed first, why begin we
with the Papist, and let the <hi>Turk</hi> alone? but if the Pope shall be
destroyed first, then mark what will follow. First it will follow,
that the Pope is not the Beast, for the Beast shall be destroyed
last of all, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 20. Secondly, it will follow, that the
troubles of the Churches are not ended, when the Pope is
dead; for the <hi>Turk</hi> is still alive, who hath made more havock
of the Churches in the East, then ever the Pope did in the
West. 7. Put the case once more, that the Whore were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the ten Kings, what think we of the <hi>Turk,</hi> when
this is done? shall not he have an end too? And if he shall,
why do we not war with him too upon presumption, that we
be the persons that shall put an end unto him? Is it not rather
to be feared, that if Christians war with Christians, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
one another, the <hi>Turk</hi> may become Master of the West,
as he is already of the East, especially if we consider, that he
came unto this height in which he is, by the wars of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
among themselves. 8. If it be lawful to have Peace with
the <hi>Turk,</hi> why not also with the Pope? I suppose they will

Lastly, What if the <hi>Turk</hi> should take the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
he hath taken <hi>Candy?</hi> What would he do with it? Would he
destroy the City, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> Would he
not rather inhabit it, as he doth inhabit <hi>Candy?</hi> And if that
should come to pass, as it is possible it may, God permitting it
to be done, for the punishment of Idolatry; for which sin,
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken by the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and so may <hi>Rome</hi> be by
the <hi>Turk:</hi> And if that should come to pass, what would they
think of <hi>Rome</hi> then? Would they think that she is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
the <hi>Turk</hi> the Beast? Would they not rather take off their
thoughts from <hi>Rome,</hi> and seek for <hi>Babylon</hi> in some other
place?</p>

spoken, whether to the ten Kings, which shall destroy the City,
or to the people of God spoken of, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. If they be spoken to
the ten Kings; the answer is, That here is no Commission to
be cruel, but a Permission only, like as when it is said of the
<hi>Assyrian, I will send him against an Hypocritical Nation, and
against the people of my wrath, will I give him a charge to take the
spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire in
the street, Isa.</hi> 10. 6. But if this be spoken to the People of God,
the answer is, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith <hi>Paraeus.</hi> The godly are not commanded to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on <hi>Babylon,</hi> but to rejoyce at Gods revenge, as appears
<hi>Vers.</hi> 20. But to whomsoever this is spoken, here is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

be without offending them: And so stands the case betwixt us
and <hi>Rome,</hi> if they assault us, we may assault them; if they
begin with us, and will not hear of Peace, we may defend our
selves, and offend our foes, until they be minded to be quiet,
and agree on Peace, or safe Terms, and firm Foundations: But
if any one doth think that we may begin a War with <hi>Rome,</hi>
hoping thereby to fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and
put an end to her, and her Religion, before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he feeds himself on vain hopes, which shall not come
to pass. And this is as much as need be said to this Question, I
