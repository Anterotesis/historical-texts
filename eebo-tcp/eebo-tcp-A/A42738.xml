            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>THere was a Man, (l've heard my <hi>Grandsire</hi> say)</l>
                  <l>That had two Sons that in his bosom lay:</l>
                  <l>The first was <hi>Bat,</hi> a sober loving youth,</l>
                  <l>But through much weakness, very slow of growth;</l>
                  <l>The other <hi>Ned</hi> a lusty jocund child,</l>
                  <l>But that he prov'd extreamly high and wild</l>
                  <l>These grew together; <hi>Ned</hi> was Father's Boy;</l>
                  <l>Who knew it well, and therefore did imploy</l>
                  <l>His wits and interest against his Brother</l>
                  <l>To get his <hi>Birth-right:</hi> yea, sware to his <hi>Mother</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>To be his <hi>Guardian,</hi> and as tender of him</l>
                  <l>As she could be, who did so dearly love him.</l>
                  <l>So 'twas agree'd through much ado; but <hi>Ned</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Grew proud and high, which great <hi>Dissentions</hi> bred.</l>
                  <l>In short, the <hi>House</hi> fell into such a flame</l>
                  <l>Of strife between the <hi>Master</hi> and the <hi>Dame,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>That all the <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> began to ring;</l>
                  <l>Some wept to hear it, other some did sing.</l>
                  <l>Among the rest there was one neighbour <hi>Cross,</hi>

                  <l>For sev'ral urgent causes that appear'd.</l>
                  <l>This Villain, seeing these broils thus begun,</l>

                  <l>Then <hi>Cross</hi> with <hi>Bat</hi> and's <hi>Mother</hi> would collogue;</l>

                  <l>Thus scann'd on all hands, he must hide his face,</l>
                  <l>And act his part by those that are in place;</l>
                  <l>And so he did, until the House did grow</l>

                  <l>Thus <hi>Bat</hi> is left alone, shakes every limb,</l>
                  <l>For fear of what was now attending him.</l>
                  <l>By secret <hi>Packets</hi> then he did implore</l>
                  <l>His <hi>Father</hi>'s powerful presence, to restore</l>
                  <l>His dving hopes: The <hi>Father</hi> mounts his steed,</l>
                  <l>His wings are impt with pity, joy, and sheed.</l>
                  <l>But with the <hi>Father</hi> home comes busling <hi>Ned,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Calls all his own, his Mother being dead.</l>
                  <l>(Though <hi>Bat</hi> were promis'd, <hi>Ned</hi> should never more</l>

                     <hi>Bat</hi> over-joy'd to see his <hi>Father</hi> come,</l>
                  <l>Rings out the Bells to bid him welcome home.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ned</hi> makes some offers to capitulate;</l>

               <l>READER! 'tis now almost six years twice told</l>
               <l>My Muse conceiv'd; so that this <hi>Brat's</hi> born old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Yet even then it had <hi>Nativity;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But ever since hath mist <hi>Epiphany;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I took it for <hi>still born,</hi> and buried it,</l>
               <l>As smother'd by an <hi>Epileptick</hi> fit.</l>
               <l>But since that time, it seems its <hi>Ghost</hi> hath walkt;</l>
               <l>And with some <hi>Friends</hi> familiarly talkt.</l>
               <l>I do not know whereof it might complain;</l>
               <l>But this they say, they'l dig it up again</l>
               <l>In hopes to make the <hi>Bones</hi> and <hi>Dust</hi> to speak,</l>
               <l>Which so long lay in silence, and to break</l>
               <l>The nap of this poor <hi>Dormouse.</hi> I confess</l>
               <l>It's not grown out of season, more or less;</l>
               <l>Much of what then did look like <hi>Prophesie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Late actions have turn'd into <hi>History.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So that to read aright, thou must begin</l>
               <l>Eleven years back, and think how things were then.</l>
               <l>Yet some things here thou'lt find, which I have reason</l>
               <l>Enough to think will ne're be out of season.</l>
               <l>And once more may I speak but what I think,</l>
               <l>You'l find the bitterest cup is yet to drink.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Ball</hi> is up, by that the <hi>Game</hi> is out,</l>
               <l>Those that survive will wish for death, I doubt:</l>
               <l>When that curst <hi>Fox</hi> that's now unkennel'd shall</l>
               <l>Turn head against the <hi>Chase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>Ah me! methinks I see the bloody Field;</l>
               <l>But here's my comfort; Heaven is my shield.</l>
               <l>I smell the <hi>Battel,</hi> and you'l shortly see</l>
               <l>How you are juggl'd to your <hi>Destinie.</hi>

               <l>When God shall heal the sickness of this Nation,</l>
               <l>And purge her <hi>Blood</hi> by an Evacuation,</l>
               <l>Yea, when our veins shall weep their fountains dry,</l>
               <l>And shed those crimson Tears, which from the eye</l>
               <l>Might have been better spar'd; then shall we know</l>
