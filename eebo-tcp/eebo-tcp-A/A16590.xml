            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

floude and drowned them, the fyer and burnte
them vp, Titus and beſieged them, Gods wrath

mournynge and woe: then was cryenge
out, wringing of handes, renting of clothes, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byng
and ſighynge for the miſeries fallen, out of
the whiche they coulde not ſcape. But oh you
morners &amp; cryers out: ye renters of clothes, why

The Goſpell is gone, goddes word is lytle prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched,

crye out now, for he wyl not heare you: You bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

ſake, for our impietie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as God hath taken awaye our kinge, ſo wil
he take awaye his goſpel: yea ſo we would haue
it, then ſhoulde all be well thinke manye. Wel, if
he take that awaye, for a tyme perchance we ſhal
be quyet, but at length we ſhall fele the want to

chaunce was to make a ſermon of repentaunce
the whiche was earneſtlye of diuerſe deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

or els put it forth in prynt. The whiche thynge
to graunte, as I coulde not (for I had not wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

muſte promyſe them to wryte it as I coulde: I
conſented to their requeſte that they ſhuld haue
it at my leaſure. This leaſure I prolonged ſo
longe, that as I wene I offended them, ſo didde
I pleaſe my ſelfe, as one more gladde to reade
other mennes wrytynges, then in ſuche ſorte to
publyſhe my wrytynges for other men to reade,
not that I wolde others not to profyt by me: but
that I knowing how ſhort my ſuppellex &amp; ſtore
as, woulde be loth for the enemies to haue iuſte
occaſion of euyll ſpeakynge and wreſtinge that
whiche ſymplye is ſpoken. But when I conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
this preſent tyme, to occaſion men now to
loke vpon all thinges in ſuche ſorte as myghte
moue them to Godlynes, rather then to anye cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe
queſtioninge, I for the ſatiſfienge of my
promyſe, and profytinge of the ſimple ignoraunt
and rude, haue nowe cauſed this Sermon to be

doeth (as it were) euen

therfore our lyfe in the ſcripture
<pb facs="tcp:7198:6"/>
is called a walkynge, for that as
the body dayly draweth more &amp;
more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neare his ende, that is the
earth: euen ſo our ſoul draweth
dayly more and more, neare the
death, that is: ſaluation or damp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation,
heauen or hell. Of which
thinge, in that we are mooſt care<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe,
and very foles (for we alas,

Sathan, and perdition, beynge

            <p>This ſentence thus pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and preached by our ſauiour
Ieſus Chriſte, as it doeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
vs to repent, ſo to the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge
of the ſame, it ſheweth vs a
ſufficient cauſe to ſturre vs vppe
therevnto, namelye, for that the
kyngdome of heauen (which is a
kyngedome of all ioye, peace, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
power, and pleaſure) is at

as do repente. So that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge

Syrs, for that I ſe you al

Beholde and marke well what
I ſaye vnto you: The kingdome
of heauen that is another maner
of ioye and felicitie, honoure, and
riches, power, and pleaſure, then
you nowe perceyue or enioye, is

that is, repent you, you ſhal moſt

I ſay, that is: repent, for this
ioye I ſpeake of, euen the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>Here we maye note fyrſte the

            <p>Agayne in that he ioyneth to the
commaundemente, the cauſe,
ſayinge: for the kyngedome of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is at hand: we may learne
that of the kyngedome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
none (to whom the miniſterye of
preaching doth appertayne) can
be partaker, but ſuch as repente
<pb facs="tcp:7198:8"/>
and do pennaunce.</p>
            <p>Therfore dearly beloued, yf
you regarde the kyngedome of
heauen, in that you cannot entre
therein except you repent, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech
you al of euery eſtate as you
woulde your owne weale, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and do penaunce, the which
thinge that you maye do, I wyll
do my beſte now to helpe you by
gods grace.</p>
            <p>But fyrſt becauſe we cannot
well tell what repentaunce is,
thorowe ignoraunce, &amp; for lacke
of knoweledge, and falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge,
I wyll (to begynne with
all, ſhewe you what repentaunce
is.</p>
            <p>Repentaunce or pennaunce is
no Englyſhe worde, but we bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
it of the Latiniſtes, to
whome pennaunce is a forethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
in Englyſhe, in Greke, a
<pb facs="tcp:7198:8"/>
beynge wyſe afterwardes, in He<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brewe,
a conuerſion or turnyng,
the whyche conuerſion or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge,
in that it can not be true
and hartye vnto God eſpecially,
without ſome good hope or truſt
of pardone for that whyche is
all readye doone and paſte, I
maye well in thys ſorte defyne
it, namelye, that pennaunce is a
ſorrowynge or forethynkynge
of oure ſynnes paſte, an earneſte
purpoſe to amende, or turnynge
to GOD, with a truſte of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
            <p>This diffinicion maye be
deuyded into three partes, that
pennaunce or repentaunce ſhuld
contayne, fyrſt a ſorowynge for
our ſynues: Secondlye a truſte
of pardonne, whyche otherwyſe
maye be called a perſwaſion
<pb facs="tcp:7198:9"/>
of Gods mercy, by the merits of
Chriſte, for the forgeueneſſe of
our ſynnes: And thyrdely apur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to amende, or conuerſion to
a newe lyfe: the whiche thyrd or
laſt part, cannot be called proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
a parte, for it is but an effect of
pennaunce, as towards the ende
you ſhall ſe by Gods grace. But
leaſt ſuche as ſeke for occaſion to
ſpeake euill, ſhoulde haue any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
though thei tarry not out
the ende of this ſermon: I there
fore deuyde penaunce into the
iii foreſayde partes, of ſorowing
for oure ſynne, of good hoope or
truſte of pardon, and of a newe
lyfe. Thus you now ſe what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
is, a ſorowyng for ſynne,
a purpoſe to amend, with a good
hope or truſte of pardone.</p>
            <p>This pennaunce not onely dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fereth
from that whiche men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye
<pb facs="tcp:7198:9"/>
haue taken to be pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
in ſaying and doing our
enioyned lady pſalters, Seuen
Pſalmes, faſtinges, pilgrimages
almoſe dedes, and ſuch lyke thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges:
but also frome that whiche
the more learned haue declared
to conſiſt of three partes, namely
Contricion, Confeſſion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction.</p>
            <p>Contricion they call a iuſte &amp;
a full ſorowe for theyr ſynne, for
this worde, iuſt, and ful, is one of
the differences betwene contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
and attricion.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion they cal a numbring
of all theyr ſynnes in the eare of
theyr ghoſtly father: for as (ſaye
they) a iudge ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abſolue with
out knoweledge of the cauſe or
matter, ſo cannot the Preiſte or
goſtly father abſolue from other
ſynnes, then thoſe whiche he
<pb facs="tcp:7198:10"/>
doth heare.</p>
            <p>Satiſfaction they call a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
makinge vnto God for their
ſynnes, by theyr vndue workes,
<hi>opera indebita,</hi> workes more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they nede to do, as they terme
them. This is theyr pennaunce
whiche they preache, wryte, and
alowe: but howe true this geare
is, howe it agreeth with goddes
worde, howe it is to be alowed,
taught, preached, and wrytten,
let vs a lyttell conſidre. If a man
repent not vntyl he haue a iuſt &amp;
full ſorowynge for his ſynnes
(dearly beloued) when ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent?
for inaſmuche as hell fier,
and the poniſhment of the deuils
is a iuſte ponyſhmente for ſynne:
Inaſmuch as in al ſynne, ther is
a contempt of GOD, whyche
is all goodneſſe, and therefore
there is a deſerte of all ylneſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:7198:10"/>
Alaſſe who can bear or feele this
iuſte ſorowe, this full ſorowe for
our ſinnes, this their contrition,
whiche they ſo do diſcerne from
theyr attricion? Shall not man
by this doctryne rather diſpayre
then come by repentaunce?</p>
            <p>Yf a manne repent not vntyll he
haue made confeſſyon of all hys
ſynnes, in the eare of hys gooſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
father: yf a man can not haue
abſolution of his ſynnes, vntyll
hys ſinnes be tolde by tale and
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, in the preiſts eare, in that
as Dauyd ſayethe, none canne

burthen do depreſſe hym: halaſſe
ſhall not a man by this doctryne
be vtterlye dryuen from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce?
Thoughe they haue
gone aboute ſomethyng to make
plaiſters for theyr ſoores, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
or attricion, to aſwage
this geare, biddinge a manne to
hope well of his contricion, thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe
it be not ſo ful, as is required
and of his confeſſion, thoughe he
haue not nombred all his ſinnes,
yf ſo be that he do ſo muche as in

that there is none but that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is gyltye (for who doth as
muche as he maye) trowe ye that
this playſter is not lyke ſalte for

when they haue al done they can
for the appeaſing of conſciences
in theſe pointes, this is the ſome
that we yet ſhulde hope well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7198:11"/>
But yet ſo hope that we muſte
ſtonde in a mammeryng &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
whether oure ſynnes be
forgeuen. For to beleue <hi>remiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

of forgeuenes of ſinnes, as
oure crede teacheth vs, they cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

and that not only hereat, but

            <p>As concerninge Satiſfaction

For yf Satiſfaction can be done

In heauen and in earth was

            <p>I mighte here brynge in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of theyr pennaunce, how
perilous it is to be embraced,
but lette the example of theyr

he damned. He was ſory enough

reſtorynge the money he had
receyued. But yet all was but
loſt, he hanged vp hym ſelfe, hys
bowelles burſte out, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
a chyld of perdition for

            <p>Mercifull father of our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure
Ieſus Chriſte, bcauſe I

and thorowe thy goodnes haue

<pb facs="tcp:7198:20"/>
whereto this longe ſufferaunce

thy mercy in Chriſt to work

thy ſpyryt, power, and grace, to
humble, mortifye, and feare my
conſcyence for my ſynnes to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that in thy tyme thou
mayeſte comforte and quycken

this ſort I ſay, or otherwyſe,
as thou thynkeſte good, yf thou
wylte haue this fyrſt parte, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricion,
or ſorowe for thy ſynnes,
do thou begge it of God, thorow

aſked it, as I haue laboured to

to moue thee from flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terynge
of thy ſelfe, from ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyſhnes
<pb facs="tcp:7198:20"/>

diligente to vſe theſe meanes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge.</p>
            <p>Vnto prayer which I would
thou ſhouldeſt fyrſt vſe as thou
canſt: Secondly, get thee Gods
lawe as a glaſſe to toote in, for in
it, and by it commeth the trewe
knowledge of ſynne, withoute
whiche knoweledge there can be
no ſorowe. For howe can a man
ſorrowe for his ſynnes, whyche
knoweth not his ſynnes? As
when a man is ſycke, the fyrſte
ſteppe to health, is to knowe his
ſyckeneſſe, euen ſo to ſaluation
the fyrſte ſteppe thereto, is to
knowe thy dampnation due for
thy ſynnes.</p>
            <p>The lawe of God therefore
muſte be gotten, and well tooted
in, that is, we muſte looke in it
<pb facs="tcp:7198:21"/>
ſpirituallye, and not corporallye

and ſo our ſauioure teacheth vs

not onely after the outward
dede, but alſo after the hearte,
makynge there the anger of the
hart a kynd of murther, luſtinge
after an other mans wyfe, a kind
of adulterye.</p>
            <p>And this is one of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betwene Gods lawe and
mannes lawe. That of this
(mannes lawe I meane) I am
not condempnable, ſo longe as I
obſerue outwardely the ſame.</p>
            <p>But Goddes lawe goeth to
the roote, and to the harte, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnynge
me for the inwarde

Get the gods word, but not that

            <p>But here thou muſt knowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
there is two kyndes of promiſes
one which are properly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law,
another which ar properly of the

            <p>In the promyſes of the lawe,
we may in dede behold Goddes

liberalite of Gods goodnes, that
we can not, but be muche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
though we haue very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelye

            <p>For theſe promyſes of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
doe not hange on the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
