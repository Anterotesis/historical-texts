            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which, that it may be the more profitable to you, I pray take a very brief view of the Story: When the <note place="margin">A diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Tribes and half and the other Tribes.</note> Warres were ended in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the two Tribes and half, the Tribes (I mean) of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and half the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> whoſe habitation and poſſeſſion lay on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> were now to returne home, and their brethren had diſmiſſed them with a bleſſing; but before they got out of the countrey there fell out an occaſion of a quarrell and diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Wherein two things.</note> them and their brethren, which begins about the tenth verſe of this Chapter, and all the reſt of the <note place="margin">1</note> Chapter is a diſcourſe about that diſcord and jarre that <note place="margin">The originall of this quarrel.</note> grew between the nine Tribes and halfe, and the two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114446:4"/>
Tribes and halfe; wherein there are theſe two things, Firſt, <hi>the Originall of the quarrell,</hi> or the <hi>cauſa procreans,</hi> what the difference was betwixt them; Secondly, <hi>cauſa corrumpens,</hi> the compoſure of it, the making an end of it: The originall of the quarrell, briefly was this, the two Tribes and halfe when they came upon the bankes of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> did there build an Altar every way like to the Altar of God, which by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to ſtand before the Arke, and the Tabernacle, upon which onely the Iſraelites were to offer their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; This newes was preſently carried to the reſt of the Tribes, and they looked upon it, as if their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had built an Altar to offer Sacrifice to God, which had beene <hi>Crimen apoſtaſiae,</hi> an Apoſtaſie from then true Religion, and they reſolved preſently in this quarrell to <note place="margin">2</note> engage their lives, and appoint a generall Rendezvouz <note place="margin">The making up of this breach or quarrell.</note> at <hi>Shiloh</hi> where the Arke of the Covenant was, here they all met as one man togoe up to war againſt them; here was their Quarrell; the reſt of the Chapter is the taking up of this quarrell, and that was done by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the ſumme whereof in a few words, is this, the Tribes did ſend ten men, one for every Tribe, and with them they ſent <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, they goe as Commiſſioners to their Brethren, and when they come to them they firſt expoſtulate the greatneſſe of the ſinne, which they thought they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they ſhew them the miſchiefe that would come of it, not onely deſtruction upon themſelves, but upon all the whole Congregation, unles they in the name of God ſhould revenge it: this they prove by the example of the iniquity of <hi>Peor,</hi> from which they were not yet clenſed, and by the inſtance of <hi>Achans</hi> ſacriledge, which brought wrath upon all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114446:5"/>
they requeſt them, that if they thought their land was unclean, becauſe they had not among them thoſe pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Gods preſence, the Arke and Teſtimony, which their brethren had, that they would leave that Countrey where they ſhould be expoſed to ſuch temptations, and with all their hearts, they would part with a portion of their owne inheritance, that they might live together as brethren. To this the Tribes and halfe make anſwer; Firſt, they doe ſolemnely call God to witneſſe, that they were farre from being guilty of that which was laid to their charge, it never came into their thoughts to build an Altar to offer Sacrifice, <hi>they pleaded not guiltie.</hi> Secondly, they tell them the true reaſon of that fact of theirs, namely they were afraid leſt the Generations to come, might occaſion their poſteritie to fall off from the true worſhip of God, when the reſt of the Tribes ſhould tell them that <hi>Jordan</hi> was the bounds of Gods peoples inheritance, and ſo they bee caſt off as people that were not within the Communion of Saints: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they reſolved to build this Altar, that it might be a pledge, and that the generations to come might plead it, that this was ſet up at the time, when the warres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to remaine as an evidence that they and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were all one, both in Nation and Religion. Which as ſoon as the Commiſſioners heard, they rejoyced, they concluded God was amongſt them, and they returne home and acquaint their brethren with it, who when they heard it were all well pleaſed; <hi>The thing pleaſed the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Some generall obſervations our of this ſtory.</note> 
               <hi>children of Iſrael, and they bleſſed God, and reſolved they would have no warre with their brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the Summe of the Story, and in this ſtory there are very many excellent things for our inſtruction: This Altar built on the bankes of <hi>Jordan,</hi> is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114446:5"/>
of in the diſpute of humane ſignificant ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the worſhip of God or for religious uſe. Whether ſuch ceremonies may be juſtified by this example, is very diſputable, but without any diſpute, here are many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table examples of <hi>Piety;</hi> it was a great example of Piety in the two Tribes and halfe, that <hi>they were ſo deſirous to provide that their poſteritie might not bee deprived of the Communion of Gods people in his Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a great example of Piety there is in this, <hi>that they were ſo ready by (not onely Proteſtations, but) Oathes to cleare themſelves from any thought of corrupting the worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have alſo a great example of Piety in the other Tribes, <hi>that in ſuch a cauſe, as the caſe of Apoſtaſie from Gods truth, they would not have ſpared the lives of their owne brethren.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Here are notable examples likewiſe of juſtice amongſt them; juſtice in the Tribes, <hi>that before they would beleeve any informations, or apprehenſions of their brethren, they would ſend Commiſsioners to know the bottome of it, to ſee whether the things were ſo;</hi> and juſtice in the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>that they did ſo faithfully relate backe to the Tribes the true ſtate of the caſe, and ſo to hinder as much as in them lay the effuſion of blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are likewiſe ſome examples of humane frailtie, that are not to bee excuſed; it's not to bee excuſed in the two Tribes and halfe, that they would goe upon ſuch a dangerous buſineſſe, which is diſputable to this

very day, whether ſuch a thing was lawfull to bee done, to ſet up ſuch a way of inſtruction or remembrance, that they would goe about ſuch a thing which might prove a ſtumbling block, and not firſt acquaint their brethren with their intentions.</p>
            <p>And as great or greater weakeneſſe was that in the nine Tribes and halfe, that they would almoſt reſolve upon a warre, and make preparations for it, upon a raſh and wrong interpretation, before they did ſo much as know, whether there were cauſe or no.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt document of all the reſt in the whole ſtory, is that which they made the ground of their warre, which you'le finde about the 23. Verſe, <hi>That if their brethren had played the Apoſtates from God in matters of his worſhip, the wrath of God would preſently fall upon the whole Nation, unleſſe they had joyned together to vindicate the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe &amp; ſeverall other Leſſons are worth the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but I reſolve to make a ſhort Sermon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wave them all, and confine my ſelfe to that, which is the reſult, and event of the Treatie, which was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Thankſgiving to God; They bleſſed God, and they reſolved, not to go to warre againſt their brethren; the words are cleare, and I think need no interpretation; they bleſſed God, that their brethren had not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſinne that they were afraid they had done; and that therefore the wrath of God was not like to bee kindled againſt them; and as the cloſe of both theſe, that God had mercifully prevented that which they feared, that they ſhould have beene compelled to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew their hands in one anothers blood, they bleſſed God that there was no cauſe of fighting. And from this I ſhall (by the Lords aſſiſtance) handle this, and this onely leſſon.</p>

            <p>This leſſon lyeth cleare in the words, 1 In the 31.

It is an example of <hi>David,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unworthy uſage of a Gentleman in the Countrey, a great man, one <hi>Nabal,</hi> that had extreamely provoked him, and abuſed him, had ſworne that hee would cut off his Family, and not leave a man of them; and in his heate was going to avenge himſelfe, but as hee was in the middeſt of his march, <hi>Abigail Nabals</hi> wife meets him, tells him the ſtory, infinuates into him by her excellent Counſell, endevours to ſtop his hand from his enterprize; now marke how <hi>David</hi> rejoyceth in it, though the warre would have beene but againſt one Family, where hee was to meete with no reſiſtance; <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, and bleſſed be God that ſent thee to mee, and bleſſed bee thy Counſell that hath with-held my hand from ſhedding blood;</hi> hee looked upon it as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull mercy, that when hee was ready to engage, God had offered ſuch a faire meanes to take him off from it. There is another in the ſecond of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of a great Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note place="margin">2 Sam. 20.</note>

and Generall, <hi>Joab</hi> by name, when hee was in the purſuit of one <hi>Sheba,</hi> that had played the Rebell and Traytor againſt his King, <hi>Joab</hi> had purſued him far, and now had chac'd him into a Citie called <hi>Abell,</hi> there beſieged him and the Citie for his ſake, with a purpoſe to batter the Walls downe, and to deſtroy all that were in the Citie, as guilty of protecting this villaine; very ſeaſonably a wiſe woman over the wall calls to <hi>Joab,</hi> and would know of him, why hee would come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Citie of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo to ſwallow up a part of the inheritance of the Lord; now marke <hi>Joabs</hi> anſwer, <hi>The Lord forbid,</hi> ſaith he) <hi>God forbid,</hi> it is farre from mee, that ever I ſhould take any pleaſure to devoure, or ſwallow up; there is no ſuch matter; there is one <hi>Sheba</hi> a Traytor againſt his King, I purſue him onely, deliver him up, I am gone, not a man dies amongſt you. You ſee a Souldier, a man enur'd to blood, abominates the thoughts of it, further then neceſſitie compells, to have his hand in the blood of any of Gods people. This will yet bee clearer, if you conſider, that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe lookes upon it, as the ſaddeſt judgement, that ever hee gives his people up to, when hee ſuffers them to imbrew their hands in one anothers blood. Take but one or two inſtances, that in the 9. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> at the 19. verſe; <hi>Through the wrath of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Text) <note place="margin">Eſay 9. 19, 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the Land is darkned,</hi> the wrath of God was like a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the ſmoake of it filled all the Land, <hi>and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall bee as fewell to this fire;</hi> This was a terrible judgement which is expreſſed in ſuch dreadfull tearmes, darkeneſſe and devouring fire are horrid things, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more intolerable then theſe two; But what was this judgement, or by what meanes ſhould this fierce wrath of God bee executed? marke the next words,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114446:7"/>
               <hi>no man ſhall ſpare his brother, they ſhall ſnatch on their right hand and bee hangry, and ſnatch on their left hand and not bee ſatisfied, they ſhall every man eate the fleſh of his owne arme, Ephraim againſt Manaſseh, and Manaſſeh againſt Ephraim, and both of them together helpe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure Judah;</hi> No man ever hated his owne fleſh, faith the Apoſtle, but this people ſhould bee ſo blinded, and ſo given up to a reprobate ſenſe, that they ſhould devoure and deſtroy their neareſt friends, and eate as it were the fleſh of their owne armes. If ever God give up a people to this, that brethren thus come to engage in one anothers blood, it is a token that the wrath of God burnes the hotteſt that it can burne againſt a Land. Take one expreſſion more, it is in Jer. 13. 14. <hi>I will daſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>them one againſt another, even the fathers and the ſonnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaith the Lord, I will not pitty nor ſpare, nor have mercy, but deſtroy them;</hi> a ſtrange expreſſion from a God of mercy, whoſe delight is in mercy, I will not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhew no mercy! kill, kill, kill; but how ſhall this be executed? why, I will daſh them one againſt another, without any enemy from abroad, there ſhall be no need to ſend for ſtrangers, the father ſhall deſtroy the children and children their fathers, and a mans mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers ſhall be his neighbours or the men of his owne houſhold; You may by theſe plainly diſcerne that God accounts it the terribleſt of all judgements to give his people up to deſtroy each other, and therefore it muſt be acknowledged a great mercy to have it prevented.</p>
            <p>To this I might adde, that in Gods book, thoſe men that are the occaſions of peoples ruining one another are accounted the moſt ahominable; and they that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent it, are counted the bleſſedeſt men that live; this is one of the things that Gods ſoule

            <p>Firſt, That Blood-ſhed warre is a terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherever it is, fall it out among whom it will. <note place="margin">1</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That it is yet a greater judgement, when <note place="margin">2</note> 
               <hi>Brethren</hi> come to devoure and deſtroy one another, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of one Nation; Civill warres is a greater judgment then war with Strangers.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The greateſt of all judgements is, when <hi>Gods people</hi> who are brethren in the profeſſion of his true Religion, come to imbrew their hands one in anothers blood: theſe things opened it will certainly be concluded, that Gods mercy in preventing this, is moſt worthy to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For the firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That to have a people given up to warre, and blood, and</hi>

               <hi>ſpoile, is a great plague.</hi> You all know in the Scripture it is counted one of Gods <hi>ſoreſt judgements,</hi> Ezek. 14. 21. When I ſend my foure ſore judgements upon Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Sword, and the Famine, and the noy ſome Beaſt, and the Peſtilence to cut off man and beaſt, the Sword is the firſt and chiefe of Gods ſore judgements: It is granted that ſometimes war is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and neceſſary; and indeed never lawful but when neceſſary; when as the ſaying is, <hi>Pax populi, patriaeque ſalus &amp; gloria regni,</hi> when publique Safetie, Libertie and Religion have no other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114446:8"/>
way to preſerve them under heaven but the Sword, the Sword is then lawfull and then neceſſary: but however war may ſometimes be lawfull, it is alwaies a great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt to the one part, if not to both; It is the Idea of all miſeries that can befall a Countrey; nothing thrives where this Woolfe ſets his foot; and hee that would have a Land-skip of it, that would have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of war, let him but conceive the burning of houſes, confuſed noiſe, garments rowled in blood, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing of women and virgins, and daſhing of Infants againſt the ſtones, deſtroy of trade, ſpoyle of wealth, blood, and wrath, and fury marching every where, a Countrey like the land of <hi>Eden</hi> before the face of man, and nothing but a deſolate Wilderneſſe when once it have walked over it; a Land ſowne with the ſeed of man and beaſt, fruitfull and flouriſhing, ſuddenly made an Aceldama, a Golgatha, a Field of blood, or a place of Sculs, this is warre: in a word, if a man would in one ſhort ſentence deſcribe a Country to bee moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, hee need ſay no more, but <hi>hic fuit hoſtilitas,</hi> Warre hath raged and raigned in this place; our ſelves, alas, for theſe yeeres paſt, have had ſo much experience of it, that our women and children are able now to bee Rhetoricians in ſetting forth the miſeries of warre; and is it not a mercy when God will prevent this? But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Looke upon <hi>civill wars, and you will judge them a</hi>  
               <note place="margin">2 Civill warre a greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>greater judgement,</hi> when brethrens Swords come to bee drawne againſt their brethren; when a mans deadly enemies muſt prove thoſe that were his old companions, when Cities are divided among themſelves, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries among themſelves, and all the miſeries of Warre come to bee inflicted by them that have beene acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and deare to us, when ſafety and ſhelter may as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114446:9"/>
ſoon be expected among enemies as old friends; let all men that have underſtanding ſay whether this doth not double, or treble the miſeries of warre; had it been an enemy that had done mee this diſpleaſure, I could have borne it, but <hi>tu Brute,</hi> thou my friend and companion, that theſe things ſhould come from thy hand! all men know how deepe this ſinkes; this teares the heart of man in peeces; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a brother offended is harder</hi>

               <hi>to bee wonne then a ſtrong City, and they are like the barres of a ſtrong Caſtle;</hi> it's hard breaking of them, but when once they are divided they are more hardly joyned: as wee ſay of a ſtrong Cord made up of a great many threds, it is hard to bee broken, but when it is broken, you'le hard ever ſew it againe to make it ſtrong; by how many arguments any did perſwade their hearts, that they ſhould not receive plunder, or ſpoile, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe from ſuch a man, or family, from ſo many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ariſeth a difficulty, if not impoſſibility to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; and hence ariſe laſting grounds of animoſitie, enmitie and hatred ſcarce ever to bee worne out, when upon every meeting this thought is ſuggeſted, This is the man who as an enemy entred my habitation and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my wealth, it may bee murdered my children or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, raviſhed my wife or daughter; adde further, that frequently in theſe civill broyles the victory ends not the occaſion or ground of the quarrell, nor takes away but increaſeth the former miſery, the conqueror com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proving inſolent, inhumane, cruell, and more grievous to the Common-wealth, then the thing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were againſt whom men have fought, that I may boldly ſet downe for a certaine the concluſion of a wiſe man, that civill warres are not onely a Malady, but a fiery ſickneſſe, even a Frenzie to a State; and how ever

God ſometimes brings good out of them, (as ſometimes men have better health after a deadly ſickneſſe) yet for the moſt part, States are never made better, but very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ruin'd by them; and when once the ſeed of it hath tooke deep root in a Land, if God from heaven doe not miraculouſly appeare, that fire burnes till all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; And is it not then a mercy from God ſeaſonably to prevent brethren, when they are falling into civill warres, thereby to devoure and deſtroy one another? But thirdly, which is neareſt to my Text, and indeed neareſt to the occaſion of our meeting;</p>

Infinite diſhonour to Gods name, when his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, covenant ſervants walke ſo contrary to his rule: Religion becomes a ſtumbling blocke, a thing even therefore abominated by the enemies of it, when the profeſſors of it ſhall bee looked upon as factious, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, turbulent, bloody, hatefull and hating one another, it overthrowes all power of godlineſſe in their owne hearts, when once the grace of Love which nouriſhes all good in the hearts of Gods people is overthrowne, and the Spirit of God thus quenched in them, grace decayes, and the wofull fruites of Satan and ſinne prevaile over them, and now they grow corrupt in their mindes and converſation, looſe from their God, bitter againſt their brethren, companions with wicked men, with whom they joyne againſt their brethren, and ſo leave their Religion, profeſſion and name, as a curſe behind them. Now to have all theſe prevented, not onely warre and civill warre prevented, but brethren in Religion, who are the Lords people, hindred from deſtroying one another, when God ſeaſonably apppeares to prevent all this, <hi>Is it not a mercy worthy the acknowledgment?</hi> To all this I might adde the excellency of the bleſſing of peace, which is hereby preſerved, that bleſſing which is the Jewell of the world; yea the unitie, peace and love of the <hi>Church and people of God</hi> preſerved by ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prevention, which is ſuch a mercy as no tongne or pen is able to expreſſe. <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity;</hi> This is <note place="margin">Pſal. 133. per torum.</note> like <hi>Aarons</hi> garment, this is like the dew upon the mountaines of <hi>Sion,</hi> which makes every ſeed and every

            </p>
            <p>To helpe you this day to give that glory and praiſe to God, which the mercy of this day calls for at all our hands, God hath in all our publique troubles watched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and appeared in the mount of all our difficulties, and hath hitherto alwayes found out wayes, when we could find none, and alwayes come in with ſeaſonable deliverances, bleſſed bee his name for it, but to my poore thoughts, never did the Lord give a more ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deliverance, and appeare more mercifully to keep us from utter ruine, then in that mercy, which wee meet this day to celebrate, and I thinke you will judge ſo, if with me you conſider theſe foure things that meet in it: Firſt, <note place="margin">1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſad occaſion of our danger. Secondly, <note place="margin">2.</note>

            <p>The perſons (ſome of them through miſ-information) <note place="margin">The greatneſſe of this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance appeares by conſidering foure things.</note> who were ingaged in the preparation to this new warre. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114446:12"/>
The propinquitie, the neare approach of utterruine by <note place="margin">3</note> it: And fourthly. <note place="margin">4</note>
            </p>
            <p>The conſequents of it. Firſt, <note place="margin">1</note>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of it: the Originall was, that moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">The ſad ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</note> and abominable rape and violence offered unto the two Houſes of Parliament, wherein the moſt loath ſome filth and durt was throwne in the faces of our Nobles, and our Senators, that I thinke was ever found in any Nation; confident I am, the like was never done in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> ſo great a blot and ſtain caſt upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I may truely ſay, is <hi>tantum non</hi> irreparable, when a rude multitude ſhall by violence compell the honorable Houſes of Parliament to paſſe what they pleaſed, ſhall reproach them, revile them, ſhall thereaten their lives, ſhall enter the Houſe, and order what the Speaker muſt propound to the queſtion, what the Glerke muſt write, and after eight houres keeping them priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and uſing them at their pleaſure; when night was comming on the Members hardly to eſcape with their lives; ſuch an indignitie it was, that I am perſwaded, if rightly underſtood, many hundred thouſands in this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> would not count their deareſt blood too great a price to vindicate or expiate; and as if this were not enough, againſt the next <hi>Friday,</hi> Printed Bills ſet up, to call all the company together againe, and hereby the Speakers, and many of the Noble Lords and Gentlemen compelled to flie, ſo that they could not with ſafetie of their lives attend the publique ſerieve; this you know was the Originall. Secondly,</p>
            <p>Conſider the perſons that were ingaged in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">2</note> for a new warre. <note place="margin">The perſons ingaged in the preparation of a new war.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the Honorable Houſes tooke both conſcience and honour engaged to have this vindicated, and their ſafety provided for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114446:13"/>
The Generall and Officers of the Army hearing of the <note place="margin">2</note> violence that was offered to the Parliament, reſolved to enable the Parliament to call it to an accompt, or they would periſh in it; and thereupon the Army that was ſcattered almoſt 200. Miles, within the ſpace of one weeke, was brought together to a Randezvouz, which was within a few houres march of the Citie of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Citie of <hi>London</hi> (not to patronize or protect the <note place="margin">3</note> inſolencie offered againſt the Parliament for multitudes of them profeſſe and proteſt an abhorrencie of it; but) apprehending that the Army would come, and either plunder them, or give Lawes to them, are preſently upon their preparation for defence; the Army on the other ſide looking upon the Cities preparation, judge that the Citie was reſolved to protect this Inſolency, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany that was committed, thus both make all poſſible preparations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, take in the propinquitie of it, how neere this was to execution, ſo neere that I am perſwaded moſt <note place="margin">3</note> men that looked upon it, did (as to the judgement of <note place="margin">The neareneſſe of our danger.</note> man) conclude it unavoydable; wee muſt now daſh one upon another; ſo neere, that the very night before the day, wherein we might have been embrewitg our hands in one anothers blood, there appeared no probability of right underſtanding between the two differing parties: ſo neer, that I thinke there was never any deſtructive worke ſo neere the execution, unleſſe it were the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder plot. And lo, now in this nicke of time, the Lord appeares in the Mount, the cloud breakes, the Citie will truſt the Army, they will open their works, &amp; their gates to them, the Army will truſt the Citie, they will march in peace quite thorough it, from end to end, no word, or act of hoſtilitie betweene them both; The Speakers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114446:13"/>
and the Honorable Lords and Gentlemen who were driven away returne backe, the Parliament fits in peace and ſafety, and all this preparation for war and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ends in a calme; all this hath God done, but this will yet appeare more wonderfull, if you take in the fourth conſideration, and that is,</p>
            <p>The Conſequents of it. Firſt,</p>
            <p>What would have beene, and muſt have been if <note place="margin">4.</note> God had not appeared. And Secondly, <note place="margin">The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequents that are, and I hope ſhall bee upon <note place="margin">1.</note> this his mercifull appearing for us. <note place="margin">2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequents that would have beene, my tongue <note place="margin">1.</note> cannot expreſſe, my heart cannot conceive how ſad our condition would have beene if the Lord had ſuffered this neare engagement to have been brought to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he had permitted this child of blood to have been borne, certainly either the Parliament, that hath ſo dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſtantly conſulted the good of the Kingdome, Citie, and Army, muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or the Army that hath fought ſo faithfully, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and ſucceſſefully, for Parliament, for Kingdome and Citie, muſt have been deſtroyed, or the Citie which in the worſt of our times hath ſo cordially with their ſtate and blood adhered to Parliament and Army, muſt have been deſtroyed, and in the deſtruction of any one of theſe, I am able to apprehend nothing, but the ruine and deſtruction of them all, wee ſhould have ſeene a ſad Cataſtrophy, an end of all the expected hopes, even the giving up the ghoſt of what wee have fought and contended for hitherto; wee had ſeene the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo of Reformation ſtrangled, and made an end of, we had ſeene all delivered up into the hands of that partie, that was full with the expectation of ſuch a day, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114446:14"/>
now doubted not but all muſt be in their hands, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſoone to give Lawes both to Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Citie, and Miniſters, to all godly people, by what names or titles ſoever they bee called, each ſhould bee carved out, what they would have alotted unto them. In a word, <hi>actum eſſet,</hi> there had been an end of <hi>England</hi> for any good dayes that we ſhould have hoped for; but the Lord appearing hath prevented this, and given us hopes of better things, for already wee have that wch <hi>Phinehas</hi> took as a bleſſed fruit of his Embaſſage here in my Text, <hi>We perceive this day that God is with us;</hi> This day have we a further pledge that God is not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> not weary of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London,</hi> not weary of the Army, but his interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thus ſeaſonably to take weapons out of their hands, ſhews us new evidence of his watchfull eye, of his carefull heart, to doe good to us all, gives us a further proof that he hath waies of deliverance when wee have none; and is not that a bleſſed conſequence? and this likewiſe we ſee already, that the Parliament not only ſits in peace and ſafety, but hath an opportunity put into their hands to ſend ſome timely ſuccors to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that our Brethren there may have cauſe to bleſſe God with us, and for us, and to ſettle and make a comfortable cloſe of the long calamities of <hi>England,</hi> and the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, City and Army come to a better underſtanding each of other: there may be ſuch conſequences and fruit of it, if God pleaſe to bleſſe and guide the Parliament, to improve it, that the generations to come ſhall have great cauſe to praiſe God for appearing upon that day, when he kept his people from imbruing in one anothers blood. Now, Honourable and Beloved, is not this a mercy worthy of acknowledgments have we not cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114446:14"/>
to ſay this day, Loe, <hi>This is our God, and we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; this is our God, we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation:</hi> hath not the Lord done very mercifully, when as beyond our expectation hee hath put this ſong of Praiſe into our mouths? whereas this day we might have all been flying into caves or deſerts, or ſeeing our deareſt friends blood pouring out, and our ſelves given up for a ſpoil: O if you underſtand theſe things aright, give glory to God who hath vouchſafed this Mercy to us.</p>

            <p>For all of us: Beſides all thoſe Uſes which ſhould be made of every deliverance, which are, to teach us, <note place="margin">1</note>

Had God for our ſins left us under this judgement, to help to deſtroy each other, and then the remainder of us given up into the hands of other adverſaries, they would have taught us to be at peace one with another; wee ſhould have agreed in priſons, or in baniſhment, or in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death.

            <p n="1">1 That God hath oftentimes caſt reproach upon you, and humbled you heretofore; but in this laſt abaſement, the Lord hath ſet ſuch a <hi>stigma,</hi> ſuch a mark of ſcorne, ſuffering you to bee ſpit in the face, after that manner, <hi>ſuffering the young to beare themſelves inſolently againſt the Ancient, and the baſe againſt the Honorable;</hi> that I cannot but ſay, there was ſome high diſpleaſure of God, either to your perſons, or to the Kingdome whom you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or both: I doe therefore moſt humbly pray you, that you would ſearch your own hearts, and enquire
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114446:15"/>
whether there be not ſome cauſe why our gracious God did thus abaſe you; certainly a Father uſes not to ſpit in the face of his Childe, if there bee not ſome ſpeciall cauſe for it: And I cannot think that the Lord would ever have let ſuch an ignominious act, that carryes ſo much abomination in the face of it, to bee offer'd to a Parliament, if he would not thereby put them to ſearch for ſomewhat, for which they ought to lay themſelves low in ſecret before him: When <hi>Shimei</hi> did curſe and revile <hi>David, David</hi> preſently reflected upon himſelf, <hi>So-let him curſe, ſince God bids him curſe David;</hi> hee preſently remembred how hee had diſhonored God in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and therefore looked at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as righteouſly inflicted by the hand of God, how culpable-ſoever <hi>Shimei</hi> was in it. I commend it to your ſerious thoughts, whether as men, or Parliament-men, or whether as Houſes of Parliament, the honour and glory of God have not been ſlighted by you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath ſuffered this ſlight and ſcorn to bee caſt upon you; enquire whether there bee not as much cauſe, why the God of heaven let this reproach bee caſt upon you, as you have to appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to enquire who they were that have done it; I blame not your care in that, but I humbly pray that you would be carefull of this. As I would fain have you learn ſomewhat from the diſgrace which God caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: So,</p>
