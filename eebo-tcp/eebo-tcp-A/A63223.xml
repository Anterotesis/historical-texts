         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the 24th of <hi>April</hi> 1678. there was a very great Conſult of a numerous company of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits

                  </gap>tion was
then determined of bringing this Plot to its accompliſhment. To this Conſult we ſhall
make it appear, that the Gentlemen at the Bar were privy and conſenting to it. The
King muſt die that is reſolved on, and you have hea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n there was a third
Sort, (for they did invent all the imaginable ways of death) and that was Poyſoning;
that &amp; will come principally before you at this time. And they had choſen out a very

               <p>We ſhall prove to you that this was his Bargain, that part of his Wages he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,

ſhall make it appear, Gentlemen, that he was privey alſo to the Conſult (for I apply my

that of money, he was to be preferred to be Phyſitian General of the Army that was
then to be raiſed, that Employment was deſigned for him, nay he accepted of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
as we ſhall endeavour to prove to you:</p>
               <p>We ſhall alſo prove, that the other Gentlemen at the Bar, the other male<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>actors
that ſtand there, were privy to the great Conſult of the death of the King. That

were the great Engineers, yet all other Orders were to contribute, and <hi>6000l.</hi> was
to be furniſhed by them. And in the courſe of our Evidence we ſhall give you ſeveral
inſtances which will concernall theſe particular Priſoners now at the Bar; and one
truly that there was ſuch a deſign of Poyſoning, which is very remarkable and that
was from a very great Engineer that hath ſuffered already, and that was Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and wherein <hi>I</hi> muſt deſire that you would obſerve another thing that falls out very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,
that though Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> at the time of his Death, and all along diſowned that
he was here in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and with great Aſſeverations did affirm it; it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the courſe of our Evidence that he was here in <hi>London</hi> then, and had frequently
diſcourſes that it was an eaſie matter to take off the King by Poyſon: And for that
purpoſe do I mention it to you as an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ance that poyſon was one of the great ways
that they intended to murther the King by. And Gentlemen you will collect from
that Evidence what credit is fit to be given to the words of ſuch dying men, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

thoſe whoſe concern it is for more reaſons then one to perſwade the People that they

was to kill the King; and to that purpoſe, there were ſeveral Letters ſent weekly
into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and very often directed by the Cover to him, wherein were ſeven

ſayes there was a fourth, there was not. Dr <hi>Oates</hi> told you as much as he knew of the
matter but he does not undertake to give you an accompt of all the Plot or Plotters in
this affair. <hi>It</hi> you make any Reaſonable objection againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Teſtimony I
will allow it, but theſe inferences I muſt not. That this is a ſtrange ſtory of <hi>Mr. Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>'s,
becauſe tis not part of <hi>Oates</hi> Diſcovery, is that a reaſonable objection? But then
for the latter part, that <hi>Dr. Oates</hi> ſays the King was to have been killed in <hi>July</hi> or
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> therefore what ſhould they think of killing him in <hi>October;</hi> he tells you that in
<hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> they did engage him in the general Plot, and firſt then be inſtrumental

thoſe Queſtions, make your own Obſervations upon them in private to your ſelves,

Council ſhall have done their Evidence: but now to make theſe inferences, will do
you little Services, and can't be permitted:</p>

of milk in the morning, and a pint of milk at night, and ſhould drink no morning
draughts but milk, and that he ſhould have one hundred ſtroaks at the <hi>Bath</hi> at the
Pump, I do not ſo well underſtand what that means, but I ſuppoſe the Court doth,
but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe were the words of the Inſtructions. In this letter Sir <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
did write, that the Queen would aſſiſt him to poyſon the King, and this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was brought by a meſſenger to maſter <hi>Aſhby.</hi> Within a day or two after I ſaw
Mr. <hi>Aſhby</hi> and Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar (he was ſo called) but
I had no acquaintance with him, but juſt the ſight of him) I ſaw him ſit in a writing

Eſtate, and that ſhe would not endure theſe Violations of her Bed any longer, and

when they came out, I deſired that I might ſee the Queen, and ſo when I came in I
had, as I believe, from her a gracious ſmile. Now if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, while

               <p>I will tell your Lordſhip how: There was a Meeting of the Fathers for
this very purpoſe to treat with Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> before <hi>Aſhby</hi> went to the Bath, &amp;
there being a meeting they did break this buſineſs to him; but what preamble they
made to it I cannot remember. My Lord, as for the other Priſoners at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—</hi>

               <p>But before you go from this matter, you ſay you know not how they brought
it in, but they brought it in ſome way, he was to meet with them to that purpoſe, and
there <hi>Aſhby</hi> did tell him he ſhould have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> What Anſwer made he to it?</p>

excuſe me from ſtaying any further Examination, and being ſo ill and indispoſed for
want of reſt, in reſpect both of my Intellectuals, and every thing elſe, I might not charge
him ſo home, but now I have a proper light whereby I may ſee a mans face, I can ſay

               <p>He is a Benedictine Monk, or at leaſt-wiſe a Lay-brother. And he was
privy to this Conſult in which the 6000 <hi>l.</hi> was agreed to be paid and given, and <hi>I</hi> do
judge he did conſent to it, for he did pray God that it might have good ſucceſs, and
that the Catholick Cauſe might once again flouriſh in <hi>England.</hi>

VVith that <hi>Harcourt</hi> went to his Cabinet and took out five or ſix Papers, and brought
a ſmall Bill, and asked Sir <hi>George Wakeman;</hi> ſaid he, Sir <hi>George,</hi> how are you provided?
ſaid Sir <hi>George, I</hi> have been ready long ſince, but you have not been ſo punctual with
me: But what have you there? ſaid <hi>Harcourt, I</hi> have a Bill of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> From whom,

ſuch an One, which he ſaid was by the Queen's Order, and that he had it from Her.
This Bill is charged upon ſuch a Goldſmith, and named him, he dwelt ſomewhere about
St. <hi>Dunſtan's</hi> Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, but I can't remember his name, I'le tell you by and by why I
think he dwelt there. Aſſoon as Sir <hi>Geo.</hi> had read it, 'tis well ſaid he, if it be accepted,
I find more incouragement from my good Lady and Miſtriſs, than from any of you all.
They had ſome little more diſcourſe, and Sir <hi>George</hi> asked of <hi>Harcourt</hi> who <hi>I</hi> was; ſaid
he, 'tis a Friend that hath been long engaged in our buſineſs, and is to do the next great
work to Yours. VVell ſaid Sir <hi>George, I</hi> will go and ſee if the Bill be accepted, and you
ſhall hear of me to night; and accordingly he did go. <hi>I</hi> did not ſtay but a very little
time after him, and therefore <hi>I</hi> Collect he could not go far to get the Bill accepted: for
<hi>I</hi> did croſs Lincoln-Inn Fieids and came down a Lane by Temple-Bar, and between the
Queens Head and Chancery Lane end <hi>I</hi> met with Sir <hi>George Wakeman:</hi> ſaid <hi>I,</hi> have
you been with your Bill already, and is it accepted? yes ſaid he, 'tis accepted: and
when is it to be paid? <hi>I</hi> am to go, ſaid he, in the Afternoon to receive it.</p>

it, I was ſo cautious, but in the hearing and company of a Juſtice of Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I went away before they had called him down, and I went to ſee if the Houſe of
Commons were ſitting; and when I came back, Sir W. <hi>VValler</hi> was juſt coming thither,

common Room, and there was Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> with the Keeper, and I was in no other Room,
but the common Room. And Sir W. <hi>VValler</hi> withdrew to the end of the Room while
I asked him ſome Queſtions; and pray will you pleaſe to ask Sir W. <hi>Waller</hi> whether I
did not call him by his name as ſoon as I ſaw him?</p>

               <p>Call, Mr. <hi>Chapman,</hi> (which was done.) <hi>My</hi> Lord there was
a Letter or Note of Directions from me to mr. <hi>Aſhby,</hi> and 'tis affirmed by maſter
<hi>Oates,</hi> that in that letter I ſhould let maſter <hi>Aſhby</hi> know I did approve well of
the Propoſals that were made to me to poyſon the King, and that the Queen would
aſſiſt me in it, and that in the ſame letter there were directions given what he ſhould
take, and how many ſtrokes of the Pump he ſhould make uſe of, and ſeveral other
things fit for a Phyſician to direct his Patient in. Now, my Lord, I will prove
by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Gentleman maſter <hi>Chapman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> who is Mayor of <hi>Bath,</hi> that he received this
very Note from maſter <hi>Aſhby,</hi> that he read it from the beginning to the end of
it; that there was no word in it, or mention of the King or Queen in the whole let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
unleſs it be of the King or Queens <hi>Bath.</hi> And, my Lord, I think he hath a piece
of this letter ſtill, that part that was the Phyſical part he tore off, and kept himſelf:
Now 'tis none of my hand, I never writ a letter to <hi>Aſhby</hi> upon any occaſion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and I will tell your Lordſhip how it came to paſs, I did not write that letter,
I hope by a Providence, for I never but uſed to write my Phyſical Directions with my
own hand. It happened that I came home late, and I was very ill; <hi>Aſhby</hi> ſent to me
for his Note, becauſe he was to go out of Town the next morning; being weary and
indiſpoſed, I laid me down on the Couch, and ſent for my man, who is an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
now, and is the better able to write ſuch a letter; I dictated the letter to him,
all my Family, and all that were by, can teſtifie the ſame; he knows very well my
hand and hath part of it to produce; for when the Queen was there, <hi>I</hi> made uſe of
him for my Apothecary, and thoſe Phyſical directions <hi>I</hi> ſent down for the <hi>Bath, I</hi>
ſent always to him. He is a very good witneſs as to my hand.</p>

left on the Table, and the Ink as not dry, a Phyſical Bill, which was the ſame hand

from Mr. <hi>White</hi> to Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> at Saint <hi>Omers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in which Letter he writ word, that
Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> had undertaken the poyſoning of the King, and was to have
15000 <hi>l.</hi> for it; of which 5000 <hi>l.</hi> had been paid him by the hands of <hi>Coleman.</hi> Sir
<hi>George Wakeman</hi> upon this was called in, and told of this Accuſation, he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
all, and did indeed carry himſelf as if he were not concerned at the Accuſation,
but did tell the King and Councel he hoped he ſhould have reparation and ſatisfaction
for the injury done to his Honour. His Carriage was not well liked of by the King and
Council, and being and matter of ſuch conſequence as this was, they were willing to
know further of it; and becauſe they thought this Evidence not proof enough to give
them occaſion to commit him, being only out of Letter of the third perſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they called in Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> again, and my Lord Chancellor deſired Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to
tell him if he knew nothing perſonally of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> becauſe they were in a

                  </gap>meut; and deſired ſufficient proof whereupon to ground a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> when he did come in again, and was asked the queſtion, did lift up
his hands (for I muſt tell the truth let it be what it will) and ſaid, No, God forbid
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35708:27"/>
that I ſhould ſay any thing againſt Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> for I know nothing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Letter, I replied, I had it by Report, that Sir <hi>George</hi> had received 5000 <hi>l.</hi> of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

               <p>Truly, my Lord, I can't remember that there was any ſuch Letter
mentioned. <hi>I</hi> tell you what <hi>I</hi> do remember; and afterwards becauſe he came and
gave this Depoſition before the Lords and Commons, that he found ſuch a Letter
upon the Table from Sir <hi>George</hi> to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> indeed <hi>I</hi> did very much wonder at it, and
it made me reflect upon that other paſſage at the Council, of his denying to accuſe
Sir <hi>George</hi> further, and it hath been in my mind ever ſince.</p>

               <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> believe Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> is miſtaken, but however <hi>I</hi> was ſo
weak; and the King and Council were ſo ſenſible of it, that the King himſelf hád like

               <p>You have taken a great confidence, I know not by what Authority, to ſay
any thing of any body. But this is naturally true, That when the Council were offended
at the carriage of Sir G. <hi>Wakeman</hi> at the Board, and therefore ſent for Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
doubting in themſelves whether what they had would be ſufficient to commit
him; for indeed it was not only a wild thing, of what was mentioned in a Letter of
a third perſon's, that Sir <hi>George</hi> had accepted of Fifteen thouſand pounds, and received
the five; therefore ſaid they, we will know of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſome more particulars, and
ſent for him in again, and asked him, Do you know any thing of your own knowledge?
if he had come in then and ſaid, Yes, I have ſeen a Letter ſubſcribed under <hi>Sir George
Wakeman's</hi> hand, would not they have committed him? ſurely they would. And
now the Council's not committing him, is an Argument, that they had not ſufficient
Evidence, and <hi>Oates</hi> did omit at that time to charge him with this Letter.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but this is now what the Clerk writes down as minutes. 'Tis an hard

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lydcott,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in ſome places, 'Tis <hi>Titus Oates</hi> ſet in diverſe places as his hand to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations.</p>

               <p>This is the Objection, it will be hard, that if a Clerk takes the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Oates,</hi> or any one elſe, and takes them as near as he can, but he never ſubſcribes
it; and you prove only 'tis a Copy of what the Clerk wrote, That cannot be allowed

               <p>My Lord, I will give you a brief Account of it; I leave it to
you, whether I behaved my ſelf i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſelf more ſubmiſſively; there was nothing of Duty wanting in my mind, but <hi>I</hi> will
give you an account of what <hi>I</hi> ſaid Verbatim. My Lord Chancellor told me, that <hi>I</hi>
was accuſed of the blackeſt of Crimes; that <hi>I</hi> had undertaken to poiſon the King. <hi>I</hi>
asked him who was my Accuſer, he pointed to <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi> and told me Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was
my Accuſer. Says I, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> do you know me? Did you ever ſee me before? Mr.
<hi>Oates</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſaid no. Why then ſaid <hi>I,</hi> how come you to be my Accuſer. Said he, I will
tell you; <hi>I</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> where there was a Conſult of the Jeſuits, at which Mr.
<hi>Aſhby</hi> the Rector of the Colledge at St. <hi>Omers</hi> did preſide; And in that Conſult it
was debated who was the fittèſt perſon for that horrid undertaking of Poiſoning the
King, and unanimouſly it was agreed upon at that Conſult, that you were; Sir <hi>George
Wakeman</hi> by Name: and now he ſays it was debated here in <hi>England.</hi> Then, my Lord,
ſaid <hi>I</hi> to my Lord Chancellor, here is no proof, therefore I hope there is no need of
any Defence. Said he, there is no Smoak but there is ſome Fire. My Lord, ſaid I,
if you underſtand by that, there can be no Accuſation without ſome Guilt, I ſhould
be ſorry I ſhould not underſtand both ſacred and prophane Hiſtory, better than to
think ſo. Then he preſſed me to know what I could ſay for my ſelf. Said I, My
Lord, <hi>I</hi> come of a loyal Family, my Father hath ſuffered very much to the value of
Eighteen Thouſand Pounds and more for the Royal Family. My Brother raiſed a
Troop of Horſe for the King, and ſerved him from the beginning of the War to the
end. He was Major to the Marques of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> at <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight, and loſt his Life
by the wounds he received in the Kings Service. As for my own part, ſaid I, I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
very young, and came over when <hi>Ireton</hi> was Lord Mayor, and both by my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35708:30"/>
and my Name, was ſuſpected to be a Favourer of the Royal Party, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was impriſoned, &amp; did not come out till I had given great Security: and the ſecond
time I was committed, was, when I entred into a Plot the only Plot I was guilty of,
I conſpired with Captain <hi>Lucy,</hi> and ſeveral others to attempt ſomething for His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Reſtauration, when few durſt appear for him. I wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ized on in my Bed; there
were ſeveral Arms found in my Apothecaries Cellar, and we were both committed to
Priſon; and we ſhould both have ſuffered Death certainly if his Majeſties happy Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had not prevented it. When my Lord preſt me ſtill to ſay what <hi>I</hi> could ſay
for my ſelf, as to what was charged on me; <hi>I</hi> told him, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> am under the
moſt foul and falſe Accuſation that ever innocent Gentleman was, and <hi>I</hi> expect Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and upon that they were offended, and <hi>I</hi> was bid to withdraw. And <hi>I</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this beſide, my Lord, that there was not a Family in <hi>England</hi> that was ſo much
inſtrumental in his Majeſties Reſtoration as that Family was; that Collonel <hi>Charles
Gifford</hi> was my near Kinſman, ſo was Collonel <hi>Carlos;</hi> and that the <hi>Pendrels</hi> were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Servants to the Family, and <hi>I</hi> hope they deſerve ſome favour.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I hope the Court will not require that I ſhould bring any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Evidence in Confutation of what is here alledged againſt me; for, before I
came to this Bar, I did not know any particular Accuſation that was againſt me; and
therefore I could not be ready to anſwer it, and ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e my Defence, or bring particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Witneſſes to evidence, and ſhew my innocency. Beſides, my Lord, it is a known
general maxim, That a poſitive Aſſertion is as eaſie to be made, as to prove a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
is oft-times hard, if not impoſſible. Men may eaſily deviſe Crimes, and frame
Accuſations againſt innocent men in ſuch a manner that the contrary cannot poſſibly be
demonſtrated. No mortal man can tell where he was, and what he did and ſaid eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day and hour of his whole life. Therefore I think; tis not only poſitive bare ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but 'tis probable ſwearing, that muſt render a man Guilty of a Crime. Otherwiſe
my Lord, it would be lawful, and in the power of <hi>Oates</hi> and his Companions here, to
hang by turns, upon bare Oath, all the innocent men in the whole Nation, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo innocent, and that for Crimes never ſo ridiculous and abſurd. And I ſay this
further, he that ſwears againſt another, Firſt, ought to be himſelf a credible Witneſs:
And then ſecondly, ſtrengthened by probable Circumſtances; Circumſtances that bring:

of a Quartane Ague that I had, and I went over to <hi>France;</hi> othewiſe during all that

               <p>Truly my Lord, what I have to ſay for my ſelf is this. About a month ago
<hi>I</hi> was told the time of my Tryal was at hand, and being then full of good hope, I did
endeavour to provide for it, and I had a great confidence my Lord that it would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
but truly upon the ill ſucceſs of the late Tryals, either my hope or my heart failed
me, and I did reſolve to caſt my ſelf upon God and his providence, and however my
ſilence might have bin interpreted, I did reſolve with ſilence and ſubmiſſion to reſign
up my ſelf to whatſoever your Lordſhip and the worthy Jury ſhould be pleaſed to
decree upon me. But my Lord, ſince your Lordſhip is pleaſed to fling forth
ſome encouragement, and to hang out the white Flagg of Hope, for your Lordſhip hath
been pleaſed to uſe many gracious expreſſions, and ſo my Lord upon this I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my former determination now en<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eavour to make defence for my life as well
as <hi>I</hi> can: But my Lord not being ſo well able to do it, or of ſo quick capacity as that
learned and wiſe Council which we have here of Counſel for us, to wit, the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Bench of Judges, for upon inquiry why by law we were allowed no Council, I
was told that the whole Bench of Judges were alwayes of Counſel for the priſoner,
and indeed they look upon it as an obligation upon them as far as Truth and Juſtice
will permit them to plead for us, Now my Lord with an humble heart I would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
ſome heads of defence to this Learned, wiſe and Honourable Council, and leave it
to them to manage my cauſe for me according to T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uth and Juſtice, which they are
better able to do for me than I for my ſelf. My Lord, I have I thank God no ſpleen nor
hatred in my heart againſt the worſt of my Enemies, nor ſhall be deſirous of Revenge, I
leave them and their proceedings to God; neither am I willing to charge mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and
mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> with worſe than the neceſſity of my defence will occaſion me to ſay of them.
Now my Lord the beſt of men may be miſtaken in a perſon, and if I prove mr, <hi>Oates</hi> is
miſtaken in the perſon in me, then I charge mr. <hi>Oa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> with no great crime, &amp; yet make my

will appear my great advocate, and what <hi>I</hi> ſuggeſt in a few heads you will <hi>I</hi> hope
put it into a method, and manage it better than I can my ſelf. My Lord, when <hi>I</hi> was
firſt brought before Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> (as truly all that were with me do know) I carried my
ſelf with a great deal of courage and confi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Lord, when I cam to ſearch the houſe <hi>I</hi> placed one at the door,
and him I ordered to let whoever would come in, but no perſon whatſoever go out,

I ſuppoſe, of any perſon ſearching in the houſe; for when the door was opened and
he let in and underſtood it, he preſently endeavoured to get away again.</p>

               <p>By your favour, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> am very Ioath to contradict what Sir <hi>William
VValler</hi> ſays in any thing, <hi>I</hi> would willingly believe him a juſt perſon that would ſay
nothing but the truth; but God Almighty is my Witneſs that I never knocked, the
door was open, and <hi>I</hi> came in of my own accord both in at the firſt and ſecond doors
this the Conſtable will teſtifie.</p>

               <speaker>Marſhal.</speaker>
               <p>I will give you better proof of it: While they were ſearching in an interior
Roem (&amp; this is well known by them all that were there) <hi>I</hi> was in an outward Room
by my ſelf this Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> knows, and when they came back and found me
there, the Conſtable and the reſt wondered I was not gone. I was left alone by the
door by my ſelf, the outward door I found open, and there is another door which
leads out into an Alley, which any man can open in three minutes time, and I know
how to do it. Now I could not learn it ſince I was taken, for I have not been permitted
to go abroad, but been under cloſe Confinement. But if it be worth the while, and you
will give me leave to go there, <hi>I</hi> can ſhew you how 'tis opened in leſs time than I can
ſpeak three words.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Would you have the Jury ſtay here while you go and ſhew us

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marſhal.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſay, if it were worth the while, that it might be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that if I would go away <hi>I</hi> could, but I did not get away, but ſtayed with a great
deal of confidence, my Lord; therefore I urge this to the point, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.
After I had been there a while before Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> wiſhed
me to withdraw, and after I had been abſent a while and came back again, Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

I did not then well underſtand the meaning of it. But afterwards Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
out of his great Civility came to ſee me at the Gatehouſe, and brought with him two
very worthy perſons, Sir <hi>Philip Mathews</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cutler.</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Mathews</hi>
upon diſcourſe hearing me declare that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was a perfect ſtranger to me, ſaid,
That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in teſtimony that he knew me, had given ſuch a certain mark behind

                  <hi>Philip Matthews,</hi> if he pleaſed to pluck off my Periwig, he ſhould
ſee whether there was any ſuch mark or no; but he being an extraordinary civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
told me, he would not give me the trouble. I deſire Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to declare now
before-hand what that mark was behind my head, and if there be ſuch a mark, 'tis
ſome Evidence that his Teſtimony is true; but if there be no ſuch, then it will appear to
this Honourable Court and the Jury, that he did not know me, but was miſtaken in the

made Saints as <hi>Coleman</hi> is ſuppoſed to be there is an end of all your Arguments. There
is a God, you ſay, and you think we ſhall go to that God becauſe he hath given us
the power, we can let our ſelves in &amp; turn the Key upon Hereticks. So that if they Kill a
King, and do all the wickedneſs they can deviſe, they ſhall go to heaven at laſt: for you
have a trick, either you can directly pardon the killing of a King, or if you Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
him he is no King, and ſo you may Kill him if it be for the advancement
of Religion. But it will be in vain for you or any Prieſt in <hi>England</hi> to deny this, becauſe
we know you Print it and publickly own it, and no body was ever yet puniſhed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch Doctrine as this. Therefore all your doings being accompanied with ſuch equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
and arts as your Religion is made up of, 'tis not any of your Rhetorick can
make you be believed, I do believe it is poſſible for an Atheiſt to be a Papiſt, but 'tis
hardly poſſible for a knowing Chriſtian to be a Chriſtian and a Papiſt. 'Tis hardly
poſſible for any man of underſtanding, ſetting aſide the prejudices of Education to be a

Your doctrine is a doctrine of blood &amp; cruelty, Chriſts Doctrine is a Law of mercy,
ſimplicity, gentleneſs, meekneſs and obedience; but you have nothing but all the Pride
that ever a Pope can uſurp over Princes: and you are fill'd with pride, and mad till you

               <p>Look you Gentlemen of the Jury, here are four Priſoners; as to one of them,
that is <hi>Rumley,</hi> the truth of it is, there is but one Witneſs againſt him; and by the Law
there ought to be two; ſo I cannot ſay, but you ought to diſcharge him: we do not
find, that there is teſtimony ſufficient according to the Law to condemn him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ought to acquit him. As to the reſt, here is Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Marſhall;</hi> there hath been two ſorts of Evidence given, I will repeat them as
well as I can, and as ſhort as I can. There hath been a general Evidence, and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Evidence: there was a general Evidence given by Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> of the Plot in
general, and by <hi>Mr. Prance,</hi> and ſomething of intimation by <hi>Mr. Jenniſon.</hi> Theſe of
<hi>Dugdale, Prance</hi> and <hi>Jenniſon</hi> do not mention ſo much as the names of the three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
that are up in their lives; but Ile tell you why it was neceſſary, and anſwers a
great Objection that they ſeem to make: for you are to believe men ſay they, and to
believe men upon probable Circumſtances, ſomething to guide you beſides the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs
of an Oath, and that is well enough ſaid. Now here is ſomething beſides and
that is the Plot; that there was a Conſpiracy to introduce Popery by the likelieſt
means, which was to kill the King; and that ſuch people as theſe men were to do it,
now that there was ſuch a general deſign to do it is a circumſtantial Evidence (as to
theſe men, I call it ſo.) And theſe are Circumſtances which may anſwer the Objection
they make, when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Oath that there was a Plot. The Teſtimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> does go more particularly
to the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> which I would obſerve by the way for the ſake of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that ſtands ſo much upon the innocency of thoſe men, and would have them to
be believed upon their own aſſertions, becauſe he ſays they dare not dye with a lye in
their mouths. I believe it is notorious enough, Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> that comes here is a man
of Quality, and one againſt whom there is no objection, and he is juſtified by one or
two more. He ſays he ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when he to his death took
upon him to avert he was then in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and brought ſeveral of his own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
who would outface it to the Court that he kept them company ſo many days and
was in the Country all the while. There was a Maid before this that came and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that ſhe ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; ſaw him at his own door in <hi>Aug.</hi> but this Gentleman comes
and proves it upon him more particularly, and tells you when the day of the week and
of the month that he was with him at his own lodging, that night he came from <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>
that he was pulling off his Boots, and pretended to come Poſt from <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> &amp;
ſo that he was in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> is true, becauſe he came th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

conſtantly denied that he was here, &amp; that may ſerve for the integrity even of their dying
Oaths. And you are not going according to your own Doctrine ſo immediately to
hell, I hope you ſuppoſe a Purgatory where you may be purged from ſuch Peccadellos
as this of dying with a Lye in your mouths. As for the teſtimony of the particular
evidence, firſt againſt Sir <hi>G. Wakeman</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, he ſaw a Letter ſubſcribed <hi>George
Wakeman,</hi> and it was writ to Mr. <hi>Aſhby,</hi> and therein among other expreſſions was this
particular, That the Queen would aſſiſt him to kill the King. He was asked how he knew
it was his hand, he ſaid he had never ſeen his hand before, but afterwards he ſaw him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>iting (as he thinks writing) in a writing poſture, and there he looked upon that P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

when he was gone from it while it was wet, and that Character to his thinking was
juſt the character of the letter. Now I muſt obſerve this to you. Firſt, ſuppoſing it to be
true, yet it is ſome what hard for a man that had never known a mans hand in his life,
to ſee a hand to day, and ſometime after to come and ſee his hand to a Bill of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and to recollect the Character ſo much backward as to know this is that or that
mans hand that I ſaw before. 'Tis one thing to know hands we are uſed to, but 'tis
another thing if we ſee a hand that we never ſaw before in our lives, and then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
at another time, and by compariſon of hands to ſay this is the ſame, that is hard,
but that is ſuppoſing it to be true. Sir <hi>G. Wakem.</hi> as all people will that are accuſed,
does deny the fact, &amp; ſays there was no ſuch thing. Againſt him beſides he ſays he ſaw in
a Book that the Jeſuit Prieſts kept among them of their tranſactions and affairs, he
ſaw in <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber a Book wherein was written. <hi>This day</hi> (and there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

<hi>for 15000l. to which he conſented,</hi> and under was written, <hi>Received 5000l. part of 15000l.
by Order of</hi> Mr. Coleman, George Wakeman. This he ſays he ſaw, and he believes that
to be the very ſame hand that he ſaw before, ſo it is by a compariſon of hands. He does
not charge Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> to the beſt of my memory, with any poſitive thing of his own
knowledg more than as I tell you of this matter.</p>

There is an additional Evidence againſt Sir <hi>George Walkeman</hi> by <hi>Bedloe:</hi> He ſays he
ſaw him have a Note for <hi>2000l.</hi> which was ſaid came from the Queen, there were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of Doubtfull words, but whether they be plain enough to ſatisfie your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
when men are upon their Lives, I leave to you. That Sir G. <hi>Wakeman,</hi>
ſhould ſay, <hi>Are you ready for me, why am I dril'd on thus in a matter of this concern.</hi> This
he would have to imploy the poiſoning of the King, but there is but one thing that
ſounds any thing plain to the matter, and that was this ſaid he, if they miſs (ſpeaking
of Killing the King) if they miſs at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and you miſs your Way, then it ſhall be
done at <hi>New-Market.</hi> This he did ſwear directly, and then Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> repli'd
he would be ready. Now if you believe this, then there are two witneſſes againſt Sir
<hi>G. Wakeman,</hi> for the matter of the Bill alone would do nothing. But when he ſays he ſaw
ſuch a Bill it muſt be for ſomething, and if he did ſay ſo, if they miſs Killing him at
<hi>Windſor,</hi> and you miſs your way we will do it at <hi>New-Market,</hi> and he replyed, <hi>I</hi> will
be ready, <hi>the thing is made plain;</hi> I leave it to you, and this is all the Evidence againſt
Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> as I remember. <hi>I</hi> hope my Brothers if they remember more will
repeat it to you. <hi>I</hi> cannot undertake to repeat every word, I remember ſo much as is

               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Corker, Oates</hi> ſays that he ſaw a Letter under his hand, that is, his name
<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe was to it, wherein he conſented to the raiſing the <hi>6000l.</hi> which was to be
raiſed out of the <hi>Benedict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do not find that he does prove that he did know Mr. <hi>Corkers</hi> Hand. And he ſays of him
further, he was their preſident, and ſo it was neceſſary to have his conſent for the raiſing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

the Murdering of the King; for ſaid he, he is a man that waits at the Altar, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you ſhould chooſe ſome fitter perſon. For that, ſays Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi> which he ſays,
that I was preſident, I was not Preſident, and he makes it neceſſary for me to ſet my
hand, becauſe <hi>I</hi> being preſident it was ſuppoſed it could not be done without me, and
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> does intend ſuch a thing by his inforcing of it too: but he does produce to
you two or three witneſſes that do ſay Mr. <hi>Stapelton</hi> hath been Preſident for 4 or 5
years; and ſaid he, if I were not Preſident, what needs all this ado about my conſent,
ſo he contradicts him in that particular that he was not Preſident, and it is not only a
bare immaterial thing, becauſe his being Preſident made his hand more neceſſary to
the raiſing the <hi>6000l.</hi> And for that matter of his ſaying that he did except againſt
<hi>Pickering,</hi> and they might have choſe another, he does not charge him to be actually
at the conſultation, but he ſays he knew of it, becauſe he ſaid <hi>Pickering</hi> was not a fit
man to do it. And he ſaid they had better chooſe a Lay-man. He proves no fact but
only theſe words. And Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he ſpeaks againſt him, and what he ſays is rather
leſs then what <hi>Oates</hi> ſays. For tis that he talked with Le <hi>Fever</hi> the Prieſt about the
Plot in general words. It may be, he was talking with ſome body elſe, and yet he
could hear that they talked together in general about it, that is all againſt him.</p>
               <p>Againſt Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> tis rather leſs then againſt <hi>Corker,</hi> that is that he did conſent to
the <hi>6000l.</hi> that ſhould be raiſed among the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> he being a <hi>Benedictine</hi> too, and
that he took exceptions againſt <hi>Pickering</hi> as <hi>Corker</hi> did, that it was not convenient to
employ him in Killing the King. And this is that <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, and that he was a Carrier
of Letters up and down, and a Factor that way. And <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſays, that he knew that he
carried Letters, and was at the Conſult where they were read and anſwered, and
when they asked him where, he ſaid at the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Convent in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> And
names in particular a Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Radcliffe,</hi> and that there was a diſcourſe
concerning the Plot in his hearing.</p>
               <p>They ſay for themſelves, they cannot anſwer any more then by Circumſtances, tis a
very ſtrange thing, if Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> knew this of us, why did not he take us before? And ſays
Sir. G. <hi>Wakeman,</hi> why did not he accuſe me of this Letter that he talks of before the
King and Council. He makes an Anſwer which to me indeed is a very faint one, as if he
were ſo weak and tired that he could not ſpeak any word farther. When the Council
asked Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> what he had to ſay for himſelf, and he behaved himſelf
ruggedly, they call for <hi>Oates</hi> again; what, ſaid they do you know any thing of your
own knowledge? No ſaid he, God forbid, I know nothing more as Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi>
ſays, and as the matter ſpeaks: for if he had charged him that he had ſeen that letter,
the Lords would infallibly have committed him. If he had but ſaid, I ſaw a letter with
his Name to it, which by the Character <hi>I</hi> believe was his, becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſaw his writing
elſewhere. And tis wonderfull to me, I don't know if a man be never ſo faint,
could not he ſay, I ſaw a letter under his hand, as well as I knew nothing more of him,
there are as few words in one, as in the other. If he had ſaid <hi>I</hi> beg your Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Majeſties Pardon, <hi>I</hi> am ſo weak I cannot recollect my ſelf, it had been ſomething, but
to make a great Proteſtation that he knew nothing of him. This is that that is ſaid by
Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> on his behalf.</p>
               <p>Theſe other Gent. ſay, that <hi>Oates</hi> did not know them, and the Woman does
ſay that ſhe did tell them when they came to ſearch, that <hi>Corker</hi> and <hi>Marſhall</hi> were
there, and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and they ſaid, they had nothing to do with any but <hi>Pickering.</hi>

for them to urge. But I deal faithfully with you, I will diſcharge my own Conſcience
to you. It lies upon the Oaths of theſe two men. Tho there was a Plot in general, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
yet that does not affect theſe men in particular, but was only uſed to anſwer that
Objection, that it ſhould not be believed upon Poſitive Swearing, hand over head,
without ſomething elſe. Here was ſomething elſe, the Plot in general, and their being
Prieſts is another Circumſtance to me, who are mad to bring in Popery, and would
do any thing to get their Tyranny again eſtabliſhed amongſt us. And there is more
then probable Evidence of that I aſſure you.</p>
