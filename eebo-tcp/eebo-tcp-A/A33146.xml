            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Worthy Friend <hi>SAMUEL ADAMS</hi> OF WOLVERTON <hi>Gent.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Can't tell why an Old Friend and Kinsman, shou'd not give a Man as good a Title to a Dedication, as a fine Coat, and a great Perriwig; Two Qualities, that of late, are thought as strictly Requisite in a Fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Patron, as a Clap, and a Duel, to the compleating a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it's no wonder that our late Plays are so Barren, since we generally see our Authors reserve their Gall and Satyr, for their Dedications, where they seem to smile in the Patron's Face; and are civilly calling him Coxcomb, by a long Repetition of those Virtues, which Half the Town is heartily convinc'd, he is not the least Tainted with: And thus, (as <hi>Apelles</hi> displeas'd with his Painting an Horse's Foam, gave it the most height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Touch, by throwing his Pensil at it in a Fury) these Gentlemen that are so very tame, and civil in their Satyr, are most Satyrical in their Panegyricks, and never so compleatly show a Fop, as when they are hardest at work upon the fine Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Now, my end in sending you this Play with your Name to't, was purely to let pou see, that I still take a Pleasure in thinking of you, though at this Distance; and (if you find it worth a Room in
<pb facs="tcp:61153:3"/>
your Closet) that it might now and then, put you in Mind of the Author: Besides, I owe you many Thanks for your Care of my Brother, and wish I had a more effectual way of returning them; in the mean time, be pleas'd to take this Present in part of Payment; though I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, shou'd I be ever Paying, I shall never be out of your Debt; for even your protection of this Trifle is running on fresh Score: For, whatever Fortune <hi>Xerxes</hi> may have found in Town, I knew your Name wou'd be the surest means to give him a Favourable Reception in the Country; and though the Ladies thereabouts shou'd think it but a dull Afternoons En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in it Self; yet, if you happen to be by at the Reading, it will at least be diverting in the Consequence: For even Poetry can't make you Ill Company: They'll want no Musick between the Acts, having the Relief of your Conversation; and they must certainly be deeply in Love with something out of their reach, if that can't put 'em in Tune: For what Company, though never so dull'd, does not feel a new Life when you come into it, or is not Dead when you leave it? What Child, what Man, or (what's no little Wonder) what Woman is not pleas'd with you, which they are seldom known to be with any Man, that has so long forborn to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some one of their Sex with his Freedom? Yet so far you do Complement 'em too; Your not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, is more than a Probability, that you will never meet with an Occasion to have an Hearty Quarrel with any of them. Thus, with a little Expence of your Good Humour, you Purchase the Favour of that Sex, at the same time giving them Security, that you never
<pb facs="tcp:61153:3"/>
will be their Enemy, by Loving any one of them too well; if every ones Love be any step to Happiness, there wants but the 'tother Half of the Worlds know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, to make you the Happiest Man in it: While you are Master of such an Easie Fortune, no Wise-Man but must approve your Choice: You have Preserv'd your Liberty, and Tasted it; and how good a Friend soever you are to the Bottle, yet your worst of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can't but still own that your a Batchelor, and no Poet: You never yet were so far overtaken, that you either Married, or Writ Verses; which that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may, (without any Complement to the Ladies) is (while Yours) the Real Wish, of</p>

            <lg>
               <l>LOng have we strove, with Passion and Grimace,</l>
               <l>To show you Vice and Vertue's diff'ring Face:</l>
               <l>Vertue's Reward has woo'd you to its Charms;</l>
               <l>And Vice expos'd, shou'd laugh you from its Arms.</l>
               <l>Vertue we vainly offer to your Taste;</l>
               <l>Tir'd with Instruction, and Agog for Iest,</l>
               <l>Y' abhor the wholesome Plainness of the Feast.</l>
               <l>In vain on Pois'nous Vice wou'd Satyr trample;</l>
               <l>For what you shou'd contemn, is your Example:</l>
               <l>In vain we wear the Buskin, or the Sandal;</l>
               <l>Your judging false makes our Instruction Scandal.</l>
               <l>The Wife provok'd to wrong her Husband's Bed,</l>
               <l>Was meant his Cure, by punishing his Head:</l>
               <l>But you from hence, not kind, but jealous grow;</l>
               <l>Think all Wives false, when Usage makes 'em so:</l>
               <l>Reform the Brute, you keep the Woman true.</l>
               <l>The Powder'd Fop, for Drawling Speech, and Dress,</l>
               <l>Expos'd, shall laugh: But then so likes his Face,</l>
               <l>He dresses in the Stage's Looking-Glass.</l>
               <l>The High-kept Miss, when shewn the Fate of Iilting,</l>
               <l>Smiles! Gets a new Spark—sets Fools a Tilting.</l>
               <l>A second Time she's warn'd, and so improves,</l>
               <l>Till in due Time about the Pit she roves,</l>
               <l>Reduc'd to <hi>Doily</hi>'s Stuff, no Stays, and dirty Gloves.</l>
               <l>Thus ev'n sage <hi>Collier</hi> too might be accus'd,</l>
               <l>If what h'as writ's through Ignorance abus'd.</l>
               <l>Girls may read him, not for the Truth he says,</l>
               <l>But to be pointed to the Bawdy Plays:</l>
               <l>Far be't to think such his Intention was.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61153:4"/>
Thus ev'n sound Physick, if wrong taken, shall</l>
               <l>Inflame Diseases, which it meant to heal:</l>
               <l>Now; though Men die, Physick has Vertue still.</l>
               <l>Wou'd you but come with Minds attentive bent</l>
               <l>To laugh at Follies, Vices to resent;</l>
               <l>Warn'd by the Dangers painted, wou'd you learn</l>
               <l>To shun abroad what's here the Wise Man's Scorn;</l>
               <l>Calm would he then the Zealot's hasty Rage;</l>
               <l>And good Men, Fearless, might support the Stage:</l>
               <l>Then, as at <hi>Athens,</hi> to learn Vertue's Rules,</l>
               <l>Crowds might we hope for from deserted Schools,</l>
               <l>To see our Labours, by just Laws allow'd;</l>
               <l>And Publick Treasures pay for Publick Good:</l>
