            <title>A declaration published by Sir Thomas Middleton, Knight, Serjeant-Major-Generall, and Vice-Admirall for the sixe counties of North-Wales setting forth the illegallity and incongruity of a pernicious oath and protestation, imposed upon many peaceable subjects within the said counties (who to avoid plundering or imprisonment) were inforced to take the same : whereby the imposers of the said oath endeavour under the paine of perjury, to make the people to renounce their owne just liberties, and the benefit and protection of the knowne lawes, and to submit to a tyranicall, arbitrary, and slavish government, excerised by the commissioners of array : and likewise, setting forth the use and intentions of the forces raised for the service of the King and Parliament, under the command of the said Sir Thomas Middleton the benefit that the country shall receive by their protection, and what they are to expect that contemne their power.</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VVHich Oath is not only contrary to the known Lawes of this Realm
and Liberties of the Subjects, but alſo contrary to it ſelfe in the
whole ſubſtance thereof, laying an impoſſibility upon the takers thereof, of
performing the ſame, as may appeare by theſe enſuing Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They ſwear to defend and maintain the true Proteſtant Religion to
the utmoſt of their power, and they ſwear to aid and aſſiſt His Majeſties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(conſiſting of all the Engliſh Papiſts, and many Iriſh Rebells) againſt the
Parliaments Forces, who conſiſt all of Proteſtants, and are meerly raiſed for
the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and to ſuppreſſe thoſe Papiſts and their
adherents, who endeavour to deſtroy the ſame in this, and the Kingdome of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and are the moſt oppoſite enemies thereto of any people that profeſſe
Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſweare to maintain His Majeſties juſt Power and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives:
And they ſweare to oppoſe all perſons that derive any Authority
from both Houſes of Parliament, without His Majeſties command or conſent:
If the Contrivers of the Oath doe meane His Majeſties Royall and Regall
Command or Conſent, the Houſes of Parliament have that to warrant all
their Actions and Proceedings, as well as all other Courts of Juſtice have,
where His Majeſties Name and Command is alwayes uſed of courſe, as a
branch of the Kingly Office inſeparably annexed to the Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of every Court, as appeares by all ordinary proceſſe, and to ſay that
any Court wants that, is to deny that Court a being: But if it be meant His
Perſonall command or conſent (or rather the will of ſome prevalent Popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected perſons wreſting from Him Commands contrary to the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of His Parliament) ſuch Commands are inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive
to His Regall Office, and conſequently contrary to His juſt Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
becauſe it oppoſeth His Royall Commands (ſignified by the higheſt
Court of Iuſtice) wherein His Majeſties Regall Power and Sovereigne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
doth alwayes reſide.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They ſweare to maintaine the juſt Priviledges of Parliament, and
they ſweare to aſſiſt the Papiſts now in Arms in His Majeſties Army, contrary
to ſeverall Acts of Parliament, it being the higheſt breach of the Priviledges
of Parliament to have their Acts contemptuouſly violated (the Court ſitting)
in meere oppoſition to their Power.</p>
            <p>So that whoſoever takes that Oath, with an intent to keep the ſame, muſt
beleeve: Firſt, That the Engliſh and Iriſh Papiſts (who are in Armes and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95885:4"/>
have places of eminent Command in His Majeſties Army, and have within
leſſe then two years time almoſt quite deſtroyed the Proteſtants and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the Kingdome of Ireland) do now fight for, and endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the true Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They muſt beleeve, that ſuch perſonall Commands are wreſted
from His Majeſty by private favourites, are to be actually obeyed before and
againſt his Royall commands and Regall Authority ſignified by his Courts of
Juſtice: and that his Majeſties juſt Power and Prerogatives are not reſident
in his Courts, but in the breaſts of His Favourites.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they muſt beleeve, that to ſet in open defiance ſeverall Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
made againſt Papiſts bearing of Arms (the Parliament ſitting) in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of their Authority, is no breach of the Priviledges of Parliament. And
laſtly, They muſt ſweare, that they doe beleeve, that all the Members of both
Houſes of Parliament, (for endeavouring to put thoſe Lawes in execution, and
to preſerve themſelves and the Kingdome from the power of the Popiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
are Traitors. For if the Forces raiſed by them for that purpoſe, are
traiterouſly raiſed, it followes, that they that raiſed them are Traitors.</p>
            <p>By which Oath and Proteſtation, the ſaid Councell of War doe purpoſely
decline to make the people ſweare to maintaine the knowne Laws, and their
own juſt Liberties; and do endeavour to engage them upon paine of perjury,
to renounce their liberties, and the benefit and protection of the known Laws,
and to ſubject themſelves to ſuch a condition of ſlavery as the unlimited
and arbitrary wills of the Commiſſioners of Array would put them into, who
have already ſo farre exerciſed their illegall power over them, that the whole
Country doe groane under the burthen of their grievances, as the many heavy
and cruell taxations, the impriſoning of mens perſons, the preſſing of men
for the Wars without Authority of Parliament, and the countenancing of
Robberies under a new name of plundering.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of which Grievances and preſſures, and the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the ſaid Oath, if not timely prevented, have occaſioned this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Declaration to undeceive the people.</p>
            <p>FIrſt, That the ſaid Oath is unjuſt, deceitfull, and impoſſible to be performed,
and the people enforced to take the ſame for feare of plundering or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment:
So it bindes not the Conſcience of any man to keep it; but on the
contrary, he that endeavours to keep an unjuſt Oath, perſiſteth in ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95885:4"/>
Secondly, That the Forces raiſed by Authority of Parliament, under the
Command of Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> Knight, are neither Traiterouſly not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly
raiſed, but have His Majeſties Royall Authority for their warrant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the ſaid Forces are raiſed for the preſervation of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, His Majeſties perſon, juſt Power and Prerogative, the juſt
Priviledges of Parliament, the juſt Liberties of the Subject, and the knowne
Laws of this Kingdome; againſt thoſe Armies of Papiſts and Delinquents
within this Kingdome, who (pretending His Majeſties perſonall Commands,
as the Rebels in Ireland doe, to countenance their Rebellion) endeavour to
deſtroy the very conſtitution and being of Parliaments, and therein His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Royall Authority and the Laws of the Realme, to the end they might
avoid the juſtice of that Supream Court. And are particularly raiſed to free
that Country from the cruell oppreſſion of thoſe perſons, who thought that
ruine would not come ſwift enough into their Coaſts, except they did petition
and ride far to uſher in the ſame: thoſe perſons, who (to compaſſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſome titles of Dignities) would let the Kingdome ſee, into what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſervitude and bondage they can bring the Common people into, by
their new acquired power of the Commiſſion of Array.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That all thoſe perſons inhabiting within any of the Counties of
<hi>North-Wales,</hi> who have been miſled, or enforced by the Commiſſioners of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,
to raiſe Armes or pay money towards the maintenance of this unnaturall
War againſt the Parliament, and ſhall forthwith come in and tender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and yeeld ſubmiſſion to the Power
and Authority of Parliament; their former delinquencie ſhall be remitted, and
their perſons and eſtates protected from the violence and fury of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That as many of thoſe perſons who have put in execution the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Array, or have been in actuall War againſt the Parliament, as ſhall
forthwith come and render themſelves unto the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi>
and ſubmit to the Power and Authority of Parliament; he will ſuſpend the
putting in execution of the Ordinances of Parliament againſt them, untill the
further pleaſure of the Parliament be ſignified therein: and will uſe his beſt
endeavour to have their former delinquencie remitted or qualified.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That as many as will not ſubmit to the Authority of Parliament,
but perſiſt in their diſobedience, muſt expect to feele thoſe miſeries which
War may bring upon them, and that puniſhment which they juſtly deſerve
for their contempt of ſo High Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95885:5"/>
And laſtly, That the Forces of the Parliament ſhall be continued no longer
in the ſaid Counties, then untill thoſe Commiſſioners of Array, and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſons that have been in actuall War againſt the Parliament, be reduced
to their due obedience to the Laws of the Realme, and the juſtice of that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Court: The Coaſts ſecured againſt the landing of Iriſh Rebells (from
whom no Proteſtant Subject of this Kingdome can expect civill uſage, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſtands affected;) The people freed from thoſe oppreſſions and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
under which they groane; and the trading of <hi>North-Wales</hi> for Cloth and
Cattell be reſtored unto them, which now is quite decayed by the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of Array's oppoſition againſt the Parliament; and the want thereof will
bring extreame poverty and famine upon the whole Country.</p>
            <p>He that can beleeve,</p>
            <p>That the Iriſh Rebels and Engliſh Papiſts doe now fight to maintaine the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion,</p>
            <p>That His Majeſties Royall Power and juſt Prerogatives are not reſident in the
Courts of Juſtice,</p>
            <p>That the Papiſts who are now in Armes, contrary to the expreſſe words of ſeverall
Acts of Parli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nt made againſt Papiſts bearing of Armes; doe now fight to
maintaine and keep thoſe Statutes in force,</p>
            <p>That thoſe Delinquents who were declared Traitors by the Parliament, and many
of them ſo proclaimed by His Majeſty, doe now fight againſt the Parliaments
Forces to maintaine the Priviledges of Parliament, and not to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Juſtice of that Supream Court:</p>
            <p>is furniſhed with a ſufficient competencie
of Ignorance to digeſt that Oath.</p>
            <p>He that hath been inforced to take an Oath, the ſubſtance whereof he cannot
beleeve; is bound in Conſcience and reaſon nos to obſerve the ſame.</p>
