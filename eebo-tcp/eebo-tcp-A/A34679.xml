            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE tongue of the juſt, or righteous</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 10. 20.) <hi>is as
choiſe ſilver.</hi> The words that fall from the
tongue of ſuch are very precious and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
And truly ſuch are the words that
dropt from the tongue and lips of this holy
and righteous man Mr. <hi>Cotton:</hi> As he himſelfe had by his
owne bleſſed experience found the tongue of that righteous
man (D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sibbs)</hi> as choiſe ſilver, yea better then the choiſeſt
gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> by which the Lord was pleaſed to convey
heavenly and eternall treaſure into his ſoule: Even ſo alſo
have many precious ſoules (ſome now above in glory, others
ſtill here below) found the words that have diſtilled from
his tongue to be above much fine gold, and of more weight
and value then the greateſt treaſure of this whole world.
Divers that are yet alive, and do remain unto this preſent,
may &amp; can hear witneſſe to the gracious words which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
out of his mouth. But I ſhall crave leave to name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one now amongſt the Saints at reſt, who was indeed one
of a thouſand in his time and place, <hi>viz.</hi> that great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
man, Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> whoſe heart the Lord wrought
powerfully upon by the tongue of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and that not
long after his heart had been ſeized upon by the tongue of
<pb facs="tcp:57074:3"/>
that <hi>ſweet Singer</hi> before mentioned. And becauſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is ſo remarkable, I ſhall be willing to relate in briefe the
ſubſtance of what I had ſometimes in private from the
tongue of this our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> himſelfe. He being
according to his courſe to Preach before the <hi>Univerſity</hi> &amp;
Schollars in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> had a great conflict in himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the compoſing of his Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> whether after the
plain &amp; profitable way, by rayſing of <hi>Doctrines,</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Uſes</hi> of the ſame. Or after the
<hi>mode</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> at that time, which was to ſtuffe
and fill their Serm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns with as much Quotation and citing

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſibly be. On the one ſide 'twas ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to him, that if he ſhould not go the former way, he
ſhould not be faithfull to the Lord in ſeeking his glory, but
his owne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the other ſide, if he ſhould not ſhew
his Learning, it would not onely be a diſparagement unto
himſelfe, but alſo unto the Colledg which had ſo lately cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
him out of another to be Fellow (for he was choſen <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
in <hi>Emanuel Colledg</hi> out of <hi>Trinity,</hi> where accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his yeare it fell out ſo as he could not be capable of a
<hi>Fellowſhip)</hi> What? is this that <hi>Cotton</hi> that was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and had ſuch a name, for a great Schollar? what a
poore choiſe hath <hi>Emanuel Colledg</hi> made? Thus he was
toſſed too and againe, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> in his thoughts (as I
thinke he ſayd) about a fortnight, the Lord ſeeming to try
his ſincerity at the firſt; but at length he came to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to deny himſelfe, what ever the world might judge or
ſay of him: His Text (if I miſtake not) being in 2 <hi>Cor. 2.
16. And who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Two or
three Doctrines (as it ſeems) he raiſed from the words. The
Schollars came generally with great expectation to heare a
more then ordinary learned Sermon from him that was ſo
famous throughout the <hi>Univerſity:</hi> and thereupon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:57074:3"/>
of Art at the beginning ſtood up, <hi>erectis auribus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi> was one; but ſoone perceiving
which way he went, which was ſo extreamely contrary to
their expectation, they ſate them downe in great diſcontent,
pulling their hats over their eyes, thereby to expreſſe their
diſlike of the Sermon: but before 'twas ended, ſomething
dropt from the tongue of the Preacher, which the Lord made
unto Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi> to be as choiſe ſilver indeed; whereby hee
was ſo affected, that he was made to ſtand up againe, and
change his poſture, and attend to what was ſpoken, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner then he and the reſt had done. Theſe things
Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi> afterward, getting to be acquainted with Mr.
<hi>Cotton</hi> (by coming to him under pretence of borrowing a
Booke of him, which he might have eaſily had elſewhere, &amp;
returning it againe) related particularly unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus our Reverend <hi>Author</hi> by denying himſelfe for the
Lord, had that caſt in upon him <hi>(viz.</hi> the gaining of ſuch
an eminent perſon to Chriſt) which was a thouſand times
better then the airy applauſe of the world, in being accounted
a learned man: Yet neither did he looſe that way, but had
the repute of that too (and not without cauſe) to his dying
day; notwithſtanding his continuall care to avoyd all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of affectation in the courſe of his Miniſtry, either
in regard of ſhewing Learning, or in the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
what he did deliver: whereby the power and effect of
his Preaching did appear to be wholly of God, being deſirous
to ſpeak to the underſtanding and capacity even of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and by manifeſtation of the Truth, to commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God, A taſte
whereof we have in theſe Sermons of his here publiſhed.</p>
            <p>It were too great arrogance for mee to thinke to adde any
authority to theſe or any other of his precious labours by my
commendation of them, I might as well go about to adde to
<pb facs="tcp:57074:4"/>
the light of the Sunne by my Candle: The very name of <hi>Cotton</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

<hi>Johns</hi> beholding him; <hi>I ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He is deſcribed by his ſhape, here is his figure and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance:
For his head, he had ſeven heads, and they amplified
by honourable Ornaments (or rather diſhonourable indeed,
but honourable in the beaſts view) namely upon his heads
the name of blaſphemy. 2. For his horns, he had ten horns,
and they are ſet forth by their Crowns which he had on his
horns; He had ſo many horns, ſo many Crowns, upon his
ten horns, ten Crowns. And as his ſhape is ſet forth by his
head and horns, ſo alſo by his reſemblance, or likeneſſe; the
whole ſhape or bulk of the Beaſt is like a Leopard: The Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
is of the femenine gender, and ſignifies the female of the
Panthers; the ſhe Panther, ſpotted and ravenous, famous for
her ſpeedy race, and yet of a good ſmell, by which ſhe allures
other beaſts to her, and as ſhe hath occaſion, doth devoure
them. And as his reſemblance for his whole ſhape is like a
Leopard, ſo for his feet he is like a Bear: And for his mouth,
he hath the mouth of a Lyon: This is the ſecond argument by
which he is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>3. The third argument whereby he is deſcribed is his ſtate,
and that amplified by three arguments. 1. By the efficient
cauſe. 2. By the variable change of it: And 3ly. by a wiſe
concluſion and obſervation. For the efficient cauſe of it, it is
ſaid to be the Dragon; he gave him his power and authority.
For the variable change of it, it was, 1. Great, for it is here
called <hi>Power, and Seate, and great Authority.</hi> 2. One of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57074:5"/>
heads was wounded; <hi>I ſaw one of his heads as it were wounded to
death.</hi> And thirdly, this wound was healed: this is the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
change of it. 1. <hi>Great authority, honourable ſeate. 2. Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to death.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>healed of that deadly wound.</hi> And this
healing is amplified by five Effects, or Conſequents. The firſt
was the worlds wondering: <hi>All the world wondered after the
Beaſt:</hi> The admiration was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this great change (ſo happily
atchieved as they thought) that he ſhould recover that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
danger. The ſecond effect it wrought was, <hi>worſhip both
towards himſelfe:</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>to the Dragon that gave
him power.</hi> The third effect of this healing was, <hi>liberty to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme:
There was a mouth given him to ſpeake great things &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</hi>
A fourth eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct was, <hi>Authority and Power</hi> (to do
what?) Firſt, <hi>To continue forty two moneths,</hi> verſ. 5. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Power to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them,</hi>
that was the fourth effect that followed his healing. The
fifth effect was amplitude, or largeneſſe of his Dominion:
<hi>Power was given him over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations,</hi> verſ.
7. <hi>And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him,</hi> verſ. 8.
Which worſhippers are deſcribed by their eſtrangement from
the number of Gods elect, whoſe names are not written in
the book of the life of the Lamb, and the Lamb ſet forth by
the eternall efficacy of his death, <hi>Slaine from the foundation of
the world.</hi> This is the ſecond part of the deſcription of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The third part is a concluſion, which contains a word of
Caution, and Conſolation, or a word of Attention and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
in the ninth and tenth verſes. <hi>If any man have eares to
heare, let him heare;</hi> as if it were a matter worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diligent attention, and of exact underſtanding and
of conſolation, in the tenth verſ. <hi>He that leadeth into captivity
ſhall goe into captivity; he that killeth with the ſword, muſt he killed
with the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. This is the former Beaſt and his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The latter Beaſt is in the eleventh verſe to the end: <hi>I beheld
another Beaſt coming up out of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. He is deſcribed by
his variety from the former beaſt: For his Original, he comes
not as the other Beaſt out of the Sea, but from the Earth:
And for his reſemblance, he hath two horns like a Lamb,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57074:6"/>
and he ſpake lik a Dragon. 2. He is deſcribed by his power,
as in the twelfth verſe, but I will not now ſpeak further of
him.</p>
               <p>Now for the meaning of the words; It is that which the
holy Ghoſt calls us diligently to attend unto; <hi>He that hath
cares to heare, let him heare:</hi> If any man have an eare to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
any apprehenſion of ſpirituall myſteries, any capacity
of matters of Religion, let him heare what manner of beaſt
the Devill ſtirred up, and ſet againſt the Church, to make
war againſt the Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as if it were a matter that few would
underſtand but ſuch as were of ſpirituall underſtanding, and
who will liſten duly to a diligent obſervation of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the matter whereof is weighty, and challengeth all our
intentions; and the more, becauſe it is very rare to meet with
that which will ſatisfie a diligent Reader in the Expoſition
hereof; But yet ſo much light God caſts almoſt into the head
of every man that takes this Book in hand, eſpecially in his
name and feare (according to his promiſe, <hi>Cap. 1. verſ. 3)</hi>
that he adds ſome light more than hath been before brought
to his hand. Here you ſee are two Beaſts, what is the former?
Many take it to be the Roman Empire, ſome take it to be the
Roman Pagan, ſome the Roman Chriſtian Empire, but I
feare neither of them are right: It is not the Roman Papan
Empire, that is, take the Empire as it was before the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Rome</hi> from Pagan to Chriſtian, in the dayes of <hi>Tyberius,</hi>
and other perſecuting Emperours, till <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> This Beaſt
was not the Roman Pagan Empire, I will give you a double
reaſon from the Text, the firſt is this.</p>
               <p>1. The Pagan Empire was deſcribed as this Beaſt is, in
<hi>Rev. 12. 3. Behold a great red Dragon, having ſeven heads aud tenn
horns;</hi> but with this difference, <hi>The ſeven heads had ſeven
Crowns upon their heads:</hi> Now this Beaſt hath alſo ſeven heads,
which make it like the other, but theſe Crowns are not upon
the heads, but upon the horns, which maketh a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
an evident ſigne it is not the Roman Pagan Empire.</p>
               <p>2. Againe, it is ſaid of this Beaſt, that he continues 42.
moneths, and that is as long as the Church was in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
for the Church continues in the wilderneſſe (as in <hi>chap.
12. 6.) a thouſand two hundred and three-ſcore dayes,</hi> which is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57074:6"/>
juſt 42. moneths: And ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 2. It is ſaid, <hi>The holy City
they ſhall tread under foot forty two moneths, all the time that the
two witneſſes prophecyed in ſackcloath, which was a thouſand, two
hundred and threeſcore dayes.</hi> Now it is certain the Roman Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Empire did not continue as long as the Church was in
the wilderneſſe; for the Church went not into the wilderneſs
till the Pagan Empire ceaſed to be Pagan, and was tranſlated
to Chriſtian. Now the Roman Pagan Empire was removed
as by a great Earth-quake in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, and changed
from Pagan to Chriſtian; it cannot therefore be the Roman
Pagan Empire, though many judicious Divines have gone
that way.</p>
               <p>What then, may it be the Chriſtian Empire? Many have
run that way, but neither is it ſo:</p>
               <p>1. For it is ſaid, <hi>this Dragon gave to him his power, his ſeate,
and great authority;</hi> now the ſeat of the Roman pagan Empire
indeed was <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Dragon did not give the Chriſtian
Emperors <hi>Rome</hi> for their Seat, they would never ſit there; but
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſate at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and prepared it to ſit there, and
for that end <hi>Conſtantine</hi> named it after himſelfe, <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi>
and if they had occaſion to come into the Weſtern parts of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
they would ſit at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> but at <hi>Rome</hi> they would not
come, unleſſe it were Gueſt-wiſe.</p>
               <p>2. Though it be true, as they ſay, the Roman Chriſtian
Emperour had a deadly wound given him by barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet when it was healed, the whole world did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him: When <hi>Charles</hi> the great did heale the wound, yet
all the world did not wonder after him; It is true, <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> did admire him, but all the Eaſtern
parts did not ſubmit to him, no nor <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Scotland,</hi>
nor <hi>Sweden,</hi> nor many other parts, they did not acknowledg
the Weſtern Emperour, gave him neither civill nor religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worſhip.</p>
               <p>3. Neither doth this ſuffer it to be the Roman Chriſtian
Empire, that it ſhould be a note of perdition and reprobation
to honour the Roman Chriſtian Emperours; for they that
have lived under the Roman Chriſtian Emperour, have not
hazarded their ſalvation by that ſubjection: but here it is ſaid
in the eighth verſe, that they that honour this beaſt are ſuch,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57074:7"/>
                  <hi>whoſe names are not written in the booke of the life of the Lambe:</hi>
So that for theſe reaſons I dare not ſo conceive this Beaſt to
he either Roman Pagan, or Roman Chriſtian Empire.</p>
               <p>What then, is it Antichriſt? The third ſort of Interpreters
run that way, and I would not exclude that wholly, but
yet neither dare I conſent to reſt in it; for when we open the
Oracles of God, we muſt not alwayes give the Comments
and Judgments of men for Scripture truths (though the men
be highly to be reverenced:) But in this place their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
doth not ſatisfie me, I will give my reaſon; Antichriſt
doth evidently appeare to be the other Beaſt that comes out
of the Earth, which is ſayd to have <hi>two hornes like a Lamb,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You may ſay, but Antichriſt may be more wayes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then one, as he is inveſted with temporall ſovera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gnty
and dominion, and ſo he may be the former beaſt: and as he
is inveſted with ſpiritual ſupremacy, and ſo he may be the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Beaſt; and indeed ſo, many Interpreters take it: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe deſcriptions.</p>
               <p>1. They differ in number; <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw a beaſt riſe out
of the Sea;</hi> and then it is ſaid in <hi>verſ. 11. I beheld another beaſt;</hi>
it is not therefore the ſame.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They differ, as in number, ſo in their originall;</hi> the firſt
roſe out of the ſea, the ſecond out of the earth.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They differ in their ſhape;</hi> The firſt beaſt had ten horns, the
ſecond had but two horns like a Lamb.</p>
               <p>4. They differ (and are apparantly diſtinguiſhed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their power, for he exerciſeth all the power of the
firſt Beaſt in his preſence: And it is ſaid alſo in the 12th. <hi>verſ.
He cauſeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worſhip the firſt
beaſt: and he cauſeth them to make an image of the firſt beaſt, and he
had power to gve life to the image of the beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
ſeems to be different; The ſecond beaſt gives all his
power to the firſt, and yet honours himſelfe too.</p>
               <p>But that which moſt of all prevailes with me, and which
wholly captivates my Judgment to leane another way, is this,
That whereas they ſay the firſt beaſt was the Pope, as <hi>Dominus
in Temporalibus,</hi> as Lord in Temporalls; and the ſecond beaſt
is the Pope, as he is <hi>Dominus in Spiritualibus.</hi> It is evident that
the Pope did not inveſt himſelfe with temporall authority at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57074:7"/>
the firſt: But at firſt claimed ſpirituall and univerſall Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
over-ſight over all the Churches; he was firſt ſupream
head of the Church in his ſpirituall Juriſdiction, and did not
claime dominion in Temporalls till after his wound was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and then he took power to depoſe the Emperour of the
Eaſt, and tranſlated his Empire from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> this
was his Dominion in earthly Monarchies which he took in
the latter place: And therefore I would rather ſay, that the
ſecond beaſt is the Pope in both reſpects, as Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
high Prieſt in Spiritualls, and the high Prieſt alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Kings of the world in Temporalls: <hi>Hee had two hornes
like a Lamb,</hi> as the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> and as if he had nothing
but from Chriſt, <hi>but he ſpake like a Dragon;</hi> When he had once
power by his Lamb-like horns, <hi>he then ſpake like a Dragon:</hi>
Therefore to ſpeak that which I conceive to be the truth, I do
look at this firſt beaſt as indeed of like condition with the
Pope, and very nearly joyned to him. The Pope is one of the
heads and rulers of this Beaſt, but yet diſtinguiſhed from the
beaſt it ſelfe, and is not the ſame with the beaſt.</p>
               <p>This therefore (all things weighed according to the Text)
I conceive to be the firſt beaſt, the Roman Catholick viſible
Church.</p>
               <p>The ſeven heads and ten horns are a clear deſcription of the
Roman State:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Now this State here is neither the Pagan Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, nor the Chriſtian Roman Empire, as hath been
ſhewed. And therefore it muſt needs be a third Roman State
diſtinct from the former, and ſucceeding in their place;
and what is that but the Roman Catholicke viſible Church?
Of this Church the Pope is the head both as univerſall Biſhop
over all Churches, and chiefly Lord in Temporalls, that had
both Swords, and obtained both Authorities, to be higheſt
ſupream head in Spirituals, as alſo ſupream head in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls,
he was Soveraign Governour in all: And the Roman-catholick
viſible Church, it comes juſt in the room of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire: how was it deſcribed? The beaſt that had ſeven
heads, and ten horns, this comes in his room; the one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all the world in his way, and the other all the Churches
another way: This is the Beaſt that the Dragon ſtirs up to
make War with the Saints. Now to appply this deſcription
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57074:8"/>
to this Church, for the better underſtanding of the Text.</p>
               <p>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>I ſaw a beaſt riſe out of the Sea:]</hi> You may aske what

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Sea is the collection of many waters; <hi>The ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together of the waters called the Seas,</hi> Gen. 1. 9, 10. And
what are the waters? <hi>The waters which thou ſaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt are People,
and Nations, and Languages, and Tongues,</hi> Rev. 17. 15. So then,
what is the beaſt here that ariſeth out of the Sea? It is ſome
ſoveraign State that ariſeth out of the connexion of many
Nations into one body, as you know the Roman Catholick
Church is not confined within the lifts of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
(though there the head is ſeated) but the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Sea;
it is well called a Sea in that reſpect, it is that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all Nations, whether ſubject to the Eaſtern or We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Emperour; yea and other Nations that did not ſubmit
themſelves to the one or other, as if they did recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as into one Sea, all banks are broken down in the Sea,
yet there is no diſtinction, but all is one Sea, one vaſt body:
And ſuch is the Roman Catholick viſible Church, all partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are here broken downe, all Churches make but one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And again, it is well ſaid to ariſe out of the Sea, according
to the like deſcription which <hi>Daniel</hi> makes of the foure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
in <hi>Dan. 7. Hee ſaw the foure windes of heaven ſtrive upon
the great Sea, and foure Beaſts came up from the ſea; divers one from
another:</hi> From the multiplyed agitations of the Sea it came
to paſſe four great Monarchs did ariſe: Juſt thus, from the
tumult of particular Churches did this Beaſt ariſe; for when
they could not agree in the Churches, but ſome were of one
minde, ſome of another, it was the wiſdom, as they thought,
of Chriſtian Princes and Biſhops (but it was but humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and was indeed from the Dragon, and not from
Chriſt) they thought it would be beſt to have but one church,
and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the head, though at firſt they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
them to four, but in the end they would have the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> over all, that ſo they might have unity; for they
ſay unity ſprings from one head; and unleſſe you have one
head, you cannot have unity: Therefore, from the particular
Church of a Congregation, they came to Dioceſan, from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57074:8"/>
to Metropolitan; from Metropolitan to Patriarchal,
from Patriarchal to Cecumenical: And ſo it comes to paſs, all
Churches muſt be gathered into one Sea, that is, one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church: For look what reaſon they had to ſet Biſhops o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
particular Churches: So having many Biſhops, by the ſame
reaſon they muſt have ſome Metropolitan, and of many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapolitans,
foure or five Patriarchs, and of them one Chief,
that is the Pope, the Father of Fathers, he muſt be the grand
Governour of all: Therefore doth he riſe out of the Sea, out
of the Sea of Tumult, and Sea of Contention: And if you
take Sea for corruption in Doctrine, and worſhip, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(as ſome good Interpreters do) it was from thence
alſo that this beaſt did ariſe; This beaſt did ariſe out of them
all; for had either pure Doctrine, or worſhip, or Diſcipline
been well looked unto, it had not been poſſible that ſuch a
beaſt as the Catholick viſible Roman Church ſhould have bin
raiſed up.</p>
               <p>It is further deſcribed to have <hi>ſeven heads, and ten horns:</hi>
The holy Ghoſt deſcribes them ſo fully, that we need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
interpretation of them: He tells us in the 17. Chapter of
this book, the ninth and tenth verſes; The ſeven heads are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Mountaines on which the Woman ſitteth, which are the
mountaines of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is built upon ſeven hills,
and the ſeven heads are alſo ſeven Kings, that is, ſeven Kingly
governments, ſoveraign governments: The firſt were Kings,
then Conſuls, then Decemvins, then Dictators, then Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,
and then the <hi>Caeſars:</hi> Five were fallen, that is, were
paſt in <hi>John's</hi> time, the ſixth were then extant, and they were
the <hi>Caeſars;</hi> the Pope he makes the ſeventh: Now the Pope
then is the ſeventh of theſe Heads, but the ſeventh head and
the beaſt are two diſtinct things, though he be one that rules
the beaſt, and hath a great influence in the guiding of it: Hee
was to receive a deadly wound, and after became an eighth
head, whereas he was but one of the ſeven: So that he is one
of the Heads, but there is difference between the head and the
beaſt, and the beaſt it ſelfe: And it is ſaid, <hi>He exerciſeth all the
power of the firſt Beaſt;</hi> that in concluſion, what the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
that ſtands: So that it is not a generall Councell that
determines any thing authentically without him, but he doth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57074:9"/>
all that the firſt beaſt doth; Hee would have the Catholick
Church honoured, but it is that himſelfe may be honoured,
as the Lord of the Church: So therefore for the heads, theſe
are the ſeven Heads.</p>
               <p>And for the Hornes, he tells you they are ſo many Kings,
which were not then riſen to Soveraigne Power, but <hi>John</hi>
ſaw it in a Myſtery afore hand; But when this Beaſt ariſeth,
this <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> then they receive a Kingdome at the
ſame time, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 12. And the ſeverall Kingdomes that
then were broken off from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (whereof <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was one) they were ſo many ſeverall Kings that all
gave their dominion to the Beaſt with one conſent, and ſo
were his protectors, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. They were his Beauty and his
Strength, as the Hornes are to the Beaſt: So it is true, here
is a great Beaſt indeed, of a vaſt comprehenſion, here is an
univerſall viſible Church, and he hath ſeven Heads; that is,
Seven Hilles, there he ſits, and ſeven Governments; There
are ſeven Heads, both of the one and other, both Hills and
Governments, whereof five were fallen, and the ſixth was
when <hi>John</hi> wrote: The ſeventh was to riſe in their roomes,
and that is, <hi>He that hath two Hornes like a Lambe, and ſpake
like a Dragon, and doth exerciſe all the Power of the firſt Beaſt:</hi>
what power is in the Church, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath the ordering
thereof; And it is ſaid here, that theſe Hornes had ten
Crowns, but ſo had not the Hornes of Pagan <hi>Rome.</hi> The
heads of Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> had ſoveraign Authority, and lived
like Princes, but ſo had not the <hi>Pope,</hi> they did not wear the
Crowns though they affect temporall dominion, but leave
the Crowns to the hornes, leave them to Crowned Kings
that give their power to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now upon theſe Heads are names of Blaſphemy.]</hi> The old
High-Prieſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue he had a plate of pure
Gold, and there was graven upon it, <hi>holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Exod.
28. 36, 37. This Beaſt hath not holineſſe to the Lord, but
names of Blaſphemy, the <hi>Pontifex maximus; His head is full of
names of Blaſphemy;</hi> But the Pope exceeds all in this caſe, for
who ever took upon him as he to pardon Sinne? A name of
Blaſphemy; To be Judge of Scriptures, a name of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy:
Hee hath many other names of Blaſphemy; he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57074:9"/>
will diſpence with Oaths of allegeance, and all civil ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he will diſpence with marriages moſt inceſtuous, <hi>and doth
exalt himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> eſpecially the Gods of
the Earth. His heads are full of names of Blaſphemy (as we
ſhall come to ſpeak God willing, in the 5 and 6 verſes.)</p>
               <p>Now it is ſaid of this Beaſt, <hi>he is like a ſhee Leopard.]</hi> It is
in the 17 <hi>Chap.</hi> compared to a woman, to ſhew, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> catholick viſible Church is as fitly reſembled by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as a ſhe Panther, &amp; ſuch is this Beaſt: <hi>Can a Leopard change
his ſpots,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. Is it not a State full of ſpots, and the
ſpots are not the ſpots of Gods people, but ſpots of heriſie,
and ſpots of Idolatry, &amp; ſpots of Tyranny, and great variety
of all ſpots of Blaſphemy: To tell the ſpots of that Sea,
were ineeed to enter into a Sea of wickedneſſe, which that
Church abounds withall. <hi>Can a Leopard change his ſpots;</hi> This
church they make account cannot erre, &amp; ſo how ſhould they
change? for they that cannot erre, to what purpoſe ſhould
they change? yet of a very ſweet &amp; fragrant ſmel, as they they
perfume their Temples with incenſe, and love to pleaſe ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
minds, and to fill covetous hearts; they are ſweet alſo,
and faire to voluptous ſpirits, with their Brothel houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the Leopard, Bear, and Lyon, I ſuppoſe there is
ſpeciall reference to them all, In <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6. where he
reſembles the Monarch of <hi>Babell</hi> to a Lyon, and the Monarch
of <hi>Perſia</hi> to a Bear, and the Monarch of <hi>Greece</hi> to a Leopard:
There the Leopard is the laſt of the three, here it is the firſt, to
ſhew a direct contrary courſe that this Beaſt takes in his riſe
to the old Monarchies. Of the great Monarchies, the firſt
was a Lyon, full of magnanimity, the next was a Beare, full
of cruelty, a Bear that devoures mucb fleſh, and the Leopard,
the ſpotted Beaſt comes after, cruell as the former: Now
here the Leopard is firſt, the whole ſhape is ſweet and ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
other beaſts would follow him by the ſmell; and ſo
this church ſeemes in the wole bulk ſweet and ſavory to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle
all unſtable Soules; But where he gets hold, he layes
his paw like a Beare, preſſeth hard, and holds faſt, and will
not let goe; Juſt like the <hi>Perſian</hi> State, they hold faſt; Never
did any of the States laſt ſo long as the Papall State; The
<hi>Aſſyrian</hi> laſted, long but yet did not continue above a thouſand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57074:10"/>
years; but this is to continue 1260. dayes, that is, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares, in a great deal of Power and Authority; And
therefore as by ſubtilty he drawes others to him, ſo them hee
holds faſt, that it is marvellous hard to root out where he
hath got hold; you may cut off his head, as it is in <hi>England;</hi>
but it is a wonder to ſee what paines there is to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Chriſt brought in, and of the Beaſt caſt out:
they will make ſo many Statutes in Parliament, that you can
have no wills confirmed, nor Marriages made, but by them,
nor no Parliments Acts paſſe but through their hands; you
have ſo many matters in the State depending on them, that
one would think it impoſſible ever to root them out: you
may take off the Beaſt his head; you may thruſt the Leopard
out at windows, but he will take hold with his feet, that you
ſhall have much ado to root him out: The great profits, and
great preferments they ſink deep in the hearts of carnall men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he hath a mouth like a Lyon.]</hi> How did the Lyon of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
ſpeak preſumptuouſly; <hi>what God is able to deliver you out of
the firey furnace?</hi> &amp;c. and he commands all that will not
worſhip his Image ſhould be caſt into the fyery furnace: Juſt
ſuch is the mouth of this Beaſt; who ſo will not worſhip
the Image of this Beaſt ſhall be killed, in the 15 <hi>v.</hi> of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So you ſee this is the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick viſible church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Dragon gave this church power.]</hi> All that the Roman
Emperor could doe before, that doth the Catholick church;
that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the old Roman Emperor did by force of arms, that
doth the Roman Church by the power of Religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
<hi>The Dragon gave him his power, and Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
And Satan will worke by the power of conſcience,
making them believe that all muſt be ſubject to them: <hi>He
gave them his Seat:</hi> what was the Seat of the old Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror?
It was <hi>Rome,</hi> Satan gave that to the Beaſt; There
is his Seat, and great Authority, inſomuch that all the world
were deeply taken with the reverence they owe as to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
mother City; So to this ſoveraign mother Church, &amp;
their holy Father the Pope that was the head of that Church:
This is the plain deſcription of this firſt Beaſt. I canot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now to open the wounding of one of the heads of this
Beaſt, nor of the healing of that wound, nor of his warre
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57074:10"/>
againſt the Saints: I am the longer in this, becauſe the more
clearly theſe things are opened, the more fully will the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the holy Ghoſt appear in the ſequell. <hi>If any man have
eares to heare, let him heare:</hi> doe not think that theſe things
concern Students onely, and Scollars; But what is this to
common chriſtians? <hi>He that hath an eare, let him heare what
the holy Ghoſt ſaith:</hi> It is the ſame charge which he gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Epiſtles which were common to all churches; <hi>If
any man have an eare let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the
Churches:</hi> Thoſe generall doctrines neceſſary for all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to underſtand, the ſame charge is laid upon all to heare
what is ſpoken concerning this beaſt; If thou underſtandeſt
Religion, if thou wouldſt be, or art a member of a Church of
Chriſt know this point; <hi>If any man have an ear let him hear this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall we make it an Article of our Creed to
believe the Catholick Church; and ſhall we now make it an Article
of Faith to beleive it to be a Monſter? I believe the holy Catholick
Church, and ſhall we make it a Beaſt?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; The holy Catholick Church we make
it an Article of our Creed, that is, a company of the Godly
called out of the world; we look at them all as thoſe for
whom Chriſt ſhed his bloud: But we muſt not look at this
as a viſible Catholick Church, much leſſe the Roman Church
as the Catholick Church: we believe the Catholick Church
is inviſible; we believe no viſible Church, but Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and therefore if you come to heare of a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
viſible Church, whereof the Pope is the head, and
who takes upon him all this Soveraignty and power here
deſcribed, we look at ſuch a body as a great B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church of this Congregation hath power within it ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

None of us are like Leopards to other beaſts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
to draw other beaſts after us, and then like Beares to
claſp them in to be ſubject to this Church, &amp; then ſpeak like
Lyons, that all ſhall be ſubject to our commands: This is a

Church of the Devill, but not of Chriſt. Thus have you the

Come we now to gather one briefe note from the words:</p>
               <p>The viſible Catholicke Roman Church is in the eſteem of the holy
Ghoſt a monſtrous Beaſt,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                  <hi>that is the note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is the beaſt here deſcribed, you have heard it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
Some Roman State it muſt be, and you have heard it
can neither be <hi>Rome</hi>-Pagan, nor <hi>Rome</hi>-Chriſtian: It muſt
therefore be the Roman Church; for it is deſcribed by ſeven
heads, and ten horns, which are the Arms of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they
are deſcribed in the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is in the eyes of the holy Ghoſt a monſtrous beaſt is
here evident; for imagine a beaſt ſet before you with ſeven
heads, and ten horns, would it not ſeem a monſter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall?
that it ſhould look like a Leopard, all ſported, <hi>and
feete like a Beare?</hi> and look at his mouth, <hi>and that's like a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
is not this a monſter? to ſay nothing of his blaſphemies,
which makes him a wicked beaſt: but look at his viſage which
is here reſembled, and what is here deciphered but a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?
It holds forth his deſcription in other places, in <hi>Chap.
16. 13. There came forth three unclean ſpirits out of the mouth of
the Dragon</hi> (that is the Devill) <hi>and out of the mouth of the Beaſt,
&amp; out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet.</hi> And you ſhall alſo read,
that the beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet;
theſe were two ſtill, they could not be made one, <hi>Rev. 19.
20. And they were both caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with
brimſtone,</hi> both the the firſt beaſt and the latter beaſt, the beaſt
and the falſe Prophet: <hi>He like a Lamb comes in ſheeps cloathing,
but inwardly is a ravening wolfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now why is it ſuch a monſtrous beaſt?</p>
               <p>If God had made ſuch a kinde of creature; a Leopard is no mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
nor a Beare, nor a Lyon: But if you make a Beaſt of all theſe,
that will be a monſter, that is contrary to the courſe of nature, cleare
beſides the ordinary courſe of naturall generation, that makes a thing
monſtrous, this then is the reaſon of the point.</p>
               <p>A beaſt ingendred againſt the courſe of nature,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> that is a
monſter, eſpecially if there be ſo many uncouth ſhapes of
which it is compoſed: And it is not ſo with this univerſall
Catholick viſible Church? Doe but conſider what kinde of
Church the Lord inſtituted, the Church of a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:
<hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, goe and tell him his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57074:12"/>
fault between thee and him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If he will not hear thee, take with
thee one or two more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If he ſhall neglect to heare them, tell it to
the Church,</hi> Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. What, the Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church, when will that meet think you? And is it ever
to be expected that when they do meet, that every brother of
this countrey and other countreys muſt go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and tell
the Treſpaſſes of his brother againſt him, and ſend for thoſe
that have offended him, and thus and thus plead with them?
And when do you think that a Catholick Church will heale
all offences between brethren? Will not this be a monſtrous
beaſt when the Catholick Church muſt heare and remove of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences?
That Church which Chriſt hath ordained will heare
the offences of brethren, and a brother hath liberty to tell
his offence to the Church, and at length the matter will be
brought to an iſſue, when they they have two witneſſes, then
the Church ſees what is to be done: Now to have a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
viſible Church, what a monſtrous diſturbance will that
be to the free diſpenſation of the government of Chriſt? and
yet the rulers thereof will be the only viſible Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the world.</p>
               <p>Again, you read in 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 23. When the whole Church</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall come together into one place,</hi> &amp;c. The Church
therefore which the Apoſtles inſtituted may be gathered into
one place, <hi>that all may heare, and all may be edefied:</hi> Why, is it
poſſible that all Churches ſhould be gathered into one place?
or ſhould all heare if they were gathered? or will they be ever
ſo gathered? what a wondrous beaſt will this be?</p>
               <p>Againe, whereas Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>his Kingdome is not of this
world,</hi> and hath appointed to his Diſciples, <hi>that they ſhould not
be Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 3. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. from 23.
to 29. <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you: But whoſoever will be great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, let him be your Miniſter: and let every ſoule be ſubject to
the authority of the higher powers.</hi> Well now, if there muſt be a
Catholick Church, and an Officer that ſhall rule all Nations,
and that in ſo many Nations with Spirituall and Temporall
Dominion, carry all before him, will it not be a Monſter?
What a diſproportion is this to the Churches of Chriſt, and to
the Officers thereof? Not to ſpeak of their other monſtrous
uſurpations of the head of this Church, but take the body as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57074:13"/>
it is, how they ſpeak like a Lyon, and hold faſt when they get
like a Beare, and are ſpotted like a Leopard, that they are
nothing but hotch-potch, and mingle-mangle: <hi>If any man
have underſtanding, let him underſtand</hi> what kind of Church this
is that is thus deciphered, and deſcribed, this viſible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church. For the Uſe.</p>
               <p>It may firſt teach us the great and juſt reaſon which all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Churches have to with-draw themſelves from the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> from the Catholick viſible
Roman Church, though they look at thoſe that ſubmit not
to them as Schiſmaticks and Hereticks; I pray you conſider
would they have us ſubmit to this great beaſt? would they
have the Lambs of Chriſt (for ſuch are the Churches of
Chriſt) to ſubmit to a Lyon, Beare, or Leopard? Hath any
Lamb in the world (much leſſe a Lamb of Chriſt) ſo many
Heads and Horns, and ſuch ſpots, and ſuch fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſuch a
mouth? Therefore I pray you conſider, it is not time for
the Lambs of Chriſt, and for all the Churches of Chriſt to flye
off from this Monſter, and to abandon them utterly, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no part nor portion with ſuch a beaſt as this?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> let this be another Uſe; it may teach us how
Chriſtian Proteſtant Churches wrong themſelves that leave
any footſteps of this government in their Churches: For that
is part of the image of the beaſt; for the ſecond beaſt, when he
was advanced, he would have an image of the firſt beaſt, they
muſt have Provinciall and Dioceſan Churches, and National
Churches, and carry I know not how many hundred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
into one Nationall Church, and there muſt be
ſome Dioceſan and Metrapolitan church, and the reſt muſt be
inferiour to that: Though this be not ſo great a monſter as
the great Beaſt, yet it is an image of this beaſt; can any bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tell his offence to ſuch a church? And will you have him
ſtay till the whole National church meets? Or will you have
him ſtay till the Dioceſan church meets, and carry his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the Viſitation? Do you think they will right his cauſe
then? Are a few ſuch kind of men, the Chancellor, and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and Surrogate, and Apparitor, do you think the church
that our Saviour bids us tell? Are theſe they that are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together, <hi>that all may heare, and all may be edefied? Do theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57074:13"/>
ſerve the Lord Jeſus, and not their owne bellies?</hi> I ſay therefore,
you may ſee what great reaſon men have to with-draw from
ſubjection in ſpirituall matters to the Image of this great
beaſt that in ſome meaſure repreſent the ſame ſtate as they.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> let it be a ſeaſonable advertiſement to all (if I
were to ſpeak to Princes) to all Princes, but however to all
Magiſtrates, how to make uſe of their Authority to be as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of the Church, &amp; in reſpect of their ſpirituall eſtate, as
children of the church, but not to give the horns to the
church (though horns be for beauty and ſtrength:) you ſee
it makes the Church a monſter, and it is to make a beaſt of
the Church: And ſo if you ſhould make Church-Officers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Peace, or Councellors, or proſtitute your own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to them, that if the Church condemn any, then
you muſt do ſo too (as heretofore if a man were condemned
by the Church, and by them delivered to the ſecular power,
then burn him preſently;) this puts your Horns upon the
Churches head, unto monſtrous deformity: And therefore it
is neceſſary for Magiſtrates to keep their power in their owne
hands, and not to take things <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> from the Church,
but to conſider what is done, and then they are to confirm
what the Church doth according to God; Here are ten horns,
and theſe are tenne Kings by the holy Ghoſts interpretation,
and they adde to the monſtrouſneſſe of this Beaſt, by giving
their power thereto. Why, doth this miſhape a Chriſtian
Church, for Magiſtrates to ſubmit their crownes to the
Church? No, God forbid, it is an honour and happineſſe to
them, when Kings are nurſing Fathers to the church, and
bow down their faces to the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. But why then
doth he put it as a part of the miſhapen ſtate of the Church,
that it had <hi>tenne hornes,</hi> to wit, becauſe theſe Kings did give
their ſtrength and power to the Beaſt, that the Beaſt did act
theſe Horns acording to the power of his luſt, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. v.
17. as it was truly accompliſhed in all the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi>
that did ſubmit all their Scepters, and Thrones, and Crowns,
and Dignities to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> That if hee command
this or that, there muſt be room for him, what ever becomes
of Princes, Laws, and Endeavours, and all acts and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of War, or Peace: He had their horns on his head, he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57074:14"/>
might puſh with them as he would: This made the Church a
monſter, when ſoveraign power was obnoxious to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> when without Excomunication, whether a
cauſe were of God or no, Magiſtrates proceeded, if the Church
had cenſured: As a Beaſt that hath horns on his head, as hee
turns, ſo muſt the power of his horns be ſet and put forth:
If therefore the Catholick Church, or any Officer of it ſhall
condemn a man as an Heretick, and then deliver him to the
ſecular power, they never diſpute the cauſe, but take it for
granted; If their holy mother Church condemn him, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Power muſt puſh and cruſh him to the very Earth, and
trample him under foot, and rend his bowels from his body,
if he once be delivered to them. Now this makes the Church
a beaſt, that hath this power over the Princes of the Earth,
that look what is their luſt, or their ignorance, or their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the contrary adjudged by them to be Hereſie, that
the Secular power muſt mayntain the one, and condemn the
other. It is a comfortable thing for Churches to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and protected by civill Magiſtrates: But if they captivate
their power to the Church, that what Church Rulers call
for not according to the Word, but their Luſts, that the civill
Magiſtrate muſt confirm, that makes the Church a Beaſt: And
<hi>therefore be wiſe now O ye Kings, be inſtructed O ye Judges of the
earth, ſerve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling,</hi> &amp;c.
Pſal. 2. 11, 12. Kiſſe the Lord Jeſus, ſubmit to him, and in
him to the church; Lick the duſt off the feet of the church,
diſpenſing his counſell and will: But when by implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
the Common-wealth muſt he proſtitute to the Beaſt, it
makes the Beaſt more monſtrous then it is: The authority of
Princes in that kind makes ſuch churches to be very beaſtly
and ugly monſters.</p>

You know how much the civill Laws of Chriſtian Kingdoms
doe ſtrengthen Eccleſiaſticall power, that if once a Church
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57074:14"/>
exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat a man, you know the power of the Law, if once
this or that court excomunicate a man, though it be but for
not paying fees, when it may be he hath no money, or thinks
it not lawfull to maintain them by his purſe: yea when he is
excommunicate, it may be for going to hear a Sermon in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, when he hath nothing but reading at home; or
if a man faſt with his neighbors in his houſe, then what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
there is out of ſuch a Court, civill Courts of Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
there comes a Significavit, that if he ſhall live ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate:
and if he continue and ſtay out a certain time,
then the Common-wealth apprehends him, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
whether the cauſe be juſt or unjuſt: I confeſſe there is
a liberty to traverſe ſuch a cauſe; but if a man want money,
or want friends, he may be taken and carryed to Priſon, and
there he may lie and rott for any of theſe miſhapen Clergy
men: But I ſay it is a great liberty to be freed from this
great beaſt, that he hath no finger amongſt us, we are out of
his paw, and out of his ſmell: It was a matter in queſtion
here not long agoe, whether the Court ſhould not take a
courſe to puniſh ſuch perſons as ſtood excommunicate out
of the Church, if they ſhould ſtand long excommunicate,
but it was a good providence of God that ſuch a thing was
prevented: Let not any Court, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> take things
from the Church; If ſuch a Law were made (the Fathers
live not for ever;) and if ſuch a Law were once eſtabliſhed,
that a Church-member ſtanding ſo long excommunicated,
the Common-wealth then ſhould proceed againſt him; were

And therefore we ſhould in the fear of God be unfeignedly
thankfull to God for our preſent liberties, and withall that
we may be ſo, <hi>Let him that hath an eare to heare, heare;</hi> If you
be of Spirituall diſcerning, and know what theſe mercies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57074:15"/>
mean, you will be really thankfull; Therefore ſhew this
thankfullneſſe, not onely in ſearching the true meaning of
the Text, and the true nature of this beaſt deſcribed in it, but
alſo in ſtanding faſt in theſe great liberties wherewith Chriſt
hath made us free, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>You ſhall have many poore creatures that came hither to
this Country, and will be ready to go back againe, they
looke at things as mean and poor here; believe it, ſuch a
man hath not an eare, nor an eye open, he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he goes: <hi>Hagar,</hi> Sarahs maid, whether goeſt thou? ſaith
the Lord to her: And ſo may I ſay to ſuch, whether will you
goe? will you be gone back againe to <hi>Egypt</hi> (God forbid
I ſhould count all our Native Country as <hi>Egypt)</hi> but if you
goe thither, you will have much adoe to eſcape the paw of
of the Bear: If you be once incorporated into any of their
Pariſhes, you will finde ſuch beaſtly work in Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(I may ſpeak it without wrong to any, but that
I may bear witneſſe againſt what is corrupt) that you will
then finde the bleſſing of thoſe that enjoy liberty and piety
together, you muſt worſhip the beaſt or the Image of the
beaſt; A Dioceſan, or Nationall Church, it is but an Image
of the great beaſt, it is a plain pattern of the ſame; and you
will finde the body of the Church rent from you, or you
will be rent from the body, if you ſhall walk roundly and
ſincerely in the ways of God; you will finde ſad work to
have your own officers or others to riſe up againſt you: but
we have here cauſe to praiſe God for our preſent liberties,
and therefore you are to be wary what you doe. If this be
cauſe of thankfulneſſe, turn not againe to that from which
the Lord by his ſtretched out arme hath delivered you: And
this let me ſay further, as it may provoke us to thankfulneſs,
ſo to forego all the Profits of this life, rather then to be
drawn to ſubjection to ſuch a Spirituall Government; you
ſee what the holy Ghoſt counts it, ſeven heads, ten horns,
heads full of names of blaſphemy, horns crowned, and here
is a beaſt like a Leopard, with feet like a Bear; that all the
Government of it looks like rapine and robbery, catching
and ſnatching, rending and tearing, this is the ſum and
ſcope of it: And therefore be not deceived; if men ſhall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57074:15"/>
tender you faire termes that may ſmell ſweet, you ſhall
have liberty in this and that, and protection of a good State,
but it is but the ſmell of a Leopard; when you have yielded
to ſuch Conditions as may be tendred, you will finde ſuch
ſtrong hold got of you, that you will never get out: And
then you ſhall finde what ever Conditions are put in at firſt,
the laſt Edition will be <hi>a mouth like a Lyon:</hi> They will bring
you in with ſubtilty, like a Leopard, lay faſt hold upon you
like a Beare; and before they have done, there will be <hi>a mouth

to be faithfull to God, that hath purchaſed theſe great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>That the Dragon (that is,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> Satan) as he had the government of the
Pagan Roman Empire: ſo being caſt out of it, he gave (or procured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57074:16"/>
and obtained) to the Roman Catholicke viſible Church his power,
and ſeate (or Throne) and great authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ſo it is plainly here ſaid,</hi> That the Dragon gave to the
Beaſt his power, and his ſeate, and great authority.</p>
               <p>The Dragon, who is that? You heard, <hi>the Dragon is the old
Serpent called the Devill, and Satan:</hi> but the Dragon conſidered,
as he ſometimes ſwayed the Roman Pagan Empire, as in <hi>Rev.
12. 3. There appeared a wonder in heaven, a great red Dragon,

the ſeven hills of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ten horns, ſo many Kings
that aroſe with the laſt head of the Beaſt; Therefore he means
the Dragon, as he ſometimes ſwayed the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
ſo the Seate and State of the Pagan Roman Empire: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now caſt out, and ſeeing he cannot maintaine his State
and divine honour, as before, to whom doth he give his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
what, to the Roman Chriſtian Empire? No, his rage
is againſt them, and the Church amongſt them: Neither did
he give them his Seate; they ſate not at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi>
Neither can he eaſily faſten upon the civill State
ſuch deluſions, as to cauſe the Chriſtian Emperours to take
to themſelves divine honour, though the Pagan Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
had ſo done: But now hee doth chooſe to faſten them

with Church-men (as I may ſpeak) to drinke in an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundation

Therefore upon this Beaſt (which can neither be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

               <p>
                  <hi>His power.]</hi> A three-fold power did the Devill faſten upon
the Roman Catholick viſible Church.</p>
               <p>1. The power of ſignes and lying wonders: <hi>Hee gave him
great power to worke great wonders,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 9. Of which there
is more ſpoken in the ſequell of the Chapter, where ſome of
his miracles are mentioned.</p>
               <p>2. He gave him the power of effectuall Sophiſtry, or (as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57074:16"/>
the Scripture calls it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 9, 10.) of deceit, of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe;
partly in the Schoolmen, and partly in their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
or Cloyſter-men, and partly in their Canoniſts. By
the efficacy of Sophiſtry in School-men, he corrupted all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
By the deceit of the Cloyſter-men, the Monkes, he
corrupted all their devotion and worſhip: And by the policy
of their Canoniſts, he corrupted all Church-government;
and this was carryed with ſuch efficacy of deceit, that thoſe
School-Divines were accounted the moſt profound, and the
Monks moſt devout, and the Canoniſts moſt judicious, and
exquiſite Polititians: Now theſe three did mightily deceive
the Chriſtian world by their power, and all this power Satan
gave to this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>3. He gave him the power alſo of making war; for in <hi>verſ.
7. It was given him to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome
them;</hi> putting into the hearts of chriſtian Kings to give their
power to the Beaſt, and to wage all their Battels at their own
charges whiles he ſate ſtill; this was the power which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by the Dragon.</p>
               <p>And for his ſeate, what was it? <hi>It was the City of</hi> Rome
<hi>which ruled over the Kings of the earth,</hi> Rev. 17. 18. And for
that end he would not ſuffer <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> nor other Emperors
to dwell at <hi>Rome:</hi> If they were in <hi>Italy,</hi> they ſhould dwell at
<hi>Ravenna:</hi> So that the Dragon granted his owne Seate or
Throne, not to the Emperors, for they never cared for it,
but he reſerved it for this Beaſt, to be the center and chief Seate
of the Roman Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And he gave him alſo great authority, tranſcendently great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>Great Authority.</p>
               <p>1. Over the Scriptures.</p>

and Churches, over the merits of Chriſt, over King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Common-wealths, over Purgatory, and for
mitigating the paines of Hell: All this he gave to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick viſible Church.</p>
               <p>1. He gave him power over the Scriptures.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As Judg of them. The Church is the Judg of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57074:17"/>
and the head of that Church is the Judg of all places
of Scripture, by his authority it is authenticall; This the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church doth challenge.</item>
                  <item>2. He doth prefer the vulgar Latine before the Originall
Scripture, a tranſcendant power.</item>
                  <item>3. It is in his power to make <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Scripture, to
be of like power with the canonicall Scripture.</item>
                  <item>4. It is his power and authority that gives unwritten
Traditions like power with the canonicall Scripture.</item>
                  <item>5. He takes upon him to be the infallible Interpreter,
and Judge of the meaning of Scripture, and that is Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</item>
                  <item>6. He takes upon him power to diſpence with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Hee hath power to diſpence with the morall Law of
God in point of Marriages, even in inceſtuous Marriages, this
is a power beyond Scripture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. He hath great authority over the conſciences of men,
making Laws and Canons to bind the conſcience, and relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and looſing them from the power of Gods Lawes, either
in point of Marriage, or in point of Oaths and Covenants, or
in point of naturall relation: He can diſpence with children
in reſpect of duty to Parents, if they come into Monaſteries,
and with duty which Subjects owe to Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>3. They have power over the Church Treaſury, by which
they meane the ſupererogation of the merits of Chriſt, and of
the Saints: They ſay Chriſt merited for a thouſand worlds:
and becauſe he ſaved but a few, it is free for the Pope to take
the ſurpluſſage of merit; He can take them and apply them
by Indulgences, for the pardoning of them that pay well for
them. And thus they who deſpiſe Gods imputation of the
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for juſtification, they take upon them
to impute it to themſelves, and to this and that notorious
wicked man.</p>
               <p>4. They have power over Kingdomes and Common-wealths,
to depoſe Kings, and to diſpoſe of their Kingdoms
as they pleaſe, and to abſolve Subjects from all Allegiance
to civill power, and for that end to nullifie their Oath, for
that end you know what the Pope ſent to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth:
Chriſt (ſay they) gave this power to <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57074:17"/>
Pope, and to that end abuſe. <hi>Jer. 1. 10. See, I have this day
ſet thee over the Nations, to root cut and pull downe, and to deſtroy,
and to throw downe, to build, and to plant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. They have power over the eſtate of the life to come.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Over Heaven. Hee claimes tranſcendent power in
that, and doth abuſe that place in</hi> Mat. 16. 19. To thee
will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, that whatſoever
thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; whatſoever thou
ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven: <hi>Therefore he can
open the gates of Heaven to them that are dead.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. They have power over Purgatory; Upon ſo much
done and given, they can help them out of Purgatory: They
make account the torments of Purgatory are equall to the
paines of Hell; but that Hell is for ever, and Purgatory but
till the laſt Judgment.</item>
                  <item>3. They have power over Hell: they have not abſolute
power to deliver out of Hell (only <hi>Gregory</hi> is ſaid to have
delivered <hi>Trajans</hi> ſoul out of Hell;) but though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deliver out of Hell, yet they can eaſe the torment. The
witneſſes of this will hardly owne it, but it is the judgment
of the moſt devout to that Sea.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So that he gave to the Catholick church his power of ſigns
and lying wonders, of all kinds of efficacy of deluſions, and
power of making Warre, and he gave him great authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Scriptures, over mens Conſciences, over the treaſures
of the Church, over Kingdomes, and Princes, and Powers
of the world to come, and over Purgatory and Hell: And
therefore conſider, if this be not a vaſt power, which is here
given, and acknowledged to be given by himſelfe to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
viſible Roman Church: You muſt not wonder that
the Catholick Church did not claim all this at firſt, but came
to this by degrees, and more faſter grew to this, eſpecially at
that time when this ſecond Beaſt (that received in ſpiritualls
his power, ſpeaking like a Dragon) had got all this tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
power. In the mean time, from the very firſt you ſhal find
this power in the repreſentative Catholick Church; They
quartered them into ſeverall Juriſdictions, into Biſhopricks;
and when they had done that, they reſted not till they had
ſet one over the reſt, and that was this of <hi>Rome:</hi> And beſides,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57074:18"/>
this was devilliſh Authority to make Laws to bind all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Congregations, to take their Government from them.
3ly. In every Councell they deviſed ſome new Doctrine, and
ſome new form of worſhip and Government, which was the
ſeed out of which this tranſcendant power was hatched.</p>
               <p>For the reaſon of the point, you may aske how hee ſhould
give all this power which he never had himſelf, how he ſhould
give that which never was his to a Beaſt, ſo as to carry all
things with that tranſcendant power, for divine power he
had not himſelf, he was caſt out from it, how then could hee
give this to any State in the world?</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> from Gods divine Juſtice, and heavy Judgment upon
the unthankfull world: That look, as God in former times
did give up the Roman Pagan world to be ruled by Satan as
the god of it (and therefore he is called in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. the God
of the world)</hi> So now God gave up the Roman Chriſtian
world, as he did the Pagan world before; the Scripture tells
us ſo, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Becauſe they received not the
love of the truth that they might be ſaved, he gave them up to effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of deluſions to believe lies: That they all might be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> They lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the ſimplicity of the Apoſtles Inſtitutions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Churches, and Laws, and Doctrine, and Apoſtolick go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but did affect high preferments, and ſetled en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
and carnall excellency. Now the Lord therefore
gives Satan wonderfull power, that as of old he was once the
God of Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo now in the Church he gives them
Church-power; that what he could not retaine in his owne
hands, that he ſubſtitutes, and gives to the Roman Catholick
Church, to carry it along with great ſucceſſe: and that's the
firſt Reaſon, the judgment of God upon the unthankfull
world.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon is taken from the effectuall means which
Satan uſed to advance the Roman Church by,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to exalt his
Church above all others; what were the means? The means
were theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ignorance, raiſing a ſmoak out of the bottomleſſe Pit,
darkning all the light of the Church, <hi>Rev. 9. 2. The Sun and
the Aire were darkned by reaſon of it:</hi> There was a mighty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57074:18"/>
dark miſt as it were: They regarded not the love of the truth,
they ſtudyed it not, and ſo the Lord left them to palpable
groſſe ignorance, in ſo much that at that time when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
beaſt aroſe, had we ſeene any that lived in the former
time of Religion, and that lived now, we would not have
thought they had been the ſame men, ſuch palpable darkneſs
were they left unto of ignorance; Now palpable ignorance
is the mother of all Superſtition and Idolatry, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidance
of all things in the Church.</p>
               <p>A ſecond means which he uſed, was, terror of Conſcience
which he ſet on effectually by the Locuſts, <hi>Rev. 9. 3, 5. There
came out of the ſmoak Locuſts, and unto them was given power as the
ſcorpions of the Earth have power:</hi> They had ſuch a notable
power to ſting the Conſciences of men, that men would ſeek
for death, and could not finde it, and take deſperate courſes,
drowning, or hanging, or any thing, rather then to live in
that terrour. They that ſhall read <hi>Parſons Reſolutions Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis,</hi>
ſhall find what terrible threats there are applyed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie,
but never ſhewed them the way to come to Chriſt, to
binde up ſuch broken ſouls: Now the Conſcience broken
and not healed, is fit to ſow any ſuperſtition in.</p>
               <p>A third means was the ſuperſtition and hypocriſie of the
votaries, and of all afflicted, but unſetled conſciences. Terror
of conſcience makes them greatly devout; They tell them
of a ſtate of perfection, and that they ſhall ſhrowd themſelves
in ſuch a Monaſtery, and there they ſhould live devoutly, and
be kept from the pollutions of the world; Many Princes
have been thus taken, and have given large endowments to
pray for their ſouls, their conſciences being wounded.</p>
               <p>A fourth meanes was the ſubtilty and ſophiſtry of the
School-men, ſuppreſſing the reading of the Scriptures, and
mixing Philoſophy with Divinity, that they might as well
have ſtudied a point of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as their divinity, and make
as good uſe of the one as of the other. They left ſtudying of
Scriptures, and read <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> which was mentioned in
Latine, and this was a notable meanes.</p>
               <p>A fifth meanes was the policy of the Canoniſts, who had
gathered together all thoſe Canons that tended to Chriſts
powerfull Government, and faſtned them upon the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57074:19"/>
Church, and the Biſhop of Rome being head, he had
it all committed to him, a notable means to bring in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all lying miracles, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 9. Whoſe coming is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, &amp; lying wonders.</hi>
Thus you ſee the means how the Dragon gave him his power,
and Authority, and ſuch Authority that he exalts himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that is called God.</p>
               <p>The uſe is thus much; Firſt it ſerves to ſhew the vanity of
all that admiration of the Roman Catholick viſible Church,
and devotion to that Church, which hath ſo long for many
Ages deluded the world, and with which Jeſuites and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
doe to this day delude devout, but carnall ſouls; Here
is great power given to them, and great authority; but whence
hath the Church all this? They pretend they have it all
from Chriſt, but they have it from the Dragon of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit; He gave him his power and ſeat and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
It never came from Chriſt, he never gave this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to any Church nor State in the world, it is from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
And whereas they plead it is the keys of the kingdome
of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. It is verely (as the Text calls it, <hi>Rev.
9. 1.) The key of the Bottomleſſe pit; There fell a ſtar from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Earth, and to him was given the key of the Bottomleſſe pit:</hi>
It is he that hath power to let out ſmoak out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit; Not to let out men from thence, as ſome have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
or from <hi>Limbus,</hi> which is the ſuburbs of Hell; But to
let out ſmoak, damnable doctrine, and falſe Government;
He hath power to open it, but no power to ſhut it; power to
ſting mens conſciences, but no power to heal them. And
therefore when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes the Roman Catholick viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church to be the true Church, he makes this the firſt
note of a true Catholick Church; whereas our Divines make
Preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments,
and holy Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cipline, he refutes them, and ſets down three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
univerſall, Catholick, viſible Church, to be the true
Church; And the truth is, it is the very Beaſt, to which the
Devill gave this great Authority and power: Wherefore let
not men be bewitched with them, but let us know they are all
but efficacies of deluſions what ever have been in this kinde

ſpoken. If any man ſay, ſhall we diſclaim an Article of our
Creed, to deſpiſe the holy Catholick Church? God forbid,
we doe believe the holy Catholick Church ſpread over all
Nations; But a Church Catholick that ſhall have one viſible
head, and be the Mother Church, verily we look at it as the
greateſt and uglieſt beaſt, that ever was raiſed in the world.
Take all other Monarchies that the Scripture deſcribes, the
Leopard of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Lyon of <hi>Babell,</hi> and the Bear of <hi>Perſiae,</hi>
and they are either of them but a beaſtly ſtate, but here all
theſe Beaſts are mingled and confounded in one: And beſides,
<hi>It hath ſeven heads, and ten horns.</hi> A Leopard, a Lyon, and a
Beare, they are orderly creatures, according to ſome Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But here is a Beaſt that runs beſides all inſtitution, and
deſcription of Scripture, and ſocieties of men that ever was
raiſed. The Catholick viſible Roman Church, is the moſt
monſter; God forbid we ſhould blaſpheme any Church, but
I do but ſpeak Scripture; Let the world be judg, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can be accommodated to any but to this Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
mother Church. It is evident in Scripture, theſe <hi>ſeven
heads, and ten horns,</hi> muſt be ſome <hi>Roman</hi> State, the Roman Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
State it cannot be, nor yet the Roman Chriſtian State,
and a Roman State it is: but there hath been no other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
State, but the Roman-Catholick viſible Church, and
that hath claimed ſuch great power and authority, which
is doubtleſſe as incompatible to Scripture as may be, which
by the wit of man hath not been invented, but by the
Dragon; and yet ſo goodly in the eyes of the world, which
great Princes are deluded and beſotted withall, and happy
they that can be reconciled to that State.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> Learn we to magnifie the free rich grace of God
that hath delivered us from this great Beaſt, and the worſhip
of it, and hath reſtored us in a great meaſure to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of primative ſimplicity, that now we may meet every

one may brign his offence (if hee cannot be ſatisfied in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
and may be heard, and the caſe in due time ſearched

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57074:20"/>
which overwhelms all the world like a great Sea; And it
i, well called a Sea, for it ſwallows up all like a vaſt Ocean.</p>
               <p>And the more thankfull ought we to be, that he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us from the Image of the Beaſt, as well as from the beaſt
it ſelfe; A Catholick Church that beareth ſway over ſo many
hundred Churches, and overwhelms them all: Such Lawes
they ſhall make as ſhall binde all Nations, and whether they
give conſent or no, they muſt ſubſcribe to them in point of
government. Were we ſenſible how odious this Beaſt were in
the ſight of the holy Ghoſt, and of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> it would
affect us with ſtrong thankfulneſſe, and hearty enlargedneſſe
to God, that hath delivered us from ſo great a beaſt, and
from any image and picture of it, unto which all the world
is ſubject, unleſſe in ſome few places.</p>

Lordly pomp and ſtate: For Officers of a Church to take
upon them any great State, or to ſee a Church compoſed in
any ſuch form, you ſee in the eyes of the holy Ghoſt it is a
Beaſt. There is nothing more diſproportionable to us, then
for us to affect Supremacy, for us to weare the hornes that
might puſh Kings; to throw downe any, or to deſire Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
to execute what we ſhall think fit, verily it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
to the ſimplicity of the Church of Chriſt. Neither
may they give their power to us, nor may we take it from
them: That when an Excommunication paſſe in the Church,
then to leave it to the Magiſtrate, that ſo a man being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
is left, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> to civill cenſure, upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
cenſure, this will cauſe the Magiſtrates to ſubmit their
power to the Church unavoidably; that if a Church cenſure,
the Magiſtrates muſt proceed againſt them: Now it is good to
have theſe two States ſo joyned together, that the ſimplicity
of the church may be maintained and upheld, and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the civill State according to God, but not by any ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
further then according to the word. Beware of all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
power, and Lordly power, of ſuch vaſt inſpection of
one church over another: Take heed of any ſuch uſurpation,
it will amount to ſome monſtrous Beaſt: Leave every church
Independant, not Independant from brotherly counſell;
God forbid that we ſhould refuſe that; but when it comes to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57074:20"/>
power, that one Church ſhall have power over the reſt, then
look for a Beaſt, which the Lord would have all his people to

offers this to the Vicar of Chriſt (as they call him) I wil give
you government over all the Churches in the world, and
Kingdoms, and States; and he in very deed takes Satans offer,
and doth take all the pomp and ſtate of the world. Time was
when <hi>Naaman</hi> the Aſſyrian offered large matters to <hi>Eliſha</hi> for
healing him of his Leproſie, but the Prophet would have
none of them (though he was no Pagan) for when he came
home, they would aske, what did it coſt you? he might ſay,
it coſt me not a groat, but what it coſt me in the Innes where I
lay; this is honour to Religion: His ſervant <hi>Gehezi</hi> indeed
runs after him, <hi>As the Lord liveth, he ſhall not goe ſo away, but he
will have a reward;</hi> He makes an excuſe, <hi>There are two ſonnes of
the Prophets come, and he deſires a talent of ſilver, and two changes
of garments;</hi> and hee very liberally faſtens a great deale more
on him then he asks: What, ſaith <hi>Eliſha, Is this a time to take
money, and to receive garments, and Olive-yards, and Vine-yards,
and ſheep, and oxen, and men-ſervants, and maid-ſervants?</hi> Hee
meant ſuch money as would buy all theſe; <hi>The leproſie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a Leproſie that wil cleave to us, &amp; make us grow more &amp; more

are Church-members; Such ſimple government, though it
hath horns (for the Lamb hath horns, and can tell how to

monſtrous and ugly in the ſight of the Lord Jeſus, to take
heed of hearkning to any power of Nationall Churches, you
will finde that this will grow to ſuch ugly deformity, that
God will turn away his face from you: You will never finde
him as in times of ignorance; Though God hath pardoned
what we did in ignorance, not knowing what wee did (as
Chriſt prayed, <hi>Luke 23. 34. Father forgive them, they know not

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaw one of his heads.]</hi> You heard before that the Beaſt had
ſeven heads: Now as the Scribes asked Chriſt concerning the
woman that had ſeven Husbands, <hi>whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be of the
ſeven?</hi> So here is a Beaſt hath ſeven heads, and one is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which of the ſeven muſt it be? To this the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>
tells us, <hi>Chap. 17. That five of them were gone;</hi> they had been,
but were not now, and theſe are the ſeven governments of
the Roman State: Theſe five had been Kings and Conſuls,
Decemviers, Dictators, Tribunes. The ſixth yet was, and
that was the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the Roman Emperours they were the
ſixth head, whether Chriſtian or Pagan, it differs not much
the ſtate of the Government, for they were all governed by
Roman Laws, under one head or other. Now therefore what
is this that is here ſpoken of, <hi>One of his heads were as it were
wounded to death?</hi> was it the Roman Emperour, whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
or Chriſtian? you heard reaſons before why it could not
be Pagan, nor indeed Chriſtian <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That head was crowned, but this hath no Crown; All
the ſeven heads were crowned, they governed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

But here theſe heads are not crowned, but the Crowns
are upon the Horns.</p>
               <p>2. Neither can it be they, becauſe of this wound upon this
head, The Roman Chriſtian Emperours they never cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
to themſelves Head-ſhip over the Church of <hi>Rome.
Conſtantine</hi> doth utterly abandon it; He profeſſeth he
ought to be judged by them, and not they by him. And
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> doth ſubmit himſelfe to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> cenſure, and
doth not exerciſe any Head-ſhip over the Church: It was
not therefore the Emperours, for they were not heads of
the Church.</p>
               <p>3. It is ſaid, the wound here given, was healed, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the world: Now certaine it is, the wound
given by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> it was never healed to
this day: but the Eaſtern part was ſwallowed up by the
Turk. And for the Emperors of the Weſt, <hi>Charles</hi> the
great, and his Succeſſors, though they healed a branch of
it, yet it was far off from healing the wound of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, thoſe wounds have decayed, and fall ſhort
of that which was the admiration of the Nations: Nor
was it the healing of this wound from the firſt time it
was given, that was the admiration of the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be ſome head that was ſo wounded, as all the
world wondered at it, and were captive to it; You heard
it was not the Roman Chriſtian Emperors, it muſt be
him that claimes to be head over all the Churches, and
who is that but <hi>Pontifex maximus?</hi> It was that which <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſias</hi>
abhor'd, he thought it an unworthy ſtyle for a
Chriſtian Emperour to be accounted the great high Prieſt
of the Church; but what he laid down, they willingly
took up, to be accounted the great Paſtor of the Church,
and therefore he is the head of the Church: For if it be
neither Pagan nor Chriſtian Emperours, it muſt be the
government that ſucceeded them, they were the ſixth,
and hee is the ſeventh: It is the ſeventh head that was
thus wounded, and whoſe wound was afterward
healed.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Now a ſecond Queſtion will be,</hi> If he be the ſeventh

as if a man were beheaded, and yet it fell after into worſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
               <p>2. It was after taken againe by <hi>Adulphus,</hi> who thought to
change the name of it, and call it <hi>Gothia.</hi>
               </p>

him, his Succeſſor <hi>Totilas</hi> deſtroyed it, and brought it to ſuch
deſolation, that there was neither man, woman, nor child
ſeen in it for forty dayes. Now this was ſuch a wound, that
all the Biſhops in the world that were wont to give homage
to him, they now began to neglect his Head-ſhip, that was but
a ſervant at home: They deſpiſed him, to be the head of the
Church, that was a ſervant to <hi>Barbarians;</hi> Inſomuch, that the
Biſhop of <hi>Revenna,</hi> he challengeth univerſall Supremacy, he
takes indignation at him, that he will be Lord Paramount:
But ſo great was the wound, that indeed the Roman Biſhop
was utterly diſcouraged, and this continued for 140. yeares
together; and though he would have uſed many meanes for
his cure, and have called in help from the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi>
yet he was not willing to help him, for they had fallen out
before about worſhipping of Images; he was conſtant for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
the other was againſt them, and ſo he might ſinke or
ſwim for them; ſo his wound ſeemed incurable.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> By degrees.</p>
               <p>1. In the yeare 555. the Lord ſtirred up <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who by
his Generalls, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Morſes,</hi> drove and deſtroyed
the <hi>Goths</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By <hi>Juſtinians</hi> novell Conſtitutions, we decree according
to the Canons of the holy Councels, the moſt holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of old <hi>Rome</hi> to be the firſt (or to have the Primacy)
of all Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57074:23"/>
3. <hi>Phocas</hi> the <hi>Parricide</hi> about fifty yeares after, about the
yeare 606. healed up the wound, granting to <hi>Boniface</hi>
the third, that he ſhould be univerſall Biſhop, not only
the firſt in order, but in honour alſo, and that all the
whole world ſhould be his Dioceſſe: And this was the
healing of his Head, which was ſo perfectly cured, that
all the world wondered at the preſervation of the head
of this Church, and began by degrees more and more to
adore both the Church, and the Head of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> There is an Objection made againſt this expoſition; That by
this means the Biſhop of Rome ſhould be healed before he be a head of
Beaſt, for this was his headſhip when he was allowed to be chief Lord
over all the Churches, and all the reſt to be under him; and the Pope
was not this head till the Act of <hi>Phocas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, He had not the peaceable poſſeſſion of this
Headſhip till this time, but yet it is evident in ſtory that he
did claim this ſupremacy before, he ſought it ambitiouſly,
and it was given him by the devotion of many Biſhops, and
Churches, and Nations, it was uſually rendred to him long
before that time. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ballo</hi> the Pope had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
forth into the Government over the Churches: And
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth (when he is put to it) that the
Biſhop of Rome would never goe to any Conſultation in the
Eaſt, but ſent his Legat; for ſaith he, it is not meet the head
ſhould follow the members: A ſecond reaſon he gives, the
Emperor (ſaith he) is at leaſt Vice-gerent of the Eaſt, he well
may have the materiall Seat that was taken up by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
where ſhall the Biſhop of Rome ſit then? and this he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
out of ſome of their writings: So that it is evident,
that he did ambitiouſly deſire it, and the manner was (being
elderly men) all his beloved and dear children they call him
Father, and ſo he takes in good part all their honorable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and he deſtributes to them ſuch parcells of reſpect, as
may ſtand with his own Sumpremacy, and their ſubjection,
and therefore they need not ſay, The wounded head was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before he was a head of the Beaſt, for it was in conception
long before. He did from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time ſeek Supremacy:
They confeſſe, little reſpect was had to him in <hi>Conſtantines</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57074:23"/>
time; But when order was ſet in Churches, he took all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for his exaltation, and did take all appeals from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that what others did to him in reſpect of his gravity, &amp;
learning, and underſtanding, he takes as done to him as ſitting
in <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, and ſo did challenge headſhip in thoſe times,
and they thought it was meet to give it; And after this, he
was ratified, and confirmed, and eſtabliſhed in peace, then
was his wound healed.</p>
               <p>Come we then to gather a note or two from the word;
The firſt note you may obſerve is this.</p>

with a mortall wound, and cruſheth it even to the death.</p>
               <p>I gather it out of theſe words, <hi>I ſaw one of his heads as it
were wounded to death;</hi> It was one of the heads of the Catholick
Church; As the body was a Monſter, ſo was the head;
to ſet a head over ſuch a vaſt body it was a Monſter in Gods
ſight: The Lord wil not ſuffer him to go on in this ambitious
deſigne, but will meet him as he did <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he cruſhed
his foot againſt the wall, and if he had gone on, he had ſleine
him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 32, 33. So doth the Lord here meet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome; if he will be the head of the viſible Church,
and animate ſuch a Body, what will the Lord doe? He will
wound him to death, and ſlay him, and cruſh his ſpirituall
arrogancy, that under pretence of Vicarſhip to Chriſt, will
yet be the Lord of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the point is,</p>

body the Church.</hi> Secondly, it is his by Purchaſe: <hi>He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to death, even the death of the Croſſe; and God hath
highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
name,</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. <hi>He dyed and roſe again, that he might
be Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. So that now
when the Lord hath this headſhip of the Church granted him,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57074:24"/>
and alſo hath purchaſed it by his own death; now for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to claym headſhip, it muſt needs imply, either that the
head is a non-reſident, or elſe thruſt out of his headſhip, he
doth adminiſter. And though the Lord be not preſent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet in his ſpirituall preſence, he is as truely preſent, and
more effectually then any that can be deviſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in regard of injury done to Chriſt, which the Lord
will not bear, he will therefore cruſh, and wound ſuch
heads.</p>
               <p>2dly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> From the ſacrilegious injury put upon the Church:
It is an uſurpation of all power from the Church, that if a
Catholick Church be met, they will give power and Lawes
to other Churches, and look what the ſecond Beaſt doth, he
adminiſters all the power of the firſt Beaſt; Look what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is given to the Catholick Church, that doth the Biſhop of
Rome incorporate to himſelf, and he cauſeth an Image of
that Church to be made in Provinciall Nations; which when
they have taken hold, like a Bears claws, they will not eaſily
be rooted out: Now this is ſuch injurous uſurpation, that
from that day to this, they have never been free; That where
the Pope hath had to doe, the Churches are ſpoiled of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that is given to them by Chriſt; And therefore you
muſt not wonder if the Lord wound the head of ſuch as goe
on in their wickedneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 20, 21. The jealouſie of the
Lord riſeth againſt ſuch uſurpations: For a viſible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church to be ſet over the world, who may make Lawes
to rule conſcience, and make Officers for the ordering of all
Churches; It is ſuch a Monſter, and the Government of
it is ſo odious in the ſight of God, that he wounds it to
death.</p>
               <p>For the uſe of the point,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> It may ſerve to provoke us all to
pray heartily, and faithfully, for the repreſſing of all ſuch
heads as either the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is, or any Images of him
whatſoever they be. You read of a little horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
whoſe root was ſtubbed up; wherever you read of any horns
that will uſurpe power over the Church, look at it (as it is)
abominable to Chriſt, it provokes the ſpirit of Chriſt, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority is his: If the Lord be ſet upon the hill of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57074:24"/>
Sion, he will wound the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any that ſhall
take his Image; He will give them a deadly blow, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when they are more arrogant, then his Indignation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
againſt them, to execute judgement on ſuch. The head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Church is a ſingular priviledge to the Lord Jeſus,
and incompitable to any: They muſt either take Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
out of his hands, or think him negligent, or non-reſident,
and that he doth not ſufficiently diſcharge his headſhip, and
therefore they will uſurpe an office in his name, but that is
abominable to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, So wee ſhall pluck the Crowne off from
the heads of Chriſtian Princes, for they challenge that ſtile to be head
of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doe not know any Chriſtian Prince that chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that ſtile. That which was ſometimes given to <hi>Saul,</hi>
may be given to Princes, 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 17. When thou waſt little
in thine eyes, waſt thou not made the head of the Tribes of Iſrael?</hi>
That is true, and ſo the King is head of all the Peeres, and
head of all the Shires, and the Churches are in ſome or other
of them, that is,</p>
               <p>1. They have power over the Church in all civill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>2. And I will ſay thus much, that they have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
and reforme inordinate abuſes in the Church, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Church officers to doe it; If they doe not, other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are to treat with them; and if their corruptions be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
either to the doctrine of the Goſpell, or if they dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
to any Tyranny, they are to look to redreſſe ſuch
things, but this gives them not headſhip over the Church;
over their perſons it doth, but not over the Church, that
is,</p>
               <p>1. They have no power either to call Church-officers, or
to depoſe them.</p>
               <p>2. They have no power to diſpence Church-cenſures.</p>
               <p>3. They have no power to ſuſpend Church liberties.</p>
               <p>4. They have no power to appoint Church-ordinances;
nor power to adminiſter any matter further then any
other member of the Church: and this did the Church
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57074:25"/>
of <hi>England</hi> acknowledge, and no more then this was due:
Therefore we allow ſome power and authority to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Magiſtrates, in the ſence ſpoken of; If they
claime any further, it will ſo kindle the jealouſie of the
Lord, that the Lord wil certainly wound it to the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Crowns of all that take it upon them: which
may be a notable warning to all Church-men (I mean
Church officers) to beware of cleeking into their hands
the power which God hath not given them; the Lord
will wound their heads, he will not endure it, 'tis a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
that he hath purchaſed with his owne bloud. I
think there is no need here to preſſe it; but this let me
ſay, it is a juſt motive to pray the more ardently, and
faithfully for the cruſhing of ſuch heads, wherever the
Lord findes any arrogant head, that any Church-officer
will undertake to give Lawes to the Churches in their
dioceſſe, that they will put Officers upon them, that they
will ſuſpend them at their pleaſure, and put in, and put
out, whether the Church will or no; This kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency
in ſuch a ſtate, let it look for a wound, for a
wound it ſhall have. And therefore, we are the more
encouraged to pray for, and to look for deliverance from
theſe Heads; for John tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. that <hi>if we
aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us;</hi> And this
is according to the will of God, that all ambitious heads
be wounded: What he hath done he will doe, <hi>There is
no new thing under the Sun;</hi> he ſpares, and changes, and
wounds in every change: Perſons are changed, but Gods
adminiſtrations are one and the ſame: If Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
have been ardently kindled againſt the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he will certainly viſite ſuch powers as take upon
them to put doctrine upon the Church; to take away
Church liberties; and ſometimes to ſcater one Church
from another, the Lord will certainly viſit it, we may
pray for it, and comfortably expect it.</p>
               <p>The next note is this;</p>
               <p>That though God doe wound and cruſh,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> and repreſſe the
arrogance of Church officers, affecting headſhip over all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57074:25"/>
Churches for a time, yet he doth ſometimes again heal their
wounds, and binde up their breaches, and give free paſſage to
their ambitious deſignes.</p>
               <p>This is evident here, <hi>I ſaw one of his heads, as it were wounded
to death</hi> (and you have heard when, and how) and yet,
which is wonderfull, <hi>His deadly wound was healed,</hi> and that to
the admiration of all the world; <hi>And all the world wondred after
the Beaſt,</hi> to ſee a wound ſo really and perfectly healed: when
this Church was wounded, afterwards the Pope was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered, but the wound of <hi>Caeſars</hi> head was left blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
both in the Eaſt and Weſt. This head muſt therefore be
the ſpirituall head of <hi>Rome:</hi> God though he repreſſe ſome
inſolency, yet he doth many times give free paſſage to their
deſignes at length. He did ſo with <hi>Balaam,</hi> he met with him
in the way, and had not the Aſſe hindred, certainly he had
ſlain him, <hi>Numb. 22. 32. Becauſe thy way was perverſe before
me, ſaith God: Balaak</hi> had ſent him word, that if he would
come and curſe the people that were come out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that
he would give him this, and that; he ſaw he had an eye to
theſe outward things; The Lord ſeeing his way perverſe, he
would have killed him; but yet at length in <hi>v. 35. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Balaam, <hi>if it be thy minde to go, I will
give thee leave, go with the men, but onely the word that I ſhall
ſpeak unto thee, that thou ſhalt ſpeak;</hi> And when he comes, he
doth bleſſe the people to the Indignation of the King of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab;</hi>
but afterwards when <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw that he ſhould looſe all
that he came for; come, ſaith he to the King, take ſome courſe
to invite the Gallants of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to a feaſt (and it was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
feaſt to the honour of <hi>Baal Peor)</hi> and ſo the anger of
the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and there were foure and
twenty thouſand dyed of the Plague, and at length <hi>Balaam</hi>
was ſlaine alſo: But yet you ſee, he gives way to his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
deſignes, to ſatisfie himſelfe to the full, though he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
viſited his Sinne upon him. So did the Lord here
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> he wounded him as it were to
death, and afterwards he heals him, and raiſeth him up again,
and ſent <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Goths</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wiſe man, gives him his Titles, and makes him Biſhop
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57074:26"/>
of Biſhops, inſpector over all the reſt, and perfectly cures
him; That whereas before he had loſt his Titles, and one or
other wrote againſt him; the Emperor being loath to make
their own Arch-Biſhop (that lived in their City with them)
chief, for diſturbing their civill Government; They had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conferre all that honour upon him that had been ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
&amp; worſhiped for ſo many years, eſpecially having had
32 M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>naſteries, &amp; had been more Orthodoxall then all other
Churches: Theſe were great inducements to give all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Pope, though they ſaw him deſperately woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
but when they ſee him recovered, they wonder at him,
and every one ſubmits to him, eſpecially the Weſtern parts;
though they in the Eaſt alſo would conſult with him, and be
led and guided by him, and all their decrees in counſell were
referred to him; if he did diſlike them, they were antequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
if he did approve them, they were received as Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Lawes of the Church.</p>
               <p>You may aske, why the Lord would heal ſuch an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ugly Beaſt, this viſible Catholick Church, and this
Beaſt that was one of the heads of this Church; for he had a
beaſtly ſhape; take him alone without the other Beaſt, and
take them together, here is a great Beaſt; afterwards he is
called in <hi>Chap. 17. the great whore,</hi> and ſhe ſits upon this Beaſt,
and he hath all his ſupportance from her; he reſtores the
Church, and the head of the Beaſt to that ſtate they were in
before; The reaſon why God doth this is double.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> in regard of his juſt diſpleaſure againſt the backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
apoſtacies of the Church in ſuch times: When the Lord
ſees the ſpirits of men are bent to apoſtacy and backſliding,
ſo as that they reject the ſimplicity of the Goſpell of Chriſt,
and if they might have it they will not; now it is a righteous
thing with God to plague them with the arrogance &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Antichriſt: <hi>If I come in my Fathers name, you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me; if another come in his own name, him you will receive;</hi>
Now it is a juſt judgement of God, if Chriſt come and offer
himſelf in the ſimplicity of his Ordinances, and they think
this is too mean, and doth not reach the ſtate of an Imperiall
City, but they muſt have ſuch and ſuch orders in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57074:26"/>
and Churches muſt be diſtinguiſhed by ſuch Patrons,
and it is fit that one be Lord Paramount over them all, and
none is ſo fit as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> If people dote upon
ſuch (ſome goodly ſhape, but drawn by the inventions of
men) well you ſhall have ſuch Biſhops: This head that
ſometimes hath been thus wounded, that ſome have had cauſe
of ſolemn praiſe for his wounding, and God hath by this
means given the Churches liberty to take ſome better way of
worſhip, but they would not, well you ſhall have enough of
him. It is one of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, <hi>(Chap. 14. 14.) the
Backslider in heart ſhall be filled with his own wayes;</hi> If you dote
after inventions of men, you ſhall be filled with vain Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
to the contentment of your own hearts. God out of
his tender faithfulneſſe to his Church he will redeem ſome,
and doth give them faire opportunities to undertake their
own liberties out of the uſurpations of men; but if they
will rather ſit under the ſhadow of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then feed upon
<hi>Manna,</hi> then goe you back again ſaith God, none of you
ſhall eat of that which I have prepared, that is one Reaſon;
Such backſliders that delight in ſuch communion in ſuch
heads over their Churches, it is juſt with God to fill them
with their own inventions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from the juſt judgement of
God upon ſuch kinde of heads,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> that doe affect ſuch ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the Lord will ſhew them this favour, he will croſſe them
as he did <hi>Balaam;</hi> but if their hearts be bent to go on in their
miſchevous courſe, he gives them leave to fulfill their own
luſts to their own perdition; And thus he did <hi>Balaam,</hi> he
gave him leave not onely to bleſſe the people, but to draw
them aſide from God; for he could not have taken a more
ready courſe to have caſt them out of Gods favour, then to
draw them to offer Sacrafice to <hi>Baal,</hi> for that was one of the
worſt dunghill gods. It is out of Gods righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when a man will not be reclaimed, when the Lord
wounds, and cruſhes him, and brings him to the laſt gaſpe,
if he have a licouriſh affection ſtill; now it is an uſuall thing
with God to pay men to their own perdition: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 11. It is ſaid, <hi>the beaſt that was and is not, ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57074:27"/>
goe into perdition,</hi> that's the head of this Beaſt; that is the next
newes you heare of this ſecond beaſt here in the Text, and
therefore it is called both the beaſt, and the head of the beaſt,
where the firſt beaſt is preſented in the form of a great whore,
who is to be brought to the laſt gaſpe; A whore ſhe was, but
he preſents her to <hi>John</hi> as a great beaſt; Now hee gives him
leave to riſe againe to his own perdition, and of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
more. Thus you ſee the truth of the point.</p>
               <p>Now for the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> it may be a juſt watch-word and warning to all the
Sons of men, to beware of Gods checks. When the Lord
checks you, cruſhes your Crowns, and expoſeth you to this
and that danger in one kind or other, beware of this;
whether you be the children of God or not, yet come home
effectually to him; for this you ſhall finde, if you be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
and call, he is ready to heare; He will heare <hi>Iſhmael;</hi>
and he hears the Lyons that roar, <hi>and ſeek their meat of him;</hi> He
will many times, once, or twice, or thrice do thus: But if the
Lord once ſtrike, and almoſt cruſh you, beware now that you
lay aſide all carnall ends and ambitious deſignes; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
if you ſhall recover againe, and perſiſt in your former
wayes without repentance, then the next news is, you goe
on to perdition: And therefore when ever the Lord affects us,
and afflicts us in any kind, it is heavenly wiſdome to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the leaſt phylip of his finger; be warned by any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
croſſes, danger by Land or Sea, by any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Lord is pleaſed to exerciſe you with, this is both chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bread, and the bread of ſtrangers: Beware you goe not
on ſtill, but if the Lord check you, then turn back again; but
if you go forward, be ſure you go to God-ward, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods will, and after Gods ends:</p>
               <p>This is that which God calls for, that you walke more
exactly, and more accurately, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 15. See then that yee
walke circumſpectly, not as fooles, but as wiſe, redeeming the time;</hi>
becauſe God hath thus and thus taken paines with you, and
hath thus and thus been as a Leopard in your paths. It is a
ſtrong ſpeech that in <hi>Amos 3. 5. Will a man lay a ſnare</hi> (and
the word is a deadly ſnare) <hi>will a man lay a deadly ſnare, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57074:27"/>
take it up, and catch nothing?</hi> The Lord will catch a prey when
he layes a trap for us, and he will not leave till he have girded
our loynes and our hearts cloſe to him, and made us more
exact in our way, or otherwiſe if he let us ſlip, it will be to
perdition: And therefore let all that heare the word, ever be
ſenſible of the leaſt wounds &amp; checks, eſpecially if they grow
to ſome bulky frame: <hi>I ſaw one of his heads as it were wounded
to death,</hi> and this deadly wound was healed, and it was healed
to immortall perdition, and therefore all that wonder after
the Beaſt, they are ſuch as have no part in the Lambs book of
Life, they have no part in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> It may teach us the more earneſtly to wreſtle
with God by faithfull and earneſt prayer for any of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt in any parts of the world; that if the Lord give
them an opportunity to wound the head of any Image of the
Beaſt, any of his heads or horns, then it will be neceſſary that
all ſuch Churches do take the hint and opportunity that God
puts into their hands, and that they do not rather cloſe with
ſuch heads whom God wounds, and be loath to lay hold of
thoſe liberties that he procures for them: But let this be the
conſtant care of Chriſtians to deſire that ſuch heads may not
be uſurping: but if the Lord gives an opportunity, the Lord
looks that all Chriſtians ſhould improve it, to vindicate
themſelves, when the Lord gives any hint thereof: When he
gives an opportunity, then is the time; when the iron is hot,
then ſtrike; Intreat God, that when he puts a prize into their
hands, that they then may learn to get wiſdome, and not in
their hearts turn to tolerate arrogant deſignes, and ſuch as
are ugly in the ſight of God: When God wounds the head of
Enemies, and caſts ſhame upon them, and hath reſcued his
people from them; If Churches ſhal again comply with them,
then what will the end of that be? It is a fearfull thing, ſuch
kind of Heads goe to perdition, and thoſe that dote upon
ſuch Heads. It is a check eſpecially for this great beaſt of
<hi>Rome,</hi> but it will be dangerous for other States too: This
will be the finall iſſue, they ſhall have enough of it, they ſhall
be filled with Hirarchicall power, and with their Agents in
Civill States, their feete like a Beare will raven in all, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57074:28"/>
they ſhall all be weary of the burden, and ſhall be ſo filled
with them, as to ſpew them out of their mouths: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how ſhould we help the people of God to traverſe that
wounded Head that it never riſe up more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> this may ſerve to teach ſuch whoſe Heads have at
any time been wounded; As there is none of the ſervants of
God, but ſometimes he will have them ſacrifice their <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
that which is moſt deare to them: The Lord will rend away
our moſt deſirable comforts; he will follow us there, where
we moſt of all are affected: And let this teach the people of
God, that if the Lord then bow their hearts to unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
turning from all evill in their hands and hearts,
how then? If the Lord will reſtore the wounded head of a
beaſt, a beaſtly head, of a beaſtly ſhape, will he not much
more reſtore the hearts of his ſervants that ſeek to him for
healing of all their corruptions, and ſcattering all their
temptations, that they may walke before him according to
to his will? What ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Hoſ. 6. 1, 2. Hee puts
words into their mouths, come let us return unto the Lord: He hath
torne, and he will heale us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up:
after two dayes will he revive us, and the third day he will raiſe us
up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> Wherein he ſhewes the meanes
whereby the Lord will apply this medicine to his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
namely by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, to
which he doth allude; that <hi>as Chriſt dyed, and roſe the third day,</hi>
ſo ſhall all that have part and portion in him; They may lye
in danger, but they ſhall come out in due time: but however,
it ſhould be a warning to the ſonnes of men how they adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their lives by going into any danger where God calls
them not: But if you be brought into danger when the Lord
doth deliver, you have cauſe to bleſſe him, and to render your
ſelves and Families back to him, that you may walke with
more girt up ſpirits to God, that ſo he may not repent of
what deliverances he vouchſafeth to you.</p>

               <p>3. The cauſes are ſet forth that made them to worſhip
them both; The <hi>Dragon</hi> in that he gave power to the
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> for his unmatchable power. <hi>Who is
like unto the Beaſt? who is able to make war with him?</hi> Here
might be three or four Notes juſtly gathered from hence,
but becauſe I affect brevity in myſticall Scriptures, I ſhall
compact them into one: The note is this;</p>
               <p>That upon the healing of the Beaſts wounded head,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> all the world
fell into an admiration of the Beaſt, and of his power, yea into an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of worſhip, both of the Beaſt, and of the Dragon.</p>
               <p>This containes both the latter end of the third, and part
of the fourth verſ.</p>
               <p>For the cauſes of this Admiration, they will be juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the point.</p>
               <p>To open the Doctrine [upon the healing of this wounded
head of the Beaſt] Remember the Beaſt is the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
viſible Church, whereof <hi>Rome</hi> was the mother City, and
mother Church, accounted of all the Churches in the world,
and the Pope is the viſible head of this Church, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
called the ſeventh head.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly. the healing of this ſeventh Head, wounded by
the captivity and calamity it fell into by barbarous Nations.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57074:29"/>
Upon the healing of this wounded Head, by the removal, and
ſcattering, and ſubduing of theſe Enemies, as alſo by the
playſter that was put to him, when ſuch Titles of Soveraign
Authority, were put upon him by the Emperors: Now this
was the Originall of that wonder, for ſo it comes in; <hi>His
deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered after the beaſt:</hi>
And ſo he expreſſeth it, <hi>Chap. 17. 8. All that dwell upon the
earth ſhall wonder when they behold the Beaſt that was, and is not,
and yet is.</hi> He was when he flouriſhed, as that which was the
great Authority of the world: He is not, when he is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his head; but as it were troden under foot, wounded
to death, as if he had not been: But yet he is againe, that is,
he is reſtored: <hi>And they that dwell on the earth, when they ſaw
that, wondered to behold the Beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is;</hi> A
Beaſt that cannot be cruſhed and beaten downe with ſuch deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
calamities, ſo that's the occaſion of their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
now upon this occaſion they fell into an admiration
of the Beaſt, and of his power. An admiration implies ſome
high eſteem of ſome great happineſſe betiding this Beaſt, not
only beyond their expectation, but tranſcendant, beyond
their apprehenſion and capacity to underſtand. For a man
doth not admire a thing, unleſſe it goe not only beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
but is tranſcendant above his reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
Yea, beyond any meanes he could uſe to bring ſuch
a thing to paſſe: Therefore when they ſee this great change,
they fall admiring of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the head of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and
of the <hi>Dragon</hi> that gave power to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and worſhip them
both. For their Admiration then, let me ſpeak ſomething of
that; and then of their Adoration both of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of
the <hi>Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was in a way of Admiration; I will not ſay what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
ſome have made of it, ſome that were called Fathers
of the Church, and have left ſuch things in writing: It would
mightily poſſeſſe one with Admiration of the Sea of Rome,
looking at him as the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> looking
at him as by his Primacy to be like <hi>Adam,</hi> for his Faith like
<hi>Abraham,</hi> for his government like <hi>Noah,</hi> gathering all the
world under him; for Order like <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> for his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57074:29"/>
to be Chriſt himſelfe, deſervedly to be God, after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called the Vicar of Chriſt, and of God; marvellous
tranſcendant ſtrains put upon him, which argues a high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of him: But to omit ſuch things as are but flouriſhes,
theſe are reall.</p>
               <p>1. That all the Churches of the world are to receive all
their doctrine and worſhip from them; Though it were
never ſo ſuperſtitious, as worſhipping of Angels, and
Saints, and making uſe of their meditation beſides Chriſt;
and they did receive from them more then all this, which
is the life and quintiſcence of all. They looked from the
Father of the Catholick viſible Church to receive Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
and pardon of all their ſinnes: If he retained
them, then they were retained; if he remitted them, they
were remitted: This they looked for from him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Doctrine and worſhip, but for ſealing up their
Pardon for ſo many hundreds and thouſands of years,
and not ſealed with waxe, but with a wap of Lead, and a
Seale ſet on that: And this was the chiefe comfort of
troubled minds in thoſe ages, theſe things they received
from them, and admirable honour they put upon that
Beaſt, to receive all ſuch things from them.</p>
               <p>2. They made to <hi>Rome</hi> all their Appeals: What ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
there was in the Chriſtian world, from thence
were their Laws, and thither were their Appeals, as out
of <hi>England</hi> and many other places, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of Church and Common-wealth, as alſo large and
bountifull payments were made to them: It were a vaſt
thing to ſum up the totall ſum of conſtant payments
that were from every Kingdome repayed to the Sea of
<hi>Rome:</hi> And as their Appeals &amp; Payments went to <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſo did their bodies on pilgrimage, and it was thought a
great devotion to kiſſe the feet of the Pope, and to ſee
thoſe bleſſed Shrines; Thus was their admiration of the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>3. They fetched from <hi>Rome</hi> the Ordination of all their
chiefe Officers: Any Arch-biſhop, who-ever choſe him,
yet he was not inſtalled, but he muſt fetch it from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and pay well for it. And from thence they fetched all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57074:30"/>
their Coronation of Kings and Emperors; and ſundry
fundamentall Lawes of every Catholick Kingdom were
derived from thence. All their Diſpenſations were
fetched from thence, that Princes might marry where
they would: And diſpenſation from Oaths, and from
Marriages contracted, all theſe things they fetched from
<hi>Rome:</hi> It was an admirable honour they put upon the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon the Head of it; what ever the
firſt Beaſt did, the ſecond Beaſt alſo did; and ſo in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the one, they worſhipped the other; and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
one, they admired both.</p>
               <p>4. They expreſſe their admiration in this, that they will
undertake eſtabliſhing of Laws from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and perſecution of ſuch godly perſons as did not ſubmit,
ſuch as were different in their minds from the Catholick
Church, if they never ſo little ſwerve from that, they
undertook to execute the Laws of the Church: And if the
Church declared him him to be an Heretick, there was
no more to do, the Common-wealth preſently put him
to death: And as they took upon them perſecution of
their Subjects at home, ſo the Subjects took upon them
to depoſe their Princes, and might depoſe them, if they
would not ſubmit their power to the Pope, ſo that there
was no ſubſiſting without ſubmitting to them. And
which is a branch of this, they undertook a vaſt and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
War abroad, againſt the common Enemy the Turke,
whereas in very deed, whilſt the Pope ſtands, it is not
poſſible any War ſhould proſper againſt him; for it was
for the ſinne of <hi>Rome</hi> that the Turk was advanced, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and beaſtly Enemy, to puniſh a beaſtly Religion:
This was their admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the world wondered after the Beaſt.]</hi> He meanes as he
expounds himſelfe, <hi>ver. 8. Thoſe whoſe names are not written in
the book of the life of the Lamb.</hi> They that were redeemed from
the world, they were not of the world, though they lived in
it: but thoſe in the world that were of the world, they did
honour this beaſt, and were ſubject to him, and gave all their
devotion to the Catholick Church: And when I ſay all the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57074:30"/>
world, I meane all the Chriſtian world, which was the viſible
face of the world, the reputed world; Theſe barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not then ſo owned; but as for the Eaſtern world,
they were all willing to give way to this tranſcendant Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in a generall Councell at <hi>Aſia:</hi>
They looked at the reigning and Imperiall City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
the chiefeſt Seate of the Catholick Church, the higheſt throne
of that Church, and were content that no Councell ſhould
be ratified but by him: If hee ratified a Councell in ſo many
Canons, it was eſtabliſhed; if he did not, then they were not;
and the Emperors were willing it ſhould be ſo, becauſe they
found inſufficiency in themſelves to maintaine the Royal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Rome againſt barbarous Nations: And therefore they
thought it State-policy to maintain the Biſhop of Rome, and
let him grow up to as great power as he could; It was as
they thought, the preſervation of their State (but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their ruine) ſo they willingly gave their power to the
beaſt: Now the barbarous Nations that had not forſaken the
Country, and had builded them houſes, they that were not
driven out (as many reſted in ſome parts of the Empire)
they willingly cloſed with ſuch a Religion as was pretty ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
to their apprehenſions, they began to comply with
it, and put their necks under it. <hi>Charles</hi> the Great having
received the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> from the Pope, he did his
beſt endeavour to bring the people to yeeld themſelves, but
the people were ſomewhat ſowr and rugged that way to be
wrought upon: Therefore the Pope had another ſophiſtry to
help himſelfe; He ſends three Apoſtles, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, he
was one Apoſtle that he ſent for <hi>England,</hi> and he brings great
Reformation, that is, he ſways the whole State to the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe that would not yeeld were miſerably
ſlaughtered. And <hi>Bonifacius</hi> he did the like in <hi>Genevah,</hi> and in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> And where ever the
world was Chriſtian, it was now Catholick, all ſubmitted to
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo by this means all the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
him, they received doctrine and worſhip from Rome,
they will goe for pardon of Sin thither: They make Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
to <hi>Rome,</hi> Appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> From thence they receive
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57074:31"/>
their fundamental Conſtitutions, Diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſations, Perſecutions,
depoſition of Princes; They receive and undertake generall
war from thence for the recovery of the holy Land: And in
one word, in ſuch admiration the Beaſt of <hi>Rome</hi> was, that it
was a Proverb among them, <hi>He ruled all the world;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ruled all the Churches, and was eſteemed to be God
on Earth: Thus did all the world wonder after the Beaſt, and
admire him, and ſo did they alſo hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> power: They did exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
admire his power; <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make warre with him?</hi> It is not cleare adoration, but it is
an attributing to the Beaſt, that which is peculiar to God;
<hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God?</hi> Exod. 15. 11. It is a ſtyle of
the high and mighty God: This admiration of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power and holineſſe it is now added to the Pope: <hi>Who is
like unto the Beaſt? who is able to make warr with him? Who is the
Lord of hoſts but our God?</hi> as if he were invincible: For they had
found, that when ſome of the Grecian Emperours that had
given their power to the Beaſt did vary in point of judgment
(as they did not love to take up the worſhip of Images) then
the Beaſt is offended, and excommunicates him, and deprives
him of his Empire, and gives it to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> puts him into a Monaſtery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
<hi>Fredericke,</hi> firſt and ſecond: And what he did with
King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> you know; He deprived him of his
Kingdome, and hee makes ſome of them do very hard pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
whiles he was ſolacing himſelfe with his Harlot: She
being more compaſſionate then he, beſought his Holineſſe to
have compaſſion on him, and ſo he ſent him back, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they made him away: And his Son, when they came
to Crown him, it muſt be with the Popes foot; and when he
hath done, he daſheth it off, to ſhew, that he hath power to
take it as eaſily from him, as to fell it from his head. Though
great men, and greatly beloved of the people, all is nothing,
if they be alienated from the Pope: All mens affections are
his; when he turns, the whole body turns; when the head
moves, the whole body doth accordingly: So that it was
marvellous admirable power that he had; whom he would he
ſet up, and whom he would he pulled downe. <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſaid,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57074:31"/>
gave it to him, and he did what he would to thoſe that were
on the earth, this is great power. They profeſſe, if their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father carry many millions of ſoules to Hell, yet no man
muſt ſay, Sir, why do you ſo: All appeals were from him, ſo
that there is tranſcendant, ſoveraign power, and indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
ſuch as no man can attaine; Power to pardon ſin, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to bind Conſcience, to diſpence with the Law of God, to
interpret and judg of Scripture as he ſees cauſe, and this is
ſuch power, as is far above the reach of man: None of them
all have ſuch power as he, not thoſe that are called Gods:
So they admire his power, what he can do to inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, to publique or private States. And they do not
only admire the Catholick Church, and the head of it, and
adore them; but in both theſe they adore the Dragon that
gave all this power to the Beaſt. The meaning may be expreſt
in two branches.</p>
               <p>1. The Dragon is expreſſed as animating heathen <hi>Rome,</hi>
for that hath ſeven heads and ten horns, which are the
armes, both of heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and of this Beaſt: Now
he is called the Dragon, as he acted heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and as
he was Lord of heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> he gave all this power to
the Pope; For they thought it meet, ſince it was the
Imperiall City when it was Pagan, that therefore it
ſhould be the mother of all Churches: And being the
Imperial City, it was the bloud-ſucker of many millions
of the ſouls of Gods ſervants, that cauſed the Dragon
to put that honour upon <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But that is not all, There is another branch comes
neerer the full meaning of the Text; that was for the
honouring of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Catholick
Church, <hi>viz.</hi> taking another doctrine for the Goſpell,
their Idolatry for pure worſhip, their Government for
the diſcipline of Chriſt, their pardons for Juſtification
of ſinne by Chriſt; In all this they doe indeed give true
worſhip to the Dragon, for what are all theſe but Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
they are none of Gods Ordinances; if you referre
them to the heads of Scripture, they are but Images of
Chriſt; In ſtead of the Miniſtery of Chriſt, you have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57074:32"/>
of men; In ſtead of juſtification by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, you have juſtification by works; In ſtead
of pardon of Sin from Chriſt, you have it from the Pope;
All things are in another forme, an Image of another
forme ſet up, deviſed, contrary to what the word eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth:
Now you ſhall finde this to be true; if you doe
vary from the kingdome of God, and Chriſt, then you
worſhip the Dragon: You read in 2 <hi>Chron. 11. 15. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
ordained him Prieſts, for the high places, and for
the Devils, and for the Calves, which he had made: he
had no Preiſts but for the golden Calves, and what were
they? they were but Images, and his intendment was
not to bring in another object of worſhip, but another
manner of worſhip; <hi>Jeroboam</hi> worſhiped Jehovah in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
which God had not appointed, and ſo he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the Divill, and not God. And you ſhall read,
when the <hi>Turke</hi> was brought in to revenge the Idolatry
of Chriſtendome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20. It is ſaid, <hi>The people that
were not cut off with the plague, they repented not of the worke
of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devils, and Idols of
Gold and Silver, and braſſe, and Stone, and of wood, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can ſee, nor hear, nor walk:</hi> which ſhews, that when
men worſhip Images, that is, God in Images; it is not
God that is ſo worſhipped, but the Divill, and all ſuch
worſhip doth not advance the kingdome of God, but
the kingdome of the Devill, therefore it is reall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him: and therefore this their taking all this
vaſt honour (all Churches receiving all from them) is
none of Gods Inſtitution, but the Devils practice, for
it was the Devill that gave him his power and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
Therefore ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>they worſhiped
the Dragon who gave power unto the Beaſt, and they worſhipped
the beaſt:</hi> This worſhip of the beaſt they gave it all to him
that gave this power to him, which was to the Dragon;
and therfore you read that he had the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit, <hi>Rev. 9. 1, 2. And he opened the bottomleſſe pit, and
there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit, as the ſmoke of a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and there came out of the ſmoke locuſts upon the earth:</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57074:32"/>
There went out Monks &amp; Friars, and a rabble of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
               <p>Now if you ſhall aske the reaſon why people upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of this wound did ſo mightily admire both the viſible
Catholick Church, and the head of it, and adore both, and
Satan himſelfe in both? The reaſon was,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> from the wrong Interpretation of ſome Scriptures,
which were very frequent with them in thoſe dayes, and are
ſtill; and that was, that the Catholick Roman Church was
builded upon a rock, and that rock was the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and into his hand the Lord Jeſus by <hi>Peter</hi> had given the keys
of the kingdome of Heaven, and theſe keys had abſolute uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
power to binde on Earth, and upon his binding on
earth, Chriſt would bind in heaven: this was an error in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that did ſo poſſeſſe their hearts, that upon the healing
of this wounded head, all the world did admire him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes a large diſcourſe; <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion
a chief corner ſtone, and they that truſt in him ſhall never be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi>
and ſo never was there any man that was an enemy to
the Catholick Church, but was confounded; nor never did
any man ſtand for the Catholick Church, but was preſerved:
and ſo they did admire him; A great inundation of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations were all driven out by the piety of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome;</hi> they were able to overturn the Emperors of the
Eaſt (and it was overturned) and bring them to his feet, and
all to be at his diſpoſing; This was ſome confirmation to
them, that he was the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> that now whoever is
ſaved, it muſt be by the power of this key, or elſe never look
for any ſaving in this world.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon may be taken from the correſpondency
and plauſableneſſe of ſuch a kinde of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to carnall reaſon.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> eſpecially when it is ſubdued by any
terrors of conſceence: for it was a ſeaſon (and that held
many years together) wherein the Prieſts, Friers, and Monks,
had marvellous power to ſting the conſciences of men with
the loathſomneſſe of their ſinne in the ſight of God, and
they had admirable dexterity therein: Theſe foure things
were all the matter of their Sermons, Vertue and vice, Heaven
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57074:33"/>
and Hell; If you be vertuous, then you ſhall go to Heaven;
If you be vicious, then you muſt go to Hell: Now they
would ſo convince mens conſciences, and upon conviction
binde the conſcience under terror, as eternally ſhut out of
Heaven, for want of virtue, which they had not; that indeed
when theſe mens conſciences are thus perplexed and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
here is a Religion that findes them ſo many ſalves and
medicines, as eaſe the power, but not remove the cauſe of the
diſeaſe; that is, they ſet men a courſe; well, though you be
vicious, and though Hell be dreadfull, yet Purgatory may
eaſe you by Prayer, and you may be diſpenſed with from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Hell, eſpecially by the Popes pardon, or by your own
workes, by your confeſſions, by ſelfe-whippings and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
or by going a Pilgrimage, you may be diſcharged of
this burden; This was very plauſable to carnall reaſon, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if they gave ſo much to ſuch a Monaſtery, that they
may offer ſo many Sacraments for them (for they look at the
bread in the Lords ſupper as a propiatory Sacrament:) here
were ſo many means to ſatisfie the conſciences of thoſe that
were ſuperſtitious, as nothing could be deviſed to give better
content to the ſpirits of men in thoſe dayes: any man that
knowes it, ſhall finde it true, that when the conſcience is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the curſe of Gods Law, and never ſhewed the true
way of fellowſhip with Chriſt, no man is ſo tender and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
in the performance of all duties as they: If you
will have them kiſſe the Popes foot, or give ſo much to a
Monaſtery; and by this means Hell ſhall be ſhut againſt them,
and Purgatory diſcharged: But for aſſurance of Salvation
in Chriſt, they could not endure that; they that ſtood
for that, they tell them, what, you will not have men doe
good workes, away with that, faggot and halter for ſuch
Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> there was a third Reaſon, and that was from the
great reverence of all Councells, and Synods to the Sea of
<hi>Rome.</hi> The City of <hi>Rome</hi> had wont to be the imperiall City,
now in ſuch a caſe as this they thought it but reaſonable; In
heatheniſh <hi>Rome</hi> they gave all worſhip to them, and ſo let
Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> give all their worſhip to the chief Head there,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57074:33"/>
and ſo to their mother Church, all Catholicks would incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others ſo to doe; and ſo by this means there were ſuch
incouragements laid for admiration and adoration, that you
may not wonder at what the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>That when the
wound was healed, all the world wondred after the beaſt, ſaying, who
is like unto the beaſt? who is able to make war with him?</hi> Not
the Emperors of the Eaſt and Weſt, not the King of <hi>England,
France, Spain,</hi> nor all that have been of greateſt force, they
were none of them able to hold up their heads againſt this
great Beaſt. The uſe of this point is thus much;</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> you may obſerve from hence, that Univerſality,
and Proſperity, though they be given for two notes of a true
Church by the Papiſts, yet indeed they are but ſopiſticall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
deluſions; They are not ſuch marks of a Church as
are peculiar to a true Church; here is Univerſality, <hi>All the
world wondred after the beaſt;</hi> and here is Proſperity, all the
world adore, and admire the Beaſt; <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt?
who is able to make war with him?</hi> Not all the Princes of the
world: So that here is externall proſperity, for ſo they call
it; here are both theſe concur, and they doe indeed argue a
Catholick Church, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith; but note this, that
Catholick Church which is viſible, (which is the Roman vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Catholick Church) the Scripture holds it forth as a
great, and ugly, and monſtrous Beaſt: look not therefore at
theſe as any good marks and ſignes, by which Jeſuites, and
Seminaries are wont to draw to deep devotion to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, for all the world have run this way, there
is but a handfull, a few of ſuch as are otherwiſe minded;
what is <hi>Genevah</hi> and ſome others to <hi>Rome?</hi> what have they
been able to doe in compariſon of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which is the Church of Churches, none have been able to doe
as they.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> we may ſee the danger of this admiration, and
adoration, the deadly and deſperate danger of adoring the
Catholick viſible Church and the Dragon. It is the cunning
of theſe Prieſts and Jeſuites to draw men by all means to be
at leaſt devoted to the Catholick Church, and to ſubmit
their power thereunto; for they ſay there is no union with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57074:34"/>
Chriſt the head, unleſſe you be united to the viſible head on
Earth; this is their uſuall plea: Now marke what the holy
Ghoſt ſpeaks in this Text; he doth ſay, that all the worſhip
of this mother Church is but the worſhip of the Dragon.
Men are devoutly adicted to give up their ſouls to the Devill,
when they give up themſelves to the Catholicke viſible
Church, the Lord profeſſeth he is not honoured by them;
they profeſſe honour to he-Saints and ſhee-Saints, and dead
Saints, and to all relicks and remnants of them; the honour
of them is given unto the Devill, and not to God. That look
what <hi>Paul</hi> ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of heathen <hi>Rome, John</hi> ſpeaks of chriſtian
<hi>Rome; This I ſay,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 20. That the
things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not
to God; and I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils;</hi>
And ſo this ſaith <hi>John</hi> the holy Apoſtle (equall to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> or next him, but here guided equally with <hi>Paul</hi> in
the Authentical word of God) he ſaith, <hi>They that worſhip God
according to the preſcript of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>they worſhip the
Devils, and not God; they worſhip the Dragon, the old Serpent.</hi> So
that it is not ſo light a matter as Gallants at Court, and great
Kings apprehend, they will be reconciled to their mother
Church, they will goe a Pilgrimage that is deviſed by the
Pope, and perform duties as their ghoſtly Father directs
them, and have their bead-prayers; In all this what do they
doe? This is a worſhip to the great beaſt, but this is the iſſue,
and ſubſtance of it, they doe indeed worſhip the Dragon; It
is not the Lord Jeſus, nor God the Father, nor the bleſſed
ſpirit that is thus worſhipped, but this is indeed the worſhip
of the Devill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">

the Lord, that hath delivered us from this admiration and
adoration, from this wofull Captivity and Calamity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Fathers have been enthralled; All thoſe of them
<hi>whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book of life,</hi> they were
all led this way; and it is a marvellous deliverance that God
hath wrought for us in taking our Religion from univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and from outward proſperity. It is ſometimes a ſnare
to Chriſtians, this kinde of Government that we have, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57074:34"/>
they are apt to ſay what doe any of the great Nations of the
world for worſhip and Government; did you ever know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch thing authoriſed in any Kingdome? There is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principle in us by nature to doe as all the world doe:
what, are we more wiſe then they? It is a great temptation,
but we have cauſe to bleſſe God that hath wrought delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for us; But what if all the world did worſhip the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
as time was when they did? what if all the world wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Beaſt, and the Dragon that gave power to the Beaſt,
muſt we doe ſo? And as they are not grounds of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſo they are fit grounds of unfeigned thankfulneſſe to
God that hath delivered us from that Religion by which all
the world was bewitched to give their Crownes, Honours,
Bodies, and States to the devotion of the viſible Catholick
Church, and to the head of that Church: It is cauſe of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
thankfulneſſe and watchfulneſſe, not to be deluded
by fine ſhewes of worldly men, but let us ſee and know where
true worſhip lies, as the Lord hath declared himſelf in Chriſt,
and held him forth in the Goſpel of truth.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> let it teach us all where to beſtow our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and adoration; It was a charge that our Saviour gave
to the Devill, (and which accordingly he himſelf practiſed,
and requires us to doe) <hi>Mat. 4. 10. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord
thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> The Devill askes this
of Chriſt to bow downe to him and worſhip him; The Lords
Indignation is kindled, his holy Zeale is inflamed againſt
ſuch a Sacriligious requeſt; <hi>Get thee hence Satan, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou
ſerve.</hi> And as we are to worſhip him alone, and no God but
him, ſo we are to admire none but him; <hi>Who is like unto thee,
O Lord amongſt the Gods? who is like unto thee, glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders,</hi> Exod. 15. 11. There is
matter of admiration; <hi>who is a God like unto the Lord that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sinne;</hi> of which you read, <hi>Mic.</hi>
7. 18. and which the Church holds forth there upon this very
ground: <hi>who is a God like unto thee?</hi> why what is there in him
that you ſo magnifie him? <hi>he is a God that forgives Iniquity,
Tranſgreſſion, and Sinne;</hi> here is cauſe indeed of admiration.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57074:35"/>
They admire and adore the Pope, why? Becauſe they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to their conſciences in their way, and an ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hope of a better ſtate in another world, and pardon of
Sinne in this, and now they come to fellowſhip with Chriſt
by the worſhip of the Devill: <hi>But who is a God like unto thee
that pardoneth Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sinne?</hi> So that here is
indeed matter of due admiration, and let it be faſtned there.
When a mans ſoul is brought low with the ſence of Sinne,
and overpoured with the burden that lyes upon his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by reaſon of the guilt of Sinne; what is matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
now? <hi>who is a God like unto thee, that paſſeth by Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
tranſgreſſion, &amp; ſin?</hi> It is not the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> that can take
away ſin, it is not all the cunning of the Dragon that can do
it: And therefore to what end are all the admirations, and
worſhips that are put upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
that gave him his power? They may pleaſe themſelves
in what ſatisfaction they apprehend they have, but their own
principles poſſeſſe them, that they can never come to ſee the
admirable goodneſſe of God in forgiving their Sinnes. But
now when the Lord ſheds abroad a ſpirit of grace and peace
in the conſcience, and applyes the goodneſſe of Chriſt to the
diſcharge of the burden of Sinne, and of quickning the heart
in the peace of Chriſt Jeſus, this breeds admiration: <hi>Bleſſed
be God the Father of mercy, and God of all conſolation, that of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant
mercy hath begotten us again to a lively hope:</hi> I ſay this
bleſſing is worthy of admiration, and not onely of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but of acknowledging all glory and bleſſednes to him.
When the conſcience is not pacified by a ſorry duty done
from man, but by a ſealed pardon from the ſpirit of God,
witneſſed by the breath of the holy Ghoſt; this is ſuch a
mercy to the ſoule; as indeed raiſeth the heart above all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of ſuch a Beaſt, I, to a true deteſtation of this Beaſt,
and of the Dragon that hath ſo long bewitched, and carried
them captive to the imaginations of their own hearts, and in
the end to their everlaſting perdition. But let it be the care
of Gods people, as ever you deſire to be bleſſed from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of ſuch a worm-eaten Religion, ſo grow to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the God of mercy and grace: and ſo we ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57074:35"/>
doe that upon juſt grounds, which our Fathers did without
grounds, to this Beaſt, and to the head of it. Upon this
ground, this head being wounded, and afterwards healed, all
the world wondred after him: Here is an Image of Chriſt,
<hi>he was wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed:</hi> and he
riſeth againe, and he proclaims all power is given him, in
Heaven and Earth; Now ſee how this Vicar of Chriſt (as
they call him) uſurps; as Chriſt was wounded, and is riſen
againe; ſo it is with this Beaſt, he is wounded to death, and
afterwards healed and reſtored, and now all the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
and worſhip him: Have they forgotten that <hi>Chriſt dyed
for our Sinnes, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification?</hi> and doe
they ſtand admiring at this Beaſt as he that was wounded, and
healed? Therefore let it be a ground of true thankfulneſſe to
the Lord, for the great change that is wrought in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and let us give the Lord the admiration that is due to
him, that we may be preſerved from thoſe deluſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
others have been deceived and may goe on in this way
conſtantly which the Lord hath eſtabliſhed, and called us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

               <p>THE events that followed upon the healing of the Beaſt;

was, <hi>

that gave power to the Beaſt,</hi> of which wee have already ſpoken.
The third event remains now to be ſpoken to, and that is,
the deligation of power to this Beaſt, upon his recovery, and
the power given him is four-fold.</p>
               <p>1. There was power given him to ſpeak great things, and
in particular, great blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There was power given him to continue,</hi> that is, as the word
ſignifies, to be doing, to be active, to be powerfull and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in his worke 42. moneths.</p>
               <p>3. There was power given him to make war with the Saints, and
to overcome them.</p>
               <p>4. Power was given him of dominion over all Kindreds, Tongues,
and Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There was given him a mouth ſpeaking great things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There was power given him to continue 42. moneths,</hi>
and both theſe Authorities or Liberties, they are amplified
by the effect it wrought in the Beaſt: He did effectually take
that power which was given him, and employed it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.
As he had a mouth given him, ſo he opened his mouth
in blaſphemies, and that amplified by the object of his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
againſt God, and God diſtributed, his Name, his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and thoſe that dwell in Heaven. The note then that
the words do afford firſt, is this.</p>
               <p>That after the healing of the wounded head of the Beaſt,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> there was
given to him power to ſpeak great things, even blaſphemies, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57074:36"/>
alſo he did effectually and abundantly exerciſe, or put forth.</p>
               <p>For ſo it is here ſaid, <hi>There was given him a mouth ſpeaking
great things and blaſphemies,</hi> and he opened his mouth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
abundantly againſt God, and againſt his name, and
his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven: Every thing
of God he did with open mouth blaſpheme.</p>
               <p>Let me a little open the words, and the Doctrine, for the
doctrine is in a manner the words of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was given him a mouth.]</hi> what mouth had he more
then other men? The meaning is, he had ſuch liberty of
ſpeech as no man had; <hi>There was given him liberty, and power,
and authority to ſpeak great things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Given him.]</hi> by whom?</p>
               <p>1. It was given him by God in his juſt judgment that gave
up men to efficacy of deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>2. It was given him by Satan, in the efficacy of whoſe
power Antichriſt comes, <hi>with all deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
2 Theſ. 2. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>3. It was given him by the generall conſent of Princes and
States Eccleſiaſticall and Civill. In Eccleſiaſticall Councels,
great was the authority that was given him, none of all them
thought themſelves equall to him: And for the Civill State,
God put it into their hearts to give their power and Throne
unto the beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17.</p>
               <p>What power did they give him to ſpeak great things, and
in particular blaſphemies? It is an alluſion to the horn in
<hi>Dan. 2. 8. There came up a little horne which had a mouth ſpeaking
great things;</hi> whether it be the ſame Beaſt, or a type of him, I
will not now ſtand to determine, but great things he ſpoke;
as indeed this was a great thing that the Catholick Church
had power to ſpeak, for he did open his mouth to ſpeak
great things, that is, ſuch things, as for other men to ſpeake,
were too great arrogance, and too much affectation of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Vain-glory; but for this Church, or the head of it
to ſpeak, they had a mouth given for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Blaſphemies.]</hi> They make many diſtinctions in Schools
of Blaſphemies, which I will not trouble you with: they
may be brought to two heads, either in attributing to God
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57074:37"/>
ſomething unworthy of him, things incompatible to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. It is blaſphemy to aſcribe to
God likeneſſe of four-footed beaſts, or creeping things, and
the like. Or otherwiſe, if you attribute to the Creature that
which properly doth belong to God, you hurt the name of
God, and cruſh it when you ſo ſpeak. Now what is it for
the Beaſt to open his mouth, to ſpeak great things and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies?
The phraſe is very ſignificant in the Hebrew: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
three things.</p>
               <p>1. That a man ſpeaks upon the meditation: He opens his
mouth to ſpeak, that is to ſay, he hath ſomething to ſay, and
power to deliver it, and he ſets himſelfe of purpoſe to ſpeak
it: <hi>I will open my mouth in wiſdome, and the meditation of my heart
ſhall be of underſtanding,</hi> Pſal. 49. 3, 4. He tells you of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and then he will open his mouth, and declare it.</p>
               <p>2. To open the mouth implies an audable, and full, and
bold, and confident expreſſion of a mans minde, that a man
doth not whiſper, but lift up his voyce, and declare with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
mouth what he hath to deliver; as in <hi>Exod. 3. 23. Open
thy mouth and tell them,</hi> that is, ſpeak boldly: Though they be
a rebellious People, and will brow-beate thee, <hi>yet open thy
mouth, and ſpeake unto them;</hi> ſpeak boldly, and confidently, as
one that goes not behind the door, but ſpeaks plainly: And
I put in plainly with boldneſſe, becauſe they are ever conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants.
If a man ſpeak boldly, he doth not extenuate what
he hath to deliver, but ſpeaks it plainly.</p>
               <p>3. This opening of the mouth doth imply that hee ſpeaks
fully and abundantly, his heart was full of it, and he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
powr out that which he delivers: As <hi>Elihu</hi> tells
you in <hi>Job 32. 18, 19, 20. I am full of matter, the ſpirit within
me conſtraineth me: Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent,
it is ready to burſt like new bottles,</hi> &amp;c. So the meaning is this,
That as the Pope ſaw (which was the head of this Beaſt) that
he had a mouth given him; that is, uncontrollable liberty to
ſpeak what he would: He did not ſodainly or raſhly ſpeake,
ſome inconſiderate, or erroneous, or arrogant ſpeech which
he did eate in againe; but he ſpake adviſedly in his grave and
conſiderate Councell, upon adviſed judgment he did ſpeak
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57074:37"/>
great things and blaſphemies: And this he did plainly and
boldly, not in ambiguous or obſcure phraſes, but plainly
in ſuch expreſſions as could beare no other meaning; and
that with ſuch confidence, that you may ſee he cared not
who heard, nor what Conſtruction might be made of it.
And this he did, not in a word or two that dropped from
him, but as flowing from him; Hee was full of matter, as
2 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is
enlarged.</hi> He did poure forth his matter with no little State;
it was ſtout matter that he did poure forth to the world.
What did hee ſpeake? that which was given him to ſpeake.
What was that? <hi>Great things.</hi> As for inſtance, to ſum up the
great things he ſpeaks: The Catholick Roman Church in
Scripture is accounted <hi>the mother of Harlots, and abomination of
the earth,</hi> Rev. 17. 5. There is not ſuch an adulterous Church
in the world.</p>
               <p>1. And yet is not this a great word and a great blaſphmy,
for the mother of Harlots to hold forth her ſelfe as the only
immaculate Spouſe of Chriſt upon the face of the Earth? Is
not this a grand word for a common Harlot, the mother of
Harlots, the lewdeſt Harlot that ever the earth bore, for her
to arrogate this ſtile as the only Church of Chriſt? And
that which is parallel to this, that the Pope (who is the head
of this Beaſt) is the head and Husband of this Church, and is
without controule: He hath a mouth given him, and he is
not aſhamed to ſpeak great things, and blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>2. It is a great word to make himſelfe the infallible Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
and abſolute judge of Scriptures, that cannot erre
in deriſion, or determination of any controverſies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor may it be for any mortall man to controll his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
nor practice.</p>
               <p>In Judgment he cannot erre: in practice, though he may
erre, yet other men may be judged; but God hath put ſuch
an uncontrollable power upon him, as he thinks that none
may meddle with him; Though he ſhould carry millions of
ſoules to Hell, yet no man muſt ſay, Sir, why do you ſo:
Councels may not judge, Princes may not judge, inferiour
States may not judge him, all the world may not judge him;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57074:38"/>
He ſtands and falls to the Canoniſts, his owne well-ſtudied
Canoniſts have ſo determined it: A great word to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
judge of Scripture, and to be uncontrollable; it is a great
matter, and greater then any man can reach unto: Never did
any earthly Prince challenge that he could not erre, nor that
none muſt controll him if he did: There have been Laws made
to controll the greateſt Princes: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was taught
to be controlled, that in the end <hi>Shadrach, Meſech,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi>
goe away rewarded,</p>
               <p>3. The Catholick Church, and the Pope is the head of it,
claimes a power of binding and looſing. To bind mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
by his Laws, and to looſe mens conſciences by his
Indulgences, and that not miniſterially, as Miniſters do from
the Word, but by a Juditiary power, to diſſolve the bond of
naturall Obedience, inceſtuous Marriages, Oaths and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
in Marriage; Natural relations between Parents and
Children, and morall Relations between Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
There is not any bond that he cannot looſe, nor any
liberty which he cannot reſtraine: And this not over a few
only, but over the vaſt world ſo far as it is Chriſtian. And</p>
               <p>4. It is a great thing he ſpeakes (and he ſpeakes it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the door) when he challengeth Soveraign dominion
(in way of advancement of Religion) over all Kingdoms, ſo
as to depoſe their Kings, and diſpoſe of their Kingdoms, leave
any State to chooſe where he hath power: If his Crowne be
to be fetched from <hi>Rome</hi> (as it was in former times when it
was moſt active) He will ſet it on, but daſh it off againe, out
of the plentitude of his power, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et up and throw downe at
his pleaſure. He opened his mouth to ſpeak great things; He
is never ſo in his element as when he doth hold forth ſuch vaſt
authority, and divine propriety, proper to the Father, Son,
and holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Now as he ſpeaks great things, ſo blaſphemes againſt God,
and wherein? <hi>Againſt his Name, and Tabernacle, and them that
dwell in heaven. Againſt his name:</hi> All theſe are blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Gods name, to attribute all theſe divine properties to a
beaſtly man, to a great beaſt. And it is blaſphemy to aſcribe
any divine honour, or to put it upon any creature: Images
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57074:38"/>
ſerved, the holy Ghoſt calls blaſphemy. <hi>Iſa. 65. 7. You have
blaſphemed me upon every green hill.</hi> And in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 27, 28.
he complaines of the like blaſphemy, <hi>that they blaſphemed him
by their Idolatires.</hi> In <hi>Mar. 2. 7. Why doth this man ſpeak blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
who can forgive ſins but God onely?</hi> It were to ſpeak blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
in any but in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is againſt his Tabernacle;</hi> that may be either
meant the body of Chriſt, as 1 <hi>John 14. He tabernacled amongſt
us.</hi> Or it may be meant the viſible Churches, ſuch as are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by him. For the body of Chriſt, it is blaſphemy to go
to every Maſſe Prieſt, to make him the body and blood of
our Saviour. Or if you underſtand the Tabernacle to be the
Church; that is the Temple of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. Now to
call the Church of Chriſt a Conventicle of Hereticks and
Schiſmaticks, it is blaſphemy, and ſo they count all the
Churches here: And for the Saints in heaven, to put upon
them divine worſhip, to build Temples to them, to put up
Prayers to them, to keep Holy-dayes to them, it is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to them, it is a great diſhonour. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
when they ſaw men to come and offer ſacrifice to them, <hi>Men
and brethren why doe you theſe things?</hi> you cannot do us a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
injury. And for the Saints in heaven, that is, pure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
he condemns them for Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, and
as unworthy of Chriſtian communion, and Chriſtian burial,
theſe are blaſphemies: So you ſee the meaning of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<hi>There was given him a mouth to ſpeake great things, and to
blaſpheme God, in his Name, in his Tabernacle, in thoſe that dwell in
Heaven:</hi> Thus hath he done many yeares, and thus doth hee
ſtill.</p>
               <p>Now for the reaſon of the point; you ſee the point ſtands
upon two branches.</p>
               <p>1. That ſuch power was given him.</p>
               <p>2. That he did effectually and abundantly put it fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h, <hi>He
opened his mouth:</hi> Let mee give the reaſons of both. 1. Why
ſuch power was given him; it was</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> from God, in his juſt judgement to puniſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
world that received not the love of the truth,
<hi>Therefore the Lord gave them over to efficacy of deluſions to believe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57074:39"/>
lies; That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11. This is the
juſt judgment of God, that ſince they refuſed the ſimplicity
of wholſome Doctrine, and had itching eares, they ſhould
have ſuch men as came with the ſubduing word of the Law to
ſpeak great things, and they ſhould have what they aske; This
is from Gods juſt jugement.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon is from Satan;<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> for God concurred, and
Satan concurred, and Chriſtian Princes concurred herein:
Satan concurred for this reaſon, that he might be avenged of
God, and deſpight the name of Chriſt, that had caſt him out,
and dethroned him from his divine power: That whereas he
was the great God of the world, and the God of Iſrael but a
puny God of the leſſer Nations; now hee is to be no God to
truſt on, but like a Toad or Serpent; this doth ſo enrage the
venome of the old Devill, that he powrs forth a flood of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and venome againſt the Church and Chriſt, as much as
may be, to teſtifie to the world hee would be Lord, and the
Lord Jeſus ſhould not prevaile: And if he may not be God,
he will ſet up a Beaſt that ſhall be adored as God: And it is a
great deſpight to Chriſt, to advance a Beaſt, that ſhall carry
great State and power, and dare, and will ſpeak greater
things then all the Churches of Chriſt, I, as great as the
Lord himſelf ſhall ſpeak; look what one ſpeaks, the other wil
ſpeak it all, and ſpeak it abundantly: As the Devill himſelfe
ſometimes ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt
fall downe and worſhip me.</hi> The ſame doth he ſpeak at this day,
and he will ſpeak without controll.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon that binds Satan ſo to ſpeak, is not only
his old enmity to Chriſt, but from his malice againſt the
Church. When hee ſaw that the ſeed of the woman had thus
dethroned him, and caſt him out of divine power, he powrs
forth a flood of malice after her, and he ſends forth an ugly
Beaſt, that if he can, may root out the face of Chriſtianity,
and root her out from the face of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 15.
Theſe are the Devils reaſons that mooved him to ſtirre up the
Beaſt, and to give him a mouth to ſpeake ſo boldly as hee
did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57074:39"/>
But why will Chriſtian Princes be ſo prodigall, to ſubmit
themſelves to him? God had committed to them the care of
the Churches, that all Churches ſhould live peaceably and
quietly under them, in all godlineſs and honeſty: why would
they ſo degenerate, and ſuffer the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and ſpeak ſuch great blaſphemies? The reaſons were,</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe they were ignorantly blinde;<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> It was a time
of palpable darkneſſe, darkneſſe that might be felt: From the
ninth Centuary to the tenth, both Proteſtant and Popiſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
complaine, that had not ſome lived in the 800. year,
and in the thouſand yeare after Chriſt, they ſhould not have
known what had beene done in the nine hundred, a whole
hundred years together: Men were ſo full of darkneſſe and
ignorance, that ſcarce any ſet pen to paper to tell us what
was done in thoſe dark times; that men did not know what
were principles of Chriſtianity, much leſſe were able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of Caſes of Church-government, or the miſterie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
which requires more diligent attendance: And thence
it was that they were ſo taken with the pretended claymes of
the Catholick viſible Church, that it would not erre, becauſe
it was built upon a Rock, and had the keys of <hi>Peter,</hi> and he
had the keys of heaven: <hi>What he bound on earth was bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and what he looſed on earth was looſed in heaven;</hi> that had
there not been palpable groſſe ignorance, it had not been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſuch groſſe things ſhould have been ſuffered to come in.</p>
               <p>And a ſecond thing that moved them was the ſtrange ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of the Beaſt in recovering of his wounded head;<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> for that
made them wonder after the Beaſt, when they ſaw ſuch a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
wound ſo throughly healed: They thought, had it not
been above the power of mortall men, it had not been poſſible
it ſhould have been healed, but certainly there was a power
above mortall men in it, and that is the reaſon in the Text
to give him a mouth to ſpeak great things, to ſpeak what hee
would.</p>
               <p>And a third reaſon why Princes gave this power,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> was their
devout ſuperſtition; many were convinced by Matchivilian
policy, of their great ſins, and they had in thoſe dayes a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
dexterity to apply the Law of God, and to ſting mens
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57074:40"/>
conſciences like a Cockatrice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 5. and then they would
do any thing for eaſe out of the bondage they lay under, and
this was a great meanes: Then they directed them to give ſo
much to ſuch a Monaſtery, or to goe a Pilgrimage, or faſt
ſuch a time, and ſuch devotion which a mans own unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
heart could reach: That when this Beaſt ſpeaks great
things, that he can pardon ſinne, and his Shavelings will take
a courſe for redeeming ſouls, and preſerving them out of hel,
this was ſuch ſatisfaction to them, that you need not wonder
if all Princes gave their Kingdomes to the Beaſt: And ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
advanced him as ſupream over them all, he hath a mouth
he may ſpeak what he will; Princes may make Laws on this
hand or on that; but if they do not ſuite with him, they are
diſannulled: And they muſt be reconciled to the mother
Church, and ſo this Harlot gives them all to her, and hath
a mouth ſpeaking great things, and therewithall great blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thus have you the point, and the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>For the uſe of it,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> I might from hence firſt ſpeak to this
point; that it were therefore a neceſſary counſell to all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, to conſider diligently the grounds of the
great priviledges of the viſible Catholick Church, they
ſtretch their authority beyond all degrees of Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all Temporall States or particular Churches: Now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it were for them to reverſe all the great things which
are delivered, and which the Pope hath ſet open his mouth
to ſpeak, though they be delivered with never ſuch fulneſſe,
and boldneſſe, and plentitude of power: It behoves men to
conſider whether all theſe great words be not the words of a
Beaſt, and blaſphemies which the head of the Beaſt had taken
upon him to utter, for it is not enough that they are ſpoken
boldly and confidently, and with good adviſement and grave
Counſell, Provinciall Decretals and Decrees, for they are
diſtinct things: It behoves Catholicks not to be gulled with
Titles and great things; for it is not alwayes that power
which God in mercy gives to men when they dare ſpeak great
things; they think the Pope is not Antichriſt; but when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
comes, <hi>will he do greater things then theſe?</hi> as they ſayd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57074:40"/>
of Chriſt; <hi>when Chriſt comes will he doe greater workes then theſe?</hi>
And ſo when Antichriſt comes can he ſpeak grater things
then theſe? And if I were to ſpeak to Lay-men (as they ſay)
in their Religion, I might adviſe them to take heed they be
not taken with the confidence of their Prieſts, that ſpeak with
good adviſement even to impudency, and with ſuch reſolute
courage, that many thouſands are carryed away with it,
and ſay, certainly men would never be ſo bold, if they were
not poſſeſſed with the goodneſſe of their cauſe: Let them not
be deluded, the Beaſt hath power to ſpeak great things, and
he opens his mouth with all courage and confidence, and
whiſpers it not, but ſpeaks with impudency, and abundance
of reſolution.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> This may ſerve to teach us the danger of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any mortall man an inordinate meaſure of power to
ſpeak great things, to allow to any man uncontroll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bleneſs

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ger of it: Let all the world
learn to give mortall men no greater power then they are
content they ſhall uſe, for uſe is they will: and unleſſe they
be better taught of God, they will uſe it ever and anon, it
may be make it the paſſage of their proceeding to ſpeake what
they will: And they that have liberty to ſpeak great things,
you will finde it to be true, they will ſpeak great blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
No man would think what deſperate deceit and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
there is in the hearts of men: And that was the reaſon
why the Beaſt did ſpeak ſuch great things, hee might ſpeak,
and no body might controll him: What, ſaith the Lord in
<hi>Jer. 3. 5. Thou haſt ſpoken and done evill things as thou couldſt.</hi> If
a Church or head of a Church could have done worſe, he
would have done it: This is one of the ſtraines of nature, it
affects boundleſſe liberty, and to runne to the utmoſt extent:
What ever power he hath received, he hath a corrupt nature
that will improve it in one thing or other; if he have liberty,
he will think why may he not uſe it. Set up the Pope as Lord
Paramount over Kings and Princes, and they ſhall know
that he hath power over them, he will take liberty to depoſe
one, and ſet up another. Give him power to make Laws, and
he will approve, and diſprove as he liſt; what he approves is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57074:41"/>
Canonicall, what hee diſproves is rejected: Give him that
power, and he will ſo order it at length, he will make ſuch
a State of Religion, that he that ſo lives and dyes ſhall never
be ſaved, and all this ſprings from the vaſt power that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him, and from the deep depravation of nature. Hee
will open his mouth, <hi>His tongue is his owne, who is Lord over
him,</hi> Pſal. 12. 3, 4. It is therefore moſt wholſome for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Officers in Church and Common-wealth, never
to affect more liberty and authority then will do them good,
and the People good; for what ever tranſcendant power is
given, will certainly over-run thoſe that give it, and thoſe
that receive it: There is a ſtraine in a mans heart that will
ſometime or other runne out to exceſſe, unleſſe the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
it, but it is not good to venture it: It is neceſſary
therefore, that all power that is on earth be limited, Church-power
or other: If there be power given to ſpeak great things,
then look for great blaſphemies, look for a licentious abuſe of
it. It is counted a matter of danger to the State to limit Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives;
but it is a further danger, not to have them limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
They will be like a Tempeſt, if they be not limited: A
Prince himſelfe cannot tell where hee will confine himſelfe,
nor can the people tell: But if he have liberty to ſpeak great
things, then he will make and unmake, ſay and unſay, and
undertake ſuch things as are neither for his owne honour, nor
for the ſafety of the State.<note place="margin">☞ Note.</note> It is therefore fit for every man to
be ſtudious of the bounds which the Lord hath ſet: and for
the People, in whom fundamentally all power lyes, to give
as much power as God in his word gives to men: And it is
meet that Magiſtrates in the Common-wealth, and ſo Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in Churches ſhould deſire to know the utmoſt bounds of
their own power, and it is ſafe for both: All intrenchment
upon the bounds which God hath not given, they are not
enlargements, but burden and ſnares; They will certainly
lead the ſpirit of a man out of his way ſooner or later. It is
wholſome and ſafe to be dealt withall as God deales with the
vaſt Sea; <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but there ſhalt thou ſtay thy
proud waves:</hi> and therefore if they be but banks of ſimple ſand,
they will be good enough to check the vaſt roaring Sea. And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57074:41"/>
ſo for Imperiall Monarchies, it is ſafe to know how far their
power extends; and then if it be but banks of ſand, which is
moſt ſlippery, it will ſerve, as well as any brazen wall. If you
pinch the Sea of its liberty, though it be walls of ſtone or
braſſe, it will beate them downe: So it is with Magiſtrates,
ſtint them where God hath not ſtinted them, and if they were
walls of braſſe, they would beate them downe, and it is meet
they ſhould: but give them the liberty God allows, and if it
be but a wall of ſand it will keep them: As this liquid Ayre
in which we breath, God hath ſet it for the waters of the
Clouds to the Earth; It is a Firmament, it is the Clouds, yet
it ſtands firme enough, becauſe it keeps the Climate where
they are, it ſhall ſtand like walls of braſſe: So let there be due
bounds ſet, and I may apply it to Families; it is good for
the Wife to acknowledg all power and authority to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and for the Husband to acknowledg honour to the
Wife, but ſtill give them that which God hath given them,
and no more nor leſſe: Give them the full latitude that God
hath given, elſe you will finde you dig pits, and lay ſnares,
and cumber their ſpirits, if you give them leſſe: there is never
peace where full liberty is not given, nor never ſtable peace
where more then full liberty is granted: Let them be duely
obſerved, and give men no more liberty then God doth, nor
women, for they will abuſe it: The Devill will draw them,
and Gods providence leade them thereunto, therefore give
them no more then God gives. And ſo for children; and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or any others you are to deale with, give them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and authority you would have them uſe, and beyond
that ſtretch not the tether, it will not tend to their good nor
yours: And alſo from hence gather, and goe home with this
meditation; That certainly here is this diſtemper in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that we cannot tell how to uſe liberty, but wee ſhall
very readily corrupt our ſelves: Oh the bottomleſſe depth of
ſandy earth! of a corrupt ſpirit, that breaks over all bounds,
and loves inordinate vaſtneſſe; that is it we ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> it may teach us to obſerve the hand of God in
all the vaſt out-runings of the Sonnes of men: when you ſee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57074:42"/>
men outragious beyond all power, wonder not at the matter,
<hi>for he that is above is higher then the higheſt, and he regardeth it,
Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 8. A man would wonder that a Biſhop ſhould take
upon him to controul all the Churches, and in very deed all
the Common-wealths and Nations of the world, and that in
ſuch high things both in nature and meaſure, that a man
would think it were not poſſible for a mortall man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſuch a vaſt enterprize, yet they have done it, the Pope
hath done it, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done it, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not at it, <hi>for he that is higher then the higheſt hath given him
this power,</hi> John 3. 27. not given it him in an Ordinance, but
in his common Providence; This tranſcendant power that
he is able to carry all before him without controll; it is a
ſtrange power, he may ſay what he will, and doe what he
will, for ſo many moneths, the time indeed is limited. So
that it will be of this uſe to us, if we ſee men outrageous,
and break bonds beyond meaſure is any common-wealth or
Church, our way is to ſee Gods hand in it, and to look up
to him to muzzle that power: He is able to bridle the high
King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that whereas he ſpake great things, what is
the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he ſhall deliver you out of my hand;
the Lord can put a bridle in his noſtrills and bring him back
the way that he came. And therefore when men ſpeak great
things againſt us, from any part of the world, know, that he
that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and our eyes muſt
be to him, that he will muzzle ſuch, and take order to cut
them off. <hi>The Lord will cut out the tongue that ſpeaketh proud
things,</hi> Pſal. 12. 4. He hath promiſed to doe it, and he will
doe it effectually. You have two places where the Lord
uſeth the word to <hi>muzzle,</hi> the one is about the Sea, <hi>Marke</hi> 4.
39. the other is ſpoken to the Devill, <hi>Mark 1. 25. Hold thy
peace,</hi> it is tranſlated; but the word in the Originall is, <hi>be
thou muzzled: Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that
treadeth out the Corne;</hi> it is the ſame word: It ſhews that the
Lord hath a muzzle for the great Sea, and a muzzle for the
Devils of hell, when we have to deal with them: If it be the
great King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he will put his bridle in his noſtrils,
and make him return back the ſame way he came: the Lord
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57074:42"/>
is above all; when they are above the reach of men, they are
not above him; he ſits in heaven, <hi>and laughs them to ſcorn.</hi>
Thoſe that have been moſt inſolent in blaſpheming, all Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
or Popiſh blaſphemies, the Lord will muzzle them: In
the mean time it it our part to ſanctifie his name that gives
this vaſt liberty, that for ſo long they ſhall ſpeak great things,
and no longer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> it may teach us that there is a proneneſſe in our
natures, to abuſe all the providences of God, whether of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
mercies, or ſpeciall judgements; and it warns us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the ſame, in the enjoyment of any mercy, or in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of any ſtroak of God upon us: Here was this Beaſt, ſo
wounded in one of his heads, as it ſeemed to be deadly; he
was again healed: The Lord viſits this Church with a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blow, by acts of his juſtice; and he alſo viſits it with great
deliverances, and acts of his mercifull providence, and when
he hath done, ſee his great admiration, and adoration,
would you not think this ſhould melt the heart of a Beaſt?
<hi>but the Oxe knowes his owner,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and the Aſſe his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider,</hi> Iſa.
13. Though this deadly wound be healed, to the admiration
of the world, yet conſider what little uſe he makes of it;
when he gives him power to doe what he will, what doth he?
He opens his mouth to ſpeak great things, and blaſphemies,
and he makes war with all the Saints of Heaven: he doth
much abuſe his glory. He was knocked on the head, becauſe
he would affect ſuch vaſt Authority to be <hi>Pontefex Maximus;</hi>
the Lord cracked his Crown, breaks the head of this enemy,
and wounds the hairy ſcalpe of ſuch as go on in wickedneſs:
He heals him again, and gives him great power; but what
doth he with it? He abuſeth it againſt God, and againſt the
Church of God, and ſpeaks great things, even blaſphemies:
So there is a nature in us that will abuſe every mercy of God,
to the corrupting of our hearts, and every judgment of God,
and every deliverance from that judgement; one would not
think what wofull diſtempers there are in our natures. If a
body be ſtuft with choller, it will turne the whole body to
feed the humour: So it is with us, we turne all the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57074:43"/>
of God into diſtempers and outragious licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, he was a Beaſt, and the Church a Beaſt;
we hope Chriſtians ſhall do better.</p>
               <p>See it in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when the Lord had wrought great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
for him, brought the Sunne ten degrees back, and
avenged him of his Enemies; afterwards he recovered him
from ſickneſſe, when his ſoule was brought to the jaws of
death: yet when the Princes of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſent to him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the wonder, that was done in the Land, God left
him to try him, that he might know what was in his heart,
and then he ſhews them his great Treaſures, and works, and
fortifications, that he had throughout his Kingdome: and
it is ſaid, <hi>He rendred not according to the benefits done unto him,
for his heart was lifted up, 2 Chron.</hi> 32. 25. 31. You ſee good
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> is apt to forget ſickneſſe: It argues the depth of
the body of Sinne which is not onely in wicked men (ſuch
as theſe proud Prelats be) but in the Godly, in thoſe that are
moſt eminent in Grace, they are not able to bear great Sailes;
if God ſhews us mercy and judgement, it is a wonder to ſee
what poore work we make.</p>
               <p>Many a carnall heart will ſay, if he be delivered from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or if he be at Sea in danger, if he get a ſhore; or if in
Priſon, if he get but liberty, God and men ſhall ſee what a
new man he will be: O the bottomleſſe depth of a deceitfull
heart! let the Lord chaſtiſe us, and raiſe us up again, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
our humiliation, and grow to exaltation; and if God
helpe us a little, we grow to ſuch out-runings of ſpirit as we
exceed therein: no gift that a man hath, no ordinance of
God, but he will thus abuſe. And therefore we have cauſe
to ſit down in duſt and aſhes, that we ſhould abuſe ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as we dayly partake in.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Vſe 5.</note> ſince this is the nature of wicked men, let God give
them but liberty, and men give them liberty, and they will
take it to the full: let God give a mouth, he will ſpeak great
things; and if he have liberty to ſpeak great things, he will
ſpeak great blaſphemies, againſt God, and his Tabernacle,
and the Saints: Then this will be a ſhame to Godly men, if

the Lord give us great things, a mouth to ſpeak all the good
we can, and liberty to do all the good we can, if we doe not
open our mouths and hearts to be ſpeaking and doing all
the good we can; It is not for us to ſtand ſnorting out the
time which God hath carved out for us, but if a beaſt have
this liberty; if you tether a Beaſt at night, he knows the
length of his tether before morning; he will goe to the end
of it before he have done: And you ſee this Biſhop the head
of the Church, if God give him a mouth, he will open it:
wicked men will take the utmoſt bounds of their liberty;
will wicked men doe ſo? why ſhould not the children of God
then, and all that fear his name take the like care to improve
all their liberties, and power to doe all the good we can?
doth God give a liberty for laying foundations, for eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
juriſdictions, and liberty for well ordering our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Town-ſhips; if the Lord give us opportunities, why
ſhould we want a heart to improve them? If the Beaſt hath
a heart to improve his wickedneſſe to the utmoſt, why
ſhould not we improve all our Talents to Gods beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to make it our whole ſtudy to doe all which the Lord
requires, that ſo we may bear plentifull witneſſe in our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
to all the liberties the Lord hath betruſted us with.
It is not for men that have received five Talents, that is to
ſay, five opportunities, to render to God as thoſe that have
received but one or two; <hi>To whom much is given of them will
much be required,</hi> Luke 12. 48. And therefore is behooves us
all, as to know the liberties of Church &amp; Common-wealth,
ſo to ſet hand and affection a work to be doing all the good
we can: If it were the Beaſt, take a patterne from him (but
they muſt go faſt that the Devils drives) he would improve
all his liberty: And why ſhould they not goe faſt whom
the Spirit of God drives, and improve the liberty they
have of God. And therefore it is for us to doe all the good
we can, and to leave nothing to thoſe that ſhall come after
us, but to walk in the righteous ſteps of their fore-Fathers.
And therefore let us not leave, nor give reſt to our eyes, till
in Family, Church, and Common-wealth we have ſet a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of holineſſe to thoſe that ſhall ſucceed us.</p>

againſt God. It is ſaid here, there was power given to the
Beaſt to ſpeak great things, and blaſphemyes: wherein did
that lye? againſt Gods name, and againſt his Tabernacle,
and thoſe that dwell in Heaven: So that blaſpheme any of
theſe, and you blaſpheme God: blaſpheme the name of
God, the Tabernacle of God, and thoſe that dwell in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whether Saints above, or Saints on Earth, and you blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
God himſelf. And therefore it ſhould be farre from
us to abuſe any ordinance or providence of God, for it is
blaſphemie againſt God himſelfe; they are the name of
God; Gods name is called on his providences: If we ſpeak
evill of Gods ordinances or providences, as for a man to
ſay, would to God I had never known ſuch a woman, it is
blaſphemy; Gods wiſedome and righteouſneſſe hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it. If we be in diſtreſſe, or in any ſickneſſe, and we
ſnarle againſt God, and mutter at our poverty and ſickneſs,
it is to blaſpheme the name of God; all theſe are providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God. To ſpeak evill of Churches, as if they were
Congregations of Heriticks, or Schiſmiticks, or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Rebels, or Libertines, and Browniſts, and ſuch like,
it is blaſphemy againſt the God of Heaven. Beſides, it is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
againſt the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, to think
every Baker can make it, that is Popiſh blaſphemy. To
ſpeak evill of the Saints of God on earth, to thinke to take
liberty becauſe they are abſent; <hi>Our tongues are our owne,
who is Lord over us:</hi> Little do we know how tender God
is of his people: we cannot ſpeak evill of any in the Church,
but we blaſpheme God: And ſo if we ſpeak evill of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
it is as much as if we ſpeak evill of God himſelf.
And therefore how precious ought the name of God to be
to us, to whom our names are pretious: It is but a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
to a chriſtian brother, but it is blaſphemy to God, and
therefore ſpeak not evill, as thinking it ſhall never come to
his eare. If we ſpeak evill of Authority, of Churches, of
Saints, or evill of them that doe evill, unleſſe you may take
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57074:44"/>
order to repreſſe it, the Lord himſelf looks at it as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
and therefore we muſt not look at it as a light matter;
our tongues are our own, and we may have liberty to ſpeak:
I, you have liberty, but not to ſpeak blaſphemies, either ſmall
or great. There is not the leaſt blaſphemy, but it is a great
Sinne, and therefore greatly to be avoyded.</p>

Such power that all the world wondered at it, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

exceedingly magnifie the power and authority of this Beaſt,

though it grew to Temporall Power in making Warr, in the
7. <hi>verſ.</hi> for he riſeth by degrees to further power, but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was given him: Given him, by whom?</p>
               <p>1. By God, that put it into the heart of the tenne Horns
(that is, the tenne K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in his word; but he put it in their hearts by his wiſe and
juſt providence.</p>
               <p>2. This authority was given by Satan, who aſſiſted Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
in the myſtery of Iniquity, in working ſigns and lying
wonders, <hi>with all deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe, till hee lift

Satan wrought mightily, what by the ſophiſtry of the

by the devotion of Cloyſter-men and Fryers, it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſee how he gained a mighty power againſt Churches
all the world over.</p>
               <p>3. This power was given him by thoſe States, the ten
Horns which gave their Crowns with one accord to the
Beaſt, that he ſhould rule in their Dominions. The chiefe

all Ordinances according to the wiſdome of his ſoveraign

all power of Laws he did out-rage out of meaſure. Given it
was by their Devotion and Superſtition, God piercing their
hearts much in thoſe times by the Miniſtery of their Fryars,
that did wound their conſciences with the ſenſe of their
murthers and luſts, that they were willing to do any thing
for the peace of their Conſciences, and therefore willingly
gave up all their power and Kingdomes into his hands; ſo it
was given him.</p>
               <p>Again further, he is ſaid to continue.] Some Tranſlations
doe read it, <hi>to make Warre,</hi> but War is not in the beſt corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Copies, but <hi>making Warre</hi> is ſpoken to in the ſeventh <hi>ver.</hi>
But making War is not ſpoken to expreſly in this fifth <hi>verſe;</hi>
but power was given him to be doing; and as we call it in a
generall phraſe, to be (a <hi>Factotum)</hi> the onely doer of the
world forty two moneths: That what he did was done, and
what he did not authorize and allow, it was not done. If the
Princes choſe an Emperour, if he accepted him, he ſtood; if
he did not accept of him, he was not received. If any decrees
be made, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> eſtabliſh them (which is the
ſeventh head) then they are authenticall; If he do not, then
they are Apocrypha. So it is with Scripture; though it be
ſuch as God never ratified, as the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> but what ſenſe
he gives it is Authenticall; He hath power to be active and
doing. This word then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is here tranſlated <hi>to
continue,</hi> doth indeed ſo ſignifie uſually, when it is joyned
with words of time; you have many examples of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 33. it is ſaid, <hi>After they had tarried there
a ſpace,</hi> the word is the ſame as here, <hi>continue.</hi> So in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.
23. it is ſaid, <hi>After they had tarried ſome time;</hi> about three
moneths. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 3. you have there continuance or
tarrying expreſſed by the ſame word: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Night
and day I was in the deep, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 25. the ſame word; he had
his buſineſſe there, there he was duely, he continued ſo long.
But ſometimes the word ever uſed with this word of time,
ſignifies to be active and buſie: So in <hi>James 4. 13. You ſay you

will goe into ſuch a Citie, &amp; continue there a yeare, and buy, and ſell,
and get gaine;</hi> the ſame word here and there; you will be buſie
and gaining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſame power therefore to continue and
be doing, argues that this authority of power, abſolute
Soveraign power over Kindreds, Nations, and Tongues, this
is here ſaid to continue a matter of 42. moneths.</p>
               <p>Now for theſe 42. moneths.] I would not buſie my ſelfe
in needleſſe ſpeculations: but I finde not any word of God a
needneſſe ſpeculation for the Church to ſearch into, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
We have had this number three or foure times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
For it is the ſame number, of which it is ſaid, <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſhall tread under foot the holy City forty two moneths,</hi> Rev. 11.
2. And 42. moneths, if they be diſſolved into dayes, make up
juſt the ſum of a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days,
allowing thirty dayes to a moneth as the old account was
wont to do, which is the ſame time of the <hi>two Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
cloathed in ſack-cloath,</hi> Rev. 11. 3. And the ſame time
of a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, or forty
two moneths, is juſt the computation of three years and an
halfe; that is, <hi>a time, and times, and halfe a time;</hi> which time it
is ſaid <hi>the woman fled into the wilderneſſe, and was nouriſhed there,</hi>
Rev. 12. 6. So that all theſe are manifeſt to be contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

dayes, where ſhe was nouriſhed by the prophecying of thoſe
two Witneſſes: So that expound aright one of theſe, and you
cleare the right Interpretation of all. Three queſtions
therefore may be enquired into to open the durance or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the authority of this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>1. Whether this be a definitive, or indefinitive time?</p>
               <p>2. Why it is ſometimes reckoned by moneths, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by dayes: And</p>
               <p>3. When doth this time take his beginning, and where
doth it expire and take his ending. Theſe things ſpoken to,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57074:47"/>
will reach as farre as God hath revealed to me.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe Queſtions.<note place="margin">Queſt: 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. There be that think this time is not a definite or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
time,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but indefinite; forty two moneths ſhewes a
good ſpace of time, known, and determined by God, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
to the Church. Now I muſt confeſſe, that meaning
doth not well ſink into my heart, to receive it with any faith
in Gods word; for if God would have put a definite time for
an indefinite; a certain time for an uncertaine, I thinke he
would rather have choſen (as he is wont to do) ſome ſuch
phraſe as is wont to expreſſe illimited time, if it had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
moneths, or ten moneths: <hi>Thou haſt changed my wages tenne
times</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban;</hi> that is, many times: <hi>How often
ſhall I forgive my brother, till ſeven times?</hi> I, <hi>till ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times:</hi> He doth not meanee, to limit us, but as oft as he
doth offend, forgive, if he repent; or if he profeſſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as you have no juſt exception againſt, forgive him:
But when he ſaith 42. moneths, why not 600. moneths, for
that is a definite time for an indefinite: why ſhould hee ſay
1260. dayes, it is not a ſpeech uſed in Greek and Latine to
expreſs an indefinite number: no more is the time, and times,
and halfe a time, uſuall in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Therefore I cannot reſt in
that Interpretation, though ſundry have gone that way.</p>
               <p>2. There be that take it indeed for a definite time, but
they would confine it to three years and an halfe, for forty
two moneths, or 1260. dayes, is juſt three yeares and an
halfe, and that is true: But I cannot accept that Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though it be common, yet our Divines do with
one accord reject it: For this Antichriſt which they ſay is
their Beaſt (in which they ſay true) that he ſhould come out
of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> three years and an halfe before the great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
day, and prevaile againſt <hi>Rome:</hi> But that it cannot be
taken for three years and an halfe, may appeare from the
great authority he ſhall gaine in this time, and the power
that he ſhall exerciſe over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and
Nations; now for any one in three yeares and an halfe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
all Nations, and to rule them by an Eccleſiaſticall
and Civill power, it is incredible. The Leopard of <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:57074:47"/>
which was a ſwift Beaſt, and had wings, yet he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the world but in twelve yeares, and it was a great
matter to overcome it then: But this Beaſt is deſcribed to be
a Leopard, but not with wings: now that he ſhould do as
much in three yeares and an halfe without wings, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
did in twelve years with wings, is not credible.</p>
               <p>3. There is a third Interpretation that make indeed the
dayes, and time, and moneths definite; that is, determined
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et, and do limit them according to the account of the
Prophets that take a day for a yeare: A like proportion of
42. moneths, of a <hi>time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> and of 1260.
dayes; taking a day for a yeare, they will all come to the
ſame period, to the ſame computation of 1260. yeares. Now
that the Prophets do ſometimes ſo reckon them, appears
from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 5, 6. where the Lord did direct the Prophet to
lye upon his ſide 390 dayes, according to the defection of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> in all which time the Prophet
did beare the burden of the defection of the People; and to
repreſent that: <hi>Son of man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have given thee to lye ſo
long, I have appointed each day for a yeare; thou ſhalt lye ſo many
dayes, as their apoſtacy hath continued in yeares:</hi> For from the
defection of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> to the captivity of the Land, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
390. years. <hi>And after that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt turne
thee, and lye upon thy other ſide forty dayes,</hi> and that was the
time of the renewing of the Covenant by <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in which the
Lord was reconciled with his people: but the people falling
into apoſtacy againe, it proved forty dayes more.</p>
               <p>And ſo when the twelve Spyes had gone forty dayes, and
ſearched out the Land, the Lord ſaith, <hi>They ſhall beare the
provocation of their Fathers forty yeares, after the number
of the dayes in which yee ſearched the Land, even forty dayes,
each day for a yeare,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 34. So that this is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
phraſe in myſticall Scriptures; when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is to
ſet out a viſion for God to expreſſe his Juſtice, he ſets it
down dayes for years: Then it is not uncouth, but very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Scripture, to ſay 1260. dayes is ſo many yeares,
and forty two moneths being ſo many dayes is all one, and
thoſe dayes being three yeares and an halfe, if you reckon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57074:48"/>
day for a yeare, they will be juſt 1260. yeares; that
therefore I take to be moſt agreeable to Scripture phraſe, and
the ſenſe of the words.</p>
               <p>But then here grows a ſecond Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Why doth he reckon ſome of theſe times by dayes,<note place="margin">Queſt: 2.</note> and ſome by
moneths?</p>
               <p>There may be a double reaſon of that.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. When he deſcribes what the Children of God doe, he
ſums up their actions by dayes. Children of light, it is meet
that their actions ſhould be meaſured out by the period of
dayes: The Witneſſes prophecying, and the womans flight
into the wilderneſſe is ſaid to be 1260. dayes: But as
God gave the Sunne to rule the day, ſo the Moon to rule
the night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 8, 9. Now therefore when you are to
ſpeak of ſuperſtitious devotions, they are works indeed of
darkneſſe, and therefore are beſt reckoned by moneths, by
that Creature in Heaven which meaſures out Night, the
Moon: And therefore it may be, and ſo the holy Ghoſt uſeth
it, if he ſpeak of the Gentiles treading under foot the holy
City, though it be by day-light, yet it is a work of darkneſs;
<hi>They tread under foot the holy City forty two moneths,</hi> Rev. 11. 2.
And if Antichriſt be to continue long, all his continuance is
but a work of darkneſſe, and therefore he is ſaid to continue
42. moneths: But what the Church do, and what the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
do, is reckoned by dayes, but it is the ſame time, the
one makes day-work of it, and the other night-work.</p>
               <p>There may be alſo this Reaſon; That the Apoſtle in theſe
Prophecyes in the New Teſtament, might allude to the like
in the old Teſtament, as to <hi>Antiochus</hi> whoſe diſpenſation was
only a time, and times, and halfe a time.</p>

                  <hi>Now for the third Queſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt: 3.</note> when this may be ſaid to begin, and

               </p>
               <p>1. Some of our beſt interpreters pitch the beginning from
the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when the Man-child
was brought forth, that is, advanced to Imperiall dignity,
which ſome make in the yeare 304 after Chriſt; though it be
true, of later times, they will by no meanes grant his Reigne
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57074:48"/>
began then, but two or three years after, and an eaſie miſtake
grows there; for when they come to meaſure out a Princes
Reign, they begin in ſuch a time, and a whole yeare is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to it, and it may be the next begins in that year, and
ſo they bring a variation in Chronologies; but you may not
wonder in ſuch miſtakes, if there be foure or five years varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that makes no great difference; God knows certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but through reckoning the laſt yeare of one, and the firſt
of another, applying the ſame to both, may ſometimes make
a yeares difference: But holy <hi>Brightman</hi> makes the beginning
of that time to be in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Crown, and
thence expires the authority of this Beaſt in the yeare 1546.
Now though his paines have been moſt ſerviceable to the
Church of all that have written of this Book, and God is to
be exceedingly magnified for him, and his Learning eſteemed;
that having ſuch a Prophetical ſpirit, he ſpake ſo homely and
plainly, that without pregnant reaſon I would not perveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his judgment: Yet as it falls out ordinarily, there is
ſomething amiſſe in the beſt humane Writers that ever wrote;
Therefore let me tell you what doth not ſatisfie me: The firſt
is this, that neither in the beginning nor end doth it punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
jump and ſuite with all events deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the beginning, it is ſayd, <hi>the woman fled into the
wilderneſſe, and continued a time, and times, and halfe a time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Dragon was caſt out of heaven, and there was place found for
him in heaven;</hi> And it is true, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made warre againſt
the Dragon, but I cannot ſay there was no place for him in
heaven, for this was the failing of the good Emperor, that he
ſtill allowed the Heathens Idols Temples to continue, though
he ſhut the doors; and his Succeſſor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them againe, and reſtored the Dragon to ſpiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
ſtated him in heaven as before with a great part of the
Empire.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, certaine it is till <hi>Gracians</hi> time, they all
kept the title of <hi>Pontifex maximus</hi> which was an honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the great Prieſt of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or to the Devill; One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Gracian,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> after him, being tender in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
refuſed it, then the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> ſayd if he will not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57074:49"/>
be <hi>Pontifex maximus</hi> yet they will have him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and call
him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had it not been by a marvelous providence,
they had wonderfully prevailed; for at the ſame time they
did reſtore all the Temples as <hi>Julian</hi> had done, and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
all the Revenues belonging to them, reſtored them all
to the Prieſts, and the Devill had the place of worſhip as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but the Lord putting them down by a mighty provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his, through the proſperity of <hi>Theadoſius,</hi> he utterly
overthrew that title, and through the zeal of his ſpirit caſt
down the Temples, would ſuffer none of them to ſtand,
rooted them out from Eaſt to Weſt; Wherever there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
famous Temples, down he throws them; he utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
the <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> and will have no Temples;
he doth confiſcate the revenues to the Emperors treaſury;
and from that time forward indeed, they never recovered,
there was no more place found in Heaven: It is true, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
began that war in the Empire: but war, it is not a
Skirmiſh or a Battell, it is not ſoon done, but many times
continues long, as between the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the houſe
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and that for ſome ſcores of yeares: So in this caſe,
the war began with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> there holy <hi>Brightman</hi> takes
it moſt right; but for the accompliſhment of it, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
to be wholly caſt out, and no more place found in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that was not till <hi>Theodoſius</hi> time; now from that time
the Emperors renouncing the title of <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> the
Popiſh ſort thought it was a marvellous providence for the
advancing of the Roman Catholick Church, that is this
Beaſt; ſo the next year the Pope took up that name, and
holds it to this day: what ever the Popes name be, it is <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex
maximus,</hi> that is his ordinary ſtyle, not Biſhop, or Arch
Biſhop, or Primate, or Metropolitan, theſe are but Images
of the Beaſt, but the head of this Beaſt is <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> the
chiefe Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Now this was to the beſt obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that I can finde, in the year 395. about 90. years after
<hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, or wanting one or two of that: Now
that is therefore one Reaſon why I doe not conceive that
theſe 42. months are only at leaſt to be reckoned from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtautines</hi>
beginning of his reigne, for they are reckoned from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57074:49"/>
the time when there was no place found for the Dragon in
Heaven, which was afterwards accompliſhed about 90 years
after. Another Reaſon why I cannot goe ſo fully with
that holy man of God, is, becauſe of the end of it, when he
comes to 1546. It is evident that in that year the Councell
of <hi>Trent</hi> did condemn the Scriptures, and advance the vulgar
Latine to be the authenticall word of God: And <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth did prevail againſt the Lant-grave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> &amp; Proſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> in the year 1547. So by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it cannot end aright, for the Beaſt hath power given him
to continue to make war for 42 moneths; now he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
longer then ſo, though it is true, his time was limited
ſoon after; and therefore I cannot with ſo full aſſurance go
ſo clearly with him in that, as uſually I do in his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet ſtill reſerving this liberty, according to the gift
of the ſpirit of Prophecy he had, you may many times read
the context of the word of God, it may be ſometimes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more exactly according to the true meaning then all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
is expreſt; which I ſpeak not to impeach the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and learning of the holy man of God, but would
give every man the honour that God hath put upon them,
make uſe of their gifts, and leave them where they may at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time miſtake, the like liberty God forbid but may be left
to others that come after us.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore if you doe a little more narrowly ſearch the
Text, and weigh every circumſtance in it, you may obſerve
(as I take it) a double computation of this time in reſpect
of the beginning and ending of it; for you ſhall read which
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brightman</hi> rightly obſerves; that the woman fled into
the wilderneſſe at <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Crown, it is
true, for ſo it is expreſly ſayd, <hi>Revel. 12. 6. She fled into the
wilderneſſe, where ſhe had a place prepared of God:</hi> and this was
before the battell was ſought; and then he tells you of the
battell that was fought in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9.; The end of which
was, <hi>there was no place for the Dragon in Heaven;</hi> and now
there is given two wings of an Eagle unto the woman, that
ſhe might flee into the wilderneſſe into her place, where ſhe
is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time from the
face of the Serpent, which is juſt 42 moneths. So that take
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57074:50"/>
both theſe places, and it will appear there is a double begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this time; the one from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Reigne, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
96 or 97 years after, there abouts it was, there is the
beginning of it. Now if you take it by moneths, and take
it not as holy <hi>Brightman</hi> doth, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> yeare, but the
<hi>Roman</hi> yeare; methinks it is moſt probable to take the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affaires to be regiſtred by Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
not <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> though it is true, <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpiritually
called <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that's in another ſence, they did not follow
them in computation; and though the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> count 30
dayes to a moneth, which ſutes well with this, yet it is not
uſuall in Scripture; for roundneſſe of number ſake, they
pitch a certain time of the moneth, 30 dayes for a moneth;
and therfore if you count ſo may years in the <hi>Roman</hi> Kallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
you ſhall come ſomewhat neere the account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Power, and tranſcendant Authority of this
Beaſt; and if you ſo reckon 1260. years, if you adde them
to 300. and the odde four years after before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
there-abouts it was; and computations are not
clear, the expiration will fall ſomewhat after the beginning
of the reigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> And eſpecially if you take
the account from more exact Chronologies, it will come in
the year wherein the Pope ſent a Bull, that is, an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
agaiſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to deliver her to Satan,
which brought forth new treaſons againſt her that followed
every year, and brought her at length the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> invaſion,
hoſtile invaſion; but from that time it was, that the blaſt of
his power was then broken; that whereas before if he had
excommunicated a Prince, it was fatall, he could never have
ſtood out, he had been everlaſtingly blaſted with his hopes,
but from that time forward, it hath been truly ſaid by
ſome, that have ſpoken of this time, that from that
time all the Popes Bulls were but baubles; they could
not prevaile againſt her, though they brought the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
and faſtned it upon the Cathedrall Church
as they call it, and afterwards read it; ſhe going to prayer,
uſed the words of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. Though they curſe, bleſſe
thou, let them be confounded that riſe up againſt me, but let thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
rejoyce:</hi> God heard her prayer, and marvellouſly broke
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57074:50"/>
his power, he had not the power that the great Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> had, who by his power ſhould rend rocks in peices,
and blaſt all before him, he never had that power after: God
delighting by weak means to bring mighty things to paſſe:
By her hand the Lord did maintain the low Countries, that
this beaſt had great power over, his arme was broken there;
and ſo againſt the King of <hi>Navar</hi> by her aſſiſting him; and ſo
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe mightily prevailed to break his power there;
and ſo in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where ſhe ſet her hand, ſhe brake mightily
his power, and the power of Catholick Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though
mightier then ſhe. She renounced the Catholick Church,
that is this great beaſt, and cut off his head to her beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which was about the ſounding of the ſeventh
Trumpet, <hi>Rev. 11. 15. When the Kingdomes of this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt:</hi> For then did
begin the ſeventh Trumpet to ſound, which brought the
converſion of Kingdomes and States; that though the beaſt
ſtill continued, yet he ſtill loſt his Authority which he had
before; what he did approve before, that ſtood, and what he
did not, that fell to the ground. Now he hath ſo much
power, that if <hi>France</hi> be more pravalent, or <hi>Spaine,</hi> he will
take with them, as he thinks he may with his Catholick
Sons for his own ſecurity: but his power is ſo blaſted, that
though he doth continue ſtill, and will continue, yet a great
Beaſt that rules all the world; that power the Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church hath loſt, though he prevail with his ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inventions with thoſe that are his in a carnall way, or
from an opinion of their fathers honeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet the
power is not left to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to doe all things, as
in thoſe former times he might; his word is not a law, nor
his decrees ſo Authenticall, they are now conſidered of, even
among Catholicke Princes; It is not now in his power to
take up Controverſies between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> if they will
make war: Time was, they durſt as well have eaten a Bears
foot, as have ventured upon any war without his likeing;
but that was the time when the armes of his power, and his
jawes were not broken.</p>
               <p>Thus if you take this Scripture as <hi>Brightman</hi> takes it, from
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57074:51"/>
                  <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Crown, it will expire then about
the time when the Bull came forth againſt Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they thought would be ſufficient to blaſt her, and all the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi>
with her: But yet that makes but one beginning and
ending of this account, whereas the Text makes two; for in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 6. when the child was caught up to God, and to
his throne, and the woman fled into the wilderneſſe, then
there was a great battle; that battle laſted 90 years, and
then was the Devill caſt out of Heaven, and his Flamins, and
Arch-flamins were blaſted with him, they had no power in
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> time: from that time the Dragon was caſt out of
Heaven, and perſecuted the woman which brought forth the
man child, and there was given to her two wings of a great
Eagle, that ſhe might flee into the wilderneſſe: Now I ſay
according to this, there is another computation of this time,
there was no more place found for him in heaven w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was in
the year 395. for two or three years, we muſt not pinch much;
it is hard to keep exact account by reaſon of taking up one
year from the Predeceſſor, which in ſo many years come to
ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe: Now if you ſhall take
the Computation from that time, (tis true from <hi>Conſtantines</hi>
time, the Church might fly into the wilderneſſe; for it is
true, the Church is made a wilderneſſe if you ſet the doores
of the Church ſo wide and pull down the walls, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before, <hi>it was a Garden incloſed,</hi> Cant. 4. 12. now you let
in vaſt territories, bring in the whole world, now you make
it Catholick; now though it had no Catholick power; a
Garden is made a wilderneſſe if you pull down the pales,
take down the narrow watch of Officers, and let in all men
that will thruſt in ambitiouſly to gratifie them; The Church
was full of covetouſneſſe, whoredomes, adulteries, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
haters of God, and the true power of Godlineſſe, even
in his time, and ſo forward, was almoſt worn out, and never
was ſo in all the time of perſecution; but after that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> had taken the ſtile of <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi>
ſlept with his Fathers, then the Church grew more
tranſcendantly Catholick, and that they thought he would
be Lord Paramount; but yet his tranſcendant power did
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57074:51"/>
ſpring as he was cheif Biſhop, then he was univerſall Biſhop,
for his power grew by degrees;) Now I ſay, if you take
this latter computation, which alſo the Text doth, then if
you reckon from 395. years, and adde to that 1260. years,
putting theſe two together, they will expire in the yeare, that
ſhall be according to the Roman account 1655. I will not
be two confident, becauſe I am not a Prophet, nor the Son
of a Prophet to foretell things to come, but ſo far as God
helps by Scripture light, about the time 1655. there will be
then ſuch a blow given to this beaſt, and to the head of this
beaſt, which is <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> as that we ſhall ſee a further
gradual accompliſhment and fulfilling of this Prophecy here.
You muſt not think it ſtrange that ſome Prophecies receive a
graduall accompliſhment; Sometimes you have a Prophecy
of the 70. yeares captivity, which is accompliſhed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the Church out of <hi>Babell;</hi> yet a more full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
ſhall be when the Church ſhall be delivered
from this whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall
be called againe. So it is here, according to the different
computation of time, the wiſe God hath all ſeaſons in his
hand, he doth foreſee, and foretell to his people when they
ſhall come to paſſe: So that though the arme of his glorious
power be broken, and his bones broken, that he is nothing
that beaſt in power that he was, and hath not been ſince the
ſending of that dreadfull excommunication, which was
thought to be ſo dangerous to the famous Princeſſe I ſpake
of; yet a power he hath over many Churches, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
given him by the ten horns, they are not all broken; as in
<hi>Chap. 11. 13. The tenth part of the City fell by reaſon of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake:</hi>
There was ſuch a fall, that a tenth part fell, but yet
a great part ſtands ſtill to this day in ſome meaſure, that will
take their Religion from him as they ſee cauſe, but not all in
Religion neither, for the King of <hi>France</hi> will not yield to the
Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> to this day; it falling out that his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
did not ſit in the cheife place, he will not authorize
that Councell: Thus is his power broken, but yet it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in ſome meaſure till a further accompliſhment of it,
but for two or three years I cannot limit that, for there may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57074:52"/>
be ſome uncertainty by reaſon of the variation of Chronicles
that have ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe in the beginning
and ending of the Reign of Princes: But otherwiſe, about
that time will be the expiration of the power and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Beaſt: But already we ſee, by the bleſſing of
God, his power weakned, but we look for a further accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</p>
               <p>The matter hath required ſome-what large opening, but
it is a counſell of God, and given of him for this end, that
it may be expounded and explained: And the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
bleſſedneſſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. to thoſe that read and ſearch this
Booke; and therefore he would encourage all to ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
the meaning of it, eſpecially as God gives opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
It was that which <hi>John</hi> mourned for, that he found
none worthy to open this book, and to looſe the ſeals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
only the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> I think there is no
man ſhall be diligently ſtudious on this Book, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> for helpe, but he ſhall find
ſomething more then he did expect. It is true, if a man go in
confidence of his own gifts and knowledge, he may foole

feare of God; the ſpirit of any Chriſtian Miniſter, or other
that layes hold of this Book, he ſhall not be ſent empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:

ſerves to ſtrengthen our faith, that the Lord is exact in his
Propheticall expreſſions: Look what he ſpeaks, though it
be many a yeare or day before, he will not faile to bring it
to accompliſhment in his time. It is truly obſerved, if God
tarry long, <hi>a thouſand years with God is but as one day,</hi> till the
appointed time come: But when his time is come, then <hi>one
day with God is as a thouſand yeares:</hi> God will as ſoon faile a
thouſand yeares, as one day: Indeed till his time be come, he
thinks it not long, though it tarry 1260. yeares; but when it
is come, then he will not faile one day. It is a memorable
ſpeech that in <hi>Exod. 12. 40, 41, 42. The ſojourning of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

the Land of Aegypt: It is a night much to be obſerved,</hi> &amp;c. Hee
doth not ſay they dwelt there ſo long, but were ſojourners
there: <hi>And it came to paſſe at the end of the foure hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of the Lord went out from the Land of Aegypt;</hi> as if God would
put ſome Emphaſis upon it: The word in the Originall is, <hi>in
the bones of the day:</hi> It is an uſuall Hebraiſm, the ſtrength of a
thing they call the bones of it; that is, in the face of all the
people, in the ſtrength of the day, even when it was full
day: God kept reckoning to a day; he will as well faile a
thouſand yeares as one day when his time is come; and till
his time be come, we muſt think it long if he ſtay a thouſand
yeares: It muſt therefore ſtrengthen our Faith, that God is
the ſame God in the New Teſtament, as in the Old; that if
we could know times as exactly as God knows them, we
might write, in the bones of ſuch a yeare and day, the bones
of the Roman Catholick Church is broken, and lyes bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid;
as it is foretold, <hi>Jezebel ſhall be caſt into the bed of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

it ſtrengthen the faith of Gods people in every time; for if
God be ſo exact in every circumſtance, what time he ſets, he
will keep, then it may more ſtrengthen us in ſubſtantiall

this way in our prayers for the deſtruction of him from yeare

You read of holy <hi>Daniel,</hi> that when hee underſtood by
books, that the Lord had ſet the captivity for 70. years, then
he ſet himſelfe by prayer and ſupplication to ſeek the Lord,
in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3. He takes this very occaſion; he found it was

ſo ought we to do; and indeed about that time it is, that

day to day the Lord diſcovers it more and more to this
country, and hath given us to ſee the true platform of a true
Church, from which the Roman Catholick Church is ſo
far diſproportionable (to be governed by a ſupream head, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead
of a particular Church ordered by Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
there is ſuch a vaſt diſtance) that well doth the holy
Ghoſt call it a great Beaſt, a lewd Strumpet, to undertake
ſuch an Inſtitution. Therefore as the thing hath been odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in Gods ſight long, ſo let us pray that he will go on to
break the power of this Beaſt: It hath not been in vain, what
a blow he hath given to the Image of this Beaſt, by the late
ſtirs in <hi>Scotland:</hi> True it is, before great deliverances, there
will be great afflictions, whether here, or elſe-where: It is
an uſuall providence to the moſt faithfull ones of God: But
what ever bitter cup the Lord may give us to drink of, yet the
day of this great Beaſt is coming, wherein he is to go to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
He hath begun to fall before the Lamb; and if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to fall before him, ſay the Magicians to the Kings Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<hi>Haman, Eſth. 6. 13. If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the
Jewes before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but ſhalt ſurely in falling fall;</hi> that is, fall more and
more: It's true, there may be ſome pangs, as a Beaſt when
he is going to his laſt gaſpe, he will fling with his tayle, and
with his horns; but he is falling, and leaves not falling till
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57074:53"/>
he finally fall; though there be pangs, as dying creatures, to
win the horſe, or loſe the ſaddle, but otherwiſe he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtand, that there may be a <hi>Factotum</hi> at that time, and will
grow more and more after that time.</p>

raiſeth two Beaſts out of his power, the firſt and ſecond
Beaſts in this Chapter; the firſt, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. to the 10. The
ſecond, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to the end of the Chapter. It was a
third Roman State, not <hi>Rome-Pagan,</hi> nor <hi>Rome-Chriſtian,</hi>
but <hi>Rome-antichriſtian,</hi> that is to ſay, the Roman viſible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church. This is deſcribed many wayes, by a wound
given him upon one of his heads for a ſeaſon; that when
<hi>Rome</hi> was ſacked, he was almoſt in a forlorn eſtate, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of recovery; but being healed, the effects were</p>
               <p>1. The worlds admiration after the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>2. Their worſhip both of the Beaſt, and of the Dragon, <hi>which is
Satan himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57074:54"/>
The third event is <hi>Power,</hi> or as the word ſignifies, <hi>Authority
(ver. 5, 6, 7.)</hi> And this <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> did ſtretch forth
it ſelfe to three employments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He had power given him to ſpeake great things and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies;
<hi>He might ſpeak blaſphemy by authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond power that was given him, was to continue,
or to be doing, to be acting and working all in all, for the
number of 42. moneths, which in the former Chapter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by dayes, and the dayes meant years, 1260. yeares,
which have been at large ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>The third power and authority given him, was, <hi>To make
warre with the Saints;</hi> and that not a vain and looſe war, but an
effectuall prevailing war, a victorious war: <hi>It was given him
to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo a fourth power given him, and that was
<hi>dominion over all the Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations:</hi> All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kingdomes, they did all of them ſubmit their Crowns
and Scepters to this Beaſt, the Roman Catholick viſible
Church, whereof the Pope is the ſeventh head, for he had
ſeven heads, and ten horns: Five of them were fallen, the
ſixth then which was the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and the Pope he was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.
Two of theſe Powers have been opened; <hi>Power to
blaſpheme;</hi> and <hi>Power to continue, and be doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the third Power or Authority given to this
Beaſt, and that is, <hi>to make war with the Saints, and to overcome
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The note then is ſhortly this;</p>
               <p>The Roman viſible Catholicke Church had power to make warre
againſt the Saints,<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> yea and to overcome them. <hi>They are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the words of the Text, explained in their true meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The warre that he ſpeaks of (as I conceive) in this place,
is not a ſpirituall warre (though that alſo this beaſt did
make, for he cauſed all that dwelt upon the Earth to admire
and adore him, and that was ſpirituall war:) But he ſpeaks
of ſuch a warre here, the effect whereof is killing with the
Sword; <hi>Hee that killeth with the ſword muſt be killed with the
ſword,</hi> verſ. 10. As if God would reward him in his owne
kind: He that ſlayes many thouſands of Chriſtians with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57074:54"/>
ſword, that is, by the power of warre, he himſelfe ſhall at
length be deſtroyed by warre alſo: So that he ſpeaks of a war
fought by Arms, by ſlaughter and blood-ſhed, by open ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
of Military perſons fighting in the quarrell of this
beaſt againſt the Saints of God. There is another warre men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this book, where it is ſaid, this
Beaſt, and the ten Horns, that is, the Chriſtian Kings, that
ſhall give their power and authority to this Beaſt, ſhall make
warre with the Lamb; and they which are of the Lambs
ſide, <hi>are called, and choſen, and faithfull,</hi> and here they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saints: But there you ſhall ſee it is not the ſame kinde of
warre, but differing there from what is here; for there it is
ſayd, <hi>They ſhall make warre with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
them;</hi> but here it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall make warre with the
Saints, and overcome the Saints:</hi> So that one of theſe warres he
ſpeaks of, when he that hath ſmitten others, he ſhall be
ſmitten himſelfe; that is, towards the end of his Authority;
then the Lamb ſhall make warre, and overcome him; but in
the meane time he hath power to make warre, and overcome
them, it is therefore a bloody warre: And it is not ſaid that
he began this war as ſoon as he began to do; for here are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
acts and paſſages of Authority, before he comes to this
tranſcendant power to violent warre: Hee was admired and
adored in the conſciences of all Roman Catholicks; Hee had
done many things, ſpake great blaſphemies many a day, and
yeare together: And in the end he receives alſo this power,
<hi>to make warre with the Saints;</hi> that he was able to muſter up
ſuch an Army of his owne, or his Horns, that is, thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that were obedient to him, as he was able to make warr.
Now this Scripture (I conceive) was accompliſhed in his
wars againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albingenſes</hi> in the 12. Century
after Chriſt, they held all things conformable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Fathers, as they called them, and every way
Orthodoxall, only they blaſphemed the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
this Beaſt could not tell what he had againſt them otherwiſe;
but otherwiſe he commended them for their honeſty, piety,
and good dealing, and there was nothing culpable in their
doing, but that they ſpake againſt the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> now
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57074:55"/>
againſt them did the Pope and the Catholick Church procure
many expeditions of ſore warre for many yeares together,
and in concluſion rooted them out of the Countrey, and
ſcattered them up and downe, ſome to ſome part of <hi>France,</hi>
ſome to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> ſome to <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome to <hi>England,</hi> and
ſome to one place, and ſome to another: though the Papiſts
did confeſſe that the people were not rooted out, but ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and where-ever they came, they propagated their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that it was more and more ſpread where they came;
but they overcame them, for they ſlew (as ſtands upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord)
about ten hundred thouſands of them, and did burn
up their Cities, and Cattell, fel'd their wood, that there
might be no more Hereticks neſtled in that wilderneſſe; and
they did take a courſe that Midwives, and Mothers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
in the womb, all ſhould be ſlaughtered by fire and
ſword, that there might be no more continuance of that
Generation: So that in this War the Pope did mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
and proſpered ſo farre, that he ſpread all Chriſtendom,
and in one battle did overcome a great many of the Saints:
Whereupon the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> being warned by a Religious man
ſent by the Biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> to confeſſe the hand of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them for Hereticall pravity, in blaſpheming the
Roman Catholick viſible Church, and continuing ſo long
in it, and to turn to the Catholick Church: For their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
to anſwer the Temptation that was put upon them,
ſaid they, it is written, <hi>The Beaſt ſhall make war with the Saints
and overcome them;</hi> therefore it is no argument of Gods being
againſt us, in reſpect of our Religion, for he may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
us Saints, though we be ſlain to this day; and therefore
though there were but a handful left, they would rather dye,
then yeeld to conformity to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So you ſee
the point opened: For the Reaſons,</p>
               <p>Firſt, how this Beaſt comes to have this power to make
warre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how the Saints come thus to be warred upon.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, how they come to be overcome (for all theſe
would be opened.)</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> this beaſt had power given him to make warre by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57074:55"/>
hands; Firſt, the devout ſubjection of the ten Chriſtian
Kings to him, that gave their kingdoms and ſwords into his
hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17. God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his
will, and to agree, and give their Kingdoms unto the Beaſt:
The principall Kings of Chriſtendome in thoſe dayes came
and gave their power to the beaſt, and by their power he was
able to do wonders againſt all.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon and cauſe of his power to war againſt the
Saints,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> was, becauſe of the proſperous ſucceſſe which they had
in the warre againſt Chriſtians a hundred yeares before, and
that was in an expedition of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and
Duke <hi>Dalbo,</hi> that went forth to recover the holy Land (as
they call it) to overcome the Turks and Sarazens, and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
Bullen,</hi> a Chriſtian Prince, as they call him, they made
him King at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there he continued, and proſpered
mightily in this war, and held it for many years together:
and Chriſtian Princes ſeeing the proſperous ſucceſſe of this
War which he had raiſed up to recover the holy Land, and
the Sepulchre of Chriſt; therefore upon the ſame tearms that
he did procure that Expedition againſt Infidels, he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
warre againſt theſe Hereticks, and out of the ſame noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there were gathered an innumerable company.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon was from the zealous Sermons of Fryars
and Monks,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> exciting all Chriſtendom to this Warr under the
Standard of the Croſſe in promiſe of equall pardon, as if the
Expedition had been againſt the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> thence came he to
make ſuch authority to make Warre with the Saints, that if
he call for it, it is done: He agrees upon it in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and he gives inſtruction to all Abbots and Fryars, and
Governours of religious Orders, that they ſhould ſend out
chiefe Preachers to call upon all the people, as in <hi>Pſal. 94.
16. Who wil riſe up for me againſt the evill doers? or who will ſtand
up for me againſt the workers of Iniquity?</hi> Sometimes complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſlackneſſe of men to holy zeale for Gods glory,
and maintenance of purity of Religion, and ſometimes a
neceſſity of taking part with thoſe that are Infidels abroad,
and Hereticks and Schiſmaticks at home; They found their
Explication amounting to that uſe, that whereas there had
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57074:56"/>
been many Hereticks neſtled up in this Countrey, therefore
it pleaſed him and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to ſtirre up the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> to vouchſafe the like plenary pardon to thoſe which
would go to warre againſt theſe Hereticks, as thoſe which
had prevailed againſt Infidels; and the premiſe of pardon did
ſo farre prevail, that they ſhortly gathered together 300000.
that in hope of plenary pardon of ſinne did give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to go on upon their owne charges; they would ſell
goods and Lands for pardon of ſin, and peace of conſcience:
And in thoſe dayes men were wont to be troubled at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Fryars and Monkes, and never found ſetled
peace by pardon from Chriſt Jeſus, and never thought to
look for pardon where it was: and they told them it was to
be had by beſtowing their goods and lands thus; and thoſe
Fryars and Monks did ſo inculcate and drive the nayl to the
head in the hearts of people, that they were never at reſt till
they went about this Expedition, there were raiſed a matter
of ten Captains, <hi>Simon Munford</hi> was one, a notable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Devill and this great Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt Reaſon was,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> the ſuperſtition of thoſe times, the
deep devotion and dejection of ſpirit that was in the bodies
of Chriſtians in thoſe dayes in regard of their ſpiritual eſtate:
They being deepely convinced of ſinne, and ſharply reproved
by the Fryars and Monks, who had a notable dexterity to
ſting the conſciences of men, and wound them by the terrour
of Gods wrath, ſometimes for their great exactions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for their inceſt; ſometimes for their whoredome, and
neglect of the Ordinances of the Church; and they had things
ſo full againſt them, that it made them ſtrictly devout, and ſo
were taken up in devotion to this great Beaſt, and the head
of it, that all the world admired and adored him for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and tranſcendant power, and keyes that he had to
heaven (as they thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) they all yeelded themſelves, ſome
their bodies to fight, and ſome that had not ſufficient to
maintaine themſelves, other good Catholicks were ready to
caſt in ſome more, ſome leſſe, to maintaine them, according
to their abilities, and happy he that could make ſomething
to make warre aginſt theſe Hereticks: So that lay all theſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57074:56"/>
together, and you will ſee how he had this great power to
make war with the Saints. Here was a great and vaſt change
from the Inſtitution of Chriſt, who confined all Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Congregation, <hi>that all may heare, and all may be edefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that one Pariſh Church ſhould grow to that vaſtneſſe, to
levy 300000. to the warre, and that by a word of his mouth
to have them all mayntained without grudging, for every
man did thinke the worke as pious, a marvellous change:
and well doth the holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>Hee had great power,</hi> that
the power of that Church ſhould reach over all Churches,
and ſhall have ſuch an influence into Kings, that look what
they ſhall dictate, all ſhall be ready, body, and goods, and
life, and all to maintain them; you ſee the reaſons of it, how
he comes by this power.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, how comes he to make War againſt the
Saints?</p>
               <p>There is a double reaſon for that,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> one is taken from
the profeſſion, and practice, and converſation of theſe
Saints: This was their practice, <hi>They followed the Lamb,</hi> as in
the next Chapter; <hi>I looked, and loe a lambe ſtood on the mount Sion,
and with him an hundred fourty and four thouſand, having his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
name written in their foreheads: Theſe are they which are not
defiled with women, for they are Virgins: Theſe are they which
follow the Lamb whether ſoever he goeth:</hi> They kept themſelves
undefiled of this Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not defiled with
the whoredome of this great beaſt; in all things they conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, and their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies,
and whoredomes, and coveteouſneſſe, were things
that would by no means be borne; therefore the Pope, who
was the great head, diſcerning he was thus conteſted againſt,
and (as they ſay) blaſphemed, he thinks he does nothing,
though he deſtroy <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and
whoever took the Sepulcher of Chriſt, as long as thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
at home were not ſubdued, therefore he thinks it as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
a worke to ſubdue them, as ever to fight for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land. But there was another thing that made the war, for
no warre can be made but by levying of Forces on both
part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57074:57"/>
And therefore a ſecond was,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> their taking up of Armes, in
the juſt defence of their liberties, both of conſcience and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man: For if the Catholick Church had raiſed up all
theſe Forces, and they had quietly ſubmitted themſelves like
ſheep to the ſlaughter, there had beene no warre then, there
had been maſſacres: It would have amounted to that as the
maſſacre in <hi>Paris,</hi> that a man did not lift up his hand, but
they were ſlaughtered like dogs in the ſtreet: Though they
come with fire and ſword, yet unleſſe they reſiſt with fire and
ſword, it cannot be ſaid to be war: Some ſet in againſt them,
though their weakneſſe cauſed them to preſume, but it was
to weak a buſineſſe for fleſh and bloud; <hi>Wee wreſtle not
againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers,
and ſpirituall wickedneſſes:</hi> They which truſt to fleſh and
bloud ſhall be deceived; as theſe men, they ſtood out, and
ſometimes proſpered, while the Earl of <hi>Tone,</hi> and ſome other
Princes joyned together, though they were but few, they
proſpered; but war is not one Battel or two, and in the end
they were overcome, and this Beaſt prevailed; and that's the
reaſon of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part, how he came to make warre againſt
the Saints.</p>
               <p>For the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, How came he to overcome them? Truly not
by ſtrength, he had very little that way; but</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> he overcame them by their a little too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the arme of fleſh: when they ſee the King of <hi>Aragon</hi>
ſet on, they come to be a little ſet on by the power of the
King, and a great Battell recoyled by truſting to the arme of
fleſh. You read in <hi>Heb. 11. 34. That by faith the Saints waxed
valiant in Fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens;</hi> but
when our faith runne in another channell, that we grow
confident not in the Lord Jeſus, by truſting in him, but on
the arme of fleſh; we know what is ſaid in <hi>Jer. 17. 5. Curſed
be the man</hi> (ye though he be a good man) <hi>that truſteth in man,
and maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord:</hi>
It withers, it cannot ſtand againſt the potent Army that riſe
up againſt them; though their enemies were never leſſe in
number, nor never leſſe provided, yet they prevailed more
then ever before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57074:57"/>
The ſecond Reaſon was, by their attention to politick and
deceitfull Treaties of peace; for when they ſaw the men
were good Souldiers, valient in battell, and able to fight it
out, and they found the 3000. that were to fight for plenary
pardon three years, had ſerved out their time, and they had
got as they thought, their ſouls ſaved, they would go home
now, and they had got peace by this carnall confidence of
theirs: So they perceived this war would be troubleſome,
and the Hereticks were like to proſper, therefore they gather
in the cheif Leaders to Treaties about peace, and great pitty
that ſuch bloud ſhould be ſhed; therefore for the honour of
<hi>Rome</hi> it were needfull to ceaſe the warre, and ſo would draw
their cheif Leaders to firme leagues of Peace, and then they
kept their beſt Generals in Priſon; and thus when they had
got them to yeild to their pretences, then they had their
neckes under their girdles, and their throats under their axes,
they might hew them out of meaſure: Inſomuch that the
King of <hi>France</hi> hearing of ſuch cruell maſſacre, he ſent to
know what their Religion was; and though he ſent expreſſe
charge that none of his Souldiers ſhould offer violence to
them, yet they concealing his Letters, they went on in
maſſacring the poor Saints, and ſcattering them up and
down, in ſo much that they prevailed, partly by the Saints
cleaving to the arme of fleſh, and by truſting their falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>And there is a third Reaſon mentioned in the 10. <hi>verſ.</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was Gods pleaſure to make it the ſeaſon of the Patience
of the Saints:<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> It was the ſeaſon wherein Antichriſt ſhould
ſwell to his height, and the Saints be brought low, and their
Patience be tryed to the utmoſt; and it being a time of the
Saints Patience, it muſt needs be a time of their ſuffering; and
ſuffer they did with much patience: but yet they were not
utterly exterpated, for ſome fled to <hi>France,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſo propagated Chriſtian Religion, which after tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

you ſee it may be given to theſe that are enemyes to the Lord

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> obſerve this much, That the Lord himſelfe doth
acknowledge even his poor children on Earth to be that
which is commonly by priviledge ſequeſtred to the holy
Saints in Heaven; He calles them Saints.</p>
               <p>We think Saint-ſhip is a peculiar priviledge to the Saints
in Heaven, when they have ended their dayes in peace and
a good conſcience, then they are accounted Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
but the Lord accounts them Saints while they live
upon the Earth, whiles they are the Church Militant,
a warfaring Church; while men undertake warre againſt
them, and overcome them by warre, even then they are
called Saints. And which is wonderfull, Saints when they
are overcome, and that by their owne ſinfulneſſe; for they
looſe not the Saintſhip, when they looſe the victory. The
Lord looks at his pooreſt children here as Saints, though there
be a miſerable body of death hang about them, that they cry
out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body
of Death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. Yea though they complain of their
Pride, and Paſſion, and Luſts, and Hypocryſie, and many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57074:58"/>
they finde againſt themſelves, though they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more fleſh then any, though they thinke themſelves
(as <hi>Paul</hi> did) <hi>Carnall, ſold under Sinne, (Rom. 7. 17.)</hi>
yet then the Lord accounts them Saints when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
about with a body of Sin:</p>
               <p>Yea which is worſe then that, when they give way to their
own Sinnes for a time, and doe withdraw their confidence
from the Lord in this and that act, and put their truſt in the
arme of fleſh: When they are ſo childiſh as to truſt Popiſh
pretences, when they are warred againſt, and overcome by
enemies, and by their own folly; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pſal. 69.
5. O God, thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſſe, and my Sinnes are not hid
from thee.</hi> The Lord knew it, but yet he did not know it to
hurt them, and loath them, and diſhearten them: but yet they
are Saints, and ſuch as he account to be his, and not onely in
regard of Regeneration, and the holineſſe of Chriſt, but in
regard of the fruits of holineſſe begun in them, as he ſaith,
<hi>Rev. 14. 4. Theſe are they which are not defiled with women.</hi> They
are ſincere in their courſe, and keep faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the main, and where they do fail, they judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Indeed in darkneſſe of Temptation they may be
ſurpriſed, but they judge themſelves for it, and God looks at
them as though they were without fault before his Throne;
when it comes to the Throne of God, the Lord Jeſus covers
it with the Robe of his Righteouſneſſe; and in the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their hearts and endeavours they are according to
God; if they be carried aſide, it is by humane frailty.</p>
               <p>Now this is comfort that the Lord accounts them Saints
when they are warred againſt, (as here in the Text)
and all the world thinks it a matter juſtly deſerving Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſhed their bloud like water, then doth the Lord beare
witneſſe they are Heriticks. So that let every chriſtian ſoul
carry this home with him, that it is not every act of unbeleif
that makes a man no Saint, for theſe truſted too much upon
the forces of others, and if they had prevailed, for God never
failes any that put their truſt in him; never do the Saints
fail in any expedition to men but when they faile in truſt to
God, 1 <hi>John 5. 4. This is the victory that overcometh the world,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57074:59"/>
even our Faith:</hi> He that believeth in the Sonne of God for
Redemption and Protection, and turnes not aſſide, whether
he go forth with many, or with few, it is all one for that; if
it were but <hi>David</hi> with a ſling and a ſtone, he ſhall prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Goliah:</hi> The Lord is faithfull, never did any faithfull
ſoul periſh till his faith failed and ſhrunk; and then when
<hi>Peters</hi> faith ſhrinks, he begins to ſinck. But it may be a ground
of much conſolation to any Saint of God, the Lord doth not
diſſaint a man, or caſt him out of the Catalogue of Saints for
this and that failing, but ſtill they are Saints, a Saint in
peace, and a Saint in warre, even when they are overcome;
when they are in calamity, and the plowers plow upon their
backes, and make large furrows, they are the Saints of God,
ſtill leaning to the Voice and Councell of the Lord; and
when they ſtart aſſide to Popiſh pretences: Onely when they
cleave to the Lord, and truſt ſteadfaſtly upon him, then they
proſper and flouriſh; but if they begin to ſhrink in their
faith, and to harken to pretences and terms of peace, then
wonder not if you ſee them overcome, yet ſtill faith is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
and their cauſe and Religion is propagated by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertion,
it was not deſtroyed. And therefore if the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
us Saints, it behooves us to be aſhamed of every paſſage
of our lives that doth not become the Saints of God. When
Religion came low, and Antichriſt overſpread the world, the
Lord accounted his faithfull ones to be Saints; in this battel
there was a Generation of Saints whom he owns: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how much more ſhould we that live in dayes of peace
and liberty, bring forth fruits of holineſſe in our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Lord may account us his Saints whoever came to
make war againſt us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> this may ſerve to teach us the lawfulneſſe of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
waging warre in their own juſt defence. You ſee it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
here, the Beaſt did make warre againſt the Saints, and
did overcome them at length, though at firſt the Saints over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them, and killed divers of them; they ſtood upon their
own defence, and it it is not laid to their charge, but ſtill
they are accounted Saints while they make warre: It is true,
their confidence in the arme of fleſh, and liſtning to Popiſh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57074:59"/>
pretences was an argument of weakneſſe, and timerouſneſſe,
but it was not their failing to reſiſt: and had they not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to thoſe ſuggeſtions brought to them by thoſe that lye in
wait to deceive; had they not leaned to humane policy, and
truſted to humane ſtrength, they had certainly proſpered. It
is true indeed, when the Laws of a State are armed againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
though chriſtians be fewer, or more in number, they
are to ſubmit, and not take up armes; and that was the
conſtant practice of the Primitive Church, the Laws of the
Empire being for Idolatry, they willingly ſuffered, though
they were more then the reſt. Or ſecondly, when the Laws
of a State are ordayned for Religion, private chriſtians muſt
lift up their hands, to right the abuſe of the Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> being a private perſon, he would not lift up his
hand againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lords Annointed, though he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Law. But yet nevertheleſſe, if the Law be for the
maintenance of Peace and Trueth, and true Religion; and
Governours and Princes will againſt Law, and beyond Law,
and conſequently againſt the Oath which themſelves have
taken to maintain the Laws and Religion, if they will make
warre againſt the Saints, and Religion, and Truth, or againſt
the way of Juſtice and happineſſe, which they are ſworn to
maintain; now in ſuch a caſe as this, It is as lawfull to take
up armes of defence, as it was for theſe men to take up war in
their own juſt defence.</p>
               <p>Now they are not private perſons, but in the place of the
Country: The Lord he put the power of the ſword into the
head of their Guides &amp; Leaders where they lived; and though
they were by former Lawes engaged by way of Homage, yet
now they may take up the ſword of their own defence and
maintenance, in witneſſe bearing to the Truth to the laſt
bloud: In ſuch caſes the caſe is much altered, for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and ſupream Governours, they are all ſubject to the Laws
and Oath of the Kingdome, and they have no power but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lawes which are made: If therefore they
take up a power againſt Law, and conteſt with the people of
God, then this power which theſe holy men did exerciſe to
maintain their peace againſt all oppoſition to be raiſed againſt
them is lawfull.</p>
               <p>

For a fourth uſe;<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> it may teach all the people of God not
to meaſure a cauſe by the event, nor perſons by accidents
that do befall them, leſt they ſhould condemn the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to ſee the ungodly proſper, and have what their hearts
could deſire, and himſelfe plagued all the day long, <hi>and

he condemned the generation of Gods children: But no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
though the Beaſt proſper, and the Saints are overcome,
yet the Beaſt is a Beaſt when he proſpers, and the Saints are
Saints, though they be overcome; therefore let us not judge

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 5.</note> It may teach all the Saints in this Countrey, or
where-ever, not to truſt the pretences of deceitfull men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſuch as are not ſound in Religion, and take heed
alſo how you truſt upon your own ſtrength (let me put them
both together for brevity ſake): We know not how ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us may be tempted in this kind, what warres may be
raiſed againſt this Countrey (though wee have none for the
preſent, nor feare none) yet in time we know not what may
come: what, are we better then our Fathers? The Beaſt of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſtill lives, his 42. moneths is not yet out (though his
power he much weakned) but his Agents ſtill live: He is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to blow a coale to thoſe that look for ſalvation from
him, to do this great and glorious ſervice to the Catholick
Church and cauſe: And if it pleaſe the Catholick Church,
then it grows a great buſineſſe to root out Hereticks, to blaſt
them by cenſures of Excommunication, and Civill State; if
it were ſo, we ſtand upon our own defence you ſee. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves
you therefore, as you deſire to be faithfull to God, to
Religion, to your Churches and Common-wealths, to your
Wives, Children, Eſtates, as you deſire to be faithfull to his
Ordinances, to the Kingly, Prieſtly, and Propheticall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Chriſt, to attend to that which theſe Saints neglected,
that is to ſay, to attend to the word of Faith, and to the
wiſdome of God: Truſt not upon the experience of your
Captaines or Souldiers, to fight by Land or Sea: Truſt not
upon your Caſtles or Veſſels by Sea, any thing you have, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57074:60"/>
may have: Truſt not upon the pieces of Ordnance, they are
all vaine things to ſave if you ſtand in need (and yet of uſe.)
Be prepared in this kind, that you may be inſtrumentall to
Gods providence, but truſt not in them, they are but the
Arm of fleſh: And if Wars come againſt <hi>New-England,</hi> it will
be from <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> and fleſh and blood will not
be able to with-ſtand them: They will be Principalities from
Hell, or the great Beaſt, the Catholick Church, or from the
Image of this Beaſt, otherwiſe there is no feare of any War:
but if any War do come, truſt not in thoſe means you have,
nor though all the Natives in the Countrey were on your
ſide: and if any great Proteſtant States ſhould offer you help,
uſe them, but do not truſt in them. It was the way of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Saints of God, they truſted on the arm of Fleſh,
and that was their great folly, and that brought the hand of
God againſt them; therefore ſee your Faith be ſincere, and
upright to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Leane not to the wiſdome of carnall reaſon,
nor truſt not to faire pretences, you ſhall have your liberties
longer eſtabliſhed, only ſomething or other you muſt give
way to, and ſome principall ones muſt be ſingled out to
treat of peace, but it was the ruine of this State: It behoves
the Saints to ſanctifie God in their hearts, to truſt upon his
grace, to cleave to the word of God; truſt what the Lord
ſaith, and not what deceitful men ſay: It was a grave ſaying
of an ancient Prince in <hi>England; Obey according to the Law, and
you obey the King: but if you obey what comes ſuddenly out of his
mouth, or againſt Law, you obey not me as King:</hi> And that is it
which Chriſtian Religion teacheth; no Religion teaches a
man more to obey Kings in wholſome Laws; to obey them,
it to obey God in them, for Princes are ſubordinate to God
himſelfe. The people do concur in making ſome Laws in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Common-wealth, and Princes have tranſcendant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the People; and God forbid any ſhould ſpring out of
this Countrey to plead againſt their Governours, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their forces, but keep their Scepters freſh from one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to another; yet this is the beſt ſervice done to Kings,
ſervice according to God: If Laws be made, let a man yield
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57074:61"/>
active obedience to them, if they be good, and paſſive if they
be evill; but againſt Law, contrary to the ſtream of Law, to
make a man think himſelfe bound, in ſuch a caſe it is to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Princes and Powers, and not to yeeld profeſſed ſubjection
to them. Therefore it behoves the people of God to know
upon what terms they ſtand, that wee may carry our ſelves
like loyall Subjects and Chriſtians, that the name of God
may not be diſhonoured by any weakneſſe of ours, and ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide on any hand or other.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The note is this,</p>
               <p>To the Roman Catholicke viſible Church was given very ample
juriſdiction and authority over all the Chriſtian world (if we may ſo

               <p>And he meanes Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations of ſuch
Countreys which were wont to be ſubject to the Empire of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which were then counted all the Civill Nations of
the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To open it briefly:</hi> It was given him over all kindreds, tongues,
and nations.</p>
               <p>Here are three words, and one include another: Nation is
the largeſt; for in a Nation there may be many Tongues,
and in one Tongue there may be many Kindreds. He had
dominion and ſoveraignty over all Nations, or over the ten
Kings; that is to ſay, the body of Chriſtian Princes, and all
the Nations ſubject to them, they all gave their power unto
the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17. No nation profeſſed Chriſtianity, but
profeſſed alſo ſubjection to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, to the
Romon Catholick viſible Church: And the Papiſts are large
in this; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes it a 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> note of the viſible Church,
amplitude of power, and he gives ſundry inſtances: Stories
are evident, that all Nations did profeſſe this Religion (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after the ſubduing of the <hi>Waldences,</hi> though they did
before) ſetting aſide that remnant of the womans ſeed that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57074:62"/>
were fled into the wilderneſſe: Now no Nation in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
profeſſe other Religion then Popery, eſpecially from
the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, which was
a matter of 720. years: There was no viſible profeſſion open,
unleſſe in ſome ſecret corners of the world: no Nation held
forth any other Religion then Popiſh, nor profeſſed ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to any other Church. Now in every Nation there are, or
may be divers Tongues, as in <hi>England,</hi> you have the Engliſh,
and Welſh, and Corniſh Tongues, beſides others that are
diſcrepant from <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But he ſaith not only every Nation,
but every Tongue, that is, every Language, they all gave
their power to the Beaſt: And in every Tongue we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Kindreds, and there is no man that could ever ſay but
ſome of his kindred have been Popiſh, or are Popiſh to this
day, if not all, yet ſome of the ancienteſt, and thoſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, here is the univerſality of it.</p>
               <p>And (I ſay) further, he had ample and great power; for
to have power over all argues amplitude. It is ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 8 <hi>verſ.</hi> (which I will take in, and open here)
it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall worſhip him:</hi> That's a great power when it
doth amount to inward worſhip, not civill, but divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
It was divine worſhip that he challenged, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
gave him. To give Laws of faith, and worſhip, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to all Churches in Chriſtendom, that was divine
power peculiar to the Lord Jeſus. It was divine power to
challenge toihimſelfe impoſition of Kings, and depoſition of
Kings without conſent of the people: To provoke the people
to do it whether they liked their Prince or no, this is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
above all created power. Beſides, it was divine
worſhip they gave, in giving him power over their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
challenging to himſelf (and they alſo yeelding freely)
a power to bind Conſcience with the Laws he gave them, to
looſe their conſciences either from the Laws of God, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Oaths; to looſe them from guilt of ſinne, to looſe
their conſciences from Contracts, from Confederacies, this
is divine power; <hi>They all worſhip him, whoſe names are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the booke of the Lamb,</hi> and ſome of them too for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but they continue not, God opens their eyes to repent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57074:62"/>
of it, and to riſe from under it. It was divine power to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
infalibility of Judgment, to judg of Scripture out of the
Oracle of his owne braines: Theſe were all divine worſhip
they gave to the Catholick Church, and to the head of it, the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that marvayl not (as the Text ſaith)
<hi>there was given,</hi> Exaſia, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> not a lame power, but an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
power over all people in Church and Common-wealth,
and over conſcience. There is nothing wherein the
Catholick Church had not power throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Now further, the Text tells you, <hi>All this power was given:</hi>
He did not wholly arrogate this power to him (though he
did ſo too) but it was given him, though he took it, and
took all advantages to get it. <hi>No man can receive any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be given him from above.</hi> But he had it given him: Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, by whom? by God, by the Devill, and given him
by Chriſtian Kings, Churches, and Common-wealths, and
Families.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> it was given by God in his juſt judgment: <hi>God gave
them up to deluſions to believe lyes,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 11. And he gave
two reaſons why God gave them up to thoſe deluſions.</p>
               <p>1. To avenge their want of entertainment of the truth in
love. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they
might be ſaved,</hi> verſ. 10. 12. Becauſe they would not receive
Chriſt, nor the ſimplicity of his government and worſhip (in
Church-ſtate) therefore God gave them up to Satan, and to
the man of ſinne, and to the Catholicke viſible Roman
Church.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That they all might be damned that have pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>
in the ſame verſe. The Lord gave them up therefore
to damnable diſtempers, damnable uſurpations and Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
the Lord gave them up for theſe two Reaſons, and
they are one ſubordinate to another.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> this power was given by Satan alſo. For it is
ſaid, <hi>The coming of Antichriſt ſhall be after the working of Satan,
with all powers, and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 9, 10. By the efficacy of

thoſe times, for efficacy of deluſion is by miracles, ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſſe
of unrighteouſneſſe, which is three-fold; The
ſophiſtry of Schoolmen, the policy of the Canoniſts that
made their Laws out of the Popes decrees, ſtill advancing the
Popiſh Church, and the head thereof, partly by the devotion
of Monks and Fryars: And if you aske why Satan did this,
there is a double reaſon of that.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to revenge the injury which the Church did him by
bringing forth a Man-child, a Chriſtian Emperour to depoſe
him from his glory, wherein he was worſhipped as the great
God of the world. Now when hee ſees hee is caſt off from the
honour he had, <hi>and there was no more place left for him in heaven,</hi>
it comes to paſſe that he pours forth a flood of barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and damnable Hereſies after the woman, and makes war
with the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 13. 15.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond Reaſon that ſtirred up Satan, was out of the
ancient enmity againſt Chriſt, and the ſeed of Chriſt, <hi>Gen. 3.
15. I will put enmity between thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> which is
Chriſt; and all the ſeed of Chriſt, which are both publique
and private Chriſtians, he hath an inveterate enmity againſt
them all; and therefore he gives the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> all the
power that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> had.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of givers of this large power to this Beaſt,
and the head of it, the Pope was.</p>
               <p>The voluntary devotion of Chriſtian Princes and States.<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note>
They did voluntarily reſign themſelves up, and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and States, and Churches, and Common-wealth, and
Conſciences and all, to the obedience of the Sea of <hi>Rome,
Rev. 17. 17. They with one accord gave their Kingdomes to the
Beaſt;</hi> God put it into their hearts to do it; that is true, but
they were left of God, and acted by Satan, and ſo were they
brought about to give this power unto the Beaſt. Some were
brought unto this by the Popes favour, and large gifts he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had his Empire from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and tranſlated it from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi>
and therefore he had reaſon to ſtand to the Authority that
ſet him up. And the ten Kings of Chriſtendom that roſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57074:63"/>
the demolition of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, which was then
called the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> their abſolute authority did
much depend upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> if the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire
had not yeelded, they had been liable in conſcience to reſtore
theſe ten Kingdoms: In point of State-policy, they had cauſe
to be much obſervant to the Pope: But that is not all, for
they could never have done it, had not the Subjects yeelded:
And what moved them? Truly they were all taken with the
Religion of the man of ſinne: That flood of Hereſies and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations
which the Catholick Church did hold forth
(as in a cup of poyſon to the world) theſe earthly ſort of
Chriſtians ſwallowed it all up. They were carnall, and yet
ſuperſtitious and devout: Carnall, for want of ſaving grace
and regeneration: And devout, for then generally Chriſtians
lay under the terrour of the Law, as in <hi>Rev. 9. 5, 6. The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts
came in,</hi> which were the Fryars and Monkes, and they
had this power to ſting their Conſciences even to the death,
that a man would give all he had for pardon of ſinne: Now
having power to ſting mens Conſciences, but not to heale
them; to kill, but not to make alive, they were now fitted
to receive the Impreſſion of the Popiſh Religion; and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to men ſo qualified and diſpoſed, was fit to heal them
overly, and to skin the wound of Conſcience; and there are
three things in that Religion that helped to skinne over the
Conſcience.</p>
               <p>1. The ſuitableneſſe of it to humane and naturall ſences.</p>
               <p>2. To carnall naturall reaſon.</p>
               <p>3. To naturall Conſcience.</p>
               <p>For theſe three concur, and that ſtrongly in this Religion,
to carry all Chriſtendome after it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for naturall ſenſe: All that have travayled into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Countreys know that their Religion is compoſed to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſence.</p>
               <p>1. To ſatisfie the eyes with goodly Images, and Pictures,
and gorgeous Temples, and Veſtures, that young and
old are taken with theſe goodly ſpectacles.</p>
               <p>2. For the eares; you know in their Cathedralls what cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
muſique they have, both vocall and inſtrumentall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57074:64"/>
3. For the ſmell, you have Incenſe and ſweet perfumes to
entertaine you.</p>
               <p>4. For the taſte, you have double Feaſts and ſolemn Feaſts,
many Feaſts full of luxury and ryot.</p>
               <p>5. For the Touch; there is toleration of Stews, to give up
their names to Stews: They will not ſuffer men to
live, unleſſe they give up their names to be free of ſuch
unclean houſes: And if you commit any lewdneſſe,
then it is eaſie to come off with ſome light penanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;
and eſpecially the purſe, that will doe all. Theſe
things marvellouſly pleaſe the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for naturall Reaſon, it ſuits marvellouſly with
naturall reaſon.</p>
               <p>1. To hold forth an hiſtorical &amp; implicite faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hiſtorical
the Devils may have: and implicite, for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as the Church believes, and hee believes this Faith
hath power to quench all temptations of the Devill.</p>
               <p>2. To hold forth ſuch a repentance as conſiſts in Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Confeſſion, and Satisfaction; <hi>Judas</hi> reached all
this: For contrition, his heart was humbled in ſence of
his ſinne. For confeſſion, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood:</hi> And for ſatisfaction; <hi>He brought again the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pieces of ſilver;</hi> He would not meddle nor make with
them.</p>
               <p>3. To hold forth ſuch an obedience as a man may be able
to perform and keep the whole Law of God, which he
thinks to be eaſie: And this doth pleaſe naturall Sence
to work our own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>4. To hold forth pardon of ſin for money, and for bodily
exerciſes.</p>
               <p>5. Uncertainty of Salvation.</p>
               <p>6. Such a frame of Church-government as keepeth all in a
politick order and unity: That all Popiſh Churches be
ſubordinate to ſuch a Biſhop, as he is to ſome Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,
and they to ſome Primate, and all to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And why? From one unity aſcends, and it is
good to keep unity: And ſo to look at a mans ſelfe as
unworthy to come into the preſence of God, and to call
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57074:64"/>
upon Chriſt, and therefore manners would make a man
cleave to ſome he-Saints or ſhe-Saints, and they ſhall
preſent their prayers to Chriſt, and Chriſt to the Father,
which is very plauſable to naturall reaſon: And for our
Fathers which grew zealous of that Religion, we ſhould
not damn them to hell, Reaſon abhors that.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for naturall Conſcience; it will counter-work
with God, and walk in equipage with God all the way, that
is to ſay, for a man to look to find according to his works,
natural Conſcience hath this in Nature, it is ingrafted in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the God of <hi>Adam,</hi> from his Ordinance in Nature,
or the rudements of it reſtored.</p>
               <p>1. Election of Faith, or works foreſeen.</p>
               <p>2. Redemption of all men alike.</p>
               <p>3. Converſion by the power of free-will. This is in
the natures of all men, by the very Law and works of
Nature.</p>
               <p>4. Juſtification by works, naturall Conſcience dictates
that; <hi>Do this and thou ſhalt live;</hi> do it not, and thou doſt
forfeit the favour of God; but receive it, and thou haſt
fellowſhip with God.</p>
               <p>5. Perſeverance by our owne endeavours.</p>
               <p>6. Glorification by merits of works.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſuit with naturall Conſcience, that Conſcience
is ſatisfied if the work be accompliſhed; if not, then they make
ſatisfaction: If they faile in theſe works by giving way to
this o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that arrogance that the work is not compleat, then
Conſcience hangs in ſome diſpence and demur: And if they
cannot ſatisfie all in this world, yet they ſhould do what
they can by giving to this and that good uſe, and do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for their ſinne: And if all faile, they may make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in Purgatory, and not ſink downe to the nether moſt
Hell: Theſe things be very acceptable to naturall Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Thus we ſee how it comes to paſſe, that to this Beaſt
was given authority and power over all Kindreds, Tongues,
and Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay to me, But doth not this croſſe ſome other Text,
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. where it is ſaid, the Lord hath redeemed his people out

of every Kindred, and Tongue, and Nation? If the Pope had this power

this time a remnant <hi>according to the Election of Grace,</hi> Rom.
11. 5. But otherwiſe all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations
have been ſwallowed up by the uſurpation of this Beaſt, and
by their ſubjection to him: So that Chriſt hath his number
out of all theſe; but it is the Beaſt that carryes away the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of them, for that ſeaſon eſpecially: He did rule over
them by a kinde of ſacred Authority, in the conſciences of
men, becauſe he had this abſolute power in Churches, a great
power for 1260. years together: whether you reckon from
<hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, or <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, he had a marvellous
power in Kingdomes, Nations, and Common-wealths. But
notwithſtanding he had this power in thoſe times, yet Chriſt
kept the intereſt in his own choſen, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. where
he had 144000. that were ſpotleſſe virgins.</p>

own, purchaſe them into his own hand, when at the calling

the Saints of the moſt high, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26, 27. The Lord will
take them all into his own hand, and power and juriſdiction,
but he muſt firſt throw down this enemy that hath uſurped o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his purchaſed poſſeſſion: But in the mean time this Beaſt
ſwallows up all for ſo many Ages together.</p>
               <p>For the uſe of the point.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> it may be to refute the Papiſts that give this as a true
note of the Church, namely, amplitude of dominion, as the
Catholick Church had: They give this for an infallible
note of the Church; now that note you ſee is here evidently
aſcribed to the people that worſhip the great Beaſt, of whom
the Lord ſaith here <hi>(ver. 8.) their names are not written in the
booke of the Lamb.</hi> So that this is a note, not of an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Church, but it may be a note of an Apoſtaticall Church
that is fallen away from the Apoſtles Doctrine: It is a true
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57074:65"/>
deſcription of that State of the Church. You ſee here <hi>Power
was given over to the Beaſt over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
And therefore amplitude of dominion is not an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
character of the Spouſe of Chriſt; for it may be given
to thoſe that are not the Church of Chriſt, even to thoſe
that are but a Beaſt in the ſight of God, not his Spouſe. I
may rather ſay the contrary, that amplitude of Dominion
was never a note of a Church of Chriſt ſince the world began:
For in the old Teſtament the State of the Church was Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall,
and they had power over one Nation, and ſometimes
conquered others, as in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> time, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi>
but it was never over all the whole world, and that dominion
which they had, they did not challenge it by Church power,
but left them ſtill to their own Religion, for the Common-wealth
propagated their power by arms, having firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of warre given them by their arrogance to them. In the
dayes of the new Teſtament, the Church that Chriſt inſtituted
reacheth no further then to their own members, and their
own members reach no further then to one Congregation,
<hi>that all might hear, and all might be edefied, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 23. So
that if Church power extends no further then the bounds of
one Congregation; then that Church that ſwelleth and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
forth her power all the world over, Kindreds, and
Tongues, and Nations; what an out-ragious ſwelling Beaſt
is that, that reacheth ſuch vaſt dominion beyond the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
that the Lord gave to his Church? If you ſhould
ſee a body ſwell to ſuch a vaſt bigneſſe, that his armes ſhall
reach from one end of the world to another, would it not be
counted a monſter? So in this caſe, the Lord hath limited
the power of the Church within it ſelfe; it is a great power
that they have, but not ſo great as to binde conſcience, unleſs
it be Miniſterially, and ſo they have power to binde Kings
in chains, and Nobles in lincks of Iron; but to have power,
judiciary power over the Scriptures, and over the conſcience,
over and above the application of the word; it is ſuch as the
Lord never gave to any Church, but it is arrogated, and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the man of Sinne.</p>

hath the Lord bought with his pretious bloud, and paid for
by the power of his eternall Spirit; and yet never did the
Lord Jeſus enjoy this power to this day, which the man of
Sinne hath enjoyed for ſo many years together. He will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it at lenght, when he ſhall call in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and with
them the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and reigne in Soveraigne
Authority both in Church and Common-wealth, according
to all the Councell of his word and will: But yet it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known to this day that ſo many Nations did ſubmit
their thrones to the Dominion and Government of Chriſt,
and to the Truth of Chriſt, and to worſhip him with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, notwithſtanding the purchaſe which Chriſt
hath made of this Soveraignty, and notwithſtanding the
efficacy of his prayer for obtaining this power, that hee
might have dominion over all. As ſoon as <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
brought the world to become Chriſtian, the woman ſhe fled
into the Wilderneſſe: The true worſhippers of Chriſt were
ſoon troden under the hatches, a mountaine of corruption
in Church Government overwhelmed them amain, that you
cannot ſet the time when ſo many Nations ſerved him, and
were as ready to take up arms in his quarrell, as they have
done for the man of Sinne.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, did they not for the recovery of the holy
Land, many Churches conſpire and lay their heads together,
and engaged themſelves for this Warre? why, when they
they undertook that Warre, was it Chriſt that commanded
any ſuch thing, that Churches ſhould engage themſelves,
and their Eſtates, and Lives, and Souls, and all for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57074:66"/>
very of the holy City; was it not meerly undertaken by the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the motion of the Catholick Church
in a Generall Councell? The Roman Catholick Church
met in a Generall Councell, and they agreed to ſet about
this expedition; They promiſed pardon of Sinne to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in hope of that, and ſuch like things they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. It was ſervice to the Beaſt, not to Chriſt: God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
acknowledgeth it as any ſervice to Chriſts Kingdome: It
was for the advancement of the head of the catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as any grew more wiſe, they grew more afraid of them.</p>
               <p>So that it is a wonder to ſee; never did the the Chriſtian
world give that Authority to Chriſt, as they have done unto
the Pope, and his Inſtitutions, which are not Ordinances of
Chriſt. Yea let me ſay another word (which is above what
I ſaid:) It hath been a very rare and ſingular caſe when any
man would acknowledge a particular viſible Church, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on no power, but Independant within it ſelfe: It is
ſuch a rarity that a man may here and there indeed finde it in
times of perſecution (in 3000. years): But after the Church
come to peace, it is very rare to heare ſuch a matter till you
come down to the <hi>Waldences,</hi> and <hi>Albedences,</hi> and thoſe poor
Churches that were ſcattered in the Wilderneſſe. It is very
hard to finde the Church of Chriſts Inſtitution to remain in
the world, whereas this Roman Catholick Church reigns in
the world: This is a great power, and yet this power the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had. The Harlot reigns over Kindreds,
Tongues, and Nations, whereas the true Spouſe of Chriſt
hath ſcarce a ſubſiſtance in the world.</p>
               <p>So that conſider, if it did not ſmite with our hearts to
cloſe with the Inventions of men, with ſatanicall power ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then with Chriſt, it were not poſſible there ſhould be
ſuch aberations from the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, were it
not for the impetuous licentiouſneſſe of the hearts of the
Sonnes of men. And therefore when there is ſuch a vaſt
ſwelling, that many Congregations ſhall be but one Church;
how ſhall we go home edefied by ſuch diſcourſe? This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes
to all the Churches, to take the opportunities that we
have, that we may not runne headlong upon the devices of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57074:67"/>
men, or our owne wits, to that which is ſuitable to ſence,
and naturall reaſon, and walking according to the light of
naturall conſcience. Conſcience was never ſo corrupt as in
corrupt nature it is; and reaſon never ſo blinde as in corrupt
nature it is, and ſence never ſo luxurious. A man is ready
to pleaſe ſence, his pallat, his noſtrils, his eye, and hand, and
touch, and naturall reaſon, and conſcience, a manis marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
free that way; ſo free, that the leſſe a man diſcerne it,
the more he is captivated to it. And therefore let every man
know that we carry about with us a principle of ſubjection
of our ſelves to the Ordinances of men rather then to Chriſt.
If it be to ſpeak to our owne honour and applauſe, we have
words at will, and hearts that runne full ſtream that way;
If it were to ſet out our ſelves, or our friends, we are open
hearted, and open mouthed that way: but if it ſhall be to
give glory to God, in the preſence of a particular viſible
Church of Chriſts Inſtitution, there we are marvellous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to ſubmit to edifie our brethren, and glorifie God. If
it were to an Ordinance of man, it is a wonder to ſee how
men will runne and ride to give ſatisfaction to this and that
Epiſcopal Court higher, and lower, and clear all ſcores
there, that we may not be debarred of Chriſtian buriall, or
Church Communion, though it may be we cannot have it
with mixture of corruption, and can ſcarſe cloſe with it,
eſpecially thoſe that are enlightned:</p>
               <p>But when we come to ſanctifie God, &amp; his praiſe, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
forth our own ſhame, there is an inward principle in us
to conſider whether it ſtands with our honour, and credit,
with our peace, and ſafety; a world of carnall reaſon and
conſcience will worke together in this caſe, and inwardly ſo
reply, and muzzle the hearts and conſciences of men, that
it is a wonder to ſee what ſhifting and daubing there is, which
they willingly give up themſelves to, when they are called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the inventions of the Sons of men.</p>

Tongue, and Nation: what a ſhame will it be if we be
not as truely devout in our Religion? as it is ſaid of <hi>Cornelius,
Acts 10. 1. He was a devout man,</hi> a Godly man given up to
God; So ſhould we give up our ſelves to the Lord, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
our credit, and profit, and whatever wee have to the Lord.
There have been men that have been content to forfit all their
Kingdomes to the man of Sin; The Emperours in <hi>Germany</hi>
have given their Crowns; The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>John</hi>
in his time did as much to the Popes Legat: And it hath
been frequent with him, to ſet the Crowns upon their heads,
and daſh them down with his feet: Theſe 42. moneths it
hath been frequent with them to give up their Crowns to
him, but much adoe to runne any hazard for Chriſt, though
a petty juriſdiction: And yet none did ever truely runne
hazard for the Lord, but the Lord took up their Crowns, and

judgement upon his rebellious Sonne <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

ſanctifying God in his heart, by giving honour to him, and
taking ſhame to himſelfe: The Lord hath maintained peace
in the conſcience, &amp; hath given it when it hath bin wanting,
and the Lord hath been pleaſed to ſanctifie their names, as
they have ſanctified his before men; <hi>whoever ſhall be aſhamed of

will ſhortly be the ruine of thoſe things they would preſerve,
the ruine of a mans name and ſtate, the ruine of his body and
ſoul together, if a man ſhall dare in the preſence of God to
give the Glory doe to his Name to a Beaſt: The Lord will be

the Church, not onely to the great comfort of the Church
where he lived, but of all others that were under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he never loſt the honour of his Government. No
man ever loſt by ſubmitting to the Authority of Chriſt, we
may truſt the Lord for that: Authority is more worth then
our haires, and yet he numbers our haires, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the world are not anſwerable to it: truſt him with
it, as he that is faithfull, and he will certainly provide that
nothing ſhall be loſt: commit your ſouls to him, as to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Creator; and the Lord finding his name ſanctified in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people, he will certainly ſanctifie us and our names
before them as we ſanctifie his. Let us yeild up our ſelves to
the ſervice of his Kingdome: when men have been contrary
minded, the Lord hath purſued them with fearful judgements.
You know the caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Lev.</hi> 10. 1. They
came before God with ſtrange fire, and the Lord makes a
ſtrange worke, and conſumes them with fire. <hi>Annanias</hi> and
<hi>Saphira</hi> that dealt deceitfully with the Church, ſome part
they delivered, but kept back part of their ſubſtance: what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57074:68"/>
followed upon that? The Lord ſtruck them dead; you will
ſay, thoſe were in thoſe dayes in which God was neere to his
Church. Beleive it, the Lord is as neere to his Church now
(though not in miracles as then, there needs not miracles
now:) The Lord will confirme his Truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 23. All
the Churches ſhall know, that I am he which ſearcheth the
reignes and hearts, and <hi>I will give to every one of you according
to your workes:</hi> As men deal ſubtilly, he will deal ſubtilly;
with the faithful, with plain hearted, with conſcionable men,
he will deal faithfully, and all the Churches ſhall know it:
the Lord will not have his judicature in his Church bafled
down with partiall, and <hi>Annanias</hi> his confeſſion. The Lord
will ſet his face againſt thoſe men, and cut them off from the
land of the living, that ſhall diſ-regard his throne and Crown.
And therefore it behooves all men whom it may at any time
concern, to ſanctifie his name; <hi>My ſonne give glory to God, and
tell me what thou haſt done,</hi> Joſh. 7. 19. And he ingenouſly
tells him from firſt to laſt, which no body ever could tell: but
ſaith hee, I ſaw among the ſpoiles a goodly Babiloniſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and two hundred ſheckels of Silver, and a wedge of
Gold of fifty ſheckels weight, then I coveted them, and took
them; well ſaith he, thou haſt troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lord
ſhall trouble thee: but yet this acknowledgement was the
valley of <hi>Achor</hi> for a door of hope <hi>(Hoſ. 2. 15.)</hi> for their
proſperity, and victory over all their enemies.</p>
               <p>So that if all Nations and Languages be thus ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the inventions of men, how juſtly doth the Lord chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
due ſubjection to his will, to ſanctifie him in our hearts,
to throw down our Crowns (if we have them) at his feet,
and glad we may do ſo. It is evident, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 10. that all
the Church, (the four Officers, and 24. Elders) they all caſt
their Crowns down before him: Though they all did
weare Crowns, all had Authority, yet they caſt them all
down at his feet, when they came before him that ſate upon
the throne, and before the Lambe: There they ſtooped; In
the preſence of Chriſt they threw down their Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and let the name of Chriſt be magnified, and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
have free paſſage, but for them let their honour fall

dayes the eſtate of our Anceſtors and Fathers of old in thoſe
dayes: For if every Kindred have worſhipped the Beaſt, then
thy Kindred have done it, or Anceſtors. We ſpeak not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriſion

(though here and there ſome may be left out) and all their
power they have given to the Beaſt, to rule Families, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

our Tongues have done it; not onely thoſe that ſpeak
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> but we have been more devoted then any
Chriſtian Nations, in giving ſuch vaſt revenues, and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſo large devotion to the man of ſinne, none have
been ſo devout as <hi>Engliſh:</hi> It is incredible to tell the great

And if all Tongues have ſubmitted to the Beaſt, then they that
ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as thoſe that ſpeak <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welſh,</hi> or

               <p>It muſt therefore humble us in regard of this their ſinne,
which will be ſet upon our ſcore, unleſſe the Lord humble us
for it: the contagion of their ſinn reaches to us, and his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie

Images and ſuperſtitions; <hi>I will viſit the iniquities of their Fathers

it behoovs us all to be humbled for the ſinne of our Anceſtors;

               <p>YOu have heard that upon the recovery and healing of
the wounded head of the Catholick Church, ſundry
effects followed; the Dragon gave unto the Beaſt a
four fold power, <hi>Power to ſpeak great things, power to

over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, and that even
to worſhip, that all that dwell on the Earth ſhall worſhip him,
believing as the Church believes, and neither more nor leſſe,
ſubmitting themſelves in conſcience to all their decrees, and
expecting their ſalvation in the fellowſhip of that Church,
which is divine worſhip peculiar onely to the Lord Jeſus. In
the words now read, you have theſe that worſhip the Beaſt,
that is, that give this divine honour to the Catholick Church,
to believe as they believe, to ſubmit their conſciences to the
power of this Beaſt, taking up all their obſervations for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
for Government from them, not from God, and looking
for their ſalvation in reconcilement with this Church; I ſay
theſe men that doe thus worſhip this Beaſt, they are deſcribed
here by their ſtate, by their ſpirituall and eternall ſtate; that
is to ſay, they are deſcribed by a deniall of their elect eſtate,
and that is expreſt in a deniall of the proper adjunct of that
ſtate, and that is, the writing of their names in the Lambs
book of life, for that is the proper adjunct of all the elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, that their names are written in the book of life of
the Lamb; theſe men men therefore being denied this proper
adjunct of an elect ſtate, they are the refore here deſcribed
by their damnable condition and ſtate; now this therefore
is here predicated of them all, that their names are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the booke of the life of the Lambe, who ever they be
that worſhip this Beaſt; and he ſaith, <hi>All did worſhip him,</hi> ſave
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57074:70"/>
onely they <hi>whoſe names were written in the Lambes booke of life:</hi>
They that did worſhip the Beaſt, had not their names written
in the Lambs book of life. So then this book in which
their names are ſaid not to be written, it is ſet forth by the
end, and by the ſubject of it.</p>
               <p>1. By the end, <hi>It is the Book of life:</hi> Not that it was a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
book, but becauſe they that are written in that book, are
written unto life, that they may live to eternity to grace and
glory.</p>
               <p>2. It is deſcribed by the ſubject, <hi>It is the Lambs Book of life;</hi>
either he is the poſſeſſor of it, God giving it to him that he
might take notice of all the names therein, and keep them ſafe
to ſalvation: or elſe he is the ſubject of it, as being the firſt and
principall perſon who is written in it; for he of old hath
been obſerved to be the head and cheif of the elect of God, in
<hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. He hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the
world,</hi> therefore he choſe him firſt, and us in him, as he is well
pleaſed, firſt with Chriſt, and in Chriſt with us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17.
whether you ſpeak of Gods everlaſting complacency, or of the
manifeſtation of it in effectuall vocation, it is in Chriſt that he
is well pleaſed; firſt with Chriſt, and in his name with us, ſo
he is ſaid to be fore-ordained <hi>before the foundation of the world,
1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20. So therefore it is ſaid to be the book of the Lamb,
the Lambs booke of life, becauſe that the book is given to him,
and becauſe alſo that he is the principall perſon, that is firſt,
and primarily, and fundamentally written in this book. I
ſay it is firſt given to him, as if all the perſons that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
life unto, he did give them as it were in a ſcroul or book
to the Lord Jeſus, (but of that I ſhall ſpeak a little more by
and by.) In the mean time I ſpeak now to the Analyſis of the
Text; but if you ſhall not traſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

in the Lambs Book of life</hi> (but as it is here and indeed ſo it
holds in the Originall) <hi>the Book of life of the Lambe;</hi> Though
it be the like ſence, then it may hold out a further notion
and meditation, and that is this.</p>
               <p>1. That the Lambe is the ſubject of that life whereof it is
ſaid, <hi>it is the Book of life of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He is the Author of it, <hi>to the elect people of God,</hi> in <hi>John</hi>
14. 19. that holds forth both that he is that life to us: Chriſt as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57074:70"/>
God-man is the ſubject of this ſpirituall and eternall life; and
his man-hood, ſo receives it as a common veſſell to all his
elect members, and becauſe he lives, we ſhall live alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is the Author both of giving and preſerving this life to
his heavenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now by this Lambe, I need not tell you is meant Chriſt the
Lambe, <hi>without ſpot,</hi> John 1. 29. <hi>We are redeemed by the precious
bloud of Chriſt as of a Lambe without ſpot, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. This
Lambe is here deſcribed by his ſuffering which was ſlain, was
put to death, a violent death: and that ſuffering of his is
amplified by the ancient vigour and efficacy of it, <hi>ſlain from the
beginning of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the note that firſt offers it ſelfe from this <hi>verſe</hi> is
this.</p>
               <p>That ſuch whoſe names are written in the lambs book of life,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note>
they all and they onely are preſerved from the worſhip of the
Beaſt: For here it is ſaid, <hi>That all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall
worſhip him,</hi> ſaving they <hi>whoſe names are written in the Lambes
Book of life,</hi> they ſhall not worſhip him; but all whoſe names
are not written in the book of the life of the Lambe, they ſhall
worſhip the Beaſt: So then they whoſe names are written in
the Lambes book of life, they doe not worſhip him; (for if
their names be written there, they are expreſly exempted;)
but they that doe worſhip him, they are ſaid not to have their
names written in the Lambes book of life: So that ſuch
whoſe names are written in the Lambes book of life, they and
all they, and they onely are preſerved from the worſhip of the

there he doth, that ancient book wherein from the foundation
of the world they were written, and therefore before the

it is all one for the Doctrine: In <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. it is ſayd,
<hi>When the Thrones were ſet, the Books were opened; and another book,
which is the Booke of life:</hi> So here is one book, according to
which, his Saints were judged, beſides the booke of life, but
that alſo was opened. Theſe bookes are truly obſerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

which is alſo called in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. the booke of Gods Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
wherein he takes notice of all perſons and actions;
that is, keeps as exact account of them as if they were written
before him in a book, which day by day were faſhioned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
the providence of God there was a deliniation of all creatures
and actions that ſhould come to paſſe. There is truly alſo the
booke of conſcience; for alſo in that God regiſters all our
actions, according to which we ſhall be judged, the conſcience
bearing witneſſe about our perſons and actions, ſo farre as
they are enlightned by God. And you read alſo of another
booke; <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, that ſhall judge them at the laſt

               <p>But there is alſo the booke of Life, by which wee ſhall

                  <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they ſhall neither have fellowſhip with Church nor
Common-wealth: There is a writing, therefore a Regiſter,
a Record of them, which in the Old Teſtament were counted
Geneologies, and very carefully did they keep them; that if
they could not ſhew their pedigree from this Geneology, they
were as polluted. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 59. as alſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 62. where he tells

they could not find their names in the Regiſter, they
were left aſide till they could finde further proof of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree;
they might be received as other Proſelytes, but not as
native Iſraelites, who were counted of the Church from the
line of their Parents, and ſome of the ſonnes of <hi>Barzilli,</hi> ſome
of the Prieſts, they thought it more honour to fetch their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree
from their father <hi>Barzilli,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> had advanced
to ſit at his Table; and they thought it more honour to be
counted of the houſe of <hi>Barzilli,</hi> then of the order of <hi>Aaron:</hi>
And they, when they would have preſented themſelves to the

of the Lamb, but they cannot diſcern who are his: <hi>The Lord
knows who are his,</hi> ſo do not we, nor the members of the
Church, therefore you heare here of a diſtinct booke of the
Lambs book of life, of which book it is expreſly written,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15. That <hi>whoſoever was not found written in the Lambs
book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All men therefore that are written in the book of Life, or
in the book of the Lamb, they are written to life. Now this
we cannot ſay of the Church-book; for as hath been obſerved
of ancient time, there are many wolves within, and many
ſheep without: Sometimes the Church hath caſt out her
moſt precious members, both Officers and Members,
ſad experience hath made it true in our times, therefore that is
not a certaine rule, that if a man be left out of the Church, he
is left everlaſtingly, unleſſe there be ſuch contempt of means
of grace, as in thoſe whom the Lord hath branded for ſuch
whom he takes no pleaſure in to eternity: For it is ſaid, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was not found written in the Lambs book of life was caſt into the
lake of fire;</hi> Therefore this is ſome other then that booke
of the Church: What book is that? no other but the eternall
record and regiſter of Gods election, that is, the Lambs book,
whoever is not found, he is indeed caſt out into the lake of
fire, being ſhut out from ſalvation by Chriſt, and then what
hope of ſalvation is there in himſelfe?</p>
               <p>Now of this book it is, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Exo. 32. 33. If
thou wilt not forgive the ſin of thy people, then blot me out of the book
which thou haſt written;</hi> not which the Church hath written,
but which thou haſt written, which the Lord hath written of
life in Chriſt, in which the Lord hath written all the names
of his Elect: This is the book out of which hee deſires to be
blotted out of; ſuch was the extaſie, I cannot ſay of his zeale,
but he was filled with ſuch ardent zeale, that rather then ſuch
a reproach ſhould be caſt upon God, that he was not able to
bring them to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> let him be blotted out of
the book which he had written, let damnation it ſelfe fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, rather then the name of the Lord ſhould be reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57074:72"/>
by the uncircumciſed Heathens; and in that ſence <hi>Paul</hi>
wiſheth himſelfe ſeparate from Chriſt, <hi>for his brethren, his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
according to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9. 3. He doth not ſay, he would
be caſt out of the Church; but he found, that zeale for the
whole Church, and for the Lord Jeſus, that rather then the
Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be hindered, if it may ſtand with Gods
liking, he could rather wiſh ſuch a wretch as he ſhould be cut
off, then that the whole body of his people ſhould be caſt off:
This is the Lambs book of Life, called the book of Life, not
becauſe the Lord ſtands in need of a book, but becauſe thoſe
whom in his eternall purpoſe he hath decreed to ſave, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
purpoſe doth fixe them as faſt in his remembrance,
as if they were written in a book before him: For that end his
decree hath taken ſuch particular notice of them, that if they
were written in a book before him, they could not be more
ſtedfaſtly and particularly recorded.</p>
               <p>It is a phraſe borrowed from men, that when they would
remember ſuch a man, or ſuch a freind, they ſet them down in
a booke; God ſtands not in need of books, but his clear, and
everlaſting love to them is ſuch, that they are engraven as on
the palmes of his hands, as the Shew-bread was preſent before
the Lord continually, which repreſented the 12. Tribes, that
his eye might be upon them from one end of the week to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the word which the <hi>Septuagints</hi> uſe for Shew-bread, it
is tranſlated as the word which the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.
and the Greeke Tranſlators and Hebrew expreſſe it, it is the
bread of Gods purpoſe, or of Gods face, and what is his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
it is not with him as it is with us, that whiles we ſpeak
of one man, we forget another; but his purpoſe is alwayes
the ſame; and theſe being the bread of Gods purpoſe, they are
ever before him from one end of the week to another, and
from one end of the year to another, now that is the meaning
of the Queſtion, <hi>what is the Booke of life?</hi> It is the booke of
Gods eternall election, that is, it is the regiſter or record of
the names of all whom God hath choſen to life and ſalvation
in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. If you ſhall aske why it is called the Lambes Booke of
life?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57074:73"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the Lord hath given this booke to
Chriſt, and all the names of his elect by name to be brought to
ſalvation, and kept in a ſtate of ſalvation to imortality, and
therefore you ſhall read in Scripture, when God puts forth an
eternall love to his people, wrought eternall ſalvation for us,
I mean when he did eternally elect us to grace and glory in
this eternall election of his, there was accompanying an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
donation in giving them to Chriſt, Chriſt knew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
counſel from eternity, and the Lord gave them to Chriſt
by him to be brought, and he undertaking that they ſhall be
brought to ſalvation, the Lord requiring that he ſhould keep
them to immortality; he ſhall work the means and apply the
ſame effectually to the end of the world: This is evident
from thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of the grant, and of the gift of
them to Chriſt before their effectuall calling, though donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
go before that; for from that love of God by which he
gives us to Chriſt in our effectuall calling, he gives us Chriſt,
and faith to receive Chriſt; but before this, there is a giving, a
donation of us to Chriſt, as <hi>John 6. 37. All that the Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
me, ſhall come unto me;</hi> So this coming to Chriſt is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on Chriſt, and it is ſo expreſt in <hi>ver. 35. He that cometh to
me ſhall never hunger, and he that beliveth on me ſhall never thirſt:</hi>
To come to Chriſt, is to belive on his name; thus much doth
hee expreſſe himſelfe; that all that the Father give him in
his eternall counſell, they ſhall come unto him, to wit, in
effectuall calling him: the Father will draw none but whom
in his eternall counſell he hath given to Chriſt; <hi>and whom he
drawes, I will not caſt out,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 37. to 44. So then when this
act of Gods eternall election paſſed on thoſe whoſe perſons are
deſigned to grace and glory, hee gave all by name to the
Lord Jeſus, as if they were particularly regiſtred in a booke:
And he promiſed, that in fulneſſe of time, he would draw
them to him, and required that the Lord Jeſus ſhould keep
them under his wing to imortality; it is called therefore
the Lambs booke of life, becauſe he is the ſubject receptive of
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. And again, it is called the Lambs booke of life,
becauſe he is the head of all Gods elect; they are all elect in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57074:73"/>
him, not beſides or out of him, not as actually believing in
him, for it is long before any work of ours, <hi>Rom. 9. 11. Not of
workes, but of him that calleth, the children being not yet born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having done good or evill, that the purpoſe of God according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
might ſtand.</hi> Election i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> before any worke of ours, God
gives us in his eternall councell to Chriſt, but we are not then
in him by faith; faith is an effect of our election, not the
cauſe of it: <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed,</hi>
Acts 13. 46. 48. But this is the thing; It is a true diſtinction
that ſome give in that caſe; we are in Chriſt, not by actuall
exiſtence in beleiving; nor as ſo conſidered, but by virtuall
comprehenſion: the Lord looks at us as in him, we are not
in him by faith; but the Lord comprehending us in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
decree, we are in him by Gods charter, even children
not born, the Lord hath wrapped us in his everlaſting armes,
in his electing love, promiſing in time to give us faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
on him, and therefore to come to him, and to give him
to us that wee may live in his ſight; therefore it is the Lambs
book of life, as he is the ſonne of man, the ſonne of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> to be united to the ſecond perſon in Trinity, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his humane nature was in being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. And it is called alſo the book of the life of the
Lambe; if you have reſpect of referring to Chriſt this life, then
you take Chriſt as he is the ſubject of this life, in <hi>John 14. 19.
Becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo;</hi> I live, and then you live: and
he is the author, the efficient, the procreant, and conſervant
cauſe of life in us to eternity; the Lord hath given us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, and this life is in his ſon; <hi>He that hath the ſonne hath
life, 1 John</hi> 5. 12. So you ſee the meaning of theſe words,
theſe perſons that are thus given to Chriſt, elect veſſels to
grace and glory that are given to Chriſt, they are preſerved
from the worſhip of the Beaſt, and none but they, they onely;
for this purpoſe you read that falſe Chriſts (whereof Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
is chief) <hi>Mat. 24. 24. They ſhall deceive many, yea if it were
poſſible the very elect:</hi> It implies thus much, that none of them
ſhall be deceived by all falſe Chriſts, but all others ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
earthly minded men, and ſuch whoſe names are not
written in the Lambes book of life, they ſhall be deceived, <hi>the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57074:74"/>
Beaſt ſhall go into perdition, and they with him,</hi> Rev. 17. 8. Not but
that for a time they that are Gods elect may be taken with a
fond admiration and adoration of the Beaſt, to beleive as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, and may look for peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the diſpenſations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it may
be ſo as <hi>Bilney</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> that were marvellous devout to
that Church; though it pleaſed God that <hi>Bilney,</hi> you may
read it in his Epiſtle to Biſhop <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> that being troubled in
conſcience, he had taken all the courſes that their Religion
enjoyned him; had made confeſſion to the Preiſts, and they
enjoyned him pennance and whipping of himſelfe, but for all
theſe his wound bled as freſh as before; till in the end he took
an Engliſh Teſtament, as it was tranſlated by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> not with
any intent to finde any thing in it that might eaſe his trouble,
but becauſe he was a perfect Latiniſt; but reading that place
in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. theſe words did ſo affect him, that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lord letting him ſee his love in Chriſt Jeſus: The Lord
(ſaith he) let me ſee that I had taken a wrong courſe all this
while; I have ſought for ſalvation where it was not to be had,
and prayed thoſe to whom he ſpoke, not to take it ill, for it
was not out of any neglect of them, but out of his faithfulneſs,
having had experience, that the courſe they preſcribed, that
was not the way; but it ſo farre prevailed, as that he was
marvellouſly eſteemed; but he was taken up by <hi>Latimer,</hi> he
made <hi>Bilney</hi> hear him Preach a moſt fearfull Sermon againſt
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> that were then better then he; yet <hi>Bilney</hi> ſaw that
he had zeal, but not according to knowledge, and he knew
not how to come within him; but he went to him in private,
and deſired to ſpeak with him, and he muſt not ſay him nay;
then he up and tells him what a miſerable wretch he had been,
how he had wounded his conſcience; how he had confeſt his
ſin to this and that Preiſt; how unprofitable all thoſe meanes
were to him which they preſcribed; and there was no means
in the world to finde peace till the Lord applyed that everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
redemption in the bloud of Chriſt; why ſaith <hi>Latimer,</hi>
he comes to ſeek for pardon from me to his ſoul; and ſaith
he, I ſaw I ſtood in more need of being taught by him, and
therefore ſtiles him in his Sermon Saint <hi>Bilney,</hi> that caught his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57074:74"/>
ſoul, and revealed that to him which he never heard of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is poſſible that <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Bilney</hi> may be devout Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
for a time; but now when this electing love of God
puts forth it ſelfe in the fruits of it, which is effectual calling;
now they are fully ſatisfied that all this devotion, beleiving
as the Church beleives, they ſee they are ſo farre out of the
way, as faith is contrary to ſence and reaſon: So that thoſe
whom God reſerved and choſen to life, they are preſerved
from totall and finall adoration of the Beaſt, they may for a
time through ignorance worſhip the Beaſt, as the beſt of Gods
ſervants in thoſe times did, and many times have been moſt
zealous for the Catholick cauſe; and yet when the Lord hath
called them effectually to his grace, then, not one that are
written in the Lambs book of life doe worſhip him; ſo that
though they worſhip him before, yet now they do not, when
they come to ſee their folly, and have the love of God made
known to them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is firſt taken from the experimentall knowledg
of every child of God effectually called,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> from the evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that he hath of the vanity of the Roman Catholick
Church, and of the emptineſſe of calling on any to look from
Church power, to heale or wound the conſcience, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
further then they diſpence the Ordinances of Chriſt:
and then it is not they, but Chriſt in them, and for them to
look for ſalvation in the communion of that Church, and in
reconcilement to that Church; They are ſo experimentally
beaten off from that, and poſſeſt of the contrary by their own
experience, that you need not take them from adoring the
Beaſt; for they ſee it is a Beaſt, and they ſhall as wel utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their ſouls, as worſhip the Beaſt; and therfore the love of
Chriſt conſtrains <hi>Bilney,</hi> and he draws <hi>Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi>
draws others, till they have propogated the truth of God to
all ages. But that, though it be one reaſon, yet it is the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Let me ſhew another reaſon why the elect of God,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> after the
electing love of God comes to be diſpenced to them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
execution: For, before it may come to paſſe, they may
worſhip the Beaſt, but then they will not doe it finally: but
when the electing love of God is ſhed abroad in their hearts,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57074:75"/>
then they will not do it; and the reaſon of that (you cannot
give a demonſtrative reaſon but from this) to prevent impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
it is not poſſible that they ſhould: now there are three
fundamentall reaſons of the impoſſibility of it; two proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there are in Gods electing love: There is in Gods election,
firſt, immutability, as God himſelfe is unchangeable, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.
6. ſo are his decrees unchangeable, the foundation of God
ſtands ſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and what he hath purpoſed, he will
bring to paſſe: <hi>The counſell of the Lord is true for ever,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.
10, 11. he diſappoints all the decrees of men, but his own
counſels they take place for ever in every age, therefore it is
not poſſible that any of his ſhould periſh; and periſh they
ſhould, if they ſhould worſhip the Beaſt; but it is not poſſible,
his unchangeable decree keepes them.</p>
               <p>Again, there is another property in his electing love, which
is the efficacy of it, for Gods electing love doth chooſe us out
of the world, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. And if he chooſe us out of the world,
the efficacy of that is, that it delivers us from the evill world:
God electing us out of the world, hath redeemed and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us from this preſent evill world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Now if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
love of God be of ſuch efficacy, that when he elects
men of his grace, he will in fulneſſe of time deliver them from
the world, then they ſhall not run headlong to the worſhip of
the Beaſt, whom their hearts cannot cloſe withall; the Lord
redeemes them from that vaine converſation received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from their Fathers, I, though there be ſuch efficacy in
the bloud of Anceſtors, yet the electing love of God redeemes
them from that: But that will more appear in the ſecond
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And that is the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt, and the efficacy of
of his redeeming bloud. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall
come unto me, and thoſe that doe come unto mee, I will by no means
caſt out,</hi> John 6. 37. <hi>Of thoſe that thou haſt given me, I have loſt
none,</hi> but the ſonne of perdition, that (but) is not an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but an adverſative; he that was never given, was loſt, he
did not bring him on to ſalvation; <hi>For this is the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould looſe
nothing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 6. 37, 38, 39. That is, his faithfulneſſe, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57074:75"/>
with his faithfulneſſe there is ſuch efficacy in his bloud, that
though the bloud of Anceſtors run very warme, that a man
would chooſe to live no better life, nor keep a better houſe
then his Father or Grandfather, but wiſh their ſouls might be
but as ſafe as theirs, when men are once redeemed by the bloud
of Chriſt, and that is ſprinkled upon their conſciences, then
the bloud of Chriſt is warmer then the bloud of Anceſtors:
though the Religion of our Fathers ſhould be ſtrong in the
hearts of devout Catholicks, as in <hi>Bilney</hi> or <hi>Latimer,</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe
for our poor Fathers, what is become of them? they pity
them, and ſee plainly, that unleſſe the Lord led them a further
way then the Religion of thoſe that taught them, they are
gone everlaſtingly, and then they wonder that God ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
chooſe ſuch a dunghill, thee and me, that they ſee a broad
difference between the Religion of their Anceſtors, and that
which they ſee now; but that is the efficacy of the bloud of
Chriſt, there is that efficacy in it, that it waſheth away all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to Fathers, to antiquity, and univerſality, he is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to them all; <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that I ſhould
glory ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. So that though
all the world runne after the Beaſt, they will not; the world
looks at them as baſe unworthy creatures, and ſo they look
at the world.</p>
               <p>And there is a third fundamentall Reaſon,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> and that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the power and preſence of the Spirit of Gods grace,
in the hearts of his people. <hi>We are kept by the power of God,
through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. That is, by the ſpirit of
God, and by the power of that ſpirit, he keeps our faith, and
by faith keeps us in the way of his ordinances, and in the way
of ſanctification to ſalvation: <hi>Little children, yee are of God,
and you have overcome theſe Antichriſts;</hi> why? <hi>for greater is he
that is in you, then he that is in the world, 1 John</hi> 4. 4. The power
of God is in you, they are of the world, and the world is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away with them; you are of God, and you hear them
not; <hi>for greater is he tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is in you, then he that is in the world.</hi>
Theſe are three fundamentall Reaſons which are indeed the
demonſtrative cauſe of the impoſſibility of them to be finally
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57074:76"/>
carried to the worſhip of the Beaſt, the election of God will
not ſuffer it, the unchangebleneſſe thereof, the faithfulneſſe of
Chriſt, the efficacy of the blood of Chriſt, and the power of the
ſpirit, and that which flowes from it is the experience of Gods
love, and the vertue of their faith in Chriſt: Their faith is
unchangeble, not poſſible to be rooted out, in <hi>Luke 22. 31, 32.
I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not:</hi> It may be ſhaken,
but it ſhall not finally fail; <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts that
they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. and that is the proper
act of faith: <hi>Be not high minded, but fear;</hi> his mercy is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for us, truſt ſteadfaſtly on the grace of Chriſt; and though
<hi>Peter</hi> ſeemed not to truſt on the grace of Chriſt, yet in his worſt
ſtate he knew that all the courſes of Satan were vanity, and he
durſt not but in his heart believe that Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi>
ſo all the elect of God know the Beaſt is a Beaſt, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Roman Church is a Beaſt, and the head of that Beaſt is
a beaſtly head, and they know that their Doctrine is ſenſuall,
and carnall, and that they all ſhall go into perdition; and
withall, their experience doth evidently convince them, that
were it not in a pang of temptation in which they are not able
to abide by it, yet by a renewall of the blood of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
ſprinkled on their ſouls, they are brought a freſh to ſee the
work of Gods grace ſtirred up in them; but otherwiſe their
conſtant courſe is, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. you hear them coming as on
a ſtage, repreſenting the Lambe in their carriage and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<hi>and follow the Lambe whereſoever he goes:</hi> but for the
Beaſt, a ſtranger, they will not follow; but both their faith
and experience yeild them a third cauſe, and that is, the ſpirit
of God carying them an end: <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, and they
follow me;</hi> but they know not the voyce of ſtrangers, they ſee
a difference between good and evill; and therefore if they
hear a man ſpeak, and doth not ſpeak of ſalvation by him,
but of the world, or of himſelfe, they will not follow him,
<hi>John</hi> 10. 45. Thus you ſee the Reaſon why none of them
worſhip the Beaſt: But on the other ſide, all the reſt of the
world doe, meaning where Antichriſts power comes, ſpeaking
of thoſe times when there was great power given to him, to
ſpeak great things, and no man might ſay, Sir, why do you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57074:76"/>
ſo: in that time when he had power to be active forty &amp; two
months, when he had power to make Warre with the Saints,
and to overcome them, and when all Nations worſhipped
him, and did not ſhake off that Religion; but in former
times, before reformation of Religion, this was an univerſal
practice; they all, Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues gave their
power to the Beaſt; and the reaſon of that was, from Gods juſt
judgement, for their not receiving the truth in love, <hi>therefore
he gave them over to ſtrong deluſions to believe lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the efficacy of Satan in the power of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſophiſtry, and doing wonders.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, by the plauſibleneſſe, trumpery, and bravery
of that Religion, ſo ſuitable to carnal reaſon, that they were
carried away thereto, and it could not be, but they ſhould be
carried away by the man of Sinne.</p>
               <p>The uſe firſt may then be thus much;<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> If all that dwell on
Earth, whoſe names are not written in the book of life, do
worſhip the Beaſt, and none are excluded but thoſe whoſe
names are written in the Lambs booke of life, then this will
unavoidably follow, that a Papiſt by his Religion cannot
go beyond a Reprobate; what he may, and renounce his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is another matter, as <hi>Bilney</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> ſometimes
did; they were written in the Lambes booke of life: but by
his Religion, take them that do believe, as the Catholick
Roman Church believes, and believe no more, but practice
that which that Religion directs them to, and goe no further,
and they continue and live and die in that, then I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it from the Text, they cannot go beyond a Reprobate,
the reaſon is evident from the Text; for if none of them
whoſe names are written in the Lambs booke of life doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Beaſt, and onely they do worſhip the Beaſt, whoſe
names are not written in the Lambs booke of life, then if they
be not written in the Lambs booke of life, the Text is very
ſtrong &amp; clear in <hi>Rev. 20. 15. Whoſoever was not found written in
the Lambs Book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone:</hi>
But thoſe that worſhip the Beaſt, are not <hi>written in the Lambs,

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57074:77"/>
very evident; <hi>All that are written in the Lambs booke of life doe
not worſhip the Beaſt:</hi> But thoſe that worſhip the Beaſt, <hi>are not
written in the Lambs baok of life.</hi> Then the concluſion is, <hi>They
ſhall be coſt into the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone:</hi> That
if it appear that this Beaſt is the Roman Catholick Church,
and the head of this Beaſt is the Pope: The concluſion will be
moſt evident, that no man living and dying a Papiſt, can go
beyond a Reprobate: I dare not ſay, but ſome that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
whom devotion hath carryed to that Religion; it is
poſſible ſome of them when they come to death, may ſee the
vanity of that Religion of worſhipping Saints, and of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Faith to them, but that is not by their Religion:
but if they dye in that Religion, and if their faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
be thruſt upon them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church,
and they worſhip Saints and Angels, and believe in their
owne merits for their juſtification, I do pronounce to you,
that a Papiſt, living and dying a Papiſt, cannot go beyond a
Reprobate; I meane ſuch an one <hi>was not written in the Lambs
booke of life:</hi> And they that are not, <hi>are caſt into the lake that
burns with fire and brimſtone,</hi> that is the iſſue: And therefore
what a fearfull thing is it in ſuch that do all they can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
Nations to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are mad upon
Romiſh religion? what deſperate ſervice do they undertake,
to bring men to ſuch a religion as deſtroys many millions of
ſoules? It is true, <hi>Thoſe that are written in the Lambs booke of
life;</hi> God looſeth none of his ſheep: but it is evident they are
bloody Butchers of many Chriſtians not choſen, yet devout
Chriſtians, many an one under pang of Conſcience, with
ſence of many ſinfull paſſions and luſts, are not able to get
out but by a Prieſts abſolution; and if they be covered with a
Fryars coule, they hope they ſhall do well enough: Such a
conſcience as can be opened and healed by ſuch wooden keys
as theſe, if they know no more, ſuch cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I will not enlarge it, but it were neceſſary to be preſſed
and urged in ſome places, look not at it as a matter of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
and circumſtance what Religion a man dyes in, and
think as ſome Stateſ-men doe, that if it were not for hot-ſpur'd
Jeſuites on the one ſide, and hot-ſpur'd Puritans (as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57074:77"/>
they call them) on the other ſide, Proteſtants and Papiſts
might be eaſily reconciled. Theſe are the whiſperings of fleſh
and blood; but that which is written in the word, doth bear
expreſſe teſtimonie againſt ſuch a concluſion: For if Jeſuites
were removed, and Puritans too, yet if there were any left
that thought they could worſhip the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they
require, that you muſt believe as they believe, your faith is
built upon the Church, and upon the diſpenſation of the
keyes of that Church, ſuch a faith and obedience as fals ſhort
of Chriſt Jeſus, that all ſalvation is to be expected from him,
if both Jeſuites, and thoſe they call Puritans were removed,
if there were none, but that take up their faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in that worſhip they hold forth: I ſay there is not any
one of them that ſo live, and ſo dye, knowing what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that can be ſaved. Indeed you read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. many
know not the depth of Satan, and it is another matter what
God may diſpence to them in private; but men that know
what they do, and believe according to the doctrine of that
Church, and worſhip according to the direction of it: I ſay,
men living, and ſo dying, there is not one of them whoſe
names are written in the Lambs book of life, and <hi>therefore
ſhall be caſt into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may teach us a true ground of any mans preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the pollutions of the world,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> bewitching polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſometimes a Catholick Strumpet carries all the world
after her, as in thoſe times: Sometimes the world ſwallows
up the Church, and every man thinkes him happy, if hee
may be clad with thick clay; others are taken up with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for their belly, and ſenſuall Epicurean luſts, there be a
world of ſuch people: Now what doth preſerve the people
of God, that they are not carryed away either with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
religion, or with worldly ambition, they are not
taken with theſe: but ſee the vanity of them; what, are any
of us better then thoſe that have been bewitched by theſe? but
what puts the difference? The originall difference is, God
hath written them in the Lambs book of life, and <hi>what hee
hath written, he hath written,</hi> as <hi>Pilate</hi> ſayd: Hee hath written
ſuch to life, and his decree is irrecoverable: <hi>My counſell ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57074:78"/>
ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure,</hi> Iſa. 46. 9, 10. Therefore there
is the Originall, from thence it flows, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
concurring with the Fathers counſell, he hath given us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
from the blood of Anceſtors, and redeemed us from
the preſent evill world, and will ſeek up every ſtragling
Lamb, and preſents us ſpotleſſe to his heavenly Father, and
then the ſpirit of God, by which he works all in the hearts
of his people that receives us, for Chriſt and the ſpirit; for
Chriſt comes and takes poſſeſſion of us, and ſo thereby girds
up our loyns to a dependance on him, and his grace, that we
are preſerved and ſaved from thoſe fearfull temptations that
overcome others, and all the world are over-whelmed
withall.</p>
               <p>It may teach us the marvellous freedome of the love of
God;<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> and therefore to admire the wonderfull love of God,
the cauſe of all this our preſervation from ſuch prevailing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
as ſwallow up the whole world; how doth it appear?
why, I pray you conſider, when the Lord wrote down thy
name, or mine, or any mans name, who ſtood by at his elbow
(if I may ſo ſpeak) to put him in mind of my name or thine?
he thought of us, if our names be there, and he ſet us downe,
and he delivered us to Chriſt Jeſus by name; what ever thy
name is, he took notice of thy name; ſuch a man in ſuch a
place, he will live in this or that Countrey, he is one, take
notice of him, lay down a price for him; in fulneſſe of time
ſend a ſpirit into this heart; if he live in a Popiſh Countrey,
ſave him from Popery; If in a worldly Countrey, ſave him
from the world: where ever he lives, ſave him from himſelf,
and bring him to my heavenly Kingdom; but what was
there in us that could commend us to God? or what could
there in us but what he appointed, but what he ſhould put
into us; he could not fore-ſee any thing, but that hee muſt
work it, therefore it muſt certainly be his undeſerved love
that muſt take notice of them, and give them ſo to come to
Chriſt, <hi>and all that the Father hath given him ſhall come unto him.</hi>
The Lord will draw them, and then they ſhall come; in the
meane time he keeps them from his Fathers eternal donation,
in <hi>John 17. 17. Thoſe whom thou haſt given me, I have kept.</hi> Hee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57074:78"/>
hath not loſt any, but one that was not given him to keep, he
prays to God to keepe them through his own name, he
keeps them by his own ſpirit, and this was agreed on from
the foundation of the world, when this book was written;
and it was not written yeſterday, but before the foundation
of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. His thoughts were about thee and
me; and whoever is written therein, a matter of much praiſe
and glory to God, that he ſhould have ſuch marvellous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thoughts to us. <hi>Pſalm. 139. 17. How precious are thy
thoughts to me O God.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 5. we read of the
precious thoughts of God towards us; that hee ſhould have
ſuch thoughts, when time yet was not, neither we nor our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and all he did fore-ſee in thee and me, would but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
his wrath; what was good he muſt work, and that was
from his counſell: If you ſee any vaniſh away, or fall away
from his grace, and from his Saints, and he hath no pleaſure
in them, they are not given to Chriſt, you ſee he is the giver
of them; but if men be not given to Chriſt, they will fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
<hi>All that the Father gives me ſhall come unto me, it is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will I ſhould not looſe one of them.</hi> If men will not hearken
to the Biſhop of their ſouls, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſee the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
danger thereof, and the originall root, <hi>They are not
written in the Lambs book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be of ſingular comfort to all the elect of God,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note>
whoſe names are written in the book of Life: It is a great
comfort that a man is written to life, hee might have beene
written to death, had not the Lord been pleaſed ſo to doe:
You read in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>Of certain men crept
in unawares, who were of old ordained to condemnation:</hi> The word
in the Originall is, <hi>fore-written, written afore-time to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
Now I ſay, that a man is not written to deſtruction, but
to life, and to life in Chriſt; not as <hi>Adam,</hi> that was to ſtand
by his own ſtrength, and ſo long as he uſeth grace well, he
ſhall live; but if not, he ſhall dye: and he ſo uſed it, that if
God give him not life in Chriſt, he dyed for ever: This is in
<hi>Adams</hi> covenant, not in Chriſts, that was for a man to live by
his own righteouſneſſe: <hi>Do this and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Levit. 18. 5.
How wofull was our condition in this caſe, but to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57074:79"/>
to life, and to life in Chriſt; that is, <hi>Becauſe hee lives, we
ſhall live alſo: I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> And by this
being written in the Lambs book of life, that the Lord ſhould
think upon us, when we had no thoughts of him; nay had
no being, that he ſhould then undertake for us; that when
the Father gives us, he will receive us; and by receiving us,
keep us ſpotleſſe to his heavenly Kingdome, that he wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
us from poſſibility of damnable Errors: <hi>They ſhall ſeduce
if it were poſſible, the very Elect,</hi> Mat. 24. 24. But there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility;
what a marvellous matter is it, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any of thoſe that are given to Chriſt ſhould be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
it is ſuch a mercy that may ſwallow up all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all afflictions, all blaſphemy of a mans good name
and ſtate, and wealth, and health, and all whatſoever;
this may ſupport him, that it is not poſſible he ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
For <hi>the Lord knows who are his,</hi> the foundation of
God ſtands ſure; the Lord hath written it, and he is more
conſtant then <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the Kings of <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes:</hi> The
Law is written and eſtabliſhed by the Kings Ring, and God
is more ſtedfaſt then any of the Kings of the Earth, what he
hath written ſhall be accompliſhed; the Lord will draw them
to Chriſt, and Chriſt will keep them, not one of them ſhall
periſh, not one of them ſhall worſhip the Beaſt; or if they
do, they ſoone ſee their folly, and are recovered out of all
ſnares, they ſhall not prevaile againſt them.</p>
               <p>It may be of inſtruction and exhortation,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 5.</note> to provoke
you to make your election ſure, then you make your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
ſure, and preſervation from Popery and the world,
and from the Devill, and from your own corrupt Nature,
ſure that you ſhall not be carried captive with the polutions
of the times and places you live in, though hundreds run from
God one way, and ten thouſands another way, &amp; fall off hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither, yet you ſhall ſtill be preſerved: in <hi>John</hi> 6.
68. where our Saviour asked his Diſciples, <hi>will ye alſo go away?</hi>
when many of thoſe that were his Diſciples went away and
fell off from him, being offended from ſomething which he
had ſpoken to them, and that was that Doctrine that we have
now in hand, and ſome other corolaries from it, they walked
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57074:79"/>
no more with him; then ſaith Chriſt to the reſt, <hi>will yee alſo
go away? Peter</hi> anſwered in the behalfe of the reſt; <q>Lord, to
whom ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternall life:</q> As
who ſhould ſay, whether ſhall a man go to mend himſelf?
<hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life?</hi> and having the words of
eternall life, how ſhall they do better elſe where? ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves
us then as we deſire, to be preſerved from all apoſtacy
and backſliding from God, notwithſtanding all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the flattering world, or buſie world, or from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
world, by perſecution, and flattering by proſperity,
and buſie world, by the cares of the world, and continuall
cumber about the world, and diſtempers in our hearts on that
ground, in ſuch a caſe as this what ſhall preſerve us? If our
names be written in the Lambes book of life, truely we ſhall
be preſerved, that neither the world, nor our paſſions and
luſts ſhall prevail againſt us. <hi>My father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand:
and I and my Father are oue, my Father and I will keepe them,</hi> Joh.
10. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, it is a needleſſe exhortation to make
our election ſure, if that be not done long ago; for it is not
begun in this world, but long before; it is concluded long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or elſe we are not written in the Lambes book of life;
one of theſe two is concluded in Heaven: Chriſt knows thoſe
that are given to him by his Father, before he knows them by
name, <hi>John</hi> 10. 14. It is worthy of memory that Chriſt
knows them all by name, that argues the particularity and
ſingularity of them, as he knows all the Stars in Heaven, ſo
doth he much more know all his elect; if he know them all
by name, hee then particularly obſerves them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
us with bleſſings of goodneſſe, and preſerves us from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
evills, but if it be recorded of God, is it not in vain to
exhort to make it ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it were in vain, methinks the Apoſtle ſhould not
have uſed it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Then that is it that lyes upon all
Chriſtians; ſome think it is not poſſible, but then it were a
vain exhortation, <hi>Make your calling and election ſure;</hi> if you
do, a wide and open door of entrance ſhall be miniſhed unto
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57074:80"/>
you; well then though I cannot make ſure my election in it
ſelfe, for it is ſure in it ſelfe; but the Queſtion is, whether it
it is ſure to me, that is my duty, for he knowes who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and knows them by name, and keeps them in his name, and
hath given his Angels charge over us, and they will all watch
over us, and therefore our Saviour in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. ſaith to
his Diſciples, <hi>Rejoyce not in this that the Devils are ſubject unto
you, but that your names are written in Heaven.</hi> Our election is
ſure enough in heaven, no ſtormes will alter it there: But
now (in a word) can we make our election ſure? the Apoſtle
intimates when you make your calling ſure, you make your
election ſure: your calling, that is but the actuall execution
of this eternall election; but they are ſo neere, that many
the Lord puts them one for another, he tells his Diſciples,
<hi>you have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> John 15. 16. he
means of his ſelection, his calling them out of the world, then
he doth communicate his electing love to ſuch; it is wrought
for us before in Chriſts death, in Gods councell, and in his
effectuall redemption, wrought for us on the Croſſe: but
yet it is not manifeſt to our conſciences till calling, but make
your calling ſure, and then election is ſure: <hi>When you are
called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. that is this book of
life, that is his purpoſe, that we are in Gods purpoſe written
to life, look to that he hath ſaved us, and called us, <hi>Not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our workes, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which
was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 8. that is the book of life
and grace; of free grace, purpoſing us to life; and you read
in <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he predeſtinated, them he hath called; and
whom he called, them he juſtified:</hi> now if a man be effectually
called to grace that doth ſearch election, let me briefly touch
it, that which makes ſure calling.</p>
               <p>1. In our effectuall calling, there is a declaration of Gods
love to the ſoul in Chriſt Jeſus by the ſpirit of grace, in the
doctrine of the Goſpell, for that is Gods call; in our calling,
God calls for his part by his grace and ſpirit, and we anſwere
that ſpirit, by that faith, which by the call of God is wrought
in our hearts; I ſay, God calls effectually to his grace by
manifeſting the rich grace of God in Chriſt, electing freely,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57074:80"/>
calling freely, from the obedience of ſinne and Satan, to the
liberty of the ſons of God, as to thoſe in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time,
when they wandered up &amp; down like Lambs in a large place:
<hi>Bilney</hi> he fetches in that one word in his loſt and forlorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
He read this promiſe, and the ſpirit of God applies
it; <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am
chiefe:</hi> This being applyed by the ſpirit, it falls on him with
power, and he ſees the goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, and the
vanity of all things elſe: and ſeeing ſo much glory in Chriſt,
and in particular to him alſo, this lets him ſee the vanity of
all other courſes; for this manifeſtation of Gods ſpirit doth
effectually and manifeſtly open our eyes to ſee, and hearts to
believe what the Lord offers, for faith is ſaid to receive what
the Lord gives of grace; here is then that which makes call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſure, for otherwiſe how can we know it, but by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,
and declaration, and revelation of the Spirit:
The things that eye never ſaw, nor eare heard, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entred into the heart of man, but he hath revealed them
by his ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9, 10. As no man knows the things of
man, but the ſpirit of man, ſo no man knows the things of God, but the
ſpirit of God: And we have not received the ſpirit of this world, but
the ſpirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given us of God.</hi> The ſpirit of God it is that ſearcheth all
things, <hi>even the deep things of God,</hi> and reveals them to us, and
lets us ſee the treaſures of grace, and lets us ſee them thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
this is the ground of effectuall calling, God calling
by his ſpirit, and we anſwering that call, and from both
theſe ſprings another fruit of our effectuall calling, which
is likewiſe a certaine pledge of it that being thus called: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that hath called us to the fellowſhip
of his ſonne</hi> actually and effectually.</p>
               <p>2. Thence it comes to paſſe, that wee chooſe the Lord for
our God: <hi>We have none in heaven but him, nor none on earth that
we deſire in compariſon of him:</hi> Away then with thoſe beautifull
Strumpets, and all works of iniquity, and wayes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
wayes of ambition, theſe are all blaſted; now <hi>I deſire
to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2.
and now it is, <hi>that he rejoyceth in nothing, ſave in the Croſſe of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57074:81"/>
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. Now this electing love in
that we elect God, we could never chooſe God, had not he cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
us, and in ſome meaſure diſcovered what his electing love
was to us, this brings the heart back again to chooſe him, and
none but him: now that is another ſecurity of our election,
and therein it differs from all others; a man may have a kinde
of ſanctification by common gifts, which will leave him ſtill
to work for himſelfe, but this is to abuſe the very gifts of
God, which the ſpirit hath wrought in us, though they be not
ſuch as accompany ſalvation, ſtill we are not lift up above
our ſelves, but when we are called effectually to Chriſt;
now no motion ſwayes us, but as we ſee the will of God in it,
we cannot beleive as the Church beleives: but we beleive
our brethren and the Church, as we ſee the Church follows
the foot-ſteps of the will of God; <hi>If I now pleaſe men</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>I am not the ſervant of Chriſt, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. Nor of
men ſought we glory, when we might have been burden ſome,
as the Apoſtles of Chriſt: If a man be left to faſt for himſelfe,
or pray for himſelfe, or worke for himſelfe, and all is for
himſelfe, that he work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from a principal reſpect unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
truly this will darken a mans effectuall calling; and if
it be his conſtant courſe, doubtleſſe his heart is not right with
God: It is true, in a pang of temptation a man may be
wheeled about, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> yet the ſight of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
love quickens them to ſee their ſinne, how farre they
are turned aſide from God; but there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſoul is bent, as it
were, with the point of a compaſs touched with a Load-ſtone,
it may be jogged by windes and ſtormes, yet it lookes ſtill to
the North pole; though you may ſhake it from its courſe,
yet let it but ſtand a while, it will directly look to the North
pole, there it will ſtand; ſo it is with all the children of
God, they cannot but worke; for Chriſt in <hi>John 16. 14. He
ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and give it unto you:</hi>
So that the heart that is ſincere, it workes from Chriſt, and
for Chriſt, and with Chriſt; <hi>I laboured more abundantly then
they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me, 1 Cor.</hi>
15. 10. So that you ſee what the manner of Gods people in
this caſe is, they are from Chriſt, and for Chriſt, and with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57074:81"/>
Chriſt, and it is a ſeal of Gods election; the higheſt ſeal is,
<hi>God knowes who are his,</hi> and that ſeal he manifeſts by his ſpirit
in the Goſpel, it is the ſpirit that ſeals up our adoption, and
here is another ſeal we ſet to our ſeal, while we cleave to him
with all our heart and ſoul, and ſeek after him, <hi>and have none
in heaven but him, nor on Earth that we deſire in compariſon of
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, the laſt aſſurance of a mans election and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(which I ſhall name at this time) is that which <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelfe doth expreſſe, in 2 <hi>Pet. 1. Give all deligence to make

us in <hi>ver. 5. Moreover adde to your faith virtue, and to virtue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>

them to adde grace to grace and one degree of grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<hi>and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if theſe things dwell in you, and abound,</hi>

               <p>THere remayns now the latter part of this verſ, which
is a deſcription of Jeſus Chriſt: and he is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>1. By the ſimilitude of a Lamb.</p>
               <p>2. By his paſſion; <hi>He is ſlaine:</hi> And</p>
               <p>3. <hi>By the antiquity of it;</hi> He is ſlaine from the foundation of
the world.</p>
               <p>The note is this:</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was as a Lamb;<note place="margin">Doctrine 2.</note> and though a Lamb, yet
was ſlaine: and though ſlaine in fulneſſe of time (about 4000. years
after the world began) yet in effect he was ſlaine from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world.</p>
               <p>This is the ſum of this latter part of the verſe. Not to ſtay
long in any of theſe things, and put to ſtay upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are principles of our Chriſtian faith; and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
may not be paſſed over in haſt, eſpecially conſidering
the handling of them is a ſpeciall branch of our calling. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Lamb of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) that taketh away the ſinnes of
the world,</hi> John 1. 29. 36. It was his particular office to point
at Chriſt, and he doth it under the notion of a Lamb: So it
is ſaid, <hi>A Lamb ſtood upon mount Zion,</hi> Rev. 14. 1.</p>
               <p>Now why a Lamb? In a double reſpect (and I ſpeak of no
more then what the Scripture hath reſpect unto:)</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of his innocency.</p>
               <p>2ly. In reſpect of his meekneſſe and patience.</p>
               <p>1. His innocency.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In his birth:</hi> That holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall
be called the ſonne of God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 35.</p>

this juſt perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he was thus innocent as a Lamb: So he was meeke
and patient as a Lamb: and the holy Ghoſt hath reſpect unto
it, <hi>Acts 8. 32. He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and like a
Lamb dumb before the ſhearers, ſo opened he not his mouth.</hi> And
therefore there is ſomething reſpected in his ſilence and quiet
ſubjection to the ſlaughter knife: And his patience or meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
doth expreſſe it ſelf in two things chiefly.</p>
               <p>1. In ſubmitting not himſelf only, but his will to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will. <hi>Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt (in his agony in the Garden)
<hi>if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, nevertheleſſe not as I will,
but as thou wilt. And if this cup may not paſſe away from me except
I drinke it, thy will be done,</hi> Mat. 26. 39. 42 And that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
after Gods own heart, when a mans heart is ſubdued to
the will of God; in which reſpect he did not murmure at his
Fathers hand, nor did expoſtulate his being delivered into
the hands of wicked men, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 23. Who when he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
reviled not againe; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly:</hi> And ſo meek was
be in this very kind, as that be prayed for his very enemies
and perſecutors. <hi>Luk. 23. 34. Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive
them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. His patience and meekneſſe ſtood in keeping ſilence in
his own juſt defence. <hi>As a Lamb dumb before the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arer,</hi> kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſilence before his Accuſers, and Judges, and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
He anſwered nothing before the high Prieſt; any thing
that might tend to his crucifying, as he doth expreſſe: If they
will make it a point to crucifie him, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>He was
the ſon of God:</hi> Saith he, <hi>I came into the world to bear witneſs unto
that.</hi> When <hi>Pilate</hi> did accuſe him, he anſwered nothing, and
the Governour wondred at it, knowing that hee could tell
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57074:83"/>
what to anſwer: He marvailed that ſo juſt a man, in ſo juſt a
caſe did not anſwer a word which did ſo narrowly concern
him: But he did not know what the cauſe was, that he was
as a Lamb dumb before the ſhearer, and before the ſlaughter
alſo.</p>
               <p>What might be the reaſon then of this Lamb lik innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and meekneſſe of Chriſt? (They are principles, and ought
to be incultated often:)</p>
               <p>The firſt ground is,</p>
               <p>To fulfill the types that went before of him,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Exod</hi> 12. 5.
The paſchall Lamb was without blemiſh. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 29 39.
The daily Sacrifice was to be a Lamb without ſpot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
therefore Chriſt muſt be ſuch.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from his perſonal union with
the ſecond perſon in Trinity:<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>For in him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 2 9. that is perſonally: So
that Chriſt muſt be a ſinner, if in any thing Chriſt had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either in doing or ſuffering (which were blaſphemy to
ſay): And hence ſprings an utter impoſſibility of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
acting any thing without the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d head acting by
him; for the Son can do nothing of himſelfe, but as he ſeeth
the Father do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> there is a further neceſſity of his Lamb-like inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:
From our neceſſity of ſuch a Sacrifice, and ſuch an
high Prieſt as was holy, and blameleſſe, and undefiled, <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 26, 27, 28. Such an high Prieſt it behooved us to have:
Yea, it was requiſite the Sacrifice ſhould be blameleſſe, <hi>Levit.</hi>
1. 3. And the Prieſt that offered it to be ſo alſo, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. 18.
For otherwiſe he could not make attonement for us, nor
could his attonement be accepted.</p>
               <p>But why was he thus patient, ſilent, and meek? a double
reaſon of that.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> That his Sacrifice might be voluntary, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the Father. <hi>Sacrifice and offering for ſinne thou wouldſt
not, neither hadſt pleaſure therein,</hi> which are offered by the law;
Then ſaid he, <hi>Loe I come to doe thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10. 8, 9.
Whoever was to offer a Sacrifice, was to bring it himſelfe,
and deliver it up, and himſelfe with it, and it muſt be offered
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57074:83"/>
willingly: Wheeher it was the Congregation that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a ſinne, or whether it were any particular perſon,
they were to bring their oblation: Any Sacrifice that a man
would have accepted, he muſt bring it to the door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 4. 14. 23. The Prieſt muſt not fetch it: If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would bring their Sacrifice they might; but if they were
extorted from them, they were not accepted: So the Lord Jeſus
muſt come and freely offer up himſelfe, as one that was to be
preſented in the ſtead of all the Elect: Hee offered himſelfe a
Surety of the Covenant; we ſhould have brought it, but we
had it not in our hearts: But hee brings himſelfe, and layes
downe his life of himſelfe, and takes it up againe, <hi>John</hi>
10. 18.</p>
               <p>And 2ly. why did he expreſſe his patience in that ſilence of
his? The reaſon was from this very cauſe, even</p>
               <p>From the want of ſufficient matter to give a juſt Anſwer in
our behalfe by all things that he could alledg for us.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> If hee
had ſtood in his own perſon, and had had nothing to do
but to cleare himſelfe, he had had a world to have anſwered
for himſelfe, and this <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw; for he ſaid that he was a
King, but a King of another world, and <hi>Pilate</hi> knew that
there was no <hi>Ceſarian</hi> Law that did forbid a Kingdome in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world: but ſtanding in our perſons, hee knew not
what to anſwer: What could there be charged upon Chriſt,
but we have been guilty of it? Can it be ſayd that none of
the Elect of God did blaſpheme? and that none of them did
deſtroy the Temple of God? and can it be juſtified that all the
Elect of God have been freed from commotions? Can any
undertake that defence for the elect of God? What ſinne can
you charge upon him, but ſome of the ſervants of God have
been guilty of it? Therefore it is, that the Lord Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
not: He doth not deny, he doth not out-face them in
the buſineſſe: It is not ſo with him; He is not ſuch an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:
He pleads with a good conſcience when he pleads, and
he is clear, but he cannot clear his Elect ones from Church-cenſure,
and Civill cenſure: Nor doth he plead with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
any kind of hard-ſhip, in putting upon him that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
he knew the elect of God had deſerved ſuch: And
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57074:84"/>
though he knew that they dealt wickedly, yet ſtanding in
our room, hee had not a ſufficient plea, let them charge him
with what they will: A man cannot charge him with any
ſinne, but ſome of his Elect have been guilty of it, and
therefore what can be anſwered? Therefore he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to excuſe himſelfe: He doth neither deny nor extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
any Crime that can be layd ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inſt him; but take it in its
full rigour, and the accuſation doth ſtand good: They ſtand
not good againſt the Principall, but againſt the Surety, as
hee is a Surety, they ſtand good againſt him; for as it is
in <hi>Job 9. 2, 3. How ſhould man be juſt with God? If hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let a man ſtand before the Tribunall of the juſtice of God,
and he cannot anſwer one of a thouſand: And if Chriſt be
to ſtand for all the elect of God, hee cannot anſwer one of a
thouſand: And therefore when the King came to ſee the
man in the room that had not on the wedding Garment, the
man was ſpeechleſſe; which plainly ſhewes us, that if Chriſt
ſtand in the room of Gods people, the caſe ſtands ſo, that
Chriſt cannot anſwer for us, to excuſe us. <hi>Job</hi> could not
anſwer one of a thouſand, though he was the perfecteſt man
in his Generation (and I know not whether any man after
him that was more innocent then he:) And what ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Gods called ones be able to doe? and what they are
not able to doe, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hee doth carry it in
the ſame manner, as one that cannot excuſe them from being
guilty of thoſe ſinnes, no more then himſelfe can.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the reaſons both of Chriſts innocency and
patience.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the point is,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> to convince us of the guilt of all the elect people of
God, and their guiltineſſe even of violent death, and unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſſe
under that death. If ſo be we had been innocent,
what needed Chriſt to have been ſo patient as hee was, ſo
Lamb-like in his innocency? His Lamb-like innocency is an
argument of our guiltineſſe: The ſervants of God, eſpecially
ſuch as take any more narrow ſearch of their own waves,
they ſee themſelves full of blemiſhes, ſpots, and wrinckles,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57074:84"/>
and many ſuch things, <hi>Iſa. 64. 6. We are all as unclean things,

and to ſay juſtly, Chriſt would have ſayd it much more fully
then we could; for he is our Advocate, and it were a ſhame
for an Advocate, if the party of the cauſe could defend his
cauſe better then his Advocate: Chriſt is more skilful in the
Law then we; but his ſilence doth profeſſe, that he knows
not what to ſay, to ſtand out in our defence. He might have
excuſed ſome of Gods elect from this or that actual groſſe
Sinne; but he could have excuſed none from a guilty prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to all manner of Sinne: There is a vicious proneneſſe
in us to all ſinne, and therefore Chriſt could not tell what to
ſay. And as there is a proneneſſe in us to all ſinne, ſo there
is an actuall commiſſion of many ſinnes, <hi>And in many things
we ſinne all,</hi> James 3. 2. And there are few or none of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
that if ſo be a man that is privy to all their dealings,
were to give an account of them, he could not juſtifie them
from the guilt, and ſtain of all ſinne. Now this is the caſe of
Chriſt, he hath been acquainted with all our wayes; and if he
be examined of what hath been done wickedly, before the
Church, and before the Common-wealth, he is not able to
deny, but both Church and Common-wealth might proceed
againſt us all. And this may caſt a holy bluſhing upon us in
the preſence of the Lord, and of this Lamb: Chriſt could
have told what to have anſwered, if ought had been to be
anſwered; but when he ſtands in our room, he ſtands ſilent:
he could not with truth bear witneſſe unto any of us touching
our guiltineſſe: knowing what he knew by us, it would
make us unfit for both ſocieties, either of Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
And it is a juſt humiliation for a man to know
that he ſtands in ſuch a ſtate, of which no good account can
be given: A man that is skilful indeed, and knows the Law
as well as Chriſt did, ſtanding in our room, he hath nothing
to anſwer for himſelfe, and the Lord knows it, and time was

can plead any righteouſneſſe of his own: Whoever he be that
will not ſtand righteous before the judgement ſeat of God by
any righteouſneſſe of his own, he muſt ſtand mute as Chriſt
himſelfe ſtood: and if he be juſt, he muſt be juſt by his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
Chriſt could plead nothing for us of our own,
not our active obedience, nor any paſſive obedience of ours:
but he having ſuffered for us, the puniſhment that all the
wickedneſſe of the Elect have deſerved, <hi>Now he doth ever live to
make interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Now he hath arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to plead: <hi>If any man ſin now, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, 2 John</hi> 2. 1. Why did he not
plead before? Truly he could not open his mouth before,
becauſe he had not yet ſuffered: but now he hath ſuffered,
the juſt for the unjuſt, and now that he hath borne the cenſure
of Church and Common-wealth, now he hath enough to
plead in the behalfe of the pooreſt chriſtian. And if ſo be
that any plead againſt his Saints and ſervants, and ſay that
they are guilty of theſe &amp; theſe ſins, God wil ſay, <hi>Deliver him
from going down to the pit; I have found a ranſome,</hi> Job 33. 24.
He now pleads ſatisfaction to the juſtice of his Father; and
having ſatisfied for all, there is a ſufficient plea in his mouth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57074:86"/>
for all the Elect of God: whatever our actual tranſgreſſions
have been, the Lord hath aboundant plea for all his people:
that ſo he may both obtain of the Father, the ſpirit to beſtow
good things upon us; and having given us ſuch things, as
faith, and love, and repentance, he may plead our ſincerity of
heart, and that argues communion with himſelfe, and ſaith
in his bloud: But that which doth make us ſtand righteous
before him is this, that he himſelfe was a Lamb without ſpot,
and yet did not plead his own innocency, but did bear all for
us, and for us all, that we might ever be righteous in the ſight
of God. And thus will God have all his ſervants plead, or
elſe they ſhall not have ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt to plead ſilence;</hi> That then thou mayeſt remember, and be
confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame,
when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the
Lord God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly to plead our iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 51. 3, 4. I acknowledg
my tranſgreſſion, and my ſinne is ever before mee: Againſt thee
onely have I ſinned and done this evill in thy ſight, that thou mighteſt
be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But purge me with by ſope and I
ſhall be clean.</p>
               <p>Looke therefore unto this point mainly and principally,
that if we come to plead before the Lord our God, hee doth
require we ſhould examine our ſelves, and in the end be ſo
ſurprized (when we have done) as not to have what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Chriſt could not tell what to anſwer, and we muſt
not wonder, if wee doe not finde what to anſwer: For here
God magnifieth his love in ſetting forth himſelfe unto a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
to be a God juſtifying him that cannot juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
He ſeeth there is the way of the grace of God, the Lord
hath done this in Chriſt; and the manifeſtation and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it doth ſo poſſeſſe the hearts of Gods children, that
it cauſeth them to cleave unto him for all their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and peace: And this is of great neceſſity, and of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
practice for the Saints of God to attend unto, that we
might not be at a loſſe in this great queſtion of our ſoules.
Conſcience cryes out unto us, and wee know not in the
world what to ſay, for wee are wicked beyond meaſure in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57074:86"/>
the ſight of God, our own ſincerity will not plead our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
before God: But all it will do, will come to this
end, that we ſhall be convinced, we have nothing to ſay:
(Nay an Angel, nay the Sonne himſelfe could not tell what
to ſay for us) but wee look to be juſtified freely by his grace:
And the God of all grace doth ſo juſtifie Chriſts cauſe, that
all the world that are juſtified, ſhall be juſtified by his plea,
who hath done all things for us that concern our everlaſting
ſalvation.</p>

all bitterneſſe of contention, and pangs of paſſion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,

But this will prevaile in all Gods people, that God will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Be of that ſpirit therefore in all your Tranſactions, that is to
ſay, mild, and patient, and innocent: And ſo it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
all the children of God in the ſame kind, to keep Lamb-like
ſilence, when you are charged with any fault whereof
you are guilty.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous ſinne when men are found in a fault, they
have a thouſand excuſes for it, and utter denyal of ſuch
things, ſo as they will cut you a Weavers beame unto a very

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57074:87"/>
nor will he confeſſe it, for they charged it upon him in his
own perſon, and ſo he could not confeſſe it: Hee could not
deny it, becauſe then he ſhould not have ſtood in our room
as he did. And therefore it behooves thoſe that are young or

ſpiritual confuſion: Wee ſhall lye downe in our ſhame,
with our confuſion upon our faces, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 24, 25. Wee
cannot deny it, nor excuſe it, and therefore we are ready to
conclude, woe to us that ever we were born; That is not a

ever we come unto Chriſt: And therefore it is a way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and of life for a man to be confounded in himſelfe
for his ſin, for the Lord doth never juſtifie a ſinner, untill hee
hath confounded him.</p>
               <p>Many a man many times will ſay, it is true, godly friends
have had a good opinion of me, but they are deceived by my

Jeſus ſtood not at a non-plus in his room; for Chriſt could
not tell what to ſay, till hee had made ſatisfaction; neither

ſlaughtered; <hi>He was led as a Lamb to the ſlaughter.</hi> Slaughter
implyes a violent death put upon him, partly by the juſtice
of God, partly by the wickedneſſe of men, and partly by the
malice of Satan. By the juſtice of God: the word is very
ſtrong in <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated,
but it ſignifies properly to grind him: the ſame word
is tranſlated deſtruction in <hi>Pſal. 90. 3. Thou turneſt man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi>
and ſo it pleaſed the Father thus to grinde him to
powder that he might have nothing of chaffe; he ground
him to duſt with grief, and horror, anguiſh, and agony, and
terrour, and pain, Iſa. 53. 6. <hi>The Lord laid upon him the iniquity of

mean to diſſolution of ſoul and body. And ſo by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe

executed. <hi>What think you of him</hi> ſaith <hi>Caiphas, you have heard

be guiltleſſe, yet delivered him to be crucified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.
And the people ſayd, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to
dye,</hi> John 19. 7. Thus was he delivered by the wickedneſſe
of men: <hi>and</hi> Pilate <hi>knew they did it of envy,</hi> Mat. 27. 18. So
that it was a great wickedneſſe in <hi>Pilate</hi> to gratifie the people,
and to ſuffer ſuch an innocent Lamb to be crucified; yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he will looſe the favour of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of the people,
he delivers him to be crucified.</p>
               <p>And which is more then ſo; as he dyed by the juſtice of
God, and the wickedneſſe of men, ſo by the malice of Satan:
for our Saviour ſaith in <hi>Luke 22. 52. This is the very hour and
power of darkneſſe.</hi> The gates of Hell were opened to powre
upon him all the vengence they were able. It was fore-tould
in <hi>Gen. 3. 15. It ſhall bruiſe they head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
The Serpent ſhould bruiſe his heel, that is Chriſt, the ſeed of
the woman. His heel, you will ſay that falls far ſhort of death;
to pinch a man on the heele, it may make him go lamely, but
not kill him: but the holy Ghoſt intends, that all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
that Satan works againſt Chriſt or any of his members,
it doth but reach to the bruiſing of the heele. It bruiſed his
heele, that implies, that Chriſt ſhould have a body like ours:
and his heele, that is the lower part of Chriſt, his humanity,
Satan ſhould bruiſe it. <hi>And he ſhall break thy head;</hi> it is the
ſame word, and therefore you may take them both for
breaking, or both for bruiſing: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> expounds it
well (in 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18.)</hi> when he tells you Chriſt ſuffered for
ſinne, <hi>The juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being
put to death in the fleſh:</hi> His heele was bruſed, that is, his fleſh.
So that though the Lord ſuffered unſupportable miſery, to be
forſaken of his Diſciples, betrayed by one, and forſworn by
another, to be forſaken of his Father in regard of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
fellowſhip he had with him: Though he ſuffered all
this, in inward and outward man, to ſuch extremity that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57074:90"/>
made him ſweat drops of blood, and in the end to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ghoſt, yet all this was but the heele, the lower part of
Chriſt as it were; for his perſonal union is not in the leaſt
meaſure intercepted: his head and councel ſtands ſure, and
all his indeavours will finde a bleſſed accompliſhment.
Whereas the Lord breakes the head of Satan, not onely cuts
him off from all hope of fellowſhip in grace, but all his plots
ſhall be diſappointed at length, and all execution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
they ſhall be bruſed: the Sonne of God comes to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the works of Satan, to undoe them. Thus comes the
Lamb to be ſlaine. The reaſon of the point is double.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> to fulfil all the former types of the Legall Sacrifices.
The Iſraelites were to ſlay the Paſchal lamb in the evening (at
the ninth hour of the day) <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6. about the ſame time
he was ſlain: And all other Sacrifices for reconciliation
were to be killed, neceſſary therefore he ſhould be ſlain; The
daily Sacrifice which conſiſted of a Lamb in the morning, and
a Lamb in the evening, were both ſlaine, though without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
and ſo was Chriſt. But that was but a ſhadow, for
Chriſts ſuffering was rather the cauſe of them: but it is
the Scripture phraſe, this was done, that this and that may
be fulfilled, becauſe ſuch a thing in after times was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the cheif reaſon why it was requiſite Chriſt ſhould
be ſlaine, and why he would be ſlaine, was</p>
               <p>That he might lay down his life for a ranſome or price for

continues not in all things written in the Law to doe them:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
ſaith the Lord, I ſet before you life and death; obey it
and live, do it not, and dye; This is the ſanction and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Law of God throughout the books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
And therefore that he might ſatisfie the Law, and the wrath
of God <hi>(Ezek. 18. 20. The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye)</hi> that
he might diſcharge the debt wee ran into, and ſatisfie for our
defects, it was neceſſary to pay this price of redemption, to
ſave us from death, and all evils that drew on death. And
conſequently therefore he hath ſaved us from ſinne, <hi>Rev. 1.
5. He hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſinnes in his bloud. He
hath redeemed us alſo from the world,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. <hi>Who gave himſelfe
for our ſinnes, that he might deliver us from this preſent evill world:
and he hath alſo given himſelfe unto the death, that he might deſtroy
through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Devill,</hi>
Heb. 2. 14. So this is one part of the reaſon, and the ſum
of the ends why Chriſt gave himſelfe to be ſlaughtered, and
his life as a price of redemption to redeem us from evill, for
redemption is from captivity and bondage from ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the world. This was a principal end of his death;
but it was but part of it. Here is a price to redeem us from
evil, from ſo many captivities wherein we were overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But there is a price given of purchaſe, to the praiſe of
his glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. It is a price of purchaſe of ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
poſſeſſion: and for that end it was alſo given in a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
manner. Now what is the purchaſed poſſeſſion which
the Lord hath given his bloud as a price to pay? Truly as
the Lord hath redeemed us from the three great enemies of
our ſouls, ſo he hath purchaſed the three greateſt bleſſings the
ſonnes of men are capable of, and they are the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
they can reach to.</p>
               <p>1. He hath purchaſed reconcilement with the Father. <hi>He
hath reconciled us by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. God loved
us indeed from eternity when he choſe us, <hi>but we were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
children of wrath as well as others.</hi> How came we to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
and reconciled to the Father, from whom we fell as
much as we could, by the bloud of the Lamb, that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
us to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:57074:91"/>
Secondly, by his death, he hath paid a price of purchaſe
for union, and poſſeſſion of union with the Sonne. So doth
the holy Apoſtle teach us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13. to 16. <hi>You that
were ſometimes farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt:</hi>
For he is our peace who hath made both one <hi>(Jewes</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> both one) and hath broken down the middle wall
of partition between us: So that he hath made <hi>Jewes</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> one houſhold of God, and hath built us upon Jeſus
Chriſt the cheif corner ſtone.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond purchaſe which the Lord hath given
his blood for the price of. We had never been united to
Chriſt, nor by Chriſt been brought to the Father, but by the
bloud of his croſſe: his blood hath flain all enmity between
God and us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the ſame price he hath alſo purchaſed us the
holy Spirit. Theſe are the three perſons in Trinity, a poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
of Chriſt to be our head: of the Father to be our God
and King, and our Father, as his Father; therefore he tels
his Diſciples in <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. ſaith he, <hi>Touch me not, for I go
to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had by death overcome death, <hi>now I go to my
Father and your Father:</hi> He hath purchaſed the poſſeſſion of
Gods fatherly love: he hath alſo purchaſed union with
himſelfe, and therefore he prayed that his paſſion might be
available to this end, that all that ſhould beleive through the
Apoſtles preaching ſhould be one with them, <hi>John 17 21, 23.
That they all might be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,
that they alſo may be one in us, that the world may believe that
thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that
they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> So that this is the purchaſe
which the Lord by his blood hath purchaſed, reconciliation
with the Father, and union with the Sonne, and alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
of the holy Ghoſt, as 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16, 17. Know yee
not that yee are the Temple of God, and that the ſpirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in you.</hi> And as he tels us in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 18. Through him we
have an acceſſe by one ſpirit unto the Father.</hi> So that this is a
purchaſe of unſpeakable bleſſings which the Lord hath given
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57074:91"/>
his blood for. It was not meet the blood of the Sonne of
God ſhould be ſpilt in vain (it were abhomination to God)
therefore he gives it to avoyd the greateſt evill that can befall
us, to cleanſe us from ſinne, and Satan, and to redeem us from
the curſe of God; and to free us alſo from death, and hell,
and the world, and all the enemies of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>He gave his blood for all this, not to redeem us from croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but from the curſe in croſſes, and that is the part which
drives us from God, <hi>Matth. 25. 41. Depart from me yee curſed.</hi>
So farre as any affliction might ſeparate us from God, he
hath redeemed us from it.</p>
               <p>Now from thence, as Chriſt hath given his blood for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with the Father, and for union with the Sonne,
and for communion with the holy Ghoſt; ſo he hath given
his blood for the purchaſe of ſome bleſſings that flow from
theſe. For by communion with the ſpirit we have.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Firſt communion with Chriſt in his death, mortifying
ſinne, and communion with him in his reſurrection raiſing
us up to righteouſneſſe. Whence the Apoſtle profeſſeth,</hi> that he
deſires to rejoyce in nothing but the croſſe of Chriſt, whereby the world
is crucified to him, and he unto the world, <hi>Gal. 6. 14. And in</hi> Rom.
6. 6. Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of death might
be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſinne.</p>
               <p>So there is the power of the ſpirit of Chriſt applying his
death, killing and crucifying ſinne and the world in us, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
the head of the Serpent, and conſequently all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Beaſt, of the Catholick Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
head of that Beaſt which is the Pope. He did therefore ſhed
his blood that he might deſtroy all the power of the enemy,
<hi>That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve
him without feare all the dayes of our life,</hi> Luke 1. 74. This is
the mighty power of the ſpirit applying the warme blood of
Chriſt to our foules.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond fruit that flows from union with the bleſſed
Trinity, is ratification of the Covenant of Grace. And
Chriſt layd downe his bloud for that end to ratifie all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
that a reconciled God hath made; and that is God in a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57074:92"/>
Covenant of Grace, <hi>That he will write his law in our hearts; that
he will forgive our ſinnes, and remember our iniquities no more; that
we ſhall know him,</hi> Jer. 31. 33, 34. Chriſt gave his blood to
ratifie this Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. And as the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
of a Teſtator ſtands not in force till the death of him
that made it, ſo the death of Chriſt ratifies this Covenant:
and as all the Covenants were confirmed by bloud, ſo hath
Chriſts blood done in a ſpeciall manner. And when he
ſpeaks of ratifying the Covenant, he doth not onely ſpeak of
ratifying of it in word, but cheifly in the hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and no price could have done that, but the blood of the
Sonne of God, by which he hath ratified all the promiſes of
God to the conſciences of Gods people: That when the heart
and conſcience of a ſinner is overwhelmed with inward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,
and fear of the wrath of God, and the curſe of the Law,
the fear of death and Hell: now what ſhall ſatisfie a chriſtian
in this, but the death of Chriſt? and what ſhall ratifie it? His
death hath purchaſed reconciliation with the Father, union
with the Son, and communion with the holy Ghoſt; <hi>now he
hath ſhed his ſpirit in our hearts, whereby we cry Abba Father,</hi> Gal.
3. 14. This ſpirit of God works faith in the hearts of
Gods people, whereby all theſe promiſes are confirmed: they
are all certainly made good, becauſe ſuch is the value and
virtue of the death of this innocent lamb of God, they are
now free from the terrour of death. It was not poſſible the
bloud of Buls and Goats ſhould take away ſinne, therefore
ſtill they had new ſacrifices, for the conſcience had loſt the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
by which it pleaded reconciliation by the ſpirit of God:
now he applying the death of Chriſt to the ſoul, doth fully
pacifie the conſcience, and ratifie the Covenant to the ſoul,
that now all the promiſes of Grace belong to this or that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Chriſt: and I pray mark it, becauſe it is as weighty
as any point of Religion: And of all the doctrines of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
there is none ſanctified ſo effectually, and immediatly
to beget faith in the ſoul, as the preaching of the croſſe of
Chriſt: All the doctrines of the Goſpel are for the begetting
of faith, but they have no efficacy this way, further then they
are ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt: other promiſes do
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57074:92"/>
confirme faith, and they may alſo beget it, but it is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the croſſe of Chriſt. That which gives ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Gods juſtice, that gives ſatisfaction to our conſciences,
for conſcience is convinced, that if God deal in juſtice (as he
knows no reaſon but he ſhould) then he of all men is moſt
miſerable: the burden of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s lies heavy, and is ready to
plunge him to hell: what will ſatisfie the conſcience now?
nothing in the world except it ſee ſome reaſon why Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſhould be ſatisfied; and how ſhall that be done? onely
by the death of the lamb of God. So that well doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
make the croſſe of Chriſt the ratification of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for that cuts of all ſinne, and curſe, and the rigor of the
Law, hell and death, and devill, and damnation, and all evil
that can befall us in this or another world, and doth ſatisfie
the juſtice of God that it might remove all theſe, and bears the
whole burden of the deſert of our ſinnes, purchaſeth recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with the Father, union with the Sonne, communion
with the holy Ghoſt. But what is all this to me, will the
ſoul ſay, unleſſe theſe be ſo given that faith be wrought in my
heart to diſcerne all theſe, and finde them? The Lord doth
indeed all theſe; the ſpirit of God comes and ſo preacheth the
Goſpel, and ſo applyes the Goſpel, as that in preaching theſe
things, he doth beget faith in the heart to believe that all
theſe things are indeed belonging to ſuch a ſoul, and to every
one whom he is pleaſed to accept, to the benefit of the croſſe
of Chriſt, and to fellowſhip therein: and now indeed is the
whole Covenant of Grace confirmed when by the death of
Chriſt the virtue of it is applyed by the ſpirit to the ſoul:
Not that there is a reconcilement to God before faith, and
union with the Sonne, and communion with the holy Ghoſt
before faith: It is before in Gods purpoſe, and Chriſts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
but when the ſpirit comes to apply this (whoſe work
it is to give accompliſhment to the work of the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;)
he applying this, works ſaith, and ratifies the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and thereupon the heart is ſatisfied, and the juſtice of
God ſatisfied, and the ſpirit at reſt from unſupportable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
which did before plow up the tender heart of a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that he lay ſprawling as it were in his blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57074:93"/>
3. A third benefit that flowes from the former in reſpect of
the price paid, and in regard of the virtue and efficacy of the
price when it comes to be applyed: you have not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
right unto the creatures to eat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſome
right and title to them by the blood of Chriſt. And he hath
alſo paid a price for the poſſeſſion of eternall glory. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill
the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion unto the praiſe of his glory,
Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. Untill doth argue, that there is a purchaſe we
do not yet receive: and when ſhall that be received? when
both we our ſelves, and the creatures ſhall be redeemed to the
glorious liberty of the ſons of God. Then ſhall we receive
the full benefit of the price which he hath paid whiles he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
upon the Croſſe. Therefore wonder not, that though
Chriſt being a lamb yet he was ſlain, that he being ſlain we
might be redeemed, and might enjoy the purchaſed poſſeſſion,
redemption from all evill in every kinde, from ſorrow, paine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the evil of them. And his blood alſo was a price
for a purchaſed poſſeſſion of reconciliation with the Father,
of union with the Sonne, of communion with the holy
Ghoſt; dominion over all ſinne, ratification of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to our ſoules, and at length the poſſeſſion of everlaſting
glory. This was the reaſon why the lamb was ſlaine, and
had it not been for theſe divine, and ſupernatural, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ends, he would not have proſtituted his life to ſuch a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ſhamefull death, as the death of the Croſſe was. It
was not meet the onely begotten Sonne of God ſhould come
down into the world to lead a miſerable life, and to dye an
accurſed death, but for noble and glorious ends, and you have
the ſum in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>For the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> it is a cauſe of juſt humiliation to us, whoſe ſins were
ſo out of meaſure ſinful, as that there is no ranſome to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for them, but ſuch an invaluable price, as the blood of
the Sonne of God. All the Gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi> all that the
world can give, what is it, to this invaluable blood of the
Sonne of God? Yet this was our caſe, and eſtate, that if we
had had many worlds for our inheritance, and given them all
for the redemption of one ſoule, it had not been ſufficient.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57074:93"/>
This was our eſtate, and this is the eſtate of all ſuch as yet live
in ſinne to this day. It is a deſperate eſtate that cannot be
repaired, nor themſelves reſcued from by ranſome, but the
blood of Chriſt. If our ſinnes had been of a leſſe nature, a
leſſe price might have made ſatisfaction: And yet ſuch is the
pride of the hearts of the ſonnes of men; that becauſe we live
civil lives (though yet natural) we have good natures, are ſo
well bred, do ſo many good offices, that we think it is not ſo
dreadful a matter, nor that we are ſo dangerous for our eſtate
as others: If it go ill with us, what will become of deſperate
roaring ruffines? whatever becomes of them, it is a frivolous
matter to you, or to ſuch as are civil, and hinder the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the grace of God: but if our natures be ſo good, and
our carriage ſo comely, I pray you what need ſuch an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
price be given? If a ſmall matter would have ſaved us
from the world, what need ſuch an invaluable price be given
to reſcue us from it? You will ſay, I hope I am not ſo addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the world, I would drive a bargaine home to the
head, and would not be cheated. But is that all you know
by your ſelves? certainly there is more; for if the Lord did
not ſee that inveglement which the word hath of us, and that
cloſe combination of us to it, the Lord would not have
thought it needful to ſend his onely Sonne to redeeme us
from this preſent evill world. Frugality is not a vice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but a virtue; and if there were no more but good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
ſurely there need not ſuch a price to be paid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us from the world: But certainly the Lord ſees ſuch
power of worldlineſſe, and untemperance in us, and ſuch
power of paſſions and luſts, that no means would reſcue us
therefrom but the power of the blood of his Sonne: and the
world hath ſuch hold of us, and we of it, that if it were not
for the blood of the Sonne of God, we ſhould never be reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from that engagement. And therefore let all flesh know,
there is that power of ſinne, and of the world, in the beſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and beſt education, that unleſſe the Lord come with the
blood of his Sonne, we ſhould be wedded to the world, and
our ſins, and luſts, and perish everlaſtingly.</p>
               <p>And for the Devil, you ſay you defie him, and did renounce
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57074:94"/>
him in Baptiſme, and promiſe it, or ſome other in your
ſtead.</p>
               <p>But if there were not a ſtrong power of Satan in us, how
comes it that the blood of Chriſt muſt be ſhed, to deſtroy
him that had the power of death, <hi>that is the Devill, Heb.</hi> 2. 14.
And therefore conſider of it, ſo ſtrongly did the cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe of the

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>reaten us, ſuch power hath ſin over the beſt nature,
that were it not for the blood of the Sonne of God, is
were not poſſible we ſhould be redeemed from them.</p>
               <p>Therefore if thou haſt a good opinion of thy ſelfe, that the
world hath no hold of thee, nor thy paſſions and luſts, and the
Devill leaſt of all, whatever the Law of God ſaith: know
that there was nothing could redeem us from this, but the
blood of the Sonne of God; and if thou doſt not believe this
(however thou art thus naturally born) the truth is, thou
trampleſt under foot the blood of Chriſt, as not worth the
ſpilling: If men be thus exact in their courſes, ſo equal in
their dealings, if the Devil have no power over you, to what
end did he through death deſtroy the Devill that had the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of death? If ſinne have no dominion over you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did he ſhed his blood, that the power of ſinne ſhould be
deſtroyed? And therefore all the while a man is out of Chriſt,
and the warme blood of Chriſt is not applyed thee, thy ſoule
is a bleeding to death.</p>
               <p>That look as it is with ſome men when in a conſumption,
&amp; have little hope of recovery, then they wil kill ſome lamb,
and while it is warme, will take the warme body of the lamb
and faſten it to them that they may be repaired: Truly thus
doth the Lord with us, he knowes we are farre conſumed, in
a ſtate of worldlineſſe, and a ſtate of ſinne, and Satan: how
ſhall the Lord reſcue us, and repaire us? No way but this,
here is an innocent Lamb, he wraps him about us, warmes us
with his blood, and ſo he recovers us againe from our conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
condition, conſuming with ſinfull luſts, and paſſions,
and Satanical deluſions. Look as Phyſitians, they will ſoon
gheſſe what the diſeaſe is by the receipt: If the Lord preſcribe
ſuch a receipt as this, the blood of the innocent Lamb of God,
then know it for a certain truth, we were in a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57074:94"/>
conſuming and waſting, and dead too, overſpread
with the world and Satan, and ſo had everlaſtingly periſhed,
had not the Lord provided ſuch a plaiſter as this.</p>
               <p>And indeed this will yet humble us the more, in caſe the
Lord make it appear that all this is done for me, and thee;
we may ſay as <hi>Mephiboſheth, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. 28 what are we, but
as dead dogs in the ſight of God, that the Lord ſhould give his
onely Sonne to recover ſuch dead dogs as we from that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eſtate in which we and our fathers lived, and many of
them dyed in, yet the Lord hath been more mercifull to us;
but what are we all but that the Lord might have cut us off?
Herein the Lord commends his love to us, <hi>that when we were
ſinners Chriſt dyed for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> it may ſerve to teach us, the wonderful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
love of God and of his Chriſt to us; the one, that
was thus willing to ſend his Sonne, the other thus willing to
go, that his blood ſhould be thus ſpilt like water upon the
ground, and himſelfe caſt aſide of men for the while (but for
ever accepted of God) that we might be ſaved. Herein the
Lord magnifies his mercy to mankinde; his juſtice, that he
will be ſatisfied; his mercy, that he will have ſatisfaction in
his Sonne, and doth not require it of our perſons. It is rich
Grace, that ſo we may ſtand, and wonder that the Lord ſhould
ever do it to ſuch as we, to give his Sonne (an innocent
Lamb) for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> it may teach us for ever to loath and abhor all
ſinne, as that which ſo deeply diſpleaſeth God, ſo as no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
might be made for ſinne, but the blood of his own
Sonne; and no blood could ſatisfie but that, and this ſin
hath been the ſlaughterer of the innocent Lamb of God. It
provokes God greatly, and ſlaughters his own Sonne; this is
the power and venome of Sinne. And therefore unleſſe we
take delight in the deep diſpleaſure of God, which is unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſable,
but in the blood of his Sonne, <hi>how ſhall we that are
dead to ſinne, live any longer therein? Rom.</hi> 6. 2. He means dead
through Chriſt; Chriſt is dead, and we in him, and with him,
all that have fellowſhip with him.</p>
               <p>Can we ſee the wrath of God riſing again, firſt in our
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57074:95"/>
ſoules, and breaking forth in fierceneſſe of the Lords indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How ſhall we dare to tread under foot the blood of
the Covenant, as if it were an unholy thing? If there were
no other argument to diſcourage from ſinne, this alone might
prevaile, the nature of ſinne, that ſo deeply diſpleaſeth God,
as there is no ſatisfaction but by the blood of Chriſt; and to
conſider, that ſinne hath ſlaughtered Chriſt Jeſus. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the meditation of the ſlaughter and death of Chriſt,
ſhould be as a ſlaughtering knife to cut aſunder all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ſinne. What is it that all pleaſures and profits can
put upon us, to countervaile the loſſe of the favour of God,
and the blood of the Lamb? can any ſinne procure the favour
of God, or any thing anſwerable to the favour of God? or
can any allurements of the world, or temptations that can
put upon us, or Satans ſuggeſtions; can they make the blood
of Chriſt an unworthy thing? or give us greater matters
then the blood of Chriſt hath purchaſed? And therefore
how ſhall we ſinne againſt the love of God? <hi>how ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this great wickedneſs, and ſinne againſt God?</hi> ſinne againſt the
blood of this immaculate Lamb of God. Theſe very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are enough to cut off all ſinne.</p>

up our ſelves back again to Chriſt, that we may now live to
him. That we may now live to the father, and to the Son;
that we may not live to ſinne, to Satan, to the world, <hi>But to
him that hath dyed for us, and given himſelfe for us; I live by the
faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for ſinne, he
dyed for us, that we might not now live to our ſelves, nor to the luſts of
men, but to the will of God, 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2, 3. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 15. So
that this is that which the Lord now cals us to, to wit, to live
now no longer to thoſe things from which we were redeemed
by an invaluable price.</p>
               <p>We are redeemed from the bondage of ſinne, and Satan,
and from the world: and not onely redeemed from theſe,
but purchaſed to life, as a reconciled people to God, to be as
the friends of God: <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the friend of God.
Though a man make no bones of breaking out againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
yet now being reconciled eſpecially to him in whom
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57074:95"/>
we live, or move, and have our being, it is for us to walke as
thoſe that are reconciled to God, as thoſe that are united to
Chriſt, as thoſe that are ſanctified by his Spirit, as thoſe that
have the grace of Chriſt applyed to our ſoules, <hi>as thoſe that are
dead to ſinne, and alive to righteouſneſſe;</hi> It is for us to walk as
thoſe that look for a purchaſed poſſeſſion to the glory of
Gods grace when this life ſhall be no more. If we be dead
with Chriſt, why are we not free from all that which is evil,
and free to all that is good? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. It is a ſtaine and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to the blood of Chriſt, to ſee a child of God live in any
durty corruption, to ſee a child of God a worldling, to yeild
to any temptation, it is a ſtaine to the blood of Chriſt: To
ſee a child of God ſet looſe from the Father, or the Sonne, or
the Spirit, it is a ſtaine to the blood of Chriſt; for the blood
of Chriſt is a purchaſe to redeem us from all evill, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
to us all good.</p>
               <p>For a fifth uſe,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 5.</note> it may teach us to apply effectually the
blood of Chriſt: as we for our parts in our Miniſtery, ſo
you in your meditations, and repititions; there is the ground
of your peace. No conſcience that hath been troubled with
ſence of ſinne, but there lies his grief, the wrath of God that
is upon his unbeleiving ſoule. He is condemned; <hi>the wrath
of God abideth on him.</hi> If you ranſack it to the bottom, there
is it that cruſheth the ſpirit: all other will be caſt off in caſe
we be clear in this principle, about the ſatisfaction of Gods
juſtice provoked againſt us by our many and great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
what ſhall ſatisfie the ſoule now? There is nothing
in the world ſo fit to beget faith, as the preaching of the croſs
of Chriſt: <hi>If I be lift up from the earth, I will draw all men unto
me, John</hi> 12. 32. If Chriſt be drawn up on the Croſſe, held
forth for his drawing of people that are troubled about the
wrath of God, and the removing thereof, and about ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to God about all our iniquities, this will draw ſoules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: For how will you uphold any man to bear his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the apprehenſion of Gods wrath with any tolerable
eaſe? No way but by holding forth Chriſt the innocent
Lamb of God, crucified upon the croſſe, and his blood ſpilt
as a price of ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice, as a price of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57074:96"/>
from all evill, and purchaſe of all good: then ſaith the
ſoule, me-thinks there is ſome hope, even for me; For who
ſhall hinder the power of the blood of Chriſt? and who ſhall
hinder the free paſſage of Gods grace? if the Lord Jeſus hath
undertaken it, and hold it forth eſpecially to men that are
ſick, and oppreſſed, and caſt downe, and ready to periſh for
want of ſuccour: In ſuch a caſe, while this is held forth,
there is the blood of Chriſt held forth, which was ſhed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the ſpirit of grace; as it is written in <hi>Gal. 3. 13, 14.
Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a
cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe for us, that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit.</hi> The ſame
blood of Chriſt, that hath redeemed us from the curſe, and
hath purchaſed the communion of the ſpirit, he is wont in
the preaching of the croſſe of Chriſt, to open Heaven to the
ſoule, to open the doors of the heart to beleive on this blood,
thus h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

ſome ſatisfaction to all turmoils, and agonies of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende.
It is a wonder to ſee how this blood of Chriſt is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
through God to make our peace, while the ſpirit doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
the efficacy thereof to the quieting, and eſtabliſhing the
ſoule, In fellowſhip with Chriſt, and reconcilement with the
Father; that the ſoule ſees, Chriſt hath not dyed in vaine,
that he hath not heard the word in vaine, nor waited upon
Chriſt in vaine, but ſees there is life, and peace, and all in the
blood of Chriſt. And therefore wonder not now that the
Apoſtles were ſo carefull in preaching the croſſe of Chriſt,
ther's the ground of all our reconciliation: That ſatisfies
the juſtice of God, and that ſatisfies the ſoule, the ſpirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it begets faith to receive it; and there is they ſtay of
the ſoul.</p>
               <p>So this is the principall duty, as for us to teach, ſo for
the people of God continually to attend unto, to ponder
upon this: eſpecially thoſe whoſe hearts are at a loſſe about
ſatisfaction of Gods wrath, and pardon of their ſinne; It is
that which in a ſpeciall manner they ſtand in need to attend
unto.</p>
               <p>For a ſixth uſe:<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 6.</note> If any man ſhall aske, how ſhall I know
that all this belongs to me? what it is for thee we cannot yet

tell, in caſe a man have had no impreſſion upon his ſoule
yet it may be to thee for ought thou canſt tell, becauſe all
the Elect are not yet called home, but are to be called:
Therefore it is not the thing, to ſay they have no hope in it,
becauſe they are not yet waſhed by it, for they may be before
they dye.</p>
               <p>But if for the preſent you would know whether you have
part in it or no: you ſee what the nature of it is, where the
blood of Chriſt comes, where it is ſprinkled, you ſee what it
doth; it hath a redeeming power in it, and a purchaſing
power: It doth redeem thee from all evill, from the power
of ſinne, and Satan, and of this world, and of thine owne
heart, and withall from the wrath of God, and the curſe of
the Law, ſo that the Conſcience is more pure and peaceable
then before, and both theſe go together.</p>
               <p>But mind what I ſay further, if this blood hath had this
free paſſage in thine heart, it hath purchaſed reconcilement
with the Father, union with the Sonne, communion with
the Spirit, conformity to Chriſt, and comforting thee in
Chriſt: Conforming thee to Chriſt in his death, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthing
thee in Chriſt and the fruits of his death, the favour
of God, and the pardon of ſinne, and the bleſſed priviledges
that his death hath purchaſed. I ſay this is the efficacy of the
blood of Chriſt where it is received in power: If theſe fruits
be in us, they are lively pledges of the love of God in our
hearts: If theſe things be ſmothered and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ubed, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with many Temptations, and worldly buſineſſes,
diſtracting cares, and temptations; though it is true, the
children of God may be at many loſſes, yet mark what I ſay,
the blood of Chriſt is a living Spring, and a running Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
though it may be troubled, yet it will runne cleare
againe; if it do not, it is a ſigne it was not from the blood
of Chriſt, but from a deluſion: But if it were from the
blood of Chriſt, thou ſhalt finde hee will purifie and pacifie
thy conſcience, for he will not looſe the value and efficacy
of that rich blood; great is the power of it, and he will not
looſe the vertue of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:57074:97"/>
I know there may be many pangs to Temptations, and
Chriſtians in this new world may meet with new Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Chriſtians are at a loſſe becauſe paſſions breake in,
we have loſt all our peace, and comfort of our union, and the
power of it; it may be ſo, it is not unuſuall; but (minde
what I ſay) truly if the blood of Chriſt have any efficacy in
us, or power upon us, you will find that the fountaine of
the blood of Chriſt is higher then any other fountain</p>
               <p>A fountaine that ſprings from a low place may be ſtopped,
but if it comes from a high place, higher then the higheſt, no
creature here below can hinder it, nor created thing below
it can intercept the flowing of it: The Lord will redeeme
thee from the world, and from theſe paſſions and luſts, and
from the Satanicall, and malignant diſtempers, and the
Lords blood will reſtore thee to reconcilement with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and bring thee to union with the Son, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Spirit, and the ſence of it. And therefore know,
if he have left thee to live in ſuch diſtempers, and thou doſt
bleſſe thy ſelfe in them, and canſt not looke further, and
there is nothing in the blood of Chriſt that much takes up
thy heart, for redemption from evill, or purchaſing good,
it is much to be feared thou haſt not yet taſted of the blood
of Chriſt: what there may be in heaven wee know not, but
no man on earth can give thee a comfortable ſigne of a good
eſtate.</p>
               <p>If a man bleſſe himſelfe in theſe engagements, and in theſe
imbondagements to the enemies of his ſoule, and thinks his
captivity is his liberty, hee doth not know what the Lord
Jeſus hath purchaſed, there is little hope ſuch a man hath
redemption from the blood of Chriſt. This is the condition
of all the people of God in the greateſt temptations, unleſſe
it be in ſome extreame hurry of paſſion, it is a captivity to
him, and a burden to him that he wants Chriſt Jeſus, and
that is a good ſigne of a mans liberty purchaſed by Chriſt:
This Chriſt who hath reconciled others to God, and done
great things for them in a way of grece, and hath alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
him to God, and delivered him from death to ſee
this captivity, and to groane under it, it is a ſigne this man
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57074:97"/>
hath had ſome other liberty in times paſt: For otherwiſe there
is no man naturally but he thinks this is his freedom to have
his owne minde not croſſed, to have his full liberty in the
world, to have good bargains, and not to be pinched in
this and that, and not for conſcience to fly in his face; it is a
ſign a man is yet a natural born captive. But when a man feels
his captivity, and looks at it as his burden, that he feeles not
the favour of God, and union with Chriſt, and communion
with the Spirit: It is a ſigne God hath called him to liberty,
but he hath ſold himſelf for a captive again; &amp; now he cryes
as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall
deliver me from this body of death:</hi> There he is carryed captive.
<hi>I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my
minde, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſinne which is
in my memebers,</hi> verſ. 23. Here is a ſign of redeeming love by the
blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>O the wofull captivity that naturall corruption is to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
ſoule, and the great liberty it is to a carnall heart,
that hee thinkes it a liberty to have his thoughts free, and
none to tell him: But to a good conſcience that hath been
waſhed and redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, the body of
death is a wofull bondage to him.</p>
               <p>This body of death it is not actuall tranſgreſſions, but a
powerfull body of carnall corruption that hangs about us;
that though we do not break out into actuall ſinnes as other
men do, yet we ſee a body of death in us, and this is our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.
So then, if the Lord hath redemed a ſoul, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
theſe comfortable bleſſings as brings us to the ſence of
our wofull condition by reaſon of the loſſe of this liberty,
all theſe are witneſſes of the redeeming love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 7.</note> it may be a uſe of conſolation to every ſuch ſoule
thus farre (even ſo farre as there is no bounds and limits to
it) it is a marvellous ſatisfaction to a ſoule in temptation,
nothing more then this I now ſpeak of. One would think
it were a great miſery to live in horrour of conſcience conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
and ſo it is: but if a man be redeemed by the blood
of this Lamb, then it is not terrour of conſcience that can

ſeparate thee from God; for Chriſt himſelfe was under ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of conſcience as much, and more then thou art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin, that he ſweat drops of blood, and cries out and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans
it in a holy manner. Why will you ſay, but will you
have me ſet ſuch things at my heele? the deſertions of God
at my heele? Is the favour of God to be ſet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will not hinder your union with your head, though you
have loſt the ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>All that Chriſt ſuffered, all his deſertions, it did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his fellowſhip with the ſecond perſon in Trinity, neither
will it hinder yours. The Serpent bruiſeth our heel, makes
us go heavily and lamely. <hi>Pſal. 43. 2. Thou art the God of my
ſtrength, why doſt thou caſt me off? why goe I mourning becauſe
of the oppreſſion of the enemy?</hi> It makes us go heavily while
God forſakes us, as a man goes that is cruſhed by an enemy,
but yet it will not break his head. And what great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this, it is not terrour of conſcience that can ſeparate
a man from Chriſt: Nay I may ſpeake a greater thing then
that, it is not the power of your corruptions that can break
your head, though they will make you go more lamely and
heavily, yet pride and paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not ſeparate union.
It muſt therefore raiſe up the heart of a Chriſtian above his
temptations, above corruptions, above the world, above
all the enemies of his ſoule, what can they all doe? If the
Lord be with us, who can be againſt us? <hi>He that delivered up
his owne ſonne to death for us, how ſhall he not with him freely give
us all things?</hi> Rom. 8. 31, 32. So that wee are freed from all
annoyance from the curſe of the Law, the rigour of the law,
free from deſertion and corruption, and the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

and Kingdome, and his Church and people, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and all is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. And how comes
all to be ours? By the blood of the Lamb that hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all good things, and the removall of all evill, therefore
how comfortable may the ſoules of Gods people be, if they
did attend to the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And therefore let not thoſe that have any part and portion
in the blood of Chriſt Jeſus be diſcouraged; let them in Gods

feare meditate more of this blood, and of the power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of it: As you deſire your lives may be more comfortable
and ſerviceable to God and man, and your death more

you be doubtfull of your ſpirituall eſtate, then more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
meditate of it, who hath ſuffered, and what, and for
what end he layd downe his life, and lay all together, and
ſee if all will not amount at length to the begetting of Faith
where it is wanting, and to the reviving of it where it is, that

               <p>HERE is ſomething yet to be handled in this Verſe,
and that is the antiquity of the ſufferings of Chriſt.
He doth not only ſay that Chriſt was a Lamb, and
ſlaughtered, but his death is deſcribed by the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of it, <hi>From the beginning of the world:</hi> Or as it is here
tranſlated (and very fitly) <hi>from the foundation of the world;</hi>
though I would not put any great weight in the very nick of
the foundation, for the foundation of the world was laid the
firſt day of the creation, when the Lord made the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the loweſt earth: the higheſt heaven, the kingdom
of the bleſſed Saints and Angels, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Come yee
bleſſed of my Father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the
beginning of the world:</hi> There was a kingdome in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, and therefore the Angels were created the
firſt day: and it is true Chriſt was ſlaine even then alſo, elſe
thoſe Angels had not been in that kingdome: But whether
you take it for the foundation in the creation, or in the nick
of the creation, it is not greatly material, for the death
of Chriſt reached both to the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
before it, and the explication of that will ſhew the truth
thereof, and I would not be exquiſite nor curious in opening
of it.</p>
               <p>The Note is this.</p>
               <p>The ſlaughter of Chriſt was from the foundation of the world.<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So it is ſaid here, <hi>The Lamb</hi> (that is Chriſt, <hi>The Lamb of
God) ſlaine from the foundation of the world:</hi> the Lamb is
Chriſt, evident it is that in fulneſſe of time he was ſlaughtered
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57074:99"/>
about 4000. years after the world was made, but yet the holy
Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>He was ſlaine from the foundation of the world;</hi> ſo
that though it was actually accompliſhed and performed in
fulneſſe of time, yet as time began, the ſuffering of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
alſo; ſlaine he was therefore <hi>from the foundation of the
world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of Gods eternall purpoſe, who from the
foundation of the world, and before the foundation of the
world appointed Chriſt to this ſlaughter. <hi>We are redeemed,</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Peter) not with ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Chriſt as of a Lamb without ſpot, who verily was fore-ordayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times,</hi>
&amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20. Before the foundation of the world,
and from the foundation of the world, many times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are both one in meaning; before the foundation of the
world he was ordained to be ſlaughtered, the Apoſtles words
are expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſly ſo, as of a lamb ſlaine he was ordained, and from
the foundation of the world implyes long before the time he
was ſlaughtered, and then you know not where to put the
period, but ſome reference it hath to the foundation of the
world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is truly ſaid to be ſlaughtered from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world, in regard of the promiſe of God made
to <hi>Adam</hi> ſince the world began; the ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> was
created he fell, or certainly ſoon after, but moſt probable
the ſame day: the ſame day that he fell, it is clear the Lord
gave him a promiſe of the death of Chriſt, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for
that is the meaning of the promiſe: <hi>He ſhall break thine head,</hi>
ſpeaking to the Serpent, he ſhall cruſh the head of the Serpent:
<hi>For the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head; Thou ſhalt
bruiſe his heel.</hi> Heel implyes the humanity of Chriſt, which
was to be tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n upon, and indeed it was all that the tempter
could doe, but that bruiſing the heel was the cruſhing of his
humanity, his ſoul and body was rent aſunder, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the foundation of the world,</hi> Chriſt was ſlaine
in the foreruning types of him; for it is ſaid, <hi>that Abel brought
of the firſtlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof,</hi> and that was a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57074:100"/>
type of this Lamb, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was a type
of Chriſt ſuffering: now becauſe offering that ſacrifice was
by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. And faith hath ground from the word
of God, though there was no written word, yet there was
from the mouth of God to <hi>Adam,</hi> that taught <hi>Adam,</hi> he and his
ſonnes to offer ſacrifice in type of Chriſt that was to be ſlain,
who ſhould break the head of the Serpent, and therefore as a
type of the bruiſing of the heel of the promiſed ſeed which
God had ſet before them, they were to offer ſacrifice, to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
forth that great worke of Chriſt: <hi>Abel</hi> beleived on
Chriſt, how far expreſly or diſtinctly I do not know; but
had he not beleived, he had not ſacrificed by faith, nor had
not been accepted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He was ſlaine from the foundation of the world,</hi> in
regard of the virtue and efficacy of his death: from thence,
the lively virtue and efficacy of the death of Chriſt did expreſs
it ſelfe from the very foundation of the world, that <hi>Abel did
offer a more acceptable ſacrifice then Cain,</hi> it was from his faith;
what was his faith faſtened on, by which his ſacrifice was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?
(for it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord had reſpect to him, and to his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)</hi>
it is Chriſt alone, it implyes he looked not for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by his ſacrifice; it is impoſſible that the blood of buls
ſhould take away ſinne, but he looked to be accepted in Chriſt
Jeſus: ſo <hi>Enoch</hi> is ſaid to have walked with God, <hi>Gen</hi> 5. 24.
and no man can walke with God except he be reconciled with
God, <hi>Amos</hi> 3 3. And is there any reconciliation but in the
blood of the Sonne of God? <hi>We are reconciled to God by the
death of his Sonne,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>by
faith he left his country and his fathers houſe, and his kindred, and
went out, not knowing whether he went, Heb. 11. 8. Gen.</hi> 12. 1.
How comes <hi>Abraham</hi> to be redeemed and reſcued from the
blood of his Anceſtors and from his fathers houſe? <hi>We are
redeemed from our vaine converſation received by tradition from our
fathers, not with ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt,
as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19.
Which argues plainly and evidently that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, if
he had not been waſhed in the blood of this Lamb, he could
not have been ſaved from hankering after the blood of his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57074:100"/>
Anceſtors; if the blood of Anceſtors had been more warme
in him then the blood of Chriſt, he would not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from his fathers houſe: but now in his old age he
leaves his country and goes to ſeek that ſeed in whom they
all ſhould be bleſſed in that country. It is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6.
That <hi>he beleived in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe:
and all juſtiffication is by faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in
the blood of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25. <hi>We all have ſinned,
and are deprived of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his grace
through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> For all the
ſinnes that have paſſed us from the beginning of the world,
the Lord received atonement for them in the blood of his
ſonne: and our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> if he were juſtified, <hi>it was by
faith in the ſonne of God.</hi> How came it to paſſe that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was
able to overcome the ſtrong and ſubtile temptations of his
Miſtreſſe, in <hi>Gen. 39. 9. How ſhall I do this great wickedneſſe,
and ſinne againſt God?</hi> Can he mortifie a luſt by any power of
his own? No, let the Apoſtle anſwer it, in <hi>Gal. 5. 29. They
that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the paſſions and luſts;</hi>
for ſo it is, it is not affections, but all the ſinful paſſions that
hang about the ſoules of men, the Lord frees us from them
all by the blood of his Sonne: So that if you ſee <hi>Joſeph</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to his luſt, and <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from his fathers houſe
and juſtified; if you ſee <hi>Abel</hi> offering a more acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
then <hi>Cain:</hi> Look at all theſe as lively fruits of the blood
of the Lamb ſlaine from the beginning of the world, whence
alſo ſprings their faith? heavenly mindedneſſe, their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?
their power of godlineſſe was as great (and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things greater) as in thoſe that have lived ſince his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
on the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Now if it had not been as effectuall and reall before his
coming, as when he did come, doubtleſſe the efficacy of his
death would have been leſſe powerfull and more weak in
them that lived before his coming; but when you ſee ſuch
livelineſſe ſpring from the virtue and power of it, then you
ſee the efficacy of it from the foundation of the world, onely
the manifeſtation of it was not ſo clear as afterwards, whence
it comes to paſſe that the generality of Chriſtians now are,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57074:101"/>
or ought to be, more cleare and more pure then the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Chriſtians then; but in ſome men, you have had them
that exceeded thoſe that lived in Chriſts owne time, and
ſince.</p>
               <p>5. There is a fifth reſpect in which Chriſt is ſaid to be
ſlaine from the beginning of the world, and that is in
reſpect of the faith of Gods elect who lived from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world: As ſoon as there was a man on the earth,
the ſame day the Lord put emnity between the ſeed of the
woman and the Serpent; now the ſeed of the woman looks
for ſalvation in the ſeed of the woman, and they did even
then look to the Lord Jeſus the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as much as we do ſince
in <hi>John 8. 56. Your father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, he
ſaw it and was glad:</hi> that was the day of the coming of Chriſt
into the world to be an attonement for the ſinnes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
If <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw it, then <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi>
and <hi>Eve;</hi> and who ever lived by Jeſus Chriſt, they all ſaw
Chriſt afar off, yet they ſaw him notwithſtanding, they ſaw
his day, the day of his Incarnation, and Paſſion, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
and it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. That <hi>faith is the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeene;</hi> that
is, it did give the Fathers before Chriſt, as clearly to ſee Chriſt
already preſent to them, as if he had been actually come in
the fleſh, and ſo it is with all the Saints at this day; look as
we do, as really believe the Reſurrection of the body, that by
faith gives it ſubſtance as verily as if it were preſent, and as
we believe the ſalvation of our ſoules, as verily as if it were
accompliſhed; and it is as clear, I meane, as certaine as if it
were already done, and in ſome meaſure as evident; for ſo he
ſaith, <hi>It is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> he ſpeaks in the Apoſtle
words, <hi>The confidence and evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Hence it
comes, <hi>That the fathers ſaw the promiſes &amp; embraced them, but did
not receive them,</hi> Heb. 11. 39. That is, did not receive them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
(for they never ſaw Chriſt in his death) but
they were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and did
verily look for them in expectation, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with them; that is, if Chriſt had been come, they would
not have done nor ſuffered more then they did; which argues
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57074:101"/>
that faith gives a baſis and ſubſiſtence to what it layes hold
on; and makes it ſo reall, that we ſhall neither do more, nor
ſuffer more, if it were preſent; They did believe that the time
would come, when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being bruiſed himſelfe, he
would break the Serpents head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are the ſeverall reſpects in which Chriſt is ſaid to be
the Lamb ſlaine from the foundation of the world;</hi> In regard
of the purpoſe of God, in regard of his promiſe, in regard of the
types of him, in the Sacrifices that were ſhadowes of Chriſt, and
did really hold him forth; in regard of the vertue of it, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the faith of Gods people that lived from the beginning of the
world; in regard of all theſe Chriſt was ſlaine from the beginning of
the world,</p>
               <p>For the Reaſons of the point;</p>
               <p>All the ways and reſpects I have ſpoken to,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> are as ſo many
Reaſons; yet if a man ſhould ſtand upon a Reaſon, I would
firſt ſay this; the firſt may be from the eternity of that which
is infinite; what ever is infinite, is eternall: Now the value
and vertue of the death of Chriſt is infinite, as <hi>being the blood
of the ſonne of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28. Now that which is infinite,
as well reacheth that which is before, as after it; infinite it is,
or elſe it cannot be eternall: and infinite it had need to be,
or elſe the infinite wrath of God could not be ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
but being infinite, it was of eternall efficacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was a Lamb ſlain, and <hi>ſlaine from the foundation of the
world:</hi> So that all that are elect were in Chriſt before the
foundation of the world. <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. Hee hath choſen us in
Chriſt before the foundation of the world;</hi> in Chriſt, and in Chriſt
crucified before the foundation of the world; for being of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
value, it muſt of neceſſity be eternall; there is nothing
infinite, but is eternall, they are co-incident; that which is
finite will end, it began in time, and will end in time: But
that which is infinite muſt needs have reſpect to eternity;
and therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John 8. 38. Before Abraham
was I am:</hi> So that take him whether as God, or in point of
the vertue and efficacy of his mediation, he was before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
it could not be eternall, if it be not infinite; and if it be
infinite, it muſt needs be eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:57074:102"/>
From the preſence of all future things to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> I ſpeak
in proper ſpeech, it is truly ſaid, there is nothing future to
Chriſt: I confeſſe the point is unconceivable to finite capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but to God all things to come are preſent, as if they
were in actuall being: <hi>All things are naked and open unto the
eyes of him with whom we have to doe,</hi> Heb. 4. 13. It is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſpeech, Eternity is like a circumference about a Center
that compaſſeth it round about, that if you fit on the Center,
you ſee all the lines: Suppoſe a great tower as high as the
clouds, and one ſitting thereupon, he ſees one man coming
this way, and another another way, he ſees they will meet
in one place; they know nothing of it, it is future to them,
but preſent to him: So the Lord that ſits upon the clouds of
eternity (if I may uſe ſuch a word) he ſees all things as if
they were preſent to him: and certaine it is, God is not one
day older then he was from the beginning; the Angels are
older, and Satan, but God is not older, nor is capable of
being older; time addes nothing to him, his eternity ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
up all; that which hath been, is, and ſhall be, it is freſh
ſtill to him; that which is paſt, and that which is to come,
whence it is ſaid, <hi>Before Abraham was I am,</hi> he doth not ſay I
was; but his paſt time is not loſt to him, no time is paſt with
God; <hi>Before Abraham was I am: a thouſand yeares are but as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday;</hi>
when it is paſt, all are one time to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 4.
So then, if you look at Gods account of things that hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into ſuch a Covenant from eternity, hath written ſo
many in the book of life to be brought on to God by the
death, and reſurrection, and aſcention of Chriſt, he knew the
perſon of the God-head would certainly take the humane
nature of Chriſt; it was preſent to him, and therefore hee
doth ſo elect, and govern, and diſpoſe of creatures as he that
had received a ranſome before the world began: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Elihu</hi> his ſpeech is weighty, in <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23. That <hi>if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
one of a thouſand come to a ſicke man, and ſhew to a man
his righteouſneſſe, and that then God is gracious to him,</hi> and ſaith,
<hi>deliver him, for I have found a ranſome</hi> (to wit, in the blood of
the Lamb) then will he ſay, <hi>deliver him:</hi> What, had he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a ranſome in <hi>Jobs</hi> time? <hi>Job</hi> lived before <hi>Abraham?</hi> truly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57074:102"/>
then he hath a ranſome, as a man hath a bond from a good
ſurety: but ſo it was in his apprehenſion, not only becauſe
Chriſt was a good ſurety, and would make good payment
in time, but the thing was as preſent with God, and really
performed; All times with God are but as now, paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and to come; all times with God are one and the ſame,
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and for ever;</hi> Yeſterday before
the Law, and to day, both under the Law, and eſpecially
under the Goſpel, and for ever the ſame, of the ſame vertue
and efficacy, and power: So you ſee the truth of the Point.</p>
               <p>The uſe is ſhortly thus much.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> it ſhews you the dangerous and damnable eſtate of
the world from the foundation of the world; the deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
and corruption of the world from the foundation
of it; it is ſaid by <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 5. 19. <hi>We know we are of God,
and all the world lyes in wickedneſſe:</hi> Did it lye ſo in <hi>Johns</hi> time,
when all the great Nations of the world worſhipped the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<hi>Apollo, Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſuch dunghill gods?
Did it not then lye in wickedneſſe? Truly it was ſo ſince the
world began, it was never better from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſts time, and from Chriſts time to this,
the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe; for otherwiſe to what
end ſhould Chriſt be ſlain from the foundation of the world,
if there were no need of a Redeemer, elſe there had been no
need of his ſacrificing from the foundation of the world
There were all errors in the world, not as God made it, but
they ſuddenly corrupted themſelves. <hi>Man being in honour
abideth not, but is like the beaſt that periſheth,</hi> Pſal. 49. 20.
The word in the Original is, <hi>he ſhall not ſleep in it, nor lodg in it,</hi>
meaning that hee ſhall not take one nights reſt, but become
like a beaſt, and clad with the skin of a beaſt: So this is the
condition of civill men that are like bruit beaſts from the
foundation of the world: <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven,
and beheld the children of men:</hi> And the Apoſtle interprets it of
all men; <hi>He looked downe and beheld all the children of men, to ſee
if there were any that did underſtand and ſeeke God: They are all
gone aſide, they are all become filthy, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 14. 2, 3, 4, 5.
This is the caſe of all men by nature. The Apoſtle expounds
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57074:103"/>
it of all, <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> by nature, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 10. to 16.
And in <hi>Gen. 6. 5. The Lord looked upon the earth, and beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was corrupt.</hi> And in <hi>Gen. 11. v. 12. The earth alſo was corrupt
before God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And God ſaw that all the imaginations of mans
heart were evill, onely evill, and that continually.</hi> The word
tranſlated, <hi>Imaginations,</hi> in the Originall is, <hi>The frame and
bent of his thoughts is evill, and onely evill, and that continually;</hi>
bent to back-ſliding from God, not a good thought in any
mans heart ſince the world began; take him as hee is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not a good thought riſeth in any mans heart, not a
good word from his lips, nor a good action from his hands;
Take him without the vertue of Chriſt ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
there never roſe a good thought in all mens hearts; if
there did, it was by the vertue of this Lamb of God that was
ſlaine from the foundation of the world. <hi>The heart of man,
(Jeremiah</hi> complained long before Chriſts time) <hi>is deceitfull
above meaſure, and deſperately wicked, who can know it,</hi> Jer. 17.
9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Who can know the bottomleſſe depth of it.</hi> This is the very
ſtate of all the world ſince the world began; the whole frame
and ſtate of the world is enmity againſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. It is
not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, and
that in ſuch a deep meaſure, you may ſee by the medicine that
the Lord prepares for it; it ſhews the depth of the depravation
of the world from the beginning, it hath been corrupt and
incurable, unleſſe it were by the vertue of the death of Chriſt,
by the ſonne of God made man, taking upon him mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and the greatneſſe and infiniteneſſe of the vertue of this
remedie doth evidently argue the bottomleſſe depth of the
corruption of the world ſince the world began: No man
would beſpeak a Smiths great hammer to break an egg-ſhell,
a man would think it a marvellous vanity if he ſhould. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lord hath prepared the ſtrongeſt iron hammer to break
the Serpents head; and which is wonderfull, this iron ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the Lord Jeſus, that breaks all before it; The ſtone cut
out of the mountaine, that breaks the iron mountaine of
<hi>Rome,</hi> Dan. 2. 34. It is the ſame it was: it makes men many
times wonder how they came to be well conceited of the old
Religion, when Antichriſt re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gned; then were golden dayes
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57074:103"/>
(as they ſay) then there was nothing, but every man regarded
other mens good as their own; precious golden ſeaſons in
the old world, then an eaſie matter would have perſwaded
them all: but to what end was Chriſt ſlain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, if it were not full of wickedneſſe? if it
were not ſo tough that this hammer of hammers muſt come
to break it in pieces? If men were ſo tractable, children to
Parents, ſervants to Maſters, and yoke-fellows ſo abundantly
in ſweetneſſe and amiableneſſe, what needed Chriſt to be
cruſhed in pieces? <hi>Say not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 10. <hi>what
is the cauſe that the former dayes were better then theſe, for thou
doſt not enquire wiſely concerning this:</hi> It is not a wiſe queſtion;
for the truth is, thou art deceived to think the elder times
were better; it is true, it is poſſible men by the policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
may grow worſe; But take them at the beſt, had there
not been a Lamb ſlain to reſcue the ſame from the corruption
of it, no fleſh had been ſaved. It is true, in ſome ages, when
the Goſpel found free paſſage, there was ſome difference. It
was ſo in <hi>Davids</hi> time, better then in <hi>Sauls</hi> and <hi>Solomons,</hi> for
a time better then in <hi>Davids;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> time, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then in <hi>Zedekiah's,</hi> and ſo it hath been up and down: but
take it the beſt, all fleſh have corrupted their wayes, there is
not a good thought, not a good word, nor a good practice
ſince the world began. Sometimes in morall vertues men
have more exceeded, when the Devill knew they were farre
off from ſpiritual grace; he tempted them not when he knew
he had them faſt in a golden and ſilken chaine, or cord of
morall vertues (ſo I may call them) he led the priſoners
of thoſe dayes in a golden chaine. The ſtrong man armed
kept the houſe all the time of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
long before Chriſt: and if any were delivered, it was by
the death of Chriſt as well as now. It is true, we read in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Poets, I think it was fetched out of <hi>Daniel</hi> from <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>
dreame; there was a golden world, and then a
ſilver world, and then a braſſe, and ſometimes iron, there
was all. The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch was gold: but when it
was gold, it was but golden fetters of ſinne, and a land of
wickedneſſe that held men cloſe to the Devill; and the ſilver
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57074:104"/>
Monarch of <hi>Perſia</hi> was but ſilver fetters; and the braſſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of <hi>Greece</hi> it was but brazen fetters.</p>
               <p>It is true, when Religion brake forth, then hee put upon
them more chaines, ſtrong beaſtly luſts, <hi>men with men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
filthineſſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. Theſe were iron chains to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
men captive to Satan: He ſees Learning break forth, and
therefore he layes ſtronger chains and bands upon them: <hi>Be
no more ſtiffe-necked, leſt your bands encreaſe, ſaith the Lord:</hi> and
ſo from golden bands you have ſilver, and from ſilver, braſſe,
and from braſſe, iron, and all to lead you captive to your
laſt execution: And what is the difference? if a man be py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion'd
with a golden cord, or a ſilver, or a brazen and iron
cord, the one is more glittering then the other, but all
bring to deſtruction: Therefore look at all the world living
in wickedneſſe ſince the world began, or elſe in vain was
the Lamb ſlain: The very frame of mans tranſgreſſion brought
in a neceſſity of a like remedy, and therefore a like need of the
blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And it is a vain Queſtion, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, why the former
times ſhould be better then theſe: ſo it is a vain apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that men have of themſelves as good, to ſay, I thank God
I have a good heart, and you ſhall finde me tractable, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
(though they be but naturall) and ſo their children
are very tractable, you may lead them with a twinde theerd,
and need not uſe violence, you may ſoon break them; what
then are you but eggſhels? what need then a iron hammer to
cruſh all the power of the enemy? do not you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſtand in need of the virtue of the blood of the Lamb as
much as others have ſince the world began? That men have
ſtood in need of the blood of the Lamb from the foundation
of the world to reſcue them from the power of the ſtrong man,
if they were ſo tractable, young or old? I know there is a
great difference between ſpirits. God forbid we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
the work of God in nature, but take the beſt ſpirit, there
is unconceivable enmity in the beſt natur'd man againſt Chriſt;
there is an in-bred emnity againſt him ever ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
as is impoſſible to be healed, but by the blood of Chriſt;
Chriſt came to cruſh them whiles they are in the ſhell, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57074:104"/>
unleſſe he heal them, verily children of a ſpan long cannot
be ſaved: Therefore let no man flatter themſelves in their
good inclination; there is that in us ſince the world began,
that Chriſt muſt be broken and cruſhed to break the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and the Devill: Chriſt himſelfe in his ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
muſt be ſtriken, he kils himſelfe by the ſtroke he gives to
the enemy.</p>
               <p>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goodneſſe of nature, or what ever elſe you can talke of, that
will root it out; nor the rod of correction, unleſſe the blood
of the Lamb be ſprinkled upon it, and then it may be of great
uſe, and any other ordinance to bring them to the wayes of
Chriſt Jeſus. Now if this were well ſtamped and revetted
into the ſpirits of men, it would humble proud fleſh, and not
onely take them off from the free will of Popery, and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme,
and a pack of ſuch; but I hope there is leſſe need of
ſpeaking againſt ſuch hereſies, but to ſet it home upon our
own hearts; whatever our fathers have been, we their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are not better: Some accidentall difference there may
be, but ſetting aſide ſuch accidentall differences for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of prevailing corruptions, they have ruled and reigned
in the hearts of men, ſince the world began, by invincible
power unable to be ſubdued, but onely by the blood of the
Lamb: And therefore you that are children of godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
hear this word and know it; you bring ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into the world with you to the ſtrong man, and now
are ſo engaged, that unleſſe Chriſt be broken for you, and his

how it is with younger and elder people, and let all Parents
tell it to their children, and Maſters to their ſervants, and all
that have to do with the world; be not deluded with a good
affection to your own nature you are in, this is the ſtate of all
ſince the world began; they are all ſprauling in wickedneſſe,

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57074:105"/>
which had plotted our deſtruction from the foundation of
the world, then certainly it is not poſſible we ſhould live in
thoſe ſinnes by which we have ſlaughtered Chriſt; can any
man that knows the difference between the right hand and
left, commit ſinne that ſlaughters Chriſt Jeſus, and live and
die in it well enough? and think with himſelfe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

it is no ſuch great matter: I tell thee, if it be breach of the

not, it coſt his breaking.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak nothing to the difference between mortall and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
ſins; was it a veniall ſin, think ye, that ſlaughtered
the Son of God? they have been breaking him ſince the
world began; and is it poſſible that if he lye a bleeding for ſin,
is it poſſible that this or that ſinne ſhould be veniall and ought
to be paſſed over? be not deceived, look what ſlaughter it
hath brought of the chiefeſt of the world, even the God of
the world, it ſlaughtered him; and there are none of all his
people that ſhall be ſaved by him, but muſt be ſlaughtered in
his luſts and paſſions, they muſt be crucified with Chriſt, if they
have any part in him; he was ſlaine from the beginning, and
ſo from firſt to laſt, they muſt be crucified from the power of
ſinne, or elſe they cannot be ſaved. And therefore let no
man bleſſe himſelf, and think he ſhall do well enough though
he continue in ſin; for the truth is, there is no ſin but coſt
Chriſts breaking and cruſhing, and either thou muſt lay hold
on his death, and be conformable unto him, or elſe thou ſhalt
never have part in him; it is tough work to ſlaughter ſin; let
this ſlaughter of Chriſt cut off all out-runnings of ſinne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thoughts, words, and deeds; let it be as a ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to be ſaved by grace, and by the blood of the Lord Jeſus,
as we doe in doing and ſuffering all for them, and we know

him our head and husband; there is the old way of ſalvation,
and it is the ſame now; there is unity and true antiquity.
The Papiſts ſpeak much of antiquities, but let them bring no
other way of ſalvation but the blood of the Lamb, and we
will look at them as Churches for point of ſalvation; we
will grant them the right hand of fellowſhip if they will look
for no ſalvation neither from free will, nor from merits of
their own, nor from the interceſſion of Saints and Angells,
nor from diſpenſations of the Pope, nor from the going on
pilgrimage, nor from the ſatisfaction of Saints, but that they
look for ſalvation onely from the blood of the Lamb; truly
we will give them the right hand of fellowſhip; let them
have errours, there may be many errours otherwiſe: but let
them hold there, and look for all ſalvation there, and reſt not
upon any other hopes of ſalvation, but what they receive
from the blood of the Lamb by faith in him (for ſo alone it
is received) faith in the blood of the Lamb, breeds and ſheds
abroad every grace in ſome meaſure and makes fruitfull. <hi>No
man hath waſhed his roabs in the blood of the Lamb, but is fit to walk
with Chriſt in white to juſtification to his ſanctification, Rev.</hi> 7. 14.
And ſo you ſhall have a true and perfect agreement in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if that we agreed upon looking there for ſalvation, and
put not ſalvation elſe-where: but when men magnifie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and pinch upon, and extenuate the blood of Chriſt, and
in their deep devotion you ſhall have pictured, here is the
blood of Chriſt, and the blood of the ſonne of the Virgin;
when he looks upon the ſonne of the Virgin, he thinks there
is perfect ſalvation; but when he looks upon other things, to
the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57074:106"/>
doth their blaſphemous devotion hang between the milk of
the mother, and the blood of the Lamb, which argues their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is tranſported to a notion of the blood of the Lamb,
and they are captive hither and thither, and any whether, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </p>
               <p>Though we lived before Chriſts time, and much more, if
after it: there is no ſinne that <hi>Adam</hi> nor his wife committed,
but there was a remedy prepared for it before the foundation
of the world; it was of infinite value, it was provided from
eternity, and promiſed from the foundation of the world;
it was ſhadowed in types, and exhibited in ſundry repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and in the lively efficacy of it in the hearts and lives
of his people ſince the world began: All that we read of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> of Kings,
Prieſts, and Prophets, and Apoſtles, what have they all been,
but lively repreſentations and foot-ſteps of the power of the
blood of the Lamb: the Lord provided his ſlaughter of the
Lamb, for the redemption of all his people, out of the world,
before the world began.</p>
               <p>It is many a conceit that Chriſtians have; this and that
might have fallen out better, if ſuch means had been taken in
time, ſuch a mans life had been ſaved; according as <hi>Martha</hi>
ſaid unto our bleſſed Saviour in <hi>John 11. 21. Lord if thou hadſt
been here, my brother had not dyed;</hi> why ſo? Chriſt had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to heal him; By what virtue ſhall he raiſe a man from
death to life? Is it not by the virtue of his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
If it be, was not his death and reſurrection before
the world began? For it is of infinite value; and therefore
though he came four dayes after <hi>Lazarus</hi> death was paſt, yet
he came timely enough, for he brought virtue with him; and
ſo let no man ſay, if I had known as much now as before, I
ſhould not have done thus: By what virtue ſhould you have
been preſerved? if there be any ſaving benefit, it muſt be by
the blood of the Lamb, for it is from that, that we look for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57074:106"/>
all our redemption from all afflictions and temptations from
his blood, then there was remedy enough before, but it was
not applyed, becauſe God hath ſome other work more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

too late: If we thinke if we had not known many things, we
might have ſaved a world of ſorrow: why did we not? was
it becauſe there was no balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> or no vettue in the
blood of the Lamb, or that the vertue of it is dryed up? No,
God forbid; but the Lord hath ſome other exerciſe for us to
make us conformable to Chriſt, he would have us more
weaned from the world, and more Chriſt-like, and more
Lamb-like; more ſpirituall, and every way more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

came not to ſave us from croſſes, but from curſes from any
thing that might hurt our ſoules, as might break our heads,
as might hurt our union with Chriſt, and communion with
his ſpirit, for that it may be of value; it was of value 4000.

not of value 4000. yeares after? it is not yet 2000. yeares

that the blood of Chriſt is ſtill lively and freſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all ſinne and croſſes, and to leave a gracious Tincture
on all croſſes, to do us more good then if we were without

the univerſality of the worſhippers of the Beaſt, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſtruction of thoſe that do worſhip him, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the elect children of God from that contagion.</p>
               <p>It is meet to be heard that ſuch a Beaſt would come into

him the reſemblance of all the old Empires, of the Lyon of

of other Beaſts, and of that other Beaſt the old Roman Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

that ſhould be given gim by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> and the

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57074:108"/>
which the holy Ghoſt makes (in the former verſes) of the
deſcription of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a word of attention, and due conſideration to
every intelligent reader of this Prophecy: <hi>If any man have an
eare, let him heare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a word of conſolation to all the Church and
people of God, and that is double.</p>
               <p>1. From the violent deſtruction of this great Beaſt, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſtruction.</p>
               <p>1. Captivity.</p>
               <p>2. Slaughter; and both amplified by the equity of both,
the Lord rendering the like vengeance unto this Beaſt, which
hath rendered unto the Saints: <hi>Hee that leadeth into captivity
ſhall goe into captivity.</hi> And againe, <hi>Hee that killeth with the
ſword</hi> (as this Beaſt had done by his Warr, ſome millions of
Saints) <hi>muſt be killed with the ſword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Conſolation is a word of acknowledgment of
the Patience, and Faith of the Saints that have, or ſhall ſuffer
from this Beaſt: <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints;</hi>
not only of the Saints acknowledged as Sufferers in the time
of the Pagan, Roman Empire, but even ſuch as ſuffer under
his Holineſſe (as they call it) and that ſuffer under this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

for witneſſe bearing, againſt the Hereſies, Idolatries,
and Tyrannies of that State. The Lord doth acknowledge
their Sufferings to be the patience and faith of the Saints: As
he did acknowledg it when the Saints were put to death in
the tenne Perſecutions, ſo likewiſe doth he acknowledge
theſe. And this is ſome part of the meaning of the words:
That which more concerneth it may be further opened in

               </p>
               <p>This is the ſumme and true meaning of the words: Theſe
two points were the ſum of the former verſes which the holy
Ghoſt had delivered with much evidence and ſtrength; and
yet leſt it ſhould be ſlighted over by ſome careleſſe Readers,
he doth therefore ſet it on as he is wont to do the weightieſt

heare:</hi> If he have the eare of a Chriſtian, that diſcernes the
voyce of Chriſt the Shepheard of his ſoule, let him heare it,
and mind it well, worthy it is therefore of due and deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and he doth never uſe the phraſe but in matters of
ſingular importance; and it doth imply, <hi>That every man hath
not an eare to heare,</hi> but only thoſe to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
eares. What ſhall they heare? They ſhall heare this,
<hi>That none of all the devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Catholicks have their names written in
the Lambs booke of life,</hi> but their devout worſhip in the end
will leave them in no better eſtate then a reprobate ſtate. If
they go no further then their Religion, it leads them to the
worſhip of this Catholick Church, but never leads them
further then a reprobate condition: But for ſuch, <hi>whoſe
names are written in the Lambs booke,</hi> hee excepts them from
this generality of worſhip, they are not of this number: It
doth expreſly hold forth, <hi>That a ſincere hearted Chriſtian, an
elect Chriſtian brought home to God, and brought to fellowſhip with
Chriſt, and the fruits of his Election are expreſſed in his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Sanctification, he cannot live and dye a Roman Catholick.</hi>
He may for a time worſhip the Beaſt in his ignorance, and
do as the reſt of the world do, and ſhew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
himſelfe and the reſt of the world: but when this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
love of God doth ſhed it ſelfe abroad into his heart, it
doth make him ſee the counſell of God more; and it doth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57074:109"/>
diſcover the deloſions of the man of Sinne, that he cannot,
nor dare not worſhip him: He ſeeth that God requires more
to Salvation, then the ſubjection unto the injunctions of this
Beaſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this is the point which the Holy Ghoſt
tells you as of ſo great, and neceſſary, and due attention
and cenſideration, which none but underſtanding eares can
or will underſtand, but all the world will run admiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord did foreſee that Doctrine would be thought a
harſh, and peremptory, and ſenſorious ſentence, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men, and they ſometimes but an handfull too, ſhould
dare to bid defiance to the whole Catholick Church to looke
at them as Reprobates: and to look at thoſe whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
for Hereticks, as the elect ſervants of God.</p>
               <p>This the Holy Ghoſt did ſee would be accounted great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,

               <p>It might be of ſingular uſe in ſome places, nor here of ſo

               </p>
               <p>Let me name you ſome popular reaſons: I will not make
any ſubtile diſcourſe of it, though it would require ſtrong
Judgement, and ſinewes of Reaſon: but take popular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and yet ſuch as will bear ſome waite.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from their want of Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> in whom all
our life and ſalvation is laid up. <hi>He that hath not the Sonne,
hath not life;</hi> it is a plaine and peremptory principle of the
Goſpell, 1 <hi>John 5. 12. No Chriſt, no ſalvation. There is no other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,
Acts</hi> 4. 12. Now this Roman Catholick Church, and they
that worſhip the ſame, they have not Chriſt: How proove
you that? For Chriſt is not had, nor received, but by faith
in the Goſpell, in a free promiſe of Grace unto the ſoule. <hi>As
many as received him, to them gave he power, to become the ſonnes of
God, even to them that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dwels in our hearts by Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. The faith therefore
by which we receive Chriſt whether have they that faith or
no, let themſelves be Judge? They do profeſſe that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith is no more but a perſwaſion of the truth of all
the doctrines of the Goſpell, and of the whole word of God:
but for a particular application of Chriſt unto the ſoule, they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57074:110"/>
do not acknowledge it as that which is the means of receiving
of Chriſt. So that the Faith which they do in this caſe hold
forth, is in very truth no other, but that which <hi>James</hi> ſaith of
the faith of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vils; they have received as much. <hi>James 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.
Thou beleiveſt that there is one God, thou doeſt wed, the Devils alſo
beleive and tremble.</hi> A Roman Catholick beleives the whole
doctrine of the world; He does well; the Devils know as
much, and beleive as much as they do, yet no man will ſay
that the Devils faith receives Chriſt. Now where there is no
Chriſt, there is no ſalvation. Where there is no Faith, there
is no Chriſt: And where there is no Faith but that which
the Devils may reach unto, there is no true Faith at all.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſſe to run into all the objections that they
make: but let any that know Faith aright, judge whether
the Faith of theirs is ſuch a Faith whereby a man can receive
the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> Without Grace there is no ſalvation. For ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of

ſay that they are ſaved by workes, and they ſay ſo, if we take
workes in the worſt tenour of workes, that is by the meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
works: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Not of works, leaſt any man ſhould
boaſt,</hi> and ſay, <hi>that he hath wrought his own ſalvation,:</hi> And the
Apoſtle tels you, <hi>If it be of works, it is not of Grace, Rom.</hi> 11. 6.
For works cannot be joyned with grace in the merit of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
they are onely the way of ſalvation. And in that ſence
it is ſaid, <hi>Worke out your ſalvation with fear and trembling: For
it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure,
Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. But if a man look for ſalvation out of the
merit of works, he hath it not from grace. Papiſts reply,
they have it from works and grace alſo; for they have it
not from works of nature, but from works of grace, and they
are not oppoſite, but ſubordinate. But what ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle?
He ſaith, <hi>workes and grace are not ſubordinate, but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
one to another: and if it be of grace, it is not of workes: and
if of workes, then not of grace.</hi> And the Apoſtle tels you, <hi>Gal. 5.
4. If ye be juſtified by the workes of the Law, you are fallen from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57074:110"/>
grace:</hi> you have no part nor portion of the grace of Chriſt:
And therefore they are fallen from grace; and if from Grace,
then from ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Theſe are principles of Religion; and he that hath any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to hear what the holy Ghoſt ſaith in this caſe,
may eaſily perceive the truth of what we ſpeak. In very
truth you will finde that all which they hold, is but in a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Covenant of works. Their election they hold is
from works and faith foreſeen: Some of them indeed are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it, as the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> but the moſt prevailing are
thoſe that think Gods electing love, is but out of faith and
works foreſeen. They look as the grace of effectuall calling
to be founded upon the good inclination of a mans will, and
co-operation of it with the grace of Gods calling. They
profeſſe that <hi>Simon Peter</hi> had no more grace given him then
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> to become a chriſtian. And what cut the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
between the one, and the other? <hi>Peter</hi> had received ſo
much grace, that if he would, he might be ſaved; and ſo they
ſay, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did receive the ſame, but God did not bow
&amp; change his will, or reaſon, but left them both ſo far ſuffered,
as they might beleive if they would. How comes it then, that
<hi>Simon Peter</hi> did beleive, and was ſaved? and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did
not beleive (with a lively faith) and was damned? They
will confeſſe it really (the body of them) that it did ſpring
from <hi>Peters</hi> will; he did out of the freeneſſe of his will chooſe
it. This is vocation from the working of a mans will:
whereas the Covenant of Grace doth confeſſe, that it is not of
our will, but of the Lords, that takes away our ſtrong heart,
and gives us a ſoft heart before any preparation.</p>
               <p>Juſtification they look for none, but by works: nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
in a ſtate of grace but by their works: and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
ſalvation, from the merit of their works: And this is
the very doctrine of a Covenant of works. And this is all
the doctrine of the <hi>Arminians:</hi> onely they do acknowledge
juſtification by faith, and differ in point of Faith, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of works.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon may be this:<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> The worſhip of creatures is
a going a whoring from God, and ſo of deſtruction unto ſuch

of it. They place their ſalvation in beleiving as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

to the Catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are more ſolicitous of
it, then of reconcilement unto God by Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18, 19.
You read of ſome there that do not hold the head, but lay
hold upon Angels, and that is Idolatry: now that is ſpoken
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For a fourth reaſon of the point.</p>
               <p>Without unfeigned repentance and lively faith there is no
hope of ſalvation,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. Except ye repent ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
periſh. And without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi>
11. 6. Now the repentance which the Roman Catholick
Church holds forth, what is it but ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> did performe?
They require contrition: <hi>Judas</hi> he was deeply wounded and
broken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3. And they require confeſſion: He came
unto them before whom he had done evill, and ſaid, <hi>I have
ſinned in betraying innocent blood.</hi> And they require ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
He came and brought the mony, and threw it into
the Temple, and would by no means meddle with it. Here is
the repentance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all (for ought I
know) that they require. I finde no rule of repentance in
this Catholick Catechiſe, but I finde it in <hi>Judas,</hi> which will
end in deſpaire (which is the common end of an hypocritical
repentance) as <hi>Stephen Gardner</hi> came unto it: and ſo they will
do, or elſe dye in <hi>Nabals</hi> ſtonineſſe.</p>
               <p>And for their faith: The faith of the Elect is deſcribed to
be a confidence, and evidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. So expound <hi>Heb.</hi>
3. 14. If we hold faſt the confidence, the word is all one
with ſubſiſtance, it is ſuch a confidence as doth give a being,
and ſubſiſtance unto the thing beleived: it doth as truly
make them to be as if they were actually extent: But what
ſay they to this? They look at is as preſumption, and an
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57074:111"/>
abomination: yea it will coſt a man his life to hold forth ſuch
a Faith. And for evidence, they do profeſſe it to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
to a chriſtian; and their Faith is ſome conjecture but
no certainty. Now gather up theſe things; If the Roman
Catholicks have no better Faith, no better repentance then
their Religion holds forth, if they receive Chriſt no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and worſhip God no better, and have no more intereſt
in God then their Religion leads them to; let all the world
look to it, for there is none of all the elect of God can live
and dye ſo.</p>
               <p>But why is this a point of ſo ſerious and deep conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and attention? that is taken</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> from the weight of the point, as moſt concerning

Roman Catholick Religion which is this: That for every

i. is of neceſſity to ſalvation. Whoever he be that hath ears to
heare let him hear ſaith the holy Ghoſt, that to be reconciled
to the Catholick Church, and ſubject to that Church and the
head thereof, it is of neceſſity the way to damnation, if a ſoul ſo
live and ſo dye. For this purpoſe the Text is as plain as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>Rev. 20. 15. Whoever is not found written in the book of life

they have known the way of a better faith and repentance,

you Proteſtants dare not deny it: And then I pray you whether is it
not ſafer to be devoted to that Church, wherein all confeſſe there is a

               <p>Here is the patience and faith of the Saints.</p>
               <p>The third note is this.</p>
               <p>The Lord doth as much acknowledg and accept the patience and
faith of his Saints that have ſuffered under the Roman Catholique
Church,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> as he did the faith and patience of the Primitive Saints, that
ſuffered under the Roman Pagan Emperours, againſt Heatheniſh ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts themſelves are full of acknowledgment of the
Primitive Martyrs, and will write many Legends of them;
as the Phariſees, they did build the Sepulchers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and yet killed their Succeſſors: <hi>Fulfill</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>the meaſure of your fathers:</hi> You garniſh the ſepulchers of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57074:114"/>
dead bodies, and yet you kill their Succeſſors. They will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
them the Primitive Martyrs; but what are thoſe
that ſuffered in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi>
They look at thoſe as <hi>Lolards,</hi> and Hereticks: But what
ſaith the Lord of them? Even of them as well as of thoſe that
ſuffered in former times; the Lord doth accept their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and ſaith of them, <hi>Here is the patience and faith of the
Saints.</hi> Wherein the Lord doth acknowledge the faith by
which they overcome this Beaſt, and patience, <hi>to be the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and faith of the Saints.</hi> The world ſaith otherwiſe: but
the Lord ſaith of thoſe that ſuffered under this Beaſt, <hi>Here is
the patience and faith of the Saints.</hi> So in <hi>Rev. 12. 13. Here is
the patience of the Saints: Write, bleſſed are the dead which dye in
the Lord from hence-forth,</hi> as well as in ancient times: Bleſſed
are they that dye in the faith of Chriſt Jeſus, in the hotteſt
and higheſt times of Popery.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is evident,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> becauſe the faith of ſuch Chriſtians, and their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
was the faith and patience of Chriſt: That is to ſay,
that which both faſtned upon Chriſt, and bore witnſſe unto
Chriſt, and ſuffered patiently for Chriſt as did the Primitive
Chriſtians in the ten Perſecutions: And it was ſuch a faith,
as by which they overcame the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. It was
faith in Chriſt Jeſus, even that faith by which they choſe <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. 24, 25. It was that faith by
which they deſpiſed honour. Even the ſame caſe of Chriſt in
<hi>Moſes</hi> hand, and in their hands, and the point is of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Roman Idolatry is but another Edition, and their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

the faith of Gods elect: And their Government is directly
contrary unto the Goſpel-government of Chriſt Jeſus as
light is to darkneſſe. When their faith in the cauſe of Chriſt
do carry them along in ſuffering for him, it is then the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſuffer under <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as under <hi>Herod.</hi> It is true,

This doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt write upon their
ſtakes where they are burned (in <hi>Smithfield</hi> or elſe-where)
and upon the chains wherewith they are bound.</p>
               <p>A great encouragement it is unto Chriſtians to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and to contend earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the faith once given to the Saints. We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be afraid to ſtand faſt in the profeſſion of the Truth, and
to hold it to the death: If we ſhould dye in his Cauſe in a
way of perſecution to be ſlaughtered by the outrage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men; what ever the world ſay of it, the Lord will
from heaven beare this witneſſe to it, That it is the patience
and faith of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> it muſt teach all who would ſuffer for the name
of Chriſt to be well aſſured of their cauſe, and then to adde
conſtancy to their ſuffering in their cauſe. Otherwiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be the cauſe of Chriſt, it is no patience, but obſtinacy,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57074:115"/>
blindeneſſe, and ignorance: But ſee that your cauſe be the
cauſe of Chriſt, and then cleave unto it by the invincible
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith of Gods elect, to overcome the world, and look Lyons

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, without fear and aſtoniſhment; and
look at puniſhment and tortour, as not worthy of the glory
that ſhall be revealed: It looks at them as things that Chriſt
hath endured greater, and other of the Saints of God have
gone before u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the like, or a greater martyrdome.</p>
               <p>Therefore, firſt, look to the cauſe, and then believe in the
truth of the cauſe, and the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt that will
maintaine his ſervants ſtable and firme, and cauſe them to
hold out unto the end. But do not take up your reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon cuſtome, nor ſide with any thing for cuſtom of the
country where you are, becauſe your Magiſtrates and Elders
do commend it to you; for it behooves every chriſtian man
to know well, what he beleives, and practiſe, and to know the
doctrine of Chriſt, and the Government and the worſhip of
Chriſt; and that not becauſe men ſay ſo, but becauſe you ſee
light for it from the word of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Then your next care is, to look that you depend upon
Chriſt for ſtrength, that as he ſuffered for you, you may be
able to ſuffer for him; ther's the faith of Gods children:
And for patience (I pray conſider it) I do not enter into a
common place of faith, and patience; but let me ſay thus
much of it, Patience is a virtue, mortifying and moderating
greifs, and fears, or afflictions, and ſubduing our wils to the
will of God, not onely in contentment, but comfort. <hi>My
brethren</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) count it all joy when you fall into divers
temptations, James</hi> 1. 2. That whereas other men, or our
ſelves in time of proſperity, when as God applies his will to
our wils, are joyful (and this is no great matter.) This is
the joy of Gods people when God ſhall apply our wils unto
his. As Chriſt did comforme his will unto his Fathers will,
and ſay, <hi>O my God, I delight to do thy will: It is written in thy
book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I came to do thy will, Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. This indeed doth make
us compleat chriſtians.</p>
               <p>A man is a happy man that hath his will and Gods will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in all that his heart does deſire: If God would have
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57074:116"/>
me ſuffer, then certain it is beſt it ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſhould chriſtians come armed with faith and patience, and
with wils ſubdued to the will of the moſt high; not onely to
be contented, but comfortable in ſuffering all things for
Chriſt: And let your faith faſten upon it, and let your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
moderate your greifs, and make your hearts comfortable
alſo, and this is that which God delights in; <hi>Here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and faith of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I will end with that ſpeech of the Apoſtle; <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
be ye followers of them, who through faith and patience inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the promiſes, Heb.</hi> 6. 12. Both by faith of well doing, and
of ſuffering evill by faith and patience. <hi>Ye have need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
Heb.</hi> 10. 36. You have need of patience, that ye may
be faithfull: and you have need of faith, that you may be
patient: When a man is confident in Chriſt above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this works patience. So we ſhall follow the ſteps of
our bleſſed Anceſtors; we ſhall ſtill go on in maintayning
the ſame faith, and worſhip, and Government, wherein our
Fathers were taught of God to walk, and whereby they did
inherit promiſes both in life and death.</p>

and what a vaſt diſtance by the grace of God we
ſtand in here from them: but yet becauſe it is a part of Gods
counſell, and ſome-what largely deſcribed, give me leave to
declare the meaning of the words, and gather ſuch notes
from them as they hold forth.</p>
               <p>Obſerve then, here is a deſcription from the 11th. verſe to
the end of the Chapter, of the ſecond Beaſt; <hi>I ſaw another
Beaſt.</hi> The Originall ſets him forth by his nature; they that
know the language, knows it ſignifies only a wild beaſt, and
in proper ſpeech it ſignifies ſuch a wilde beaſt as was veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
and therefore the remedy for the venome of this beaſt,
they call it <hi>Therion,</hi> a proper preſervative againſt venome or
poyſon.</p>
               <p>This beaſt is deſcribed by four arguments.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>By his originall;</hi> He comes out of the earth.</p>
               <p>2. By his ſimilitude (or reſemblance) in three things.</p>

of his power; <hi>He exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt.</hi>

power, or the effects of his power which are theſe:</p>
               <p>1. He cauſeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worſhip
the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed; <hi>he procures ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the firſt Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>3. He deceives them that dwell on the earth by the meanes

an Image to the Beaſt, which had the wound by the ſword,
and did live, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>5. He doth animate and give life to this image of the Beaſt,
that this image of the Beaſt ſhould have both power to ſpeak,
and to cauſe as many as would not worſhip the image of the
Beaſt to be killed.</p>
               <p>A ſixth effect is, he cauſeth all ſorts of men, rich and poor,

               <p>For the Notes that theſe words afford, I will handle them
all in two: They will not need much enlargement, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and Application of them will reach the meaning,
and ſcope of the words. Remember what the firſt Beaſt was,
and then you will more eaſily know what this Beaſt muſt be.
You know this firſt Beaſt being deſcribed to have ſeven heads,
and ten horns, was taken by all for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and
this being not that, but another that comes in his room af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him: Is is evident then that this Beaſt muſt either be the
<hi>Roman-Heathen</hi> Empire, or the <hi>Roman-Chriſtian</hi> Empire, or
the Roman-catholick viſible Church; one of theſe three Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
States it muſt be.</p>
               <p>Not the firſt, for this roſe after that was caſt down; after
the Dragon was caſt out of Heaven, and had no more to rule
that State. Alſo you heard in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. that Beaſt had ten
crowns on the heads; this hath not Crowns on the heads,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57074:117"/>
but on the horns; the Princes and heads of that State were
crowned: This doth not weare the temporall Crown, but
thoſe Princes that mayntaine him, they weare the Crowns.</p>
               <p>Againe, that Beaſt, Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> did not begin his time of
proſperity, and flouriſhing, with the womans flight into the
wilderneſſe, and the <hi>two witneſſes prophecying in ſackcloath, a
thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes;</hi> for their government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
when the Chriſtian State began, and therefore it could
not be Pagan-heathen <hi>Rome;</hi> Nor could it be the Chriſtian
Imperial Roman <hi>State:</hi> For</p>
               <p>1. It is ſaid in the ſecond <hi>verſ.</hi> That <hi>the Dragon gave him his
power, and his ſeate, and great authority;</hi> but that he did not to
the Chriſtian Emperours, for they would not live at <hi>Rome,</hi>
but at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It was never made a ſigne of reprobation to worſhip the
Roman Chriſtian Emperors, but it is made a ſign of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
to worſhip this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>It remayns therefore, that this Beaſt deſcribed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
pare of the Chapter, is the third Roman State; which
being not Rome-Pagan, nor Rome-Chriſtian, it muſt needs
be the Roman Papall <hi>State,</hi> under the government of the
Pope, and that is no other but the Roman Catholick viſible
Church, to which all the deſcription you have heard ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
doth naturally belong.</p>
               <p>Now that being the firſt beaſt, what is this ſecond beaſt?
This is apparantly diſtinct from it; and it is not ſo proper to
ſay, that the firſt beaſt was the Pope, as he had ſoveraign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in Temporalls; and that he is the ſecond Beaſt as he
hath ſupream power in Spiritualls, for he had his Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

he had ſupream power in Temporals. Now the beaſt here
being not the Roman Catholick Church, what is it then? It
is the head of that Church; and what is that? It is no other
but the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> The heads of the Roman Catholique
viſible Church, from one ſucceſſion to another, they are this

Firſt then, take this note;</p>
               <p>That the Biſhop or Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">Doctrine 1.</note> and of

Church in his power.</p>
               <p>This is the former part of the deſcription by his Adjunct,
by his Similitude, and by his Originall: However he ſeems to
Catholicks a holy Father, and a god on earth; yet in the

have horns like a Lamb, yet ſpeaks like a Dragon, and thus
<hi>John</hi> guided by the holy Ghoſt, ſaw him. Let me ſhortly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
theſe points.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>He is here deſcribed to be a wilde beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> The word ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies;

the word of Truth, or by the cenſures of the Church, no nor
by the power of Princes; he is above them all, and beyond
them all; a wild beaſt he is therefore.</p>
               <p>For his Originall, <hi>He ariſeth out of the earth.]</hi> That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
he hath it not from Heaven, but from below; not

Chriſt) <hi>I am from above,</hi> John 8. 23. Hee ſprings from the
earth, eſpecially from earthly and carnall policy; that for
keeping of good agreement in the Churches, they muſt be
folded up into certain Metropolitans or Patriarchs; and to
keep unity, you muſt have one over them all, and that was
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all unity they ſay ſprings from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if you have more then one Governour, you will have
no peace: Now this being a carnall principle, ſome carnall
reaſon being the ground for the preſervation of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> for that the Emperours thought, if the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> were advanced, it would be a means to ſtrengthen them
againſt the barbarous Nations that come againſt them; this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57074:118"/>
carnall reaſon brought him to be exalted: And though his
Originall was earthly for the cauſe, yet he aſcended above

               <p>2. He aroſe out of the Earth, becauſe he roſe up inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> this is his deſcent out of the Earth.</p>

at leaſt for a long time; The power of binding and looſing
were his two horns, to bind all, and looſe all, and that lay
in the cloſet of his own breaſt when to put it forth; this is
but the power of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>But he ſpake like a Dragon.]</p>
               <p>You have two or three ſeverall ſpeeches of the Dragon. In

ſpeak?</p>
               <p>1. Venomous words to our firſt Parents; <hi>You ſhall not dye

               <p>Now becauſe I cannot ſo well make uſe of this, before I
have ſpoken of the reſt, becauſe they are co-incident, take
this for a ſecond Note, and ſo make uſe of both together.
The note is long, but it is but the collection of the ſum of
theſe verſes, the words of the Text will bring the Doctrine
eaſily to remembrance; This then is the note.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of Rome exerciſeth all the Authority of the firſt Beaſt,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
that is, of the Roman viſible Catholick Church, he cauſeth all that
dwell on the Earth to worſhip that Church, he doth worke wonders,
even to the fetching of fire from Heaven, and by his wonders procures
all chriſtian States to make an Image to the firſt Beaſt, and gives ſuch
life and power to the Image of the Beaſt that it is able to ſpeak, and
it ſhall cauſe ſuch as do not worſhip it to be put to death, and finally he
leaves an impreſſion, or imprints a character upon all ſorts of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and will ſuffer none to enjoy ſpirituall or civill communion with
them, unleſſe ſuch as will receive either his marke, or his name, or the

               <p>I put them into a doctrinall frame, becauſe they are the

all that are acquainted either with the writings of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,

and the Pope familiarly exerciſeth them all.</p>
               <p>1. The Pope hath power to convent generall Councels;

                  </gap>ce unleſſe the Catholick Church and the Biſhops
meet in a repreſentative Synod, it concludes with their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
this he pleads for to this day, it belongs not to
the Emperors, nor to Chriſtian Princes, but to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> It is one of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> affirmations, that one Church
ſhall have power to call all Churches, be it to <hi>Florence,</hi> or
<hi>Baſſeil,</hi> thether they muſt go whether he will.</p>
               <p>2. As the Catholick Roman Church did uſurpe power to
make Laws and Canons to binde all Churches; So the Pope
doth challenge the ſame power to make Laws to binde all
Churches; he pleads for it, and will not be content without
it.</p>
               <p>3. Look as the Catholick viſible Roman Church doth
claime Authority of ratifying Scriptures; if they put in the
Apocrypha, it ſhall be good Scripture; and if the Church do
not approve the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew</hi> in Greek, but in Hebrew, it
ſhall be that; or if they refuſe both them, and take the vulgar
Latine, that ſhall ſtand: This power the Catholick Church
challengeth power to do, and the ſame doth the Pope.</p>
               <p>4. If the Roman Catholick viſible Church challenge a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of interpreting Scripture, and judging of controverſies
with infalibility of judgement: The Pope challengeth that
to himſelfe when he interprets Scripture, or decides contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
about Religion, he cannot erre, and ſo they make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he is a fit Judge therein.</p>
               <p>5. Look as you ſee the Roman Catholick viſible Church
had power of binding and looſing, challengeth all appleal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and great things they will do by that priveledge, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

for ſeven years, ſome to their death, that the

larger meaſure then the old Roman viſible Church did chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.
This the Roman Biſhop challengeth to binde conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to looſe oathes and covenants between Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
between man and wife, to looſe vows, and oaths, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
relations, between parents and children, if they will

the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in caſe of inceſt: this is ſuch a power to looſe
the bonds of Gods commandments, and Gods oaths, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to God and his ſervants, it is ſuch Tranſcendant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
the Roman viſible Catholick Church never challenged
greater.</p>
               <p>6. The Roman viſible Catholick Church never challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ſo great power till it was animated and acknowledged by
the Pope, to take upon them to ſet up one King, and to take

<hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Henery</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henery</hi> the fifth;
he crowns and diſcrowns whom he will, and this out of the
plentitude of his power.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, he doth challenge this beyond the Church it
ſelfe, Immunity, and Impunity from all Civill and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
power, and judicature. The Church is above all j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

power, and the Pope the head of it is above it, and therefore
may not be brought into order by any cenſure of any Church,
nor by the civil ſword: And therefore he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that exerciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt, and rather puts
more power to it; whatever the Catholick Church may do,
that he can do; where they can diſpence and make Laws,
where they can bind or looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So farre as they may
go, he can go, and he doth all in the name, and ſight of the
Church.</p>
               <p>And he cauſeth all that dwell on the Earth.] <hi>That is, carnal
chriſtians,</hi> whoſe converſation is not in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To worſhip the firſt Beaſt.]</hi> How to worſhip? He ſpeaks of
divine worſhip not civil adoration: This is an aberation
from a Church; but a beaſtly Church, it is a monſter; The
Church of the firſt inſtitution was of one particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57074:120"/>
and for all the Churches of the world to be ſubject
to one Cathedral, it is far beyond all comprehenſion of rule:
Now he cauſeth all that dwell on the Earth to worſhip that
Beaſt. Wherein are they to worſhip him?</p>
               <p>1. It is made a matter of neceſſity to ſalvation to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to that Church; and more care is had of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to that Church, then of being reconciled to God in
Chriſt: All pleas of being reconciled to Chriſt will not ſtand
in their judgment, unleſſe you be reconciled to them.</p>
               <p>2. Except you be bound in conſcience to that ſtate, he will
allow you no communion; he will have all the decrees of
the Church as binding the conſcience.</p>
               <p>3. This is divine worſhip, you ſhall take no doctrine but
that is of his ſtamp, nor worſhip, nor Government but of his
acknowledgment, nor no diſpenſation of them but according
to his Canons: And all that dwell on the Earth muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, all run upon the Beaſt; the Pope doth not ſo much
challenge it to himſelfe as to the Church, and that which is
given to the Church he takes to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He doth great wonders, ſo that he makes fire come
from Heaven on the Earth in the ſight of men:</hi> And it is ſaid,
<hi>Antichriſt ſhall come in all power of ſignes and lying wonders, 2 Theſ.</hi>
2. 8, 9. Their Legions are full of theſe wonders: And in
particular, for this point, of cauſing fire to come down from
Heaven: It is an alluſion ſure to the fire that the old Prophet
fetched from Heaven: As <hi>Eliah fetched fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the ſacrifice, 1 Kings</hi> 18. 38, 39. And that was a fire that
expreſſed Gods gracious acceptance, that made all the people
cry, <hi>the Lord he is God:</hi> But this the Pope did not fetch ſure,
he never fetched any acceptance from Heaven. But you read
of another fire fetched from Heaven by <hi>Eliah,</hi> and that was,

Now it is evident it might be, for he was a Conjurer, and 22.

                  </gap>ches, and gave their ſoules to the Devil, that they might
obtaine the Popedome, but they were but lying wonders;
for miracles require divine power, but the Devil cannot go
beyond the power of nature; ſo that you may take it in the
proper meaning; their own men do much magnifie it, and
make it one of the markes of their Churche, whereas Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
that want miracles are not Churches: So that thoſe
cenſures by which they thundred againſt chriſtian Emperors,
they did follow with ſuch ſucceſs, that they made all wonder,
that none could ſtand againſt them, not <hi>Henery</hi> the fourth,
nor <hi>Henery</hi> the fifth, not <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, nor the King of
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> none of them all were able to take up armes againſt
him; they did all admire him; <hi>Who is able to ſtand againſt him,
end to make Warre with him?</hi> And that gave ſuch free paſſage to
his Laws, that all chriſtian States preſently took up what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
he put upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by theſe miracles, and the mighty ſucceſſe of
them, he had power <hi>to cauſe them that dwell on the earth to make
an Image to the Beaſt, that had the deadly wound, and was healed;</hi>
that is, the Roman Catholick viſible Church: What is this
Image of the Beaſt? he cauſeth all the earth, that is, all earthly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57074:121"/>
States to receive it; he will ſuffer none to be without it:
what is this Image? an Image not of their own making, they
muſt make an Image by his appointment: It is an Image of
the firſt beaſt, not of the ſecond directly, and conſequently
the officers of that Beaſt muſt repreſent this ſecond Beaſt, but
be an Image of the firſt: if the firſt Beaſt was the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
viſible Church; then if he cauſeth all the Earth to
make an Image to that Beaſt, then he cauſeth all Churches
and Common-wealths, to frame their State and platforme,
according to the Image of the Roman Catholick viſible
Church, and therefore he cauſeth all Chriſtian Princes to erect
all their Churches in a Roman Catholick way: what is that?
Metropolitan, National, Provnciall, Dioceſan, Cathedral,
and Provincial Churches; Theſe are all lively characters of
the Roman Catholick Church, reſerving ſtil pre-emenency to
their mother Catholick Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but otherwiſe they
are the lively Image of ſuch a Church, even as daughters are
of their mothers: and being overcome with the power of his
miracles, and deceits, and deluſions (as you heard) by the
Policy of Canoniſts, by carnall Policy, and by their Votaries,
and by working miracles, ſignes, and lying wonders; it is a
wonder to ſee what power he had, that all the power of the
Popedome, and of the Catholick Church was in a model and
repreſentation drawn in all Churches in <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> during
the time of 42. moneths, which is 1260. years, and then a
great part of his Image was marred in a great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,
but yet he ſtill continues; ſo then there is a lively
Image of the Roman Catholick Church, though it may be,
ſome are drawn from ſubjection thereunto; and yet though
they be drawn off from ſubjection to it, yet ſtill the Image, and
repreſentation is written in the very foreheads of ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
that is a fourth thing.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>He had power to give life to the Image of the Beaſt;</hi> what
life? that it ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe, <hi>That as many as
would not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt ſhould be killed:</hi> How
doth he put this life into the Image of this Beaſt to ſpeak? It
is, to ſpeak with authorty, as in <hi>verſe 5. A mouth ſpeaking
great things;</hi> He would ſpeak, and ſpeak with authority;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57074:122"/>
that now theſe Dioceſan, Metropolitan, and Provinciall
Churches, they can ſpeak with authority, as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church doth, and their words muſt take place, and
he puts that life into it by his own canons and laws which
they take up; the canons and laws made by the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> do ſo animate Provincial, and Dioceſan Churches, that
they ſpeak the ſame language, not altogether ſo corrupt, but
with like authority, and require like ſubjection of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and by your leave, they grow to it for very conſcience
ſake; that thoſe things which were indifferent before, yet
being laws of the Church, now they muſt binde conſcience;
this is to ſpeak great things. Now they have power likewiſe
<hi>to cauſe as many as will not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt, they ſhall
be killed;</hi> a ſigne none of them took that power like the beaſt;
but yet though they have not power to kill them, yet to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them to the Secular power, and they muſt kill them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whatever the Dioceſan Church doth agree on againſt her He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
that will not obey the Government or doctrine of
the Church; what then? The deliver him to the Secular
power, then they cauſe him to be put to death, and they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him to fire and faggot, ſo you ſee the mighty power of
this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>There is one thing remaining of his power, and that is the
ſixth and laſt effect, He cauſeth all, both ſmall and great, rich
and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand,
or in their foreheads: Kings, and Princes, Miniſters and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
men (as they call them) high and low, whatever they be,
he cauſeth them all to receive a character, or marke, either in
their right hand, or in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>A marke in the hand; that character themſelves call an
indelible character, and they receive that who receive any
orders from the Pope, and are reconciled to the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

marke, that is, they ſhall ſweare fidelity, and loyalty to the
Roman Catholick viſible Church, this they make indelible;
wherever they come, <hi>they are Prieſts for ever after the order of
Melcheſidech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or on their foreheads; they have a marke anſwerable to

their name; their name, what is that but Roman Catholicks?
or elſe there is no fellowſhip with them; and all muſt at

but I leave that to the next time (as being too large to enter

and deſignation of this Beaſt who it is: Is hath been

fall upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> that if <hi>John</hi> had lived
in theſe dayes, he would have ſeene all this with his eyes,
which he ſaw in a viſion: No man can tell where to beſtow
all this deſcription for 1260. years, but upon the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that is of ſuch a wilde nature, that no Church, no law
of God, no ſociety of men, no Kings, nor Princes can rule;
and all the world that knows this Beaſt, knows this to be true
of the Pope, whoſe Original (all Chriſtians know) ſprings
from the Earth, to keep men in unity, and to preſerve the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
from inundations of Barbarians, to keep Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of which he ſprings, yet incenſibly, and ſlowly, that he is not
diſcerned for many years together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he hath horns like a Lamb,</hi> that he pretends nothing but
(Saint <hi>Peter</hi> as they call it) the Keys of the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>But he ſpeaks like a Dragon,</hi> as if he had the Keys of the

both againſt the lawes of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> to diſſolve
oaths, and covenants, and relations, they ſhall marry whom

<hi>he hath ſpoken as a Dragon:</hi> The Devil himſelfe as he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Secondly,<note place="margin">V;ſe 2.</note> this doth juſtly reprove all the Popiſh admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and adoring of the man of Sinne; They look at him as
their holy Father, and Biſhop of Chriſt, and Vicar of God, as
one that hath an infallible judgment, that cannot erre, that
he is above all power of cenſure: If he ſhould draw miſſions
of ſoules to hell, no man muſt ſay, Sir, why do you ſo? they
have this opinion of him: No matter what they conceive, he
muſt be judged by the King of Kings, and by the God of Gods,
and by the Saints of that God that judgeth according to the
word; and they look at this Father as a Monſter, as a wilde
beaſt, whom no Scripture, no Church can keepe in awe,
but he is Lord paramount above them all; they look at him
as the Dragon of the bottomleſſe pit, as he that deſtroys the
Chriſtian world: and however he may pretend, as if he had
nothing but Lamb-like power, yet <hi>hee ſpeakes like a Dragon;</hi>
thus <hi>John</hi> ſaw him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> Obſerve from hence a reaſon of a note that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
many Interpreters; That if this beaſt have ſuch power,
why doth he not cauſe the earth to worſhip himſelf? why
doth he not provide for his own honour, but for the firſt
beaſt? The reaſon is plain; the firſt Beaſt being the Roman
Catholick Church, and the head of that Beaſt, all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that redounds to the beaſt, falls upon the head of the
beaſt, and it is upon himſelfe; He exerciſeth all that power
that the firſt beaſt hath, and therefore no marvell if he labour
to draw all men what he can to worſhip, not himſelfe, but
the Roman Catholick Church, to be reconciled to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
decrees from it, and ſubmit in conſcience thereunto,
and receive no worſhip nor doctrine but from them, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but eſtabliſhed by them; no Lawes to be enjoyned
and tranſacted but by them, for he knows that this honour
will redound to him; He knows all this power doth reſt in
his own breaſt, and it is he that acts the Roman Catholick
Church, and he can do with a Councell, and without a
Councell what the Church can do, and he failes not to do
it from time to time. Wonder not therefore that he puts off
the honour to the firſt beaſt, the old Roman Church, there
he layes all his devotion, but in concluſion it is all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:57074:123"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> you may ſee the corrupt Originall, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
State of corrupt religion, and of ſuch kind of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as are drawn out by the modell of the Roman Catholick
viſible Church, any image of that beaſt: I do not trouble you
with what others think to be the image of the Beaſt (I ſhould
but weary my ſelfe in ſo doing) but if the firſt beaſt be the
Roman Catholick Church, as it muſt needs be, then the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
muſt be according to it, though not of equall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet of the like frame; whereas the Lord hath inſtituted
no other but particular Congregations to bring in a whole
Nation (that may containe a thouſand Congregations) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Church, what an image is this of the Roman viſible
Catholick Church: It is not Catholick indeed, it is ſhort
of that, but ſo large as it carries a Nation, it exceeds Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan,
and Dioceſan exceeds particular Congregations:
Now ſee the danger of this; you ſee the firſt riſe was from the
power of this beaſt, <hi>He cauſeth all the earth to make an Image of
this Beaſt:</hi> He did not bring them to make one in number, but
one in <hi>England,</hi> and one in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and one in <hi>France,</hi> and
one in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in every Countrey according to their
diviſions, and Princely Potentates; that all that dwell in the
limits of that Juriſdiction, they have one Cathedral Church,
to which all other Parochiall Churches do belong; this hee
cauſeth them to do: and when he hath done it, giveth it the
very like breath of the <hi>Roman</hi> Order; though not in ſo vaſt a
meaſure, yet in a faire modell, that they are like the image
of this holy Father, and ſo by this meanes it comes to paſſe,
by his Laws and Canons which he perſwades all to receive,
and which is a wonder, ſince they have cut him off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
head of the Church, yet ſtill they reteyn the life of Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in the State of ſuch Chancellors, and Parators, and ſuch
kind of Civill, and Eccleſiaſticall power mingled together;
that a Cathedrall Church forty or fifty miles off, ſhall ſend
terrible cenſures to cut off the poor Saints of God, and they
muſt obey it; and if they ſtand in an Hereticall courſe (as
they call it) there is no living for them, they will kill their
Propheticall life, as they did the two Witneſſes; or if they
do in any effectuall manner work, they will not ſtick to call
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57074:124"/>
them to account, and caſt them out, and deliver them to
the Secular power, and they ſhall deliver them to fire and
ſword.</p>
               <p>So then, ſee the danger of ſuch Conſtitutions, it was
wrought by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and lives by life from him,
the life of the Law of God breaths not in the pulſes of it; any
that know them, know how far they be from the pattern of
the Scripture, how ridiculous they be to ſuch as diſcern the
ſtate of them; You ſee alſo what mighty power they have,
that all civill States have been contented to deliver ſuch to
fire and ſword, whom they have delivered up as Hereticks:
They ſoon looſe the protection of the Civill State, if they
looſe the favour of imaginary Churches; well doth he call
them images, they are images of the Pope, and images which
God forbids, and the inventions of the ſonnes of men; <hi>Thou
ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any graven Image,</hi> in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
You ſhall make no Images of Officers, nor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor worſhip, but that which Chriſt himſelfe hath

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 5.</note> it lets us ſee how dangerous it is, to annex civill
penalties, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> upon ſuch as are caſt out of the Church;
an uſuall thing in Popiſh Churches, or in the Images of ſuch.
Firſt, they ſuſpend them from the Sacrament, but then it
comes with an Excommunication, no man muſt buy nor
ſell, he hath refuſed to honour the image of the Beaſt: It is
dangerous to bring in civill Authority immediately upon
Church-cenſure: A warning to us here, that if men be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
not to deny them civill Commerce, or to
ſay ſuch as ſtand out excommunicated ſo long, ſhall no
longer enjoy the priviledges of the State: The Church may
cut them off from fellowſhip with it ſelfe, there may be juſt
reaſon ſo to do; they may diſcover ſuch hypocrifie as may
make them unfit for the Church, but yet they may not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
be unfit for the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 6.</note> It may ſerve to humble us ſo farr, as in times paſt
we had any thing to do with this Beaſt, eyther in the loynes
of our Fathers with this firſt Beaſt, the Roman Catholick

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57074:124"/>
(I meane Eccleſiaſticall communion) with the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of this firſt Beaſt, that is, with Provinciall, Dioceſan,
Cathedrall, National Churches.</p>
               <p>You know it is not my manner to fall into ſpeeches of
Chriſts in other parts, it is beſt for us to look to our owne;
but when the Text is juſt ſo fit, now to be ſilent, were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the children of God the bread of their portion: If it be
ſuch a Church as is of the Popes deviſing, as hath provoked
the jealouſie of God, and hath not been derived from the
primitive inſtitution that Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed; then ſo far
as we have had to deale with them, either in office, or out of
office, receiving their Sacraments, and their Cenſures, or
have publiſhed their Cenſures, though God (it may be) mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
kept us from publiſhing ſuch as we did conceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;
yet foraſmuch as there hath been any ſubmittance in this
kind, any Church-communion, whereby we have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Church-office by the Image of this beaſt, or inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the ordination of the firſt beaſt, or ſo far as wee have
ſubmitted to the firſt or ſecond Beaſt; ſo far as we have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked
in the holy things of God, which flow from Church-communion,
as Sacraments and Cenſures do, verily ſo farre
we have cauſe to be humbled; though the Lord kept any of
us from thinking it any neceſſity to be reconciled to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or kept us from ſundry things in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which the Image of the Beaſt required; and though he
kept us alſo from receiving all their Dictates without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll;
yet for our practice in entring into our calling, and
our diſpenſations which have been but images of the firſt
beaſt: and ſo far as our fellowſhip in Ordinances with them
have cleaved to that Church, verily the guilt of that will lye
upon ſuch ſoules as have not unfeignedly bewailed it before
the Lord.</p>
               <p>What think you might be the cauſe that Chriſtians do
complayn of ſo much deadneſſe, under ſuch plenty, and (as
ſome ſay) power of Ordinances? I might as juſtly blame
the world for as great part, that men think they are forced
to lanch out in building and planting; an evill haunt and
cuſtome hath been rivetred into mens ſpirits, that they have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57074:125"/>
much ado to be content any where; but this is not all: Nor
can I lay it wholly upon over-much confidence in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
we have heretofore thought men happy that had liberty
of Ordinances, though out in a duty of humiliation; God will
let you ſee the emptineſſe of all Ordinances, &amp; that there is no
life in them further then he puts in them; but I will not put in
neither of both theſe, though both theſe may challenge a part
of the deadneſſe of the Countrrey, and may becauſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:
But giue me leave to ſay, I feare this chiefly, that men
thought it enough that they were got out of the reach of
Summoners, and Pariters, and ſuch like, whoſe offices have
been by the power of the beaſt, the remnants whereof hang
in thoſe places where they ſhould not ſtand; I feare men have
reſted in turning their backs upon ſuch troubles as they were
put unto, when they have not been ſerious in judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for theſe Images of jealouſie, when they are ſo loft to
be rent from them, I feare the Lord hath not humbled them
for their old contagion, and therefore they are not ſo dead,
for what is an Image but deadneſſe? truly becauſe we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in bodily preſence, then in heart departed from them,
therefore there is ſuch deadneſſe: what's the reaſon, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the leaſt motion, men are ready to remove to a new Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as if they removed from old <hi>England</hi> to New in a
pang: If men had a calling upon juſt grounds to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then when we come where the Ordinances of God are,
we ſhould ſit down under the Ordinances, under the ſhadow
of the Almighty, and never look for more: But when that
doth not ſatisfie that we enjoy Ordinances, all that liberty
we did deſire, we do enjoy, and yet it doth not ſatisfie;
certainly there is ſome ſinne lyes in the breaſt ſtill, for which
the Lord purſues men with a reſtleſſe frame, they are not yet
purged from the image of Romiſh pollution, and therefore
the Lord ſees it not meet to give us reſt, no not in <hi>Sion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in heart we are not returned from <hi>Babell,</hi> but every
new occaſion puts us to a new plantation, and when we are
there we cannot reſt: And therefore I feare, becauſe we have
not judged our ſelves for our inordinate walking in polluted
Churches, but have rather ſought for our own peace, then
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57074:125"/>
purity from theſe pollutions, which there have defiled us, or
do not ſee any great need of judging our ſelves in that kinde;
thence it is, that to this day the Lord hath much ado to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
our hearts in his peace and purity, and in power, but ſtill
we are much deſtitute of inward purity and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and therefore dead heartedneſſe hangs about us to this
day. And therefore as we deſire the power, and purity, and
peace of Ordinances ſtamped upon our hearts, ſo we are to
bewaile the contagions we have had in this Image of the beaſt
with Officers or people, that ſo the Lord may give a reviving
according to the deſire of our hearts.</p>

pollutions, in which you ſee all that dwell on the earth have

us from the power of this Beaſt (the Roman Catholick
Church) that he hath freed us from making an Image to that

removed us from the marke of this Beaſt, that we deſire not to

he hath freed us in ſome meaſure from the number of his

and Miniſters, they ſhall have power to impoſe Officers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Churches, and to excommunicate Officers and Members;
It is too much the image of the firſt Beaſt, and too much of
the power of both Beaſts, and therefore it is to be lamented:
but that the Lord ſhould give us ſuch liberty, that all our
Churches are not ſubordinate one to another, and none ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
nor plead Supremacy, but are preſerved and kept from
all contagion of the firſt and ſecond beaſt, this calls us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
thankfulneſſe, and wee are to deſire that the Lord
would keep us at ſuch a diſtance, that we may never return
to the image of either of the beaſts.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>By his Originall;</hi> He came out of the earth.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>By his reſemblance; which is three-fold;</hi> To the Lamb in
his hornes; To the Dragon in his tongue and ſpeech, and to the firſt

               <p>3. As he is deſcribed thus by his Originall, and by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,

can call Councels, and make their Canons authenticall; He
can make Lawes to bind Conſcience, he can make Lawes to
bind whole <hi>Churches,</hi> as well as the Aecumenicall power of

He hath power to pardon ſinne, and to ſell out pardons

                  <hi>The ſecond act of his power,</hi> He cauſeth all that dwell on the

               <p>The third act of his power; <hi>He doth great wonders, even to

Acceptance, which <hi>Eliah</hi> brought to conſume the Sacrifice;
but the fire of Vengeance upon the Rebellious, as the Prophet
called for fire upon the Captains that came to attach him.</p>
               <p>4. He doth by his miracles deceive all that dwell upon the earth.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>He cauſeth them all to make an Image like unto the firſt beaſt.</hi>
The firſt beaſt (as you heard) was the <hi>Roman viſible Catholicke

               <p>They muſt ſwear, or perform ſome loyalty to the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The mark of the beaſt, the carriage of the beaſt in
the Originall: All that have received Religious Orders, have
received the mark of the beaſt, all their religious Orders leave
an indelible Character upon them, ſo that all that are entred
into religious Orders, are ſworn <hi>Catholiques.</hi> The name of
the beaſt, what is it? Though they be not of the religious
Order, yet they profeſſe themſelves to be <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi>
and profeſſe ſubjection to the head of that <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57074:127"/>
his doctrine and worſhip, though it be be to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and to his government, as that which binds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
the name of the Beaſt is a <hi>Roman Catholicke,</hi> ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe both to the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the head of that
<hi>Church,</hi> and that for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>But for the number of his name, it was reſerved to this
dayes exerciſe: Wheras the holy Ghoſt having ſaid that he
would permit no man to buy or ſell, but ſuch as had received
the marke, or his name, or the number of his name; he doth
in this laſt Verſe declare what this number of his name is,
which at leaſt they muſt have, or elſe they cannot have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce:
Now this number he firſt doth amplifie or illuſtrate,
and then expreſſe it.</p>
               <p>He doth illuſtrate or amplifie it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the adjunct of wiſdome needful for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it; <hi>Here is wiſdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the duty of men that have underſtanding to
count it.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, He doth amplifie it by the ſubject, or by the
efficient of it, <hi>It is the number of a man:</hi> This is his illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
It requires wiſedome to count it: It is the duty
(though) of them that have underſtanding to ſearch it out.
And when they do count it, they finde it the number of a
man.</p>
               <p>In the Second place he doth expreſly deſigne or diſcipher
out the number, and that is in the laſt word, <hi>his number is ſix
hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place is very obſcure as any in the word, and therefore
the holy Ghoſt tels us, <hi>here is wiſdome to finde it out:</hi> but
withal, here is a command that every one that hath received
the leaſt meaſure or talent of wiſdom ſhould endeavour it,
and he doth incourage men to find it out.</p>
               <p>But were it not that the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>If any man want
wiſdome let him aske it of God, and it ſhall be given him, James</hi> 1. 5.
And were it not that God hath given Chriſt to be our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to declare to us the whole councel of his Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 30. And were it not that the providence of God in the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57074:128"/>
invitation of ſundry brethren, hath put me upon the handling
of this book, and now it fals in order to be opened; for my
own part, I think I ſhould never have choſen this Text to
have ſpoken to whilſt I had lived: But now ſince we are
come to it, in our interpretation of this book, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God is perfected in the weakneſſe of his ſervants, I
ſhall therefore endeavour by the helpe of God, and by the
light of his wiſdome, to expreſſe ſuch meditations as God
hath ſuggeſted to men, and leave them to your further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and ſpiritual diſcerning and judgement.</p>
               <p>The note then is ſhortly thus much.</p>
               <p>To finde out the number of the Beaſt requires heavenly wiſdome,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and
yet ſuch as have received any wiſdome ought to count that number, and
upon the acount ſhall find it to be the number of a man, in ſum ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
threeſcore and ſix.</p>
               <p>This is the ſum, I wrap up all in one Doctrine, that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Doctrine in the parcels, all the parts of the verſe may
be opened therewith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay to finde out this number is wiſdome, it requires
heavenly wiſdome; <hi>Here is wiſdome:</hi> And God accounts
not the wiſdome of this world wiſdome, but fooliſhneſſe; he
ſpeaks therefore of that which in Scripture language is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not Mathematical, nor Airthmetical wiſdome; for
what great wiſdome would it require to count this number, it
ariſeth out of ſix, and is multiplyed by ten, this is ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as any mean Arithmetition might count, ſix times ten
is 60. and ten times 60. is 600. and ſix times one is ſix, the
wiſdome therefore lies not there. But to ſee how this count
diſciphers the Beaſt, and by that means to give more perfect
intelligence of the Beaſt, and of his nature, then by his marke
and name alone could be gathered, that requires heavenly
wiſdome, but wiſdome therefore it doth require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It requires
a mans beſt underſtanding to enquire what the holy Ghoſt
hath ſaid of this number: and though it require much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yet the counting of this number is both poſſible, and
neceſſary: if it were not poſſible, the holy Ghoſt would not
ſay, <hi>Let him that hath underſtanding, count the number of the
Beaſt:</hi> Hee is wont to ſay, <hi>Let him that hath an eare, hear what
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57074:128"/>
the ſpirit ſaith:</hi> but here he ſaith, <hi>Let him tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hath underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
count the number of the Beaſt.</hi> And it is alſo neceſſary for
him, not of neceſſity to ſalvation, <hi>without which a man cannot
be ſaved,</hi> but <hi>(neceſſitate precepti)</hi> neceſſary in regard of Gods
command: Now becauſe there are none of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
that are vaine things, but weighty, therefore they are
either <hi>very neceſſary to ſalvation, or very expedient:</hi> ſo that a
man ſhall be much weakened in his ſpiritual progreſſe, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Popiſh times, or in ſuch times where men live in the
Image of Popiſh Churches, National or Dioceſan,) if he be
ignorant thereof, he ſhall finde it to be much expedient to
count the number of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>And further I adde, it will be found to be but <hi>the number of
a man:</hi> What is the meaning of that? I will not trouble you
with variety of interpretations, briefly the number of a man:
I ſuppoſe it is here oppoſed to that which ye read of in <hi>Rev.</hi>
21. 17. where he tels us, <hi>The new Jeruſalem was meaſured, an
hundred and fourty and four cubits, according to the meaſure of a
man,</hi> that is of the Angel: here he doth not ſay ſo, <hi>the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a man,</hi> that is of the Angel: but it is the number of a
meere man, a carnal man, and therefote in ſum this number
wil proove but an humane invention, it is therefore called <hi>the
number of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finally, he ſaith this number is <hi>ſix hundred threeſcore and
ſix.</hi> Six hundred ſixty ſix is not in the Original in ſo many
words, onely three greek letters are put for theſe three num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now it is true in the Greek account they do
reckon numbers by the letters of the Alphabet, and from the
firſt letter <hi>Alpha</hi> to <hi>Iota,</hi> they are for ſingular units, for <hi>Alpha</hi>
is one, and <hi>Beta</hi> is two, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they put in <hi>Sigma</hi> and make
that ſix, <hi>Iota</hi> is the tenth letter, and ſo is ten in number; and
from <hi>Iota</hi> to <hi>Rho,</hi> they are reckoned by tens, as <hi>Cappa</hi> is twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Lambda</hi> thirty, <hi>Mu</hi> fourty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo till you come to
<hi>Rho</hi> and that is one hundred, and then the reſt that follow
are ſo many multiplied, as <hi>Sigma</hi> is two hundred, <hi>Tau</hi> three
hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſix hundred. So that if theſe be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
as holding out the numbers, as here the words expreſſe,
then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſix hundred, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſixty, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſix; which being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57074:129"/>
together they make up ſix hundred ſixty ſix.</p>
               <p>Now a man would wonder that the holy Ghoſt ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in ſuch Arithmetical riddles; but ſince it pleaſeth him
thus to expreſſe himſelfe, we muſt not look at it as a cabaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
curioſity, nor as an unſearchable myſtery: but they
that labour herein, ſhall finde that which may ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others: For though by the arme of fleſh no man
ſhall be ſtrong, yet by the wiſdome of God the ſervants of
Chriſt ſhall ſee light, and babes ſhall ſee the myſtery of it.
Therefore to cleare up this point, ſo far as God ſhall give
light, conſider with me I pray you ſix or ſeven ſeveral obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
paſſages of the holy ſtory of the <hi>Revel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lp
us in ſome meaſure in enquiring and counting this ſum of <hi>ſix
hundred three ſcore and ſix,</hi> what it may point at. Let it not be
weariſome to you; for though to us that are Miniſters, we
think we are moſt properly in our element when we preack
Chriſt, and the need of Chriſt; yet foraſmuch as Antichriſt is
oppoſed to Chriſt, and is an enemy to Chriſt, the one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
may be the better known by the other, and no part of
Scripture but is worthy our conſideration, we may not be ſo
ſquemiſh as to neglect to ſeek what may be the councel of the
holy Ghoſt in this point. Obſerve therefore what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth obſerve about this number.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſhall obſerve this, to finde out the meaning;
that ſuch as have this number they all have liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
either in the Catholick Roman Church or in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of that Church; they may trade with them, whether in
ſpiritual or temporal buſineſſes, they will not grudge you;
you are a currant market man among them; you are a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
commodity, and you may paſſe with them, and your
mony is good ſilver, as in <hi>Verſe</hi> 16, 17. But if you be not a
Preiſt of their order, nor a Roman Catholick, nor have
his number, you may not buy, nor ſell; that is ſomething
then.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Marke this, that this number of the name is the
degree of commerce with the Roman Catholick Church, for
ſo he doth diſcend, <hi>Verſe 17. No man may buy or ſell but thoſe
that have the marke, or the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57074:129"/>
name:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, they were of the loweſt, they were
the leaſt ſort of them, yet to them it did pertaine that had
the number of the name: yet there is ſo much real difference
between them, that he ſaith plainly, <hi>They that receive the mark
or his name, they ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation: And
they ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the
holy Angels, and in preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoak of their
torment ſhall aſcend up for ever and ever, and they ſhall have no reſt
day nor night,</hi> Rev. 14. 9, 10, 11. Which ſhews if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in it, they cannot be ſaved: There was a cry of the Angel
with a loud voyce, <hi>If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image,
and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, &amp;c.</hi> It ſhews
the danger is very great to receive the mark of the Beaſt or the
name of the Beaſt: But the number of his name I do not
read of any ſuch judgement pronounced to be inflicted upon
them: though it be great wiſdome to avoyd it, and it will
wonderfully advance their heavenly good to get free from
it: For wherein lies wiſdome but in attaining our cheife
good, and to know the beſt means that leads to that good, &amp;
that is in communion with God in his Ordinances purely
diſpenced; that is a ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is this recorded of this number of the name,
that the choiceſt chriſtians and the beſt chriſtians, they gave
God thanks for victory over the number as well as over the
Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 15. 2. They got victory over the Beaſt, and over his
Image, and over his marke, and over the number of his name, ſo that
they ſung the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the
Lamb, ſaying, great and marvellous are thy works Lord God almighty,
&amp;c.</hi>
They had got the victory over the number of the name
of the Beaſt, and they are more abundant in thankſgiving for
deliverance, then they that had onely victory over the marke,
and that is their Preiſtly order or profeſſion of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion; ſo that this will come neare ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
conformed to the Image of the Beaſt, that is, National,
Dioceſan, or Cathedrall Churches; but theſe have got victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over that, not onely over the Beaſt and his Image, and his
mark, and his name, but alſo the number of his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:57074:130"/>
The fourth obſervable thing in Scripture is (I am occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to gather up little bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of wiſdome which the holy
Ghoſt hath ſcattred that ſo we may gather up this account)
that this number of his name is not ſaid to be the number of
his years; It is neither the number of his years when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
nor the number of his years when he ſhall end: They
cannot make it the beginning of his years; for though there
be ſome that thought that Antichriſt did firſt ariſe to a name
in the year 606. yet they cannot cleare it by ſtory. It is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in 606. or rather 604. <hi>Boniface</hi> took upon him the title
of cheif Biſhop, that is, ſpiritual advancing, which was a part
of Antichriſt, yet Antichriſt was begun; and 606 is not 666.
there is 60. years difference; and it is like the holy Ghoſt
would not have varied ſo much in ſuch an expreſſe number,
therefore this number is not for the time of the beginning of
this beaſt. Neither is it the end of his years, for the beaſt
continues ſtill to this time, which hath been almoſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years ſince 666. But ſome ſay in this round number,
ſomething is omitted, as when we ſay 88. we mean 1588. yet
in Scripture phraſe ſuch ſmall numbers are not regarded, we
ſpeak to thoſe that know what we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But the Scripture requires us to uſe wiſdome in finding
out this number: but what wiſdome were it for the holy
Ghoſt to leave out a thouſand, as we leave out when we ſay
88. for 1500. the holy Ghoſt doth not ſo here. And beſides,
I would faine learn of any man of that judgement, what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
the Saints got, either the year when Antichriſt began, or
when he ſhall end. What victory have we got? or ſhall no
body conflict with this number of the beaſt but thoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the year 666? or that ſhall live in the year 1666? In
<hi>Rev. 15. 2. They got victory over the Beaſt and his Image, and over
his name and number of his name, before the pouring out of the ſeven
vials;</hi> So that I cannot ſay this is the number of the period of
the beaſt, that thoſe are the number of his name.</p>
               <p>And for a fifth thing, there is this further to be obſerved in
it, that it is not the number of the followers of the beaſt, but
the number of the beaſt: If it were the number of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

Lamb; for they are ſaid to be <hi>an hundred fourty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi>
in <hi>Chap</hi> 14. 1. And had the beaſt had no more but 666.
then he had a leſſe number to fight for him, then the Lamb
had to fight for him: but in <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. of this chapter, he tels
you, <hi>All that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names
are not written in the Lambs book of life:</hi> And the world was
never ſo hapy, as to leave but 666. reprobates in it in any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
therefore that cannot be the meaning.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whereas he ſaith, this number is the number of a
man, and the number is <hi>ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix,</hi> he doth
apparently put a difference between that and the name of the
beaſt; for hee doth expreſly diſtinguiſh them in the former
verſe, for he ſaith, <hi>The marke of the Beaſt, and the name, and the
number of his name, Verſe</hi> 17. They are three diſtinct things:
So in <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 2. where he ſaith, <hi>They got victory over the beaſt
and his Image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name:</hi>
And more yet, expreſly in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 9, 10, 11. He denouceth
vengence to them that receive his mark or name, and yet not
damnation to all that receive his number; ſo that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is not his name, it is a diſtinct thing from the name, as
the adjunct is from the ſubject. Then it will follow, me
thinks (but I referre it to men of better judgement) it cannot
be that either <hi>Latinus</hi> ſhould be the number of the name, or
<hi>(Eccleſia Catholica)</hi> the Roman Catholick Church; yet upon
theſe points do our chief and late Expoſiters run: But (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them their due honour) it doth not ſatisfie me, becauſe
<hi>Eccleſia Catholica</hi> is the name of the firſt beaſt; and the name is
one thing, and the number is another thing. And <hi>Latinus</hi> is
one of the names of the ſecond beaſt, of <hi>Latinus Epiſcopus,</hi> the
name of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore it being his name, it is
not the number of his name: So then all theſe things be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
theſe obſervations being laid down, attend to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
obſervation for the clearing of the meaning of the text,
and for opening the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>Obſerve this,</p>
               <p>7. That this number is expreſly oppoſite to the number of
the Lamb in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> in the following <hi>Chapter:</hi> The
number of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is one thing, and the number of the <hi>Lamb</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:57074:131"/>
is another thing: For enough this be not the number of the
Beaſts followers, <hi>ſixe hundred threeſcore and ſixe,</hi> yet it is the
number of the Beaſt; and the number of the Lambs followers
<hi>is an hundred forty &amp; foure thouſand,</hi> what will that hold forth?
You ſhall find what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> intends expreſly in that
number in ſome other parts of this book, that this <hi>hundred
forty and foure thouſand</hi> hath his originall and riſe from 12.
And 12. multiplyed by 12. will ariſe from ſo many <hi>ſcores</hi> to
ſo many <hi>hundreds,</hi> and 12. times <hi>twelve-thouſand</hi> is <hi>an hundred
forty and foure thouſand.</hi> So that that is the number of <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
forty and foure thouſand,</hi> the baſis of the number is 12. and
multiplyed by 12. it will ſtill be derived into the ſame 12.
Now thus doth the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> lead us by the hand to conſider
of more diſtinctly; In <hi>Rev</hi> 12. 14. 16. He tells us, <hi>The walls
of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the
twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb, and the City lyeth foure-ſquare, and
the length is as broad as the breadth, &amp;c.</hi> He meaſured the City
with the read, 12000. furlongs, the length, and the breadth,
and the height of it are equall. There he layes the number
according to the number of the 12. Apoſtles, the foundation
of the Church of the living God: And further, ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k how he
multiplies on that 12. ſaith he, <hi>They are all equall, twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
furlongs in breadth, twelve thouſand furlongs in length, twelve
thouſand furlongs in height:</hi> Which argueth ſtill, that as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is built upon them, ſo it is multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
from them: And when he comes to meaſure the wall,
he tells you in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. that <hi>it was an hundred forty and foure:</hi>
Juſt the Lambs company; Still the whole Fabrick of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
is 12. the foundation of the number is Apoſtolicall, it is
numbred by 12. and multiplyed by 12. It ariſeth ſtill but to
Apoſtolical ſimplicity, their number, and their meaſure, and
their order, in all their dementions; when you have ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it up to the higheſt, their Laws and Orders that they ſet
up, you ſhall finde 12. there, and you ſhall finde no more.
Now then what is the number of the Beaſt? You ſee what the
Lambs number is, <hi>An hundred forty and foure thouſand:</hi> what is
the Beaſts number? <hi>It is ſixe hundred threeſcore and ſixe,</hi> it falls
ſhort in the beginning, ſixe of the firſt 12. There is nothing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57074:131"/>
Apoſtolical in it from the firſt riſe: And as the riſe is not the
Apoſtolicall number, and conſtitution, ſo neither is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of it, for ſix is not multiplyed by 12. but by ten;
for ſixe unites being multiplyed by tenne, make 60. and ten
times ſixty is 600. So all the multiplications is by ten, not
by 12. the Apoſtolick number is not here. It is true, 666.
runs roundly, and hath a comely proportion in it; where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and eaſie to remember; 144. is not ſo round a number,
neither for apprehenſion, nor for memory. But yet wee are
not at the bottome: What ſhould be the reaſon that the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt</hi> ſhould fingle out the number ſixe, and multiply it by
ten? why doth the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> put it upon ſixe? Seven had bin
no Apoſtolical number, nor 10. multiplyed by 20. But why
doth the <hi>H. Ghoſt</hi> pitch upon ſixe, and the multiplication of
ſixe by ten? Why you that are converſant in the Latine Bible
look <hi>Junius</hi> his notes, and he tells you; whereas all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church</hi> was formerly governed by five books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls,
<hi>Boniface</hi> he did compile a ſixth book of Decretalls,
and called it <hi>Sextus</hi> (you that have the book of Canons may
finde it) which being (ſaid the Pope) a perfect number, and
therefore being added to the former books of Decretalls, it
maketh up a certain plat-form of direction for all matters of
practice and manners in the diſcipline of the Church, and ſo
it is a perfect number of all things to be done in the Church,
both for doctrine, worſhip, and government: ſo the Popes
Canons are ſummed up in his <hi>Sextus,</hi> there is the reaſon why
he makes ſixe the foundation; all their Adminiſtrations are
founded and meaſured out from their Canon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Lawes, which
are all wrapped up in ſix volumes, and the ſixth is the moſt
compleat of them all.</p>
               <p>Now if you will aske why this ſixe comes to be multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ten? If ye obſerve it, all the government and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the <hi>Roman State</hi> is by tenths, by tithes; all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt give the <hi>tenth</hi> to the Prieſt, and the Prieſt to the
Biſhop for the mayntenance of the <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> and ſo
the whole Government comes to be multiplyed, maintained,
and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:57074:132"/>
Thus you ſee what the number is, and the reaſon why the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> calls it ſo, and how he doth oppoſe it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
number of that which is delivered by the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and followed by the holy Saints of God from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to another. Put then all theſe together, and all
will amount to this; That whereas the number of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which both his followers are built, and his <hi>Church,</hi> and
all the Dimentions and Adminiſtrations of it: Their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
their gates, their <hi>length, heighth,</hi> and <hi>breadth,</hi> all of
them are founded in the Apoſtolicall doctrine: For <hi>Chriſt
prayed for his twelve Apoſtles, and all that ſhould believe in his name
through their word,</hi> John 17. 20. It is the comprehenſion of
all Saints to the end of the world, whereas they are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Apoſtolicall ſimplicity, both for their <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church-adminiſtrations,</hi>
they are all built upon <hi>twelve,</hi> and multiplyed
and enlarged by 12.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, all the <hi>Roman Catholickes</hi> they are built
upon the Popiſh Lawes and Decrees, all which require ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Popiſh Church, and ſubmiſſion to that <hi>Church,</hi>
and to the Pope as the head of that <hi>Church,</hi> receiving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

that was founded in ſixe, on the ſixe books of their Decrees,
and it is multiplyed according to the ſame books, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn
all the Clergy, from the Pope to the loweſt Pariſh prieſt:
And it is wiſdome to find this out, and it requires heavenly
wiſdome to ſee the dangerous ſtate of this, and yet they that
have wiſdome may finde this out; and when they ſearch it
out, <hi>They will finde it but the number of a man, not of the Angel,
or of the Apoſtles, or of any meſſenger of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember the ſpeech of one of the Saints of God,<note place="margin">Parker.</note> That it
is a moſt unworthy thing that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be
governed by the Lawes of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (and ſuch were all their
ſixe books) and it is moſt unworthy, that both the Church
it ſelfe, and all the Images of it, that they are all governed by
theſe ſixe bookes; and it is moſt unworthy that Antichriſt
ſhould govern all the Adminiſtrations of the Church; that
if a man be cited, it ſhall be by a Latine writ; and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
he ſhall be proceeded againſt according to Canon
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57074:132"/>
Lawes; and if he be cenſured, it ſhall be a Canon Law, and in
<hi>Latine,</hi> and ſo ſhall his Abſolution be; and what pertayns to
their whole government, it is but founded in theſe ſixe books
of Decretals, and count them, and you ſhall find them but the
number of a man; nothing but meerly the wit and policy of
men, either to keep unity as they ſay (but tyranny in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
or to enrich men with fees, or maintayne the honour
of ſome Cathedrall perſon, it is all but meer humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now for a man to ſee not only the <hi>Roman Catholicke
viſible Church</hi> to be a Beaſt, but that the Pope the head of it is a
beaſt, and the image of that Church is a beaſt; Dioceſan, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall,
Nationall, and Metropolitan Churches are but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of this great beaſt, and to ſee all the numbers and rights
they thruſt upon the Church by Canons, they are but the
number of the beaſt, the number of a man, humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
what is appointed by the Church, whether Croſſe or
Surplice, or kneeling at the Sacrament, they are but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of Canons, Canon multiplyed on Canon, but it
is ſtill but the power of the Canon, this is great wiſdome to
find it out: And it behooves thoſe that have wiſdome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it; and they that conſider it, ſhall find it but a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
device, one as well as another; and they will conſider
which way the <hi>State</hi> goes, and which way the <hi>State</hi> leanes:
Though ſome poor hearts think they are bound to obey the
Lawes of the Kingdom, and ſome good ſouls many times will
be tampering with them too much; but he that ſhall obſerve
it, ſhall find it but the number of a man when he doth find it:
He ſhall find thus much, that if he do believe as God is wont

have born witneſſe againſt the Hierarchy and the papall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but may we not hearken to the Canon of the
Church maintained by a whole National Councel? and may
we not yield to the orders of theſe Canons, and beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the number of the Name? Suppoſe the Croſs, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
or kneeling at the the Sacrament, many Chriſtians have
ſtrong reaſonings about this, that they may keep their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

have mercy and not ſacrifice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though ſuch Godly chriſtians in their weakneſſe have ſuch
reaſonings, yet beleive it we are to bleſſe God that hath given
us to ſee that there is no correſpondency to be kept with
<hi>Rome:</hi> If you have the number of his name, this is not that
which the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of as damnable hereſie, you may
live and dye in that judgment, and be ſaved, therefore he doth
not pronounce fire and brimſtone to ſuch; they think in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
they may yeild to this and that, as being the command
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or of the Church; <hi>the Lord ſpare you</hi> as the Apoſtle
ſaith; But if a man will adore the Roman Catholick Church
or the Pope the head of it, and ſubmit in conſcience to be
guided by their Laws, he renounces his ſalvation in ſuch a
caſe; that a man ſhall pin his faith upon the Churches ſleeve,
and his hope, and Government, and courſe of life on the
Churches ſleeve, this is the way to everlaſting damnation:
And therefore in thoſe Churches that are even Images of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
it pleaſeth God to keep his ſervants ſo far, that they
dare not take all their Laws for doctrine without queſtion,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57074:133"/>
nor all the ways of their Government as the Government of
Chriſt, that God opens all the hearts of his faithful ſervants
to ſee: But yet for the number of his name; It is (ſay they)
but a few trifling things, they are made a matter of ſix, as
Croſſe, and Surplice, and kneeling at the Sacrament, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Altars, and the name of Jeſus, and ye will have ſix in
the end, and what will be multiplyed on that ſix, the Lord
knows: But for you here, look at it as a ſpecial mercy, that
you ſee the vanity of receiving the number of his name, and
that you have this deliverance from it; that though you have
loſt your buying and ſelling, that if you were there, you
might hardly be ſeen in the Market, and in many of thoſe

them, or they receive them; and though they cut of his head
for ſaith, yet for diſcipline, and order, and circumſtances they

It will not be ſafe for ye to receive the Image of any other

you ſhall have liberty of buying and ſelling, of traffique

that way; yet believe it, it is a ſpecial part of your wiſdome
to know this, and the danger of it. If a man in his ignorance
ſhall yeild to theſe things, God will pardon it; but if a man
know theſe things, and willingly give way to them, the Lord
will require it at his hands: Conſider therefore this number,

of the Churches of God, and adminiſtration of things
here, though we faile and go aſide, we have the rule to ſhew us
the way back againe:) I ſay when you are gone, go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will, you will have much ado to finde materials, and
more ado to finde forme and adminiſtration: as that it may
be in cold blood, you will fit and mourn by the waters of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi>

Therefore let it provoke us to hold faſt what we have received
and not to be taken off with faire pretences, to turne aſide to
one hand or the other; if we be in a ſtate of wiſdome, let us
keep in it, and beleive it, whatever takes you to a contrary

is wiſedome, then I am ſure the contrary of it muſt needs be

eye to our brethren in our native Country, to conſider thoſe
defects that thoſe which reformed religion before us did leave
in the recovery of the Country out of the jaws of Antichriſt;
(you ſee what the Lord requires of us, that we ſhould have
nothing to do with the number of the Beaſt) Though they
cut off the head of the Beaſt, from being of any ſoveraign po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to them, yet they took too much liberty for forme of
worſhip, and for the number of the Popes name, and of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by Canon Laws, yea the whole Church diſcipline
by the Popiſh Canon Law, onely with this deſtinction, that
whereas the Pope enjoyed it before, now the King he claims
headſhip over the Church aſwel as the civil State, and he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Church-power to the chief Biſhops, and they worke
upon it more and more; and though it be true, both <hi>Henery</hi>
the eighth, and much more <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
all theſe did ſet ſo many Councellors, ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and ſo many common and civil Lawyers to cull out of
the Popes Decretals ſuch Canons as were moſt fit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and moſt of ſuch as cut off Popiſh ſupremacy, yet they
could never agree of it, and ſo they admit them as the Popes
Canons only; yet ſo that whereas reference of Eccleſiaſtical
matters was to the Pope, now it is to the King as ſupream
head and Governour, but the Popes Canons are the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. Now what was the reaſon? There was
an unſafe principle in their hearts, that they thought it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to take the Laws of the Roman Church, and that any
King might have power to make Laws to govern the Church,
as well as the Pope had. It is true, he hath power to make
Lawes as well as the Pope had, and better; but the truth is,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57074:135"/>
neither the Pope, nor King hath power to make Laws to rule
the Church, but it muſt be by the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is not of the number of 12. is ſuperadded, and
will never proſper; but this principle making them willing
to admit ſuch things, though they were the chiefeſt of the
Kingdome, that were appointed for that worke, yet they could
never agree: But had they received a little more light and
wiſdome to cut off the number of the Beaſt aſwel as his head,
it would have prevailed for the liberty of Gods Ordinances
and purity of Doctrine: I ſay this being wanting to them,
let it not be wanting to us; but through the mercy of God,
the ſervants of God have taken no ſmall paines to clear up
ſuch things; what the Laws are in the Church of Chriſt by
which Magiſtrates and others are to be guided, how far civil
Government may reach, and how farre it may not go, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
this fundamental principle, to hold them cloſe to the
direction of the holy Ghoſt by the 12. Apoſtles; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pious care of our Magiſtrates, and of the Churches,
this wiſdome will by the bleſſing of God be eſtabliſhed; that
that which other Nations have not attained to this day, may
by the bleſſing of God be reached by us: and yet though the
Elders are to enquire and to commend to them ſuch rules as
may eſtabliſh it, it pleaſeth God not to give as yet paſſage to
our purpoſes; appoint one day, a ſtorme of raine hinders; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the ſecond day fortnight, then a ſtorme of ſnow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
that it is tough work to eſtabliſh things of this nature;
it is difficult, as if the Lord would have them eſtabliſhed in a
ſpirituall way, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the Law by 40. dayes faſting, he had
the ſpirit of God and larger meaſure by much then we, yet
the Lord requires ſerious humiliation of him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince I heard that there hath been a ſeaſonable motion to
commend ſuch a thing to the State that the whole country
do in ſpecial maner ſeek God at ſuch a time againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
of the general Court; and this weighty point fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in for ripening of mens thoughts for the Laws of the
Country and limitation of juriſdictions both of Church and
Common-wealth, the Lord ſaith, <hi>he will be ſought unto by the
houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Therefore I think the motion is ſeaſonable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57074:136"/>
and was glad to hear of it; and thought to commend it to our
honoured Governours that ſit at <hi>Stern,</hi> and all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(but we that are preſent have no power but in our own
Church, nor that but with the conſent of the Church) that if
it be thought convenient this day ſeven-night might be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to ſeek the face of God, that we may take time both to
ripen our conſultations, and to prevaile with the Lord to
proſper our conſultations and adminiſtrations, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which ſo much concerns poſterity may be eſtabliſhed;
for my own part, while we live I am not greatly ſolicitous
thereabout, yet for future we know not what Governors may
ariſe, and what may be put upon our poſterity; needful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that things were put in a right frame, that whatever
men ſay, yet the Lord may ſay here is wiſdome, and here is
neither marke, nor name, nor number of name, but all carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the laws of the 12. Apoſtles, and this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

days, we much more of one day. And for our native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
we do not know what conflicts there may be there about
the number of the name of the Beaſt; we are come from them
in bodily preſence, and therefore cannot helpe them by a
word of advice; but this we may do, put up ſupplications to
heaven, and we may intreat the God of wiſdome, and the
Prince of peace, that he would put in amongſt them that they
may ſee the whole fabrick, root and branch of the man of ſin,
that ſo there may be a perfect combination of the two great
Nations, that the Parliament may be for the better, not for
the worſe, but purity of ordinances (if it be the bleſſed will
of God) may be eſtabliſhed; however we ſhall finde a bleſſing,
and ſome of our brethren ſhall fare the better: and if things
wax clearer and zeal warmer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will begin to ſuſpect the
number as well as the name, and as the head of the beaſt; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the three innocent ceremonies (as they call them)
they are grown to ſix; and being multiplyed by ten, they may
grow to 60. yea to 600. for ought I know: Let us help them
what we can by Prayer.</p>
