            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For Magick it ſelf, which the ancients did ſo divinely contemplate, is ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with bearing the badge of all diabolical ſorceries: which Art (ſaith <hi>Mirandula) Pauci intelligunt, multi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendunt, &amp; ſicut canes ignotos ſemper allatrant:</hi> Few underſtand, many reprehend; and as dogs barke at thoſe they know not: ſo do many condemne and hate the things they underſtand not. Many men there are, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the very name and word <hi>Magus,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who being indeed not <hi>Magus,</hi> but <hi>Goes,</hi> that is, familiar with evil Spirits, uſurped that Title. But Magick and Witchcraft are far differing Sciences;<note place="margin">

Now Witchraft and Sorcery are workes done meerely by the devill, which with reſpect unto ſame covenant made with man, he acteth by men his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to accompliſh his evil ends: of theſe, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all ages, people and countries, as alſo the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, afford us ſundry examples.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Magus</hi> is a Perſian word primitively, whereby is expreſt ſuch a one as is altogether converſant in things
<pb facs="tcp:93270:3"/>
divine, and as <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, the art of Magick is the art of worſhipping God: and the Perſians called their gods <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hence <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Magus</hi> is either <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, that <hi>Magus</hi> is either a name ſometime of him that is a god by nature, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of him that is in the ſervice of God: in which latter ſence it is taken <hi>Matth. 2.1, 2.</hi> when the wiſe-men came to worſhip Jeſus; and this is the firſt and higheſt kinde, which is called divine Magick; and theſe the Latines did intitle <hi>Sapientes,</hi> or wiſe-men; for the fear and worſhip of God is the beginning of knowledge. Theſe wiſe-men the Greeks call <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> and amongſt the Egyptians they were termed <hi>Prieſts:</hi> The Hebrews termed them <hi>Cabali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos,</hi> Prophets, Scribes and Phariſces; and amongſt the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians they were differenced by the name of <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and by the Perſians called <hi>Magicians:</hi> and one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> one of the ancient Magicians, uſeth theſe words: <hi>Et verum Deum merita majeſtate proſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; angelos miniſtros Dei, ſed veri ejus venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni novit aſſiſtere; idem daemonas prodit terrenos, vagos, humanitatis inimicos: Soſthenes</hi> aſcribeth the due Majeſty to the true God, and acknowledgeth that his Angels are miniſters and meſſengers which attend the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God; he alſo hath delivered, that there are devils earthly and wandering, and enemies to mankind.</p>
            <p>So that the word <hi>Magus</hi> of it ſelf imports a Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of divine and heavenly Sciences; but under the name of <hi>Magick,</hi> are all unlawful Arts comprehended; as Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy and Witchraft, and ſuch Arts which are effected by <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">

<pb facs="tcp:93270:3"/>
do indeed uſe the help of the devill himſelf to do miſchief; practiſing to mix the powder of dead bodies with other things by the help of the devill prepared; and at other times to make Pictures of wax, clay; or otherwiſe (as it were <hi>Sacramentaliter)</hi> to effect thoſe things which the devil by other means bringeth to paſs. Such were, and to this day partly, if not altogether, are the corruptions that have made odious the very name of Magick, having chiefly ſought, as the manner of all Impoſtures is, to counterfeit the higheſt and moſt noble part of it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond kinde of Magick is Aſtrologie, which judgeth of the events of things to come, natural and humane, by the motions and influences of the Stars upon theſe lower ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, by them obſerv'd and underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> affirmeth, that by this part of Magick or Aſtrologie, together with the motions of the Stars and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heavenly bodies, <hi>Abraham</hi> found out the knowledge of the true God while he lived in <hi>Caldea, Qui Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platione Creaturarum, cognovit Creatorem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Damaſcen)</hi> who knew the Creator by the contemplation of the creature. <hi>Joſephus</hi> reporteth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he inſtructed the Egyptians in Arithmetick and Aſtronomy; who before <hi>Abraham's</hi> coming unto them, knew none of theſe Sciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham ſanctitate &amp; ſapientia omnium prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſſimus, primum Caldaeos, deinde Phoenices, demum Egyptios Sacerdotes, Aſtrologia &amp; Divina docuerit. Abraham</hi> the holieſt and wiſeſt of men, did firſt teach the Caldeans, then the Phoenicians, laſtly the Egyptian Prieſts, Aſtrologie and divine knowledge.</p>
            <p>Without doubt, <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> that divine Magician and Philoſopher, who (as ſome ſay) lived long before <hi>Noah,</hi> attained to much divine knowledge of the
<pb facs="tcp:93270:4"/>
Creator through the ſtudy of Magick and Aſtrologie; as his Writings, to this day extant among us, teſtifie.</p>
            <p>The third kinde of Magick containeth the whole Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of Nature; which bringeth to light the inmoſt vertues, and extracteth them out of Natures hidden boſome to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane uſe: <hi>Virtutes in centro centri latentes;</hi> Vertues hidden in the centre of the Centre, according to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts: of this ſort were <hi>Albertus, Arnoldus de Villa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Raymond, Bacon,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magick theſe men profeſs'd, is thus defined: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia eſt connexio à viro ſapiente agentium per natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram cum patientibus, ſibi, congruenter reſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ut inde opera prodeant, non ſine corum admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione qui cauſam ignorant.</hi> Magick is the connexion of natural agents and patients, anſwerable each to other, wrought by a wiſe man; to the bringing forth of ſuch effects as are wonderful to thoſe that know not their cauſes.</p>
            <p>In all theſe, <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> was well learned, eſpecially in the firſt and the higheſt: for in his Oracles he confeſſeth God to be the firſt and the higheſt; he believeth the Trinity, which he would not inveſtigate by any natural knowledge: he ſpeaketh of Angels, and of Paradiſe; approveth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul; teacheth Truth, Faith, Hope, and Love; diſcourſing of the abſtinence and charity of the <hi>Magi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Zoroaſter, Euſebius</hi> in the Theologie of the Phoenicians, uſing <hi>Zoroaſter's</hi> own words: <hi>Haec ad ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ſcribit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Euſebius) Deus primus, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilium, ſempiternus, ingenitus, expers partium, ſibiipſi ſimillimus, bonorum omnium auriga, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera non expectans, optimus, prudentiſſimus, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juris, ſine doctrina juſtitiam perdoctus, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra perfectus, ſapiens, ſacrae naturae unicus inventor,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93270:4"/>
&amp;c. Thus ſaith <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> word for word; God the firſt, incorruptible, everlaſting, unbegotten, without parts, moſt like himſelf, the guide of all good, expecting no reward, the beſt, the wiſeſt, the father of right, having learned juſtice without teaching, perfect, wiſe by nature, and onely inventor thereof.</p>
            <p>So that a Magician is no other but <hi>divinorum cultor &amp; interpres,</hi> a ſtudious obſerver and expounder of divine things; and the Art it ſelf is none other <hi>quam Naturalis Philoſophiae abſoluta conſummatio,</hi> then the abſolute perfection of Natural Philoſophy. Nevertheleſs there is a mixture in all things, of good with evil, of falſhood with truth, of corruption with purity. The good, the truth, the purity in every kinde, may well be embraced: As in the ancient worſhipping of God by Sacrifice, there was no man knowing God among the Elders, that did forbeare to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the God of all power, or condemn that kinde of Worſhip, becauſe the devil was ſo adored in the Image of <hi>Baal, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Aſtaroth, Chemoſh, Jupiter, Apollo,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Neither did the abuſe of Aſtrologie terrifie <hi>Abraham,</hi> (if we believe the moſt ancient and religious Writers) from obſerving the motions and natures of the heavenly bodies. Neither can it dehort wiſe and learned men in theſe days from attributing thoſe vertues, influences, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the ſtars and other Lights of heaven, which God hath given to thoſe his glorious creatures.</p>
            <p>I muſt expect ſome calumnies and obtrectations againſt this, from the malicious prejudiced man, and the lazie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecters of Ignorance, of whom this age ſwarmes: but the voice and ſound of the Snake and the Gooſe, is all one. But our ſtomacks are not now ſo queazie and tender, after ſo

            <p>But I incite the Reader to a charitable opinion hereof, with a Chriſtian Proteſtation of an innocent purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and intreat the Reader to follow this advice of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus, Qui litigant, ſint ambo in conſpectu tuo mali &amp; rei.</hi> And if there be any ſcandal in this enterpriſe of mine, it is taken, not given.

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93270:9"/>Now we proceed to declare with what Planets theſe Figures are diſtributed; for hereupon all the propriety and nature of Figures, and the judgement of the whole Art dependeth: Therefore the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer Fortune</hi> are aſcribed to the Sun; but the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>greater Fortune</hi> is when the Sun is diuenal, and poſited in his dignities; the other, or <hi>leſſer Fortune,</hi> is when the Sun is nocturnall, or placed in leſſe dignities. <hi>Via,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus</hi> (that is, the Way, and People) are referred to the Moon; the firſt from her beginning and encreaſing, the ſecond from her full light and quarter decreaſing. <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> and <hi>Laetitia</hi> (which is Gain, Profit; Joy and Gladneſs) are of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> But the firſt hath <hi>Jupiter</hi> the <hi>greater Fortune,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>leſſe,</hi> but without detriment. <hi>Puella</hi> &amp; <hi>Amiſſio</hi> are of <hi>Venus;</hi> the firſt fortunate, the other (as it were) retrograde, or combuſt. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctio</hi> &amp; <hi>Albus</hi> are both Figures of <hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp; are both good; but the firſt the more Fortunate. <hi>Puer</hi> &amp; <hi>Rubeus</hi> are Figures aſcribed to <hi>Mars;</hi> the firſt whereof hath <hi>Mars</hi> benevolent, the ſecond malevolent. <hi>Carcer</hi> &amp; <hi>Triſtitia</hi> are both Figures of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> &amp; both evil; but the firſt of the greater detriment. The Dragons head and Dragons tayl do follow their own natures.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the infallible compariſons of the Figures, and from theſe we may eaſily diſcern the equality of their ſignes; therefore the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer Fortunes</hi> have the ſigne of <hi>Leo,</hi> which is the Houſe of the Sun: <hi>Via</hi> &amp; <hi>Populus</hi> have the ſigne of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is the Houſe of the Moon: <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> hath for his ſigne <hi>Piſces;</hi> &amp; <hi>Laetitia Sagittary,</hi> which are both the Houſes of <hi>Jupiter: Puella</hi> hath the ſigne of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> of <hi>Libra,</hi> which are the Houſes of <hi>Venus: Conjunctio</hi> hath for its ſigne <hi>Virgo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Albus</hi> the ſigne <hi>Gemini,</hi> the Houſes of <hi>Mercury: Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> have for their ſigne <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the Houſe of <hi>Mars: Carcer</hi> hath the ſigne <hi>Capricorn,</hi> &amp; <hi>Triſtitia Aquary,</hi> the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Saturn:</hi> The Dragons head and tail are thus divided, the head to <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the Dragons tail adhereth to <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and from hence you may eaſily obtain the Triplicities of theſe ſignes, after the manner of the Triplicities of the ſignes of the Zodiack: <hi>Puer</hi> therefore, both <hi>Fortunes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Laetitia,</hi> do govern the fiery Triplicity; <hi>Puella, Conjunctio, Carcer,</hi> and the Dragons

head, the earthly Triplicity: <hi>Albus, Amiſſio,</hi> &amp; <hi>Triſtitia,</hi> do make the Airy Triplicity: &amp; <hi>Via, Populus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rubeus,</hi> with the Dragons tail, &amp; <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> do rule the watry Triplicity; &amp; this order is taken according to the courſe or manner of the ſignes.</p>
               <p>But if any will conſtitute theſe Triplicities according to the natures of the Planets, and Figures themſelves, let him obſerve this Rule, that <hi>Fortuna major, Rubeus, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio,</hi> do make the fiery Triplicity: <hi>Fortuna minor, Puella, Laetitia,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctio,</hi> the Triplicity of the Ayr: <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> the Dragons tail: <hi>Via,</hi> &amp; <hi>populus,</hi> do govern the watry Triplicity; and the earthly Triplicity is ruled by <hi>Carcer, Triſtitia, Albus,</hi> and the Dragons head. And this way is rather to be obſerved then the firſt which we have ſet forth; becauſe it is conſtituted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule and manner of the ſignes.</p>
               <p>This order is alſo far more true and rational then that which vulgarly is uſed, which is deſcribed after this manner: of the Fiery Triplicity are, <hi>Cauda, Fortuna minor, Amiſſio,</hi> and <hi>Rube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> of the Airy Triplicity are, <hi>Acquiſitio Laetitia, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctio:</hi> of the watry Triplicity are, <hi>Populus, Via, Albus, Puella:</hi> And <hi>Caput, Fortuna major, Carcer,</hi> and <hi>Triſtitia,</hi> are of the earthly Triplicity.</p>
               <p>They do likewiſe diſtribute theſe figures to the twelve ſignes of the Zodiack, after this manner; <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> is given to <hi>Aries; Fortuna,</hi> both <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> to <hi>Taurus; Laetitia</hi> to the ſigne <hi>Gemini; Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> to <hi>Cancer; Albus</hi> is aſſigned to <hi>Leo, Via</hi> to <hi>Virgo;</hi> the Dragons head, and <hi>Conjunctio</hi> to <hi>Libra; Puer</hi> is ſubmitted to <hi>Scorpio; Triſtitia</hi> and <hi>Amiſſio</hi> are aſſigned to <hi>Sagittary;</hi> the Dragons tail to <hi>Capricorn; Populus</hi> to <hi>Aquarius;</hi> and <hi>Carcer</hi> is aſſigned to the ſigne <hi>Piſces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now we come to ſpeak of the manner of projecting or ſetting down theſe figures, which is thus; that we ſet down the points according to their courſe in four lines, from the right hand toward the left, &amp; this in four courſes: There will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſult unto us four Figures made in four ſeveral lines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the even or uneven marking every ſeveral line; which four Figures are wont to be called <hi>Matres:</hi> which do bring forth the reſt, filling up and compleating the whole Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure

               </figure>
               <p>Of theſe four <hi>Matres</hi> are alſo produced four other ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Figures, which they call <hi>Filiae,</hi> or ſuccedents, which are gathered together after this manner, that is to ſay, by making the four <hi>Matres</hi> according to their order, placing them by courſe one ofter another * *; then that which ſhall reſult out of every line, maketh the Figure of <hi>Filiae,</hi> the order whereof is by deſcending from the ſuperior points through both <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> to the loweſt: as in this example.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93270:11"/>And theſe 8 Figures do make 8 Houſes of Heaven, after this manner, by placing the Figures from the left hand towards the right: as the four <hi>Matres</hi> do make the four firſt Houſes, ſo the four <hi>Filiae</hi> do make the four following Houſes, which are the fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, &amp; eighth: and the reſt of the Houſes are found after this manner; that is to ſay, out of the firſt &amp; ſecond is derived the ninth; out of the third &amp; fourth the tenth; out of the fifth &amp; ſixth the eleventh; &amp; out of the ſeventh &amp; eighth the twelfth: By the combination or joyning together of two Figures according to the rule of the even or uneven number in the remaining points of each Figure. After the ſame manner there are produced out of the laſt four Figures, that is to ſay, of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, &amp; twelfth, two Figures, which they call <hi>Coadjutrices,</hi> or <hi>Teſtes;</hi> out of which two is alſo one conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, which is called the Index of the whole Figure, or thing Queſited: as appeareth in this example following.</p>

               <p>As the former <hi>Matres</hi> doe make the four Angles of an Houſe, the firſt maketh the firſt Angle, the ſecond the ſecond Angle, the third maketh the third Angle, and the fourth the fourth Angle; ſo the four <hi>Filiae</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Matres,</hi> do conſtitute the four ſuccedent Houſes; the firſt maketh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Houſe, the ſecond the eleventh, the third the eighth, and the fourth maketh the firſt Houſe: the reſt of the Houſes, which are Cadents, are to be calculated according to the Rule of their Triplicity; that is to ſay, by making the ninth out of the fourth and fifth, and the ſixth out of the tenth and ſecond, of the ſeventh and eleventh the third, and of the fourth and eighth the twelfth.</p>
               <p>And now you have the whole Figure of true judgement conſtituted according to true and efficacious reaſons, whereby I ſhall ſhew how you ſhall compleat it: the Figure which ſhall be in the firſt Houſe ſhall give you the ſigne aſcending, which the firſt Figure ſheweth; which being done, you ſhall attribute their ſignes to the reſt of their Houſes, according to the order of the ſignes: then in every Houſe you ſhall note the Planets according to the nature of the Figure: then from all theſe you ſhall build your judgement according to the ſignification of the Planets in the ſignes and Houſes wherein they ſhall be found, and according to their aſpects among themſelves, and to the place of the querent and thing queſited; and you ſhall judge according to the natures of the ſignes aſcending in their Houſes, and according to the natures and proprieties of the Figures which they have placed in the ſeverall Houſes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commiſture of other Figures aſpecting them: The Index of the Figure which the Geomancers for the moſt part have made, how it is found in the former Figure.</p>

In the ſecond Houſe, he ſignifies manifeſt riches and manifeſt gain, good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the gaining of any thing loſt or miſ-laid; the taking of a thief, and recovery of things ſtollen.

In the tenth Houſe <hi>Triſtitia</hi> ſignifies Princes to be ſevere, but very good lovers of juſtice; it cauſeth juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but ſuch as are tedious and ſlow in determining of cauſes; bringeth a Mother to a good old age, with Integrity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of life, but mixt with divers diſcommodities and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; it raiſeth to great Offices, but they ſhall not be long enjoyed nor perſevered in; it ſignifies ſuch Offices as do appertain to the water, or tillage, and manuring of the Earth, or ſuch as are to be imployed about matters of Religion and wiſdom. In the eleventh Houſe <hi>Triſtitia</hi> ſignifies ſcarcity of friends, and the death of friends; and alſo ſignifies little love or favour. In the twelfth Houſe it ſheweth no enemies; wretchedly condemneth the impriſoned; and cauſeth many diſcommodities and diſprofits to happen in ones life.</p>

                  <hi>Caput Draconis</hi> in the firſt Houſe augmenteth life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our Books of Occult Philoſophy, we have not ſo compendiouſly, as copiouſly, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the principles, grounds, and reaſons of Magick it ſelf, and after what manner the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments thereof are to be choſen, elected, and compounded, to produce many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects: but becauſe in thoſe books they are treated of, rather Theorically, then Practically; and ſome alſo are not handled compleatly and fully, and others very figuratively, and as it were Enigmatically and obſcure Riddles, as being thoſe which we have obtained unto with great ſtudy, diligence, and very curious ſearching and exploration, and are heretofore ſet forth in a more rude and unfaſhioned maner: Therefore in this book, which we have compoſed and made
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93270:23"/>
as it were a Complement and Key of our other books of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Philoſophy, and of all Magical Operations, we will give unto thee the documents of holy and undefiled verity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable and Unreſiſtable Magical Diſcipline, and the moſt pleaſant and delectable experiments of the ſacred Deities. So that as by the reading of our other books of Occult Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, thou mayeſt earneſtly covet the knowledge of theſe things; even ſo with reading this book, thou ſhalt truly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Wherefore let ſilence hide theſe things within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cloſets of thy religious breſt, and conceal them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Taciturnity.</p>
               <p>This therefore is to be known, That the names of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent preſidents of every one of the Planets are conſtituted after this maner: that is to ſay, By collecting together the letters out of the figure of the world, from the riſing of the body of the planet, according to the ſucceſſion of the Signes through the ſeveral degrees; and out of the ſeveral degrees, from the aſpects of the Planet himſelf, the calculation being made from the degree of the aſcendant. In the like maner are conſtituted the names of the Princes of the evil ſpirits; they are taken under all the Planets of the preſidents in a retrograde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the projection being made contrary to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, from the beginning of the ſeventh Houſe. Now the name of the ſupreme and higheſt Intelligence, which many do ſuppoſe to be the ſoul of the world, is collected out of the four Cardinal points of the figure of the world, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner already delivered: and by the oppoſite and contrary way, is known the name of the great <hi>Daemon,</hi> or evil ſpirit, upon the four cadent angles. In the like manner ſhalt thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the names of the great preſidential ſpirits, ruling in the Air, from the four Angles of the ſuccedent Houſes: ſo that as to obtain the names of the good ſpirits, the calculation is to be made according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, beginning from the degree of the aſcendent; And to attain to the names of the evil ſpirits, by working the contrary way.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo obſerve, that the names of the evil ſpirits are extracted, aſwel from the names of the good ſpirits, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93270:24"/>
of the evil: ſo notwithſtanding, that if we enter the table with the name of a good ſpirit of the ſecond order, the name of the evil ſpirit ſhall be extracted from the order of the Princes and Governours; but if we enter the table with the name of a good ſpirit of the third order, or with the name of an evil ſpirit a Governour, after what manner ſoever they are extracted, whether by this table, or from a celeſtial figure, the names which do proceed from hence, ſhall be the names of the evil ſpirits, the Miniſters of the inferiour order.</p>
               <p>It is further to be noted, That as often as we enter this table with the good ſpirits of the ſecond order, the names extracted are of the ſecond order: and if under them we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the name of an evil ſpirit, he is of the ſuperiour order of the Governours. The ſame order is, if we enter with the name of an evil ſpirit of the ſuperiour order. If therefore we enter this table with the names of the ſpirits of the third order, or with the names of the miniſtring ſpirits, aſwell of the good ſpirits, as of the evil, the names extracted ſhall be the names of the miniſtring ſpirits of the inferiour order.</p>
               <p>But many Magicians, men of no ſmall authority, will have the tables of this kinde to be extended with Latine letters: ſo that by the ſame tables alſo, out of the name of any office or effect, might be found out the name of any ſpirit, aſwel good as evil, by the ſame maner which is above delivered, by taking the name of the office or of the effect, in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of letters, in their own line, under their own ſtar. And of this practice <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> is a great Author, who delivered this kinde of calculation in Egyptian letters: not unproperly alſo may they be referred to other letters of other tongues, for the reaſons aſſigned to the ſignes; for truly he onely is extant of all men who have treated concerning the attaining to the names of ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Therefore the force, ſecrecy and power, in what maner the ſacred names of ſpirits are truly and rightly found out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the diſpoſing of vowels, which do make the name of a ſpirit, and wherewith is conſtituted the true name, and right
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93270:24"/>
word. Now this art is thus perfected and brought to paſs: firſt, we are to take heed of placing the vowels of the letters, which are found by the calcutation of the celeſtial figure, to finde the names of the ſpirits of the ſecond order, Preſidents and Governours. And this in the good ſpirits, is thus brought to effect, by conſidering the ſtars which do conſtitute and make the letters, and by placing them according to their order: firſt let the degree of the eleventh Houſe be ſubſtracted from the degree of that ſtar which is firſt in order; and that which remaineth thereof, let it be projected from the degree of the aſcendant; and where that number endeth, there is part of the vowel of the firſt letter: begin therefore to calculate the vowels of theſe letters, according to their number and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the vowel which falleth in the place of the ſtar, which is the firſt in order, the ſame vowel is attributed to the firſt letter. Then afterwards thou ſhalt finde the part of the ſecond letter, by ſubſtracting the degree of a ſtar, which is the ſecond in order from the firſt ſtar; and that which remaineth, caſt from the aſcendant. And this is the part from which thou ſhalt begin the calculation of the vowels; and that vowel which falleth upon the ſecond ſtar, the ſame is the vowel of the ſecond letter: and ſo conſequently maiſt thou ſearch out the vowels of the following letters alwayes, by ſubſtracting the degree of the following ſtar, from the degree of the ſtar next preceding and going before. And ſo alſo all calculations and numerations in the names of the good ſpirits, ought to be made according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes. And in calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the names of the evil ſpirits, where in the names of the good ſpirits is taken the degree of the eleventh Houſe, in theſe ought to be taken the degree of the twelfth Houſe. And all numerations and calculations may be made with the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, by taking the beginning from the degree of the tenth Houſe.</p>
               <p>But in all extractions by tables, the vowels are placed after another maner. In the firſt place therefore is taken the certain number of letters making the name it ſelfe, and is thus num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from the beginning of the columne of the firſt letter,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93270:25"/>
or whereupon the name is extracted; and the letter on which this number falleth, is referred to the firſt letter of the name, extracted by taking the diſtance of the one from the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the Alphabet. But the number of that diſtance is projected from the beginning of his columne; and where it endeth, there is part of the firſt vowel: from thence therefore thou ſhalt calculate the vowels themſelves, in their own number and order, in the ſame column; and the vowel which ſhall fall upon the firſt letter of a name, the ſame ſhall be attributed to that name. Now thou ſhalt finde the following vowels, by taking the diſtance from the precedent vowel to the following: and ſo conſequently according to the ſucceſſion of the Alphabet. And the number of that diſtance is to be numbred from the beginning of his own column; and where he ſhall ceaſe, there is the part of the vowel ſought after. From thence therefore muſt you calculate the vowels, as we have aboveſaid; and thoſe vowels which ſhall fall upon their own letters, are to be attributed unto them: if therefore any vowel ſhall happen to fall upon a vowel, the former muſt give place to the latter: and this you are to underſtnd only of the good ſpirits. In the evil alſo you may proceed in the ſame way; except only, that you make the numerations after a contrary and backward order, contrary to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Alphabet, and contrary to the order of the columnes (that is to ſay) in aſcending.</p>
               <p>The name of good Angels, and of every man, which we have taught how to finde out, in our third Book of Occult Philoſophy, according to that manner, is of no little authority, nor of a meane foundation. But now we will give unto thee ſome other ways, illuſtrated with no vain reaſons. One where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, by taking in the figure of the nativity, the five places of Hylech: which being noted, the characters of the letters are projected in their order and number from the beginning of <hi>Aries;</hi> and thoſe letters which fall upon the degrees of the ſaid places, according to their order and dignity diſpoſed and aſpected, do make the name of an Angel. There is alſo another way, wherein they do take Almutel, which is the ruling and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93270:25"/>
governing ſtars over the aforeſaid five places; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is to be made from the degree of the aſcendant; which is done by gathering together the letters falling upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutel: which being placed in order, according to their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, do make the name of an Angel. There is furthermore another way uſed, and very much had in obſervation from the Egyptians, by making their calculation from the degre of the aſcendant, and by gathering together the letters according to the Almutel of the eleventh Houſe; which Houſe they call a good <hi>Daemon:</hi> which being placed according to their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the names of the Angels are conſtituted. Now the names of the evil Angels are known after the like manner, except only that the projections muſt be performed contrary to the courſe and order of the ſucceſſion of the ſignes: ſo that whereas in ſeeking the names of good ſpirits, we are to calculate from the beginning of <hi>Aries;</hi> contrariwiſe, in attaining the names of the evil, we ought to account from the beginning of <hi>Libra.</hi> And whereas in the good ſpirits we number from the degree of the aſcendant; contrarily, in the evil, we muſt calculate from the degree of the ſeventh Houſe. But according to the Egyptians, the name of an Angel is collected according to the Almutel of the twelfth Houſe which they call an evill ſpirit. Now all thoſe rites, which are elſewhere already by us delivered in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, may be made by the characters of any language. In all which (as we have aboveſaid) there is a myſtical and divine number, order and figure; from whence it cometh to paſs, that the ſame ſpirit may be called by divers names. But others are diſcovered from the name of the ſpirit himſelf, of the good or evil, by tables formed to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now theſe celeſtial characters do conſiſt of lines and heads: the heads are ſix, according to the ſix magnitudes of the ſtars, whereunto the planets alſo are reduced. The firſt magnitude holdeth a Star, with the Sun, or a Croſs. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with Jupiter a circular point. The third holdeth with Saturne, a ſemicircle, a triangle, either crooked, round or acute.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93270:26"/>
The fourth with Mars, a little ſtroke penetrating the line, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſquare, ſtraight, or oblique. The fifth with Venus and Mercury, a little ſtroke or point with a tail, aſcending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending. The ſixth with the Moon, a point made black. All which you may ſee in the enſuing table. The heads then being poſited according to the ſite of the Stars of the figure of Heaven, then the lines are to be drawn out, according to the congruency or agreement of their natures. And this you are to underſtand of the fixed Stars. But in the erecting of the Planets, the lines are drawn out, the heads being poſited according to their courſe and nature amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>When therefore a character is to be found of any celeſtial Image aſcending in any degree or face of a ſigne, which do conſiſt of Stars of the ſame magnitude and nature; then the number of theſe Stars being poſited according to their place and order, the lines are drawn after the ſimilitude of the Image ſignified, as copiouſly as the ſame can be done.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93270:26"/>But the Characters which are extracted according to the name of a ſpirit, are compoſed by the table following, by giving to every letter that name which agreeth unto him, out of the table; which although it may appear eaſie to thoſe that apprehend it, yet there is herein no ſmall difficulty; To wit, when the letter of a name falleth upon the line of letters or figures, that we may know which figure or which letter is to be taken. And this may be thus known: for if a letter falleth upon the line of letters, conſider of what number this letter may be in the order of the name; as the ſecond or the third: then how many letters that name containeth; as five or ſeven; and multiply theſe numbers one after another by themſelves, and treble the product: then caſt the whole (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added together) from the beginning of the letters accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſucceſſion of the Alphabet: and the letter upon which that number ſhall happen to fall, ought to be placed for the character of that ſpirit. But if any letter of a name fall on the line of figures, it is thus to be wrought. Take the number how many this letter is in the order of the name, and let it be multiplied by the number of which this letter is in the order of the Alphabet; and being added together, divide it by nine, and the remainder ſheweth the figure or number to be placed in the character: and this may be put either in a Geometrical or Arithmetical figure of number; which notwithſtanding ought not to exceed the number of nine, or nine Angels.</p>

               <p>But the Characters which are underſtood by the revelation of Spirits, take their vertue from thence; becauſe they are as it were certain hidden ſeals, making the harmony of ſome divinity: either they are ſignes of a Covenant entred into, and of promiſed and plighted faith, or of obedience. And thoſe Characters cannot by any other meanes be ſearched out.</p>
               <p>Moreover, beſides theſe Characters, there are certain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Figures and Images of evil Spirits, under which forms they are wont to appear, and yeild obedience to them that invoke them. And all theſe Characters or Images may be ſeen by the table following, according to the courſe of the letters conſtituting the names of Spirits themſelves: ſo that if in any letter there is found more then the name of one Spirit, his Image holdeth the pre-eminence, the others imparting their own order; ſo that they which are the firſt orders, to them is attributed the head, the upper part of the body, according to their own figure: thoſe which are the loweſt, do poſſeſs the thighs and feet; ſo alſo the middle letters do attribute like to themſelves the middle parts of the body, to give the parts that fit. But if there happen any contrariety, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is the ſtronger in the number ſhall bear rule: and if they are equal, they will impart equal things. Furthermore, if any name ſhall obtain any notable Character or Inſtrument out of the Table, he ſhall likewiſe have the ſame character in the Image.</p>
               <p>We may alſo attain to knowledge of the dignities of the evil Spirits, by the ſame Tables of Characters and Images: for upon what ſpirit ſoever there falleth any excellent ſigne or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument out of the Table of Characters, he poſſeſſeth that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As if there ſhall be a Crown it ſheweth a Kingly dignity; if a Creſt or Plume, a Dukedome; if a Horn, a County; if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93270:28"/>
theſe there be a Scepter, Sword, or forked Inſtrument, it ſheweth Rule and Authority. Likewiſe out of the Table of Images you ſhall finde them which bear the chief Kingly dignity: from the Crown judge dignity; and from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Rule and Authority. Laſtly, they which bear an humane ſhape and figure, have greater dignity then thoſe which appear under the Forms and Images of Beaſts; they alſo who ride, do excel them which appear on foot. And thus according to all their commixtures, you may judge the dignity and excellency of Spirits, one before another. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you muſt underſtand, that the Spirits of the inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of what dignity ſoever they be, are alwayes ſubject to the Spirits of the ſuperiour order: ſo alſo, that it is not incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their Kings and Dukes to be Subject and Miniſter to the preſidents of the ſuperiour order.</p>

               <p>But we now come to ſpeak of the holy and ſacred Pentacles and Sigils. Now theſe Pentacles are as it were certain holy ſignes preſerving us from evil chances and events, and helping and aſſiſting us to binde, exterminate, and drive away evil ſpirits, and alluring the good ſpirits, and reconciling them unto us. And theſe Pentacles do conſiſt either of Characters of the good ſpirits of the ſuperiour order, or of ſacred pictures of holy let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or revelations, with apt and fit verſicles, which are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either of Geometrical figures and holy names of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe and manner of many of them; or they are compounded of all of them; or very many of them mixt. And the Characters which are uſeful for us to conſtitute and make the pentacles, they are the Characters of the good Spirits, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially and chiefly of the good ſpirits of the firſt and ſecond order, and ſomtimes alſo of the third order. And this kinde of Characters are eſpecially to be named holy; and then thoſe Characters which we have above called holy. What Character ſoever therefore of this kinde is to be inſtituted, we muſt draw about him a double circle, wherein we muſt write the name of his Angel: and if wee will adde ſome divine name congruent with his Spirit and Office, it will be of the greater force and efficacy. And if we will draw about him any angular figure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of his numbers, that alſo ſhall be lawful to be done. But the holy pictures which do make the pentacles,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93270:31"/>
are they which every where are delivered unto us in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and ſacred Writings, as well of the old as of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;<note place="margin">The brazen ſerpent ſet up in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</note> even as the figure of the Serpent hanging on the croſs, and ſuch-like; whereof very many may be found out of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Prophets, as of <hi>Eſaias, Daniel, Eſdras</hi> and others, and alſo out of the revelation of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> And we have ſpoken of them in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, where we have made mention of holy things. Therefore when any picture is poſited of any of theſe holy Images, let the circle be drawn round about it on each ſide thereof, wherein let there be written ſome divine name, that is apt and conformed to the effect of that figure, or elſe there may be written about it ſome verſicle taken out of part of the body of holy Scripture, which may deſire to aſcertain or deprecate the deſired effect. As, if a pentacle were to be made to gain victory or revenge againſt ones enemies, as well viſible as inviſible, the figure may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the ſecond book of the <hi>Macchabees:</hi> that is to ſay, a hand holding a golden Sword drawn,<note place="margin">Accipe gladium ſanctum, mumus à Deo, in quo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarios populi mei Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</note> about which let there be written the verſicle there contained; To wit, <hi>Take the holy Sword the gift of God, wherewith thou ſhalt ſlay the adverſaries of my people Iſrael.</hi> Or alſo there may be written about it a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle of the fifth <hi>Pſalm: In this is the ſtrength of thy arm: before thy face there is death;</hi> or ſome other ſuch-like verſicle. But if you will write any divine name about the figure then let ſome name be taken that ſignifies Fear, a Sword, Wrath, the Revenge of God, or ſome ſuch-like name congruent and agreeing with the effect deſired. And if there ſhall be written any Angular figure, let him be taken according to the reaſon and rule of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as we have taught in our ſecond book of Occult Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, where we have treated of the numbers, and of the like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. And of this ſort there are two pentacles of ſublime vertue and great power, very uſeful and neceſſary to be uſed in the conſecration of experiments and Spirits: one whereof is that in the firſt chapter of <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> To wit, a figure of the Majeſty of God ſitting upon a Thone, having in his mouth a two-edged Sword, as there is written, about which let there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93270:31"/>
be written, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ego ſum primus &amp; noviſſimus, vivus &amp; ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. I am the firſt and the laſt, who am living, and was dead, and behold I live for ever and ever; and I have the keys of death and hell.</hi> Then there ſhall be written about it theſe three verſicles.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Manda Deus virtuti tuae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Give commandment, O God, to thy ſtrength.</l>
                  <l>Confirm, Oh God, thy work in us.</l>
                  <l>Let them be as duſt before the face of the winde. And let the Angel of the Lord ſcatter them. Let all their wayes be darkneſs and uncertain. And let the Angel of the Lord perſecute them.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Moreover, let there be written about in the ten general names, which are, <hi>El, Elohim, Elohe, Zebaoth, Elian, Eſcerchie, Adonay, Jah, Tetragrammaton, Saday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another pentacle, the figure whereof is like unto <hi>a Lambe ſlain, having ſeven eyes, and ſeven hornes, and under his feet a book ſealed with ſeven ſeales,</hi> as it is in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> Whereabout let there be written this verſicle: <hi>Behold the Lyon hath overcome of the Tribe of ſudath, the root of David. I will open the Book, and unlooſe the ſeven ſeals thereof.</hi> And one other verſicle: <hi>I ſaw Satan like lightning fall down from heaven. Behold, I have given you power to tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power of your enimies, and nothing ſhall be able to hurt you.</hi> And let there be alſo written about it the ten general names, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But thoſe Pentacles which are thus made of figures and names, let them keep this order: for when any figure is polited, conformable to any number, to produce any certain effect or vertue, there muſt be written thereupon, in all the ſeveral Angles, ſome Divine name, obtaining the force and efficacie of the thing deſired: yet ſo nevertheleſs, that the name which is of this ſort do conſiſt of juſt ſo many letters, as the Figure may conſtitute a number; or of ſo many letters of a name, as joyned together amongſt themſelves, may make the number of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93270:32"/>
or by any number which may be divided without any ſuperfluity or diminution. Now ſuch a name being found, whether it be onely one name or more, or divers names, it is to be written in all the ſeveral Angles in the Figure: but in the middle of this Figure let the revolution of the name be whole and totally placed, or at leaſt principally.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes alſo we conſtitute Pentacles, by making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of ſome kinde of name, in a ſquare Table, and by drawing about it a ſingle or double Circle, and by writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome holy verſicle competent and befitting this name, or from which that name is extracted. And this is the way of making the Pentacles, according to their ſeveral diſtinct forms and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, which we may as we pleaſe either multiply or commix together by courſe among themſelves, to work the greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, and extention and enlargement of force and vertue.</p>
               <p>As, if a deprecation ſhould be made for the overthrow and deſtruction of ones enemies, then we are to minde and call to remembrance how God deſtroyed the whole face of the earth in the deluge of waters; and the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> by raining down fire and brimſtone; likewiſe, how God overthrew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt in the Red-Sea, and to call to minde if any other malediction or curſe be found in holy Writ. And thus in things of the like ſort. So likewiſe in deprecating and praying againſt perils and dangers of waters, we ought to call to remembrance the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the deluge of waters, the paſſing of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thorow the Red-Sea; and alſo we are to minde how Chriſt walked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters, and ſaved the ſhip in danger to be caſt away with the tempeſt; and how he commanded the windes and the waves, and they obeyed him; and alſo, that he drew <hi>Peter</hi> out of the water, being in danger of drowning, and the like. And laſtly, with theſe we invoke and call upon ſome certain and holy names of God; to wit, ſuch as are ſignificative to accompliſh our deſire, and accommodated to the deſired effect: as, if it be to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow enemies, we are to invoke and call upon the names of wrath, revenge, fear, juſtice, and fortitude of God: and if we would avoid and eſcape any evil or danger, we then call upon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93270:32"/>
the names of Mercy, Defence, Salvation, Fortitude, Goodneſs, and ſuch like-names of God. When alſo we pray unto God that he would grant unto us our deſires, we are likewiſe to intermix therewith the name of ſome good ſpirit, whether one onely, or more, whoſe office it is to execute our deſires: and ſomtimes alſo we require ſome evil ſpirit to reſtrain or compel, whoſe name likewiſe we intermingle; and that rightly eſpecially, if it be to execute any evil worke; as, Revenge, Puniſhment, or deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if there be any Verſicle in the Pſalms, or in any other part of holy Scripture, that ſhall ſeem congruent and agreeable to our deſire, the ſame is to he mingled with our prayers. Now after Prayer hath been made unto God, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient afterwards to make an Oration to that executioner whom in our precedent prayer unto God we have deſired ſhould adminiſter unto us, whether one or more, or whether he be an Angel, or Star, or Soul, or any of the noble Angels. But this kinde of Oration ought to be compoſed according to the Rules which we have delivered in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy, where we have treated of the manner of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Inchantments.</p>
               <p>You may know further, that theſe kinde of bonds have a threefold difference: for the firſt bond is, when we conjure by Natural things: the ſecond is compounded of Religious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by Sacraments, Miracles, and things of this ſort; and the third is conſtituted by Divine names, and holy Sigils. And by theſe kinde of bonds, we may binde not onely ſpirits, but alſo other creatures whatſoever, as animals, tempeſts, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Incendia;</hi> Envie and Malice.</note> burnings, floods of waters, and the force and power of Arms. Oftentimes alſo we uſe theſe bonds aforeſaid, not onely by Conjuration, but ſomtimes alſo uſing the meanes of Deprecation and Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover, it conduceth much to this purpoſe, to joyn ſome ſentence of holy Scripture, if any ſhall be found conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hereunto: as, in the Conjuration of Serpents, by comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morating the curſe of the Serpent in the earthly Paradiſe, and the ſetting up of the Serpent in the wilderneſs; and further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Verſicle, <note n="*" place="margin">Super aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem &amp; baſiliſcum ambulabis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt walke upon the Aſp and the Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93270:33"/>
&amp;c. Superſtition alſo is of much prevalency herein, by the tranſlation of ſome Sacramental Rites, to binde that which we intend to hinder; as, the rites of Excommunication, of Sepulchres, Funerals, Buryings, and the like.</p>
               <p>And now we come to treat of the Conſecrations which men ought to make upon all inſtruments and things neceſſary to be uſed in this Art: and the vertue of this Conſecration moſt chiefly conſiſts in two things; to wit, in the power of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſecrating, and by the vertue of the prayer by which the Conſecration is made. For in the perſon conſecrating, there is required holineſs of Life, and power of ſanctifying: both which are acquired by Dignification and Initiation. And that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf ſhould with a firm and undoubted faith believe the vertue, power, and efficacie hereof. And then in the prayer it ſelf, by which this Conſecration is made, there is required the like holineſs; which either ſolely conſiſteth in the prayer it ſelf, as, if it be by divine inſpiration ordained to this purpoſe, ſuch as we have in many places of the holy Bible; or that it be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto inſtituted through the power of the Holy Spirit, in the ordination of the Church. Otherwiſe there is in the Prayer a Sanctimony, which is not onely by it ſelf, but by the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of holy things; as, the commemoration of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Hiſtories, Works, Miracles, Effects, Graces, Promiſes, Sacraments and Sacramental things, and the like. Which things, by a certain ſimilitude, do ſeem properly or improperly to appertain to the thing conſecrated.</p>
               <p>There is uſed alſo the invocation of ſome Divine names, with the conſignation of holy Seals, and things of the like ſort, which do conduct to ſanctification and expiation; ſuch as are the Sprinkling with Holy-Water, Unctions with holy Oyl, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous Suffumigations appertaining to holy Worſhip. And therefore in every Conſecration there is chiefly uſed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Conſecration of Water, Oyl, Fire, and Fumigations, uſed everywhere with holy Wax-lights or Lamps burning: for without Lights no Sacrament is rightly performed. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be known, and firmly obſerved, that if any Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to be made of things profane, in which there is any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93270:33"/>
pollution or defilement, then an exorciſing and expiation of thoſe things ought to precede the conſecration. Which things being ſo made pure, are more apt to receive the influences of the Divine vertues. We are alſo to obſerve, that in the end of every Conſecration, after that the prayer is rightly performed, the perſon conſecrating ought to bleſs the thing conſecrated, by breathing out ſome words, with divine vertue and power of the preſent Conſecration, with the commemoration of his vertue and authority, that it may be the more duly performed, and with an earneſt &amp; intentive minde. And therefore we will here lay down ſome examples hereof, whereby the way to the whole perfection hereof may the more eaſily be made to appear unto you.</p>
               <p>So then, in the conſecration of water, we ought to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate how that God hath placed the firmament in the midſt of the waters, and in what manner that God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradiſe, from whence ſprang four ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rivers, which watered the whole earth. Likewiſe we are to call to remembrance in what manner God made the water to be the inſtrument of executing his juſtice in the deſtruction of the Gyants in the general deluge over all the earth, and in the overthrow of the hoſt of Pharaoh in the Red-ſea; alſo how God led his own people thorow the midſt of the Sea on dry ground, and through the midſt of the river of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and likewiſe how marvelouſly he drew forth water out of the ſtony rock in the wilderneſs; and how at the prayer of Samſon, he cauſed a fountain of running water to flow out of the cheek-tooth of the jaw-bone of an aſs: and likewiſe, how God hath made waters the inſtrument of his mercy, and of ſalvation, for the expiation of Original ſin: alſo, how Chriſt was baptized in Jordan, and hath hereby ſanctified and clenſed the waters. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, certain divine names are to be invocated, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable hereunto; as, that God is a living fountain, living water, the fountain of mercy; and names of the like kinde.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe in the conſecration of fire, we are to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate how that God hath created the fire to be an inſtrument to execute his juſtice, for puniſhment, vengeance, and for the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93270:34"/>
expiation of ſins: alſo, when God ſhall come to judge the world, he will command a conflagration of fire to go before him. And we are to call to remembrance in what manner God appeared to Moſes in the burning buſh; and alſo, how he went before the children of Iſrael in a pillar of fire; and that nothing can be duely offered, ſacrificed, or ſanctified, without fire; and how that God inſtituted fire to be kept continually in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the covenant; and how miraculouſly he re-kindled the ſame, being extinct, and preſerved it elſwhere from going out, being hidden under the waters: and things of this ſort. Likewiſe the Names of God are to be called upon which are conſonant hereunto; as, it is read in the Law and the Prophets, that God is a conſuming fire: and if there be any of the Divine names which ſignifie fire, or ſuch-like names; as the glory of God, the light of God, the ſplendor and brightneſs of God.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe in the conſecration of Oyl and Perfumes, we are to call to remembrance ſuch holy things as are pertinent to this purpoſe, which we read in <hi>Exodus</hi> of the holy anointing oyl, and divine names ſignificant hereunto, ſuch as is the name Chriſt, which ſignifies anoynted: and what myſteries there are hereof; as that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the two Olive-trees diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling holy Oyl into the lamps that burn before the face of God: and the like.</p>
               <p>And the bleſſing of the lights, wax, and lamps, is taken from the fire, and the altar which containeth the ſubſtance of the flame: and what other ſuch ſimilitudes as are in myſteries; as that of the ſeven candleſticks and lamps burning before the face of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are the Conſecrations which firſt of all are neceſſary to be uſed in every kinde of devotion, and ought to precede it, and without which nothing in holy Rites can be duely performed.</p>
               <p>In the next place now we ſhall ſhew unto you the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Places, Inſtruments, and ſuch like-things.</p>
               <p>Therefore when you would conſecrate any Place or Circle, you ought to take the prayer of Solomon uſed in the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93270:34"/>
of the Temple: and moreover, you muſt bleſs the place with the ſprinkling of Holy-water, and with Fumigations, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating in the benediction holy myſteries; ſuch as theſe are, The ſanctification of the throne of God, of mount Sinai,<note place="margin">Sanctum ſanctorum.</note> of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, of the Holy of holies, of the temple of Jeruſalem. Alſo, the ſanctification of mount Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, by the crucifying of Chriſt; the ſanctification of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt; of mount Tabor, by the transfiguration and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of Chriſt: and the like. And by invocating divine names which are ſignificant hereunto; ſuch as the Place of God, the Throne of God, the Chayr of God, the Tabernacle of God, the Altar of God, the Habitation of God, and ſuch-like divine names of this ſort, which are to be written about the Circle or place to be conſecrated.</p>
               <p>And in the conſecrations of inſtruments and of all other things whatſoever that are ſerviceable to this Art, you ſhall proceed after the ſame manner, by ſprinkling the ſame with Holy-water, perfuming the ſame with holy Fumigations, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynting it with holy Oyl, ſealing it with ſome holy Sigil, and bleſſing it with prayer; and by commemorating holy things out of the ſacred Scriptures, Religion, and Divine names which ſhall be found agreeable to the thing that is to be conſecrated: as for examples ſake, in conſecrating a ſword, we are to call to remembrance that in the Goſpel, <hi>He that hath two coats,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> habet duas tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. and that place in the ſecond of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> That a ſword was divinely and miraculouſly ſent to <hi>Judas Macehabeus.</hi> And if there be any thing of the like in the Prophets; as that place, <hi>Take unto you two-edged Swords,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Accipite vobis gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os bis acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner you ſhall conſecrate experiments and books, and whatſoever of the like nature, as it is contained in writings, pictures, and the like, by ſprinkling, perfuming, anointing, ſealing, and bleſſing with holy commemorations, and calling to remembrance the ſanctifications of myſteries; As, the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Tables of the ten Commandments, which were delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> by God in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> The ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Teſtaments of God, the Old and New; The ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Law, and of the Prophets, and Scriptures,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93270:35"/>
which are promulgated by the holy Ghoſt. Moreover, there is to be commemorated ſuch divine names as are fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient hereunto; as theſe are: The Teſtament of God, The book of God, The book of life, The knowledge of God, The wiſdom of God; and the like. And with ſuch kinde of Rites is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conſecration performed.</p>
               <p>There is furthermore, beſides theſe, another Rite of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, of wonderful power, and much efficacie; And this is out of the kindes of ſuperſtitions: That is to ſay, when the Rite of conſecration or collection of any Sacrament in the Church is transferred to that thing which we would conſecrate.</p>
               <p>It is to be known alſo, that Vowes, Oblations, and Sacrifice, have the power of conſecration, aſwel real as perſonal; and they are as it were certain covenants and conventions between thoſe names with which they are made, and us who make them, ſtrongly cleaving to our deſire and wiſhed effect: As, when we dedicate, offer, and ſacrifice, with certain names or things; as, Fumigations, Unctions, Rings, Images, Looking-glaſſes; and things leſs material, as Deities, Sigils, Pentacles, Inchantments, Orations, Pictures, and Scriptures: of which we have largely ſpoken in our third booke of Occult Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>There is extant amongſt thoſe Magicians (who do moſt uſe the miniſtery of evil ſpirits) a certain Rite of invocating ſpirits by a Book to be conſecrated before to that purpoſe; which is properly called, <note n="†" place="margin">Liber Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituum.</note> 
                  <hi>A Book of Spirits;</hi> whereof we ſhall now ſpeak a few words. For this Book is to be conſecrated, a book of evil ſpirits, ceremoniouſly to be compoſed in their name and order: whereunto they binde with a certain holy Oath, the ready and preſent obedience of the ſpirit therein written.</p>
               <p>Now this book is to be made of moſt pure and clean paper, that hath never been uſed before; which many do call <note n="*" place="margin">Which <hi>Virgin-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is to be had at Mr. <hi>Rooks</hi> ſhop at the holy lamb at the Eaſt-end of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church: and likewiſe the <hi>Virgin-Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the beſt abortives.</note> 
                  <hi>Virgin-Paper.</hi> And this book muſt be inſcribed after this manner: that is to ſay, Let there be placed on the left ſide the image of the ſpirit, and on the right ſide his character, with the Oath above it, containing the name of the ſpirit, and his dignity and place, with his office and power. Yet very many do compoſe this book otherwiſe, omitting the characters or image: but it is more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93270:35"/>
efficacious not to neglect any thing which conduceth to it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there is to be obſerved the circumſtances of places, times, hours, according to the Stars which theſe ſpirits are under, and are ſeen to agree unto; their ſite, rite, and order being applied.</p>
               <p>Which book being ſo written, and well bound, is to be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, garniſhed, and kept ſecure, with Regiſters and Seals, leſt it ſhould happen after the conſecration to open in ſome place not intented, and indanger the operator. Furthermore, this book ought to be kept as reverently as may be: for irreverence of minde cauſeth it to loſe its vertue, with pollution &amp; profanation.</p>
               <p>Now this ſacred book being thus compoſed according to the manner already delivered, we are then to proceed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration thereof after a twofold way: one whereof is, That all and ſingular the ſpirits who are written in the book, be called to the Circle, according to the Rites and Order which we have before taught; and the book that is to be conſecrated, let it be placed without the Circle in a triangle. And in the firſt place, let there be read in the preſence of the ſpirits all the Oathes which are written in that book; and then the book to be conſecrated being placed without the Circle in a triangle there drawn, let all the ſpirits be compelled to impoſe their hands where their images and characters are drawn, and to confirm and conſecrate the ſame with a ſpecial and common Oath. Which being done, let the book be taken and ſhut, and preſerved as we have before ſpoken, and let the ſpirits be licenſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, according to due and right order.</p>
               <p>There is another manner of conſecrating a book of ſpirits, which is more eaſie, and of much efficacy to produce every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, except that in opening this book the ſpirits do not alwayes come viſible. And this way is thus, Let there be made a book of ſpirits as we have before ſet forth; but in the end thereof let there be written Invocations &amp; Bonds, &amp; ſtrong conjurations wherewith every ſpirit may be bound. Then this book muſt be bound between two Tables or Lamens, and in the inſide thereof let there be drawn the holy Pentacles of the Divine Majeſtie, which we have before ſet forth and deſcribed out of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93270:36"/>
the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> then let the firſt of them be placed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the book, and the ſecond at the end of the ſame. This book being perfected after this manner, let it be brought in a clear and fair time, to a Circle prepared in a croſs way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Art which we have before delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there in the firſt place the book being opened, let it be conſecrated to the rites and wayes which we have before declared concerning Conſecration. Which being done, let all the ſpirits be called which are written in the book, in their own order and place, by conjuring them thrice by the bonds deſcribed in the book, that they come unto that place within the ſpace of three days, to aſſure their obedience, and confirm the ſame, to the book ſo to be conſecrated. Then let the book be wrapped up in clean li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and buried in the middle of the Circle, and there faſt ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up: and then the Circle being deſtroyed, after the ſpirits are licenſed, depart before the riſing of the ſun: and on the third day, about the middle of the night, return, and new make the Circle, and with bended knees make prayer and giving thanks unto God, and let a precious perfume be made, and open the hole, and take out the book; and ſo let it be kept, not opening the ſame. Then you ſhall licenſe the ſpirits in their order, and deſtroying the Circle, depart before the ſun riſe. And this is the laſt rite and maner of conſecrating profitable to whatſoever writings and experiments, which do direct the ſpirits, placing the ſame between two holy Lamens or Pentacles, as before is ſhewn.</p>
               <p>But the Operator, when he would work by the Book thus conſecrated, let him do it in a fair and clear ſeaſon, when the ſpirits are leaſt troubled; and let him place himſelf towards the region of the ſpirits. Then let him open the book under a due Regiſter; let him invoke the ſpirits by their Oath there deſcribed and confirmed, and by the name of their character and image, to that purpoſe which you deſire: and if there be need, conjure them by the bonds placed in the end of the book. And having attained your deſired effect, then you ſhall licenſe the ſpirits to depart.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall come to ſpeak concerning the invocation of ſpirits, as well of the good ſpirits as of the bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93270:36"/>The good ſpirits may be invocated of us divers wayes, and in ſundry manners do offer themſelves unto us. For they do openly ſpeak to thoſe that watch, and do offer themſelves to our ſight, or do inform us in dreams by oracle of thoſe things which are deſired. Whoſoever therefore would call any good ſpirit, to ſpeak or appear in ſight, it behoveth them eſpecially to obſerve two things: one whereof is about the diſpoſition of the invocant; the other about thoſe things which are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to be adhibited to the invocation, for the conformity of the ſpirits to be called. It behoveth therefore that the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant himſelf be religiouſly diſpoſed for many dayes to ſuch a myſtery. In the firſt place therefore, he ought to be confeſſed and contrite, both inwardly and outwardly, and rightly expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by daily waſhing himſelf with holy water. Moreover, the invocant ought to conſerve himſelf all theſe dayes, chaſte, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinent, and to ſeparate himſelf as much as may be done, from all perturbation of minde, and from all manner of forraign and ſecular buſineſs. Alſo, he ſhall obſerve faſtings all theſe days, as much as ſhall ſeem convenient to him to be done. Alſo, let him daily between ſun-riſing and ſun-ſetting, being clothed with a holy linen garment, ſeven times call upon God, and make a deprecation to the Angels to be called according to the rule which we have before taught. Now the number of dayes of faſting and preparation is commonly the time of a whole Lunation. There is alſo another number obſerved amongſt the Cabaliſts, which is forty days.</p>
               <p>Now concerning thoſe things which do appertain to this Rite of Invocation, the firſt is, That a place be choſen, clean, pure, cloſe, quiet, free from all manner of noiſe, and not ſubject to any ſtrangers ſight. This place muſt firſt be exorciſed and conſecrated: and let there be a table or altar placed therein, covered with clean white linen, and ſet towards the eaſt: and on each ſide thereof, let there be ſet two conſecrated wax-lights burning, the flame whereof ought not to go out all theſe days. In the middle of the altar, let there be placed Lamens, or the holy paper which we have before deſcribed, covered with fine
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93270:37"/>
linen; which is not to be opened until the end of theſe days of the Conſecration. You ſhall alſo have in readineſs a precious perfume, and pure anointing oyl; and let them be both kept conſecrated. There muſt alſo a Cenſer be ſet on the head of the altar, wherein you ſhall kindle the holy fire, and make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume every day that you ſhall pray. You ſhall alſo have a long garment of white linen, cloſe before and behinde, which may cover the whole body and the feet, and girt about you with a girdle. You ſhall alſo have a veil of pure clean linen, and in the fore-part thereof let there be fixed golden or gilded Lamens, with the inſcription of the name <hi>Tetragrammaton;</hi> all which things are to be ſanctified and conſecrated in order. But you muſt not enter into the holy place, unleſs it be firſt waſhed, and arrayed with a holy garment; and then you ſhall enter into it with your feet naked. And when you enter therein, you ſhall ſprinkle it with holy water: then you ſhall make a perfume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar, and afterwards with bended knees pray before the altar as we have directed.</p>
               <p>But in the end of theſe dayes, on the laſt day, you ſhall faſt more ſtrictly: and faſting on the day following, at the riſing of the ſun, you may enter into the holy place, uſing the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies before ſpoken of, firſt by ſprinkling your ſelf, then with making a perfume, you ſhall ſigne your ſelf with holy oyl in the forehead, and anoynt your eyes; uſing prayer in all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations. Then you ſhall open the holy Lamen, and pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the altar upon your knees, as above ſaid: and then an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being made to the Angels, they will appear unto you, which you deſire; which you ſhall entertain with a benign and chaſte communication, and licenſe them to depart.</p>
               <p>Now the Lamen which is to be uſed to invoke any good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you ſhall make after this maner; either in metal conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or in new wax, mixt with ſpices and colours conformable: or it may be made with clean paper, with convenient colours: and the outward form or figure thereof may be ſquare, circular, or triangular, or of the like ſort, according to the rule of the numbers: in which there muſt be written the divine names, as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93270:37"/>
well the general names as the ſpecial. And in the centre of the Lamen, let there be drawn a character of ſix corners;<note place="margin">Hexagonus</note> in the middle whereof, let there be written the name and character of the Star, or of the Spirit his governour, to whom the good ſpirit that is to be called is ſubject. And about this character, let there be placed ſo many characters of five corners,<note place="margin">Pontagonus</note> as the ſpirits we would call together at once. And if we ſhall call one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one ſpirit, nevertheleſs there ſhall be made four Pentagones, wherein the name of the ſpirit or ſpirits, with their characters, is to be written. Now this table ought to be compoſed when the Moon is increaſing, on thoſe dayes and hours which then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the ſpirit. And if we take a fortunate ſtar herewith, it will be the better. Which Table being made in this manner, it is to be conſecrated according to the rules above delivered.</p>
               <p>And this is the way of making the general Table, ſerving for the invocation of all good ſpirits whatſoever. Nevertheleſs we may make ſpecial Tables congruent to every ſpirit, by the rule which we have above ſpoken of concerning holy Pentacles.</p>
               <p>And now we will declare unto you another Rite more eaſie to performe this thing: that is to ſay, let the man that is to receive an Oracle from the good ſpirits, be chaſte, pure, and confeſs'd. Then a place being prepared pure and clean, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered every where with white linen, on the Lords day in the new of the Moon let him enter into that place, clothed with clean white garments; and let him exorcize the place, and bleſs it, and make a Circle therein with a ſanctified cole; and let there be written in the uttermoſt part of the Circle the names of the Angels, and in the inner part thereof let there be written the mighty names of God: and let him place within the Circle, at the four angles of the world, the Cenſers for the perfumes. Then let him enter the place faſting, and waſhed, and let him begin to pray towards the eaſt this whole Pſalm:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Beati imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culati in via,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> &amp;c. by perfuming; and in the end deprecating the Angels, by the ſaid divine names, that they will daign to diſcover and reveal that which he deſireth: and that let him do ſix days, continuing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93270:38"/>
waſhed and faſting. And on the ſeventh day, which is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, let him, being waſhed and faſting, enter the Circle, and perfume it, and anoynt himſelf with holy anoynting oyl, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting his forehead, and upon both his eyes, and in the palms of his hands, and upon his feet. Then upon his knees let him ſay the Pſalm aforeſaid, with Divine and Angelical names. Which being ſaid, let him ariſe, let him begin to walk about in a Circle within the ſaid Circle from the eaſt to the weſt, until he is wearied with a dizzineſs of his brain: let him fall down in the Circle, and there he may reſt; and forthwith he ſhall be wrapt up in an ecſtaſie, and a ſpirit will appear unto him, which will informe him of all things. We muſt obſerve alſo, that in the Circle there ought to be four holy candles burning at the four parts of the world, which ought not to want light for the ſpace of a whole week. And the manner of faſting muſt be ſuch, that he abſtain from all things having a life of Sence, and from thoſe which do proceed from them: and let him onely drink pure running water: neither let him take any food till the going down of the ſun. And let the perfume and the holy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting oyl be made, as is ſet forth in <hi>Exodus</hi> and the other holy books of the Bible. It is alſo to be obſerved, that always as often as he enters into the Circle, he hath upon his forehead a golden lamen, upon which there muſt be written the name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> as we have before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But natural things, and their commixtures, do alſo belong unto us, and are conducing to receive Oracles from any ſpirit by a dream: which are either Perfumes, Unctions, and Meats or Drinks: which you may underſtand in our firſt book of Occult Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>But he that is willing always and readily to receive the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Dream, let him make unto himſelf a Ring of the Sun or of Saturn for this purpoſe. There is alſo an Image to be made, of excellent efficacie and power to work this effect; which being put under his head when he goeth to ſleep, doth effectually give true dreams of what thing ſoever the minde hath before determined or conſulted on. The Tables of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93270:38"/>
do likewiſe confer to receive an Oracle, being duly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med under their own Conſtellations. And theſe things thou mayeſt know in the third book of Occult Philoſophy,</p>
               <p>Holy Tables and Papers do alſo ſerve to this effect, being ſpecially compoſed and conſecrated; ſuch as is the Almad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Table of the Revolution of the name <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton.</hi> And thoſe things which are of this kinde, and written unto theſe things, out of divers figures, numbers, holy pictures, with the inſcriptions of the holy names of God and of Angels; the compoſition whereof is taken out of divers places of the holy Scriptures, Pſalms, and Verſicles, and other certain promiſes of the divine Revelation and Prophecies.</p>
               <p>To the ſame effect do conduce holy prayers &amp; imprecations, as well unto God, as to the holy Angels and Heroes: the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations of which prayers are to be compoſed as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn, according to ſome religious ſimilitude of Miracles, Graces, and the like, making mention of thoſe things which we intend to do: as, out of the old Teſtament, of the dream of <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, Pharaoh, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> if out of the New Teſtament, of the dream of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> of the dream of the three Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt ſleeping upon the breſt of our Lord: and whatſoever of the like kinde can be found in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Miracles, and Revelations; as, the revelation of the Croſs to <hi>Helen,</hi> the revelations of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the revelations of <hi>Bridget, Cyril, Methodius, Mech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tild, Joachim, Merhir,</hi> and ſuch-like. According to which let the deprecations be compoſed, if when he goeth to ſleep it be with a firm intention: and the reſt well diſpoſing themſelves, let them pray devoutly, and without doubt they will afford a powerful effect.</p>
               <p>Now he that knoweth how to compoſe thoſe things which we have now ſpoken of, he ſhall receive the moſt true Oracles of dreams. And this he ſhall do; obſerve thoſe things which in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy are directed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this thing. He that is deſirous therefore to receive an Oracle, let him abſtain from ſupper and from drink, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93270:39"/>
well diſpoſed, his brain being free from turbulent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; let him alſo have his bed-chamber fair and clean, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſed and conſecrated if he will; then let him perfume the ſame with ſome convenient fumigation; and let him anoint his temples with ſome unguent efficatious hereunto, and put a ring upon his finger, of the things above ſpoken of: let him take either ſome image, or holy table, or holy paper, and place the ſame under his head: then having made a devout prayer, let him go unto his bed, and meditating upon that thing which he deſireth to know, let him ſo ſleep; for ſo ſhall he receive a moſt certain and undoubted oracle by a dream, when the Moon goeth through that ſigne which was in the ninth Houſe of his nativity, and alſo when ſhe goeth through the ſigne of the ninth Houſe of the Revolution of his nativity; and when ſhe is in the ninth ſigne from the ſigne of perfection. And this is the way and meanes whereby we may obtain all Sciences and Arts whatſoever, ſuddenly and perfectly, with a true Illumination of our underſtanding; although all inferiour familiar Spirits whatſoever do conduce to this effect; and ſomtimes alſo evill Spirits ſenſibly informing us Intrinſecally or Extrinſecally.</p>
               <p>But if we would call any evil Spirit to the Circle, it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us to conſider, and to know his nature, to which of the Planets it agreeth, and what Offices are diſtributed to him from the Planet; and being known, let there be ſought out a place fit and proper for his invocation, according to the nature of the Planet, and the quality of the Offices of the ſaid Spirit, as near as the ſame may be done: as, if their power be over the Sea, Rivers or Flouds, then let the place be choſen in the Shore; and ſo of the reſt. Then let there be choſen a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, both for the quality of the Air, ſerene, clear, quiet, and fitting for the Spirits to aſſume bodies; as alſo of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and nature of the Planet, and of the Spirit, as to wit, on his day, or the time wherein he ruleth: he may be fortunate or infortunate, ſometimes of the day, and ſometimes of the night, as the Stars and Spirits do require. Theſe things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, let there be a Circle framed in the place elected, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel for the defence of the Invocant, as for the confirmation of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93270:39"/>
the Spirit. And in the Circle it ſelf there are to be written the divine general names, and thoſe things which do yeild defence unto us; and with them, thoſe divine names which do rule this Planet, and the Offices of the Spirit himſelf; there ſhall alſo be written therein, the names of the good Spirits which bear rule, and are able to binde and conſtrain that Spirit which we intend to call. And if we will any more fortifie and ſtrengthen out Circle, we may adde Characters and Pentacles agreeing to the work; then alſo if we will, we may either within or without the Circle, frame an angular figure, with the inſcription of ſuch convenient numbers, as are congruent amongſt themſelves to our work; which are alſo to be known, according to manner of numbers and figures: of which in the ſecond book of Occult Philoſophy it is ſufficiently ſpoken. Furthermore, he is to be provided of lights, perfumes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents and medicines, compounded according to the nature of the Planet and Spirit; which do partly agree with the Spirit, by reaſon of their natural and coeleſtial vertue; and partly are exhibited to the Spirit for religious and ſuperſtitious worſhip. Then he muſt be furniſhed with holy and conſecrated things, neceſſary aſwel for the defence of the Invocant, and his fellows, as alſo ſerving for bonds to binde and conſtrain the Spirits; ſuch as are either holy Papers, Lamens, Pictures, Pentacles, Swords, Scepters, Garments of convenient matter and colour, and things of the like ſort. Then when all theſe things are provided, and the Maſter and his fellows being in the Circle, in the firſt place let him conſecrate the Circle, and all thoſe things which he uſeth; which being performed with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient geſture and countenance, let him begin to pray with a loud voice, after this manner. Firſt let him make an Oration unto God, and then let him intreat the good Spirits: and if he will read any Prayers, Pſalms, or Goſpels for his defence, they ought to take the firſt place. After theſe Prayers and Orations are ſaid, then let him begin to invocate the Spirit which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, with a gentle and loving Inchantment, to all the coaſts of the World, with the commemoration of his own Authority and power. And then let him reſt a little, looking about
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93270:40"/>
him, to ſee if any Spirit do appear; which if he delay, then let him repeat his invocation, is above ſaid, until he hath done it three times; and if the Spirit be pertinacious, obſtinate, and will not appear, then let him begin to conjure with divine power; ſo alſo that the conjurations and all his commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do agree with the Nature and Offices of the Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and reiterate the ſame three times, from ſtronger to ſtronger, uſing Objurgations, Contumelies, Curſings, and Puniſhments, and ſuſpenſion from his Office and Power, and the like.</p>
               <p>And after all the courſes are finiſhed, then ceaſe a little; and if any Spirit ſhall appear, let the Invocant turne himſelf towards the Spirit, and courteouſly receive him, and earneſtly intreating him, let him firſt require his name, and if he be called by any other name: and then proceeding further, let him ask him whatſoever he will: and if in any thing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall ſhew himſelf obſtinate or lying, let him be bound by convenient conjurations: and if you doubt of any lye, make without the Circle with the conſecrated Sword, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a triangle or <note n="*" place="margin">A Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with five cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                  <hi>Pentagone,</hi> and compel the Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it: and if thou receiveſt any promiſe which thou wouldſt have to be confirmed with an Oath, let him ſtretch the ſword out of the Circle, and ſwear the Spirit, by laying his hand upon the ſword. Then having obtained of the Spirit that which you deſire, or are otherwiſe contented, licenſe him to depart with courteous words, giving command unto him, that he do no hurt: and if he will not depart, compel him by powerful conjurations; and if need require, expel him by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms, and by making contrary fumigations. And when he is departed, go not out of the Circle, but make a ſtay, making prayer, and giving of thanks unto God and the good Angels, and alſo praying for your defence and conſervation: and then all thoſe things being orderly performed, you may depart.</p>
               <p>But if your hope be fruſtrated, and no Spirit will appear, yet for this do not deſpair; but leaving the Circle, return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at other times, doing as before. And if you ſhall judge that you have erred in any thing, then you ſhall amend by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93270:40"/>
or diminiſhing; for the conſtancy of Reiteration doth often increaſe your authority and power, and ſtriketh terrour into the Spirits, and humbleth them to obey.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſome uſe to make a Gate in the Circle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may go in and out, which they open and ſhut as they pleaſe, and fortifie it with holy Names and Pentacles.</p>
               <p>This alſo we are to take notice of, That when no Spirits will appear, but the Maſter being wearied hath determined to ceaſe and give over; let him not therefore depart without licenſing the Spirits: for they that do neglect this, are very greatly in danger, except they are fortified with ſome ſublime defence.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes alſo the Spirits do come, although they appear not viſible, (for to cauſe terrour to him that calls them) either in the thing which he uſeth, or in the operation it ſelf. But this kinde of licenſing is not given ſimply, but by a kinde of diſpenſation with ſuſpenſion, until in the following terms they ſhall render themſelves obedient. Alſo without a Circle theſe Spirits may be called to appear, according to the way which is above delivered about the conſecration of a Book.</p>
               <p>But when we do intend to execute any effect by evil Spirits, where an Apparition is not needful; then that is to be done, by making and forming that which is to be unto us as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or ſubject of the experiment it ſelf; as whether it be an Image, or a Ring, or a Writing, or any Character, Candle, or Sacrifice, or any thing of the like ſort; then the name of the Spirit is to be written therein, with his Character, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigency of the experiment, either by writing it with ſome blood, or otherwiſe uſing a perfume agreeable to the Spirit. Oftentimes alſo making Prayers and Orations to God and the good Angels before we invocate the evil Spirit, conjuring him by the divine power.</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of Spirits which we have ſpoken of in our third book of Occult Philoſophy, not ſo hurtful, and neereſt men; ſo alſo, that they are affected with humane paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and do joy in the converſation of men, and freely do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit with them: and others do dwell in the Woods and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts; and others delight in the company of divers domeſtique
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93270:41"/>
Animals and wilde Beaſts; and otherſom do inhabit about Fountains and Meadows. Whoſoever therefore would call up theſe kinde of Spirits, in the place where they abide, it ought to be done with odoriferous perfumes, and with ſweet ſounds and inſtruments of Muſick, ſpecially compoſed for the buſineſs, with uſing of Songs, Inchantments and pleaſant Verſes, with praiſes and promiſes.</p>
               <p>But thoſe which are obſtinate to yeild to theſe things, are to be compelled with Threatnings, Comminations, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Deluſions, Contumelies, and eſpecially by threatning them to expel them from thoſe places where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant.</p>
               <p>Further, if need be, thou maiſt betake thee to uſe Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms; but the chiefeſt thing that ought to be obſerved, is, conſtancy of minde, and boldneſs, free and alienated from fear.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when you would invocate theſe kinde of Spirits, you ought to prepare a Table in the place of invocation, covered with clean linen; whereupon you ſhall ſet new bread, and running water or milk in new earthen veſſels, and new knives. And you ſhall make a fire, whereupon a purfume ſhall be made. But let the Invocant go unto the head of the Table, and round about it let there be ſeats placed for the Spirits, as you pleaſe; and the Spirits being called, you ſhall invite them to drink and eat. But if perchance you ſhall fear any evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then draw a Circle about it, and let that part of the Table at which the Invocant ſits, be within the Circle, and the reſt of the Table without the Circle.</p>
               <p>In our third book of Occult Philoſophy, we have taught how and by what meanes the Soul is joyned to the Body; and, what hapneth to the ſoul after death.</p>
               <p>Thou maiſt know further, That thoſe Souls do ſtill love their relinquiſhed Bodies after death, as it were a certain affinity alluring them; ſuch as are the Souls of noxious men, which have violently relinquiſhed their Bodies, and Souls wanting a due burial, which do ſtill wander in a liquid and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93270:41"/>
Spirits about their dead carcaſſes; for theſe Souls by the known meanes by which heretofore they were conjoyned to their Bodies, by the like vapors, liquors, and ſavours, are eaſily drawn unto them.</p>
               <p>From hence it is, that the Souls of the dead are not to be called up without blood, or by the application of ſome part of their relict Body.</p>
               <p>In the raiſing up of theſe ſhadows, we are to perfume with new Blood, with the Bones of the dead, and with Fleſh, Egges, Milk, Honey and Oil, and ſuch-like things, which do attribute to the Souls a meanes apt to receive their Bodies.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be underſtood, That thoſe who are deſirous to raiſe up any Souls of the dead, they ought to do it in thoſe places, wherein theſe kinde of Souls are moſt known to be converſant; or for ſome alliance alluring thoſe ſouls into their forſaken body; or for ſome kinde of affection in times paſt, impreſſed in them in their life, drawing the ſaid Souls to certain places, things, or perſons; or for the forcible nature of ſome place fitted and prepared for to purge or puniſh theſe ſouls. Which places for the moſt part are to be known by the experience of viſions, nightly incurſions, and appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch-like prodigies ſeen.</p>
               <p>Therefore the places moſt fitting for theſe things, are Church-yards. And better then them, are thoſe places wherein there is the execution of criminal judgements. And better then theſe, are thoſe places, in which of late yeers there have been ſome publick ſlaughters of men. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that place is better then theſe, where ſome dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs, that came by violent death, is not yet expiated, nor ritely buried, and was lately buried; for the expiation of thoſe places, is alſo a holy Rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the bodies, and oftentimes prohibiteth the ſouls to come unto their bodies, and expelleth them far off unto the places of judgement.</p>
               <p>And from hence it is, That the Souls of the dead are not eaſily to be raiſed up, except it be the Souls of them whom we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93270:42"/>
know to be evil, or to have periſhed by a violent death, and whoſe bodies do want a right and due burial.</p>
               <p>Now although we have ſpoken concerning ſuch places of this kinde, it will not be ſafe or commodious to go unto them: but it behoveth us to take to what place ſoever is to be choſen, ſome principal part of the body that is relict, and therewith to make a perfume in due manner, and to performe other competent Rites.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be known, that becauſe the Souls are certain ſpiritual lights, therefore artificial lights, eſpecially if they be framed out of certain competent things, compounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a true rule, with congruent inſcriptions of Names and Seals, do very much avail to the raiſing up of departed Souls.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe things which are now ſpoken of, are not alwayes ſufficient to raiſe up Souls, becauſe of an extranatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral portion of underſtanding and reaſon, which is above, and known onely to the Heaven and Deſtinies, and their power.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to allure the ſaid Souls, by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and coeleſtial powers duely adminiſtred, even by thoſe things which do move the very harmony of the Soul, aſwel imaginative, as rational and intellectual; as are Voices, Songs, Sounds, Inchantments: and Religious things; as Prayers, Conjurations, Exorciſmes, and other holy Rites, which may very commodiouſly be adminiſtred hereunto.</p>

For we ſee in this book, as it were a certain introduction of Magical vanity; and as it were in preſent exerciſe, they may behold the diſtinct functions of ſpirits, how they may be drawn to diſcourſe and communication; what is to be done every day, and every hour; and how they ſhall be read, as if they were deſcribed ſillable by ſillable.</p>
            <p>In brief, in this book are kept the principles of Magical conveyances. But decauſe the greateſt power is attributed to the Circles; (For they are certain fortreſſes to defend the operators ſafe from the evil Spirits;) In the firſt place we will treat concerning the compoſition of a Circle.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Circle, and the compoſition thereof.</head>
               <p>THe form of Circles is not alwayes one and the ſame; but uſeth to be changed, according to the order of the Spirits that are to be called, their places, times, daies and hours. For in making a Circle, it ought to be conſidered in what time of the year, what day, and what hour, that you make the Circle; what Spirits you would call, to what Star and Region they do belong, and what functions they have. Therefore let there be made three Circles of the latitude of nine foot, and let them be diſtant one from another a hands breadth; and in the middle Circle, firſt, write the name of the hour wherein you do the work. In the ſecond place, Write the name of the Angel of the hour. In the third place, The ſigil of the Angel of the hour. Fourthly, The name of the Angel that ruleth that day wherein you do the work, and the names of his Miniſters. In the fifth place, The name of the preſent time. Sixthly, The name of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ruling in that part of time, and their Preſidents. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The name of the head of the Signe ruling in that part of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93270:43"/>
time wherein you work. Eighthly, The name of the earth, according to that part of time wherein you work. Ninthly, and for the compleating of the middle Circle, Write the name of the Sun and of the Moon, according to the ſaid rule of time; for as the time is changed, ſo the names are to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And in the outermoſt Circle, let there be drawn in the four Angles, the names of the preſidential Angels of the Air, that day wherein you would do this work; to wit, the name of the King and his three Miniſters. Without the Circle, in four Angles, let <hi>Pentagones</hi> be made. In the inner Circle let there be written four divine names with croſſes interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the middle of the Circle; to wit, towards the Eaſt let there be written <hi>Alpha,</hi> and towards the Weſt let there be written <hi>Omega;</hi> and let a croſs divide the middle of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. When the Circle is thus finiſhed, according to the rule now before written, you ſhall proceed.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the names of the hours, and the Angels ruling them.</head>
               <p>IT is alſo to be known, that the Angels do rule the hours in a ſucceſſive order, according to the courſe of the Heavens, and Planets unto which they are ſubject; ſo that that Spirit which governeth the day, ruleth alſo the firſt hour of the day; the ſecond from this governeth the ſecond hour; the third, the third hour, and ſo conſequently: and when ſeven Planets and hours have made their revolution, it returneth again to the firſt which ruleth the day. Therefore we ſhall firſt ſpeak of the names of the hours.</p>

The ſecond example is, whereby the ſame St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth that the living do appear to the living, in their ſleep: for he ſaith, That <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logius</hi> the Rhetorician, profeſſing the Rhetorick of <hi>Cicero</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> he found a difficult and obſcure place that was not declared to him; ſo that waking and ſleeping he vexed himſelf by reaſon of his ignorance: but, in a certain night, the image of <hi>Aurelius Auguſtine</hi> appeared to him, and taught
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93270:80"/>
him in what manner the dark and difficult place was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>

                  <p>He doth ſo conclude: and the greater to ſtrengthen ſuch his judgement, he addeth, That if the ſouls of the dead have any intereſt or counſel in the affairs of the living, he undoubtedly knew, that his own pious mother did not deſert him, not for one night, but when ſhe was living, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him both by ſea and land: neither did he at any time ſuſtain any anguiſh of heart, but comforted his ſorrows. And that this may not ſeem too hard a ſpeech, the preſident of Chriſt teacheth, that they do not erre, who affirm that the good Angels, by the appointment of God, and Divine diſpenſation, do ſometimes come to, and viſit men, both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſleeping, and ſometimes to the place where ſouls endure puniſhment: notwithſtanding, it is not unto all, but only unto thoſe who have ſo lived, that God ſhall judge them worthy of this mercy; or unto thoſe upon whom, without any reſpect unto their deſerts, God will be pleaſed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his unſpeakable mercy; that by the prayers of the living they may obtain pardon of their ſins, and deliverance from the priſon of torments.</p>

               <p>IF you would be informed concerning the ſubſtance of any man whether he ſhall be rich or not, behold the Lord of the ſecond, which if he ſhall be with a good Planet, and a good Planet likewiſe in the ſecond, he ſhall be rich; but if the Lord of the ſecond be joyned with evil Planets, and an evil Planet ſhall be in the ſecond, he ſhall be poor.</p>
               <p>If you would know whether you ſhall have again a thing lent, or not, look if there be an evil Planet in the ſecond, and diſagreeing with his Lord; then he that detaineth the thing lent, will not willingly render back the ſame: but if there be a good Planet in the ſecond, and agreeing with his Lord, it ſhall eaſily be recovered; and if the Lord of the ſecond be exalted and be evil, or if an evil Planet be with him in the ſecond, or if the Lord of the ſecond be exalted, he which keepeth the thing depoſited, will not willingly reſtore the ſame, but he ſhall do it whether he will or not. And if an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Planet be in the ſecond, it's to be recovered: but if <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> be in the ſecond, ſo that he be his Lord, and bringeth contrariety then it ſhall be recovered; and if a good Planet be in the ſecond Houſe, he ſignifies recovery, although he be the Lord thereof.</p>
               <p>Mark therefore the concord and diſcord of the Planets: the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are friends, the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> are friends, <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> enemies; <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are friends, <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> are enemies.</p>
               <p>The Planets are ſaid to be friends, when they agree in one nature and quality, as <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe both their natures are hot and dry; <hi>Venus</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> do agree in cold and moiſture: or when Planets do agree in ſubſtance and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are friends: or when the Houſe of one is the exaltation of another, or on the contrary.</p>

The ſecond Houſe and his Lord ſignifies the gain of the Querent: and the eighth Houſe and his Lord ſignifies the gain of his fellow, or his part: and if they be both good, they ſhall both gain; and if both evil, they ſhall both loſe: and if one be good and the other evil, he whoſe ſignificator is good, ſhall gain; and he whoſe is evil, ſhall loſe.</p>

And note, that in a Queſtion concerning war and kingdom, it is ſaid that there is more power and efficacie, or fortitude in the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Planet, then in his Houſe; but in all other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the contrary.</p>
               <p>If you would be informed concerning any one being that is gone to any fight, whether he ſhall return ſafe, ſee the Lord of the Aſcendent; if he be good, that is, with good Planets, and a good Planet in the firſt, he will return ſafe; but if the <hi>Sun</hi> be with the Lord of the firſt, in any part of the Queſtion, let him not go, becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> burneth him. And if the Lord of the ſeventh be with a good Planet, and the

Lord of the firſt with a good Planet likewiſe, he ſhall have ſome impediment in the way; but he will not die. And if an evil Planet be with the Lord of the firſt, and a good Planet in the firſt, if he goeth he ſhall ſuffer great damage, but not death; nevertheleſs he may be grievouſly wounded. And if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the firſt, or with the Lord of the firſt, let him not go; becauſe ſome impediment will happen unto him by ſome man that he will meet. And if there be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Planet with the Lord of the firſt, or <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the firſt, or with the Lord of the firſt, he will be wounded with wood or with a ſtone. If <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Dragons Tail</hi> be in the firſt, or with the Lord of the firſt; or if there evil Planets in the firſt, or with the Lord of the firſt, he will ſuffer wounds or death. See likewiſe if there be an evil Planet in the eighth, becauſe then death is to be feared. And if the <hi>Sun</hi> be with the Lord of the ſeventh, or in the eighth, it ſignifies that it is ill to go. The like judgement is of the ſeventh and the tenth.</p>
               <p>And if a Queſtion be propoſed concerning the event of War, ſee the ſeventh and the firſt, and their Lords: for the firſt Houſe and his Lord ſignifies the Querent; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Houſe and his Lord the adverſary. So that if there be good Planets in the firſt, and evil in the ſeventh; and if the Lord of the firſt and ſeventh be evil, the Querent ſhall overcome: but if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the firſt, and an evil Planet in the firſt, and the Lord of the ſeventh good, or * R * in the ſeventh, the Querent ſhall be overcome, or taken, or ſlain. And if the Lords of them both be in the firſt, and there be good Planets from the part of the firſt Houſe, unto the end of the Houſe which is the middle of the Queſtion; and if evil Planets do poſſeſs the other half of the Queſtion, that is to ſay, from the ſeventh unto the end of the twelfth houſe, the adverſary ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. But if both the Lords ſhall be in the Aſcendent, and if they be good from the part of the firſt, and evil from the part of the ſeventh, they ſhall both ſuffer great loſs; but the Querent ſhall have the better in the end. But if the Lord of the Aſcendent be in the ſeventh, or in his Queſtion, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93270:89"/>
fortitude of the adverſary: and if the Lord of the ſeventh be in the firſt, or in his Queſtion, it ſignifies fortitude of the actor. And if the Lord of the Aſcendent be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth; or the Lord of the eighth in the firſt, or with the Lord of the firſt, it ſignifies the death of the Querent. And if the Lord of the ſeventh be in the ſecond, or with his Lord; or the Lord of the ſecond in the ſeventh, or with the Lord of the ſeventh, it ſignifies the death of the enemy.</p>
               <p>If you would know whether War ſhall continue long or not, if mean or meanly; if the Lords of the firſt and the ſeventh do agree, the parties ſhall be pacified after the War.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt depart from the place wherein thou art, and remove thy ſelf to ſome other place; and if thou wouldſt know whether it be better for thee to ſtay or go: or concerning two buſineſſes, if thou deſtreſt to know which of them is moſt expedient for thee to undertake, conſider the Lords of the firſt and the ſecond, for thoſe places to which thou wouldſt go, the place wherein thou art, and the gain which thou getteſt there; and the ſeventh and the eighth, and their Lords, for the place to which thou wouldſt go, and the gain which thou mayſt get there: and thoſe places chuſe, whoſe Lords are the better, or joyned to the better Planets. Or otherwiſe: behold the Lord of the Aſcendent, and the Moon; which if they be ſeparated from evil Planets, and joyned to good and fortunate Planets, it is better for thee to go from the place where thou art, then to ſtay there, and to do what buſineſs ſoever thou haſt in thy minde. And if the Lord of the Aſcendent and the Moon be ſeparated from the Fortunes, and joyned to evil Planets, then it is not good for thee to remove thy ſelf, nor to do thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or thus: See the Moon; and if the Planet from which ſhe is ſeparated be better then that to whom ſhe is joyned, do not remove: and if the Planet which ſhe is joyned to, be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that from which ſhe is ſeparated, then go.</p>

It is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient therefore to know and diſcern all differences of the wiſdom of the Creator and the Creatures, that it may be certainly manifeſt unto us, what we ought to aſſume to our uſe of every thing, and that we may know in truth how and in what manner that may be done. For truly every creature is ordained for ſome profitable end to humane nature, and for the ſervice thereof; as the holy Scriptures, Reaſon, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, do teſtifie.</p>

                  <p>God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things viſible and inviſible, in the holy Scriptures propoſeth himſelf to have an eye over us; and as a tender father which loveth his children, he teacheth us what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and what not; what we are to avoid, and what we are to embrace: then he allureth us to obedience with great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93270:94"/>
promiſes of corporal and eternal benefits, and deterreth us (with threatning of puniſhments) from thoſe things which are not profitable for us. Turn over therefore with thy hand, both night and day, thoſe holy Writings, that thou mayſt be happy in things preſent, and bleſſed to all eternity. Do this, and thou ſhalt live, which the holy Books have taught thee.</p>

                  <p>Appoint therefore to him who ſolely dependeth upon God, the wiſdom of every creature to ſerve and obey him, <hi>nolens volens,</hi> willing or unwilling. And in this, the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God ſhineth forth. It conſiſteth therefore in this, that we will diſcern the creatures which ſerve us, from thoſe that are unwilling; and that we may learn how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the wiſdom and offices of every creature unto our ſelves. This Art is not delivered, but divinely.

                     <head>The moſt general Precepts of this Secret.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Every Governour acteth with all his Spirits, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to wit, alwayes after the ſame manner; or otherwiſe of their own free-will, if God hinder them not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every Governour is able to do all things which are done naturally in a long time, out of matter before prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and alſo to do them ſuddenly, out of matter not before prepared. As <hi>Och,</hi> the Prince of Solar things, prepareth gold in the mountains in a long time; in a leſs time, by the Chymical Art; and Magically, in a moment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The true and divine Magician may uſe all the creatures of God, and offices of the Governours of the world, at his own will, for that the Governours of the world are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto them, and come when they are called, and do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93270:99"/>
their commands: but God is the Author thereof: as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> cauſed the Sun to ſtand ſtill in heaven.</p>
                     <p>They ſend ſome of their Spirits to the mean Magicians, which do obey them only in ſome determinate buſineſs: but they hear not the falſe Magicians, but expoſe them to the deceits of the devils, and caſt them into divers dangers, by the command of God; as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in his eighth Chapter, concerning the Jews.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In all the elements there are the ſeven Governours with their hoſts, who do move with the equal motion of the firmament; and the inferiours do alwayes depend upon the ſuperiours, as it is taught in Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A man that is a true Magician, is brought forth a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian from his mothers womb: others, who do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this office, are unhappy.

                  <p>There are other names of the <hi>Olympick</hi> ſpirits delivered by others; but they only are effectual, which are delivered to any one, by the Spirit the revealer, viſible or inviſible: and they are delivered to every one as they are predeſtinated: therefore they are called Conſtellations; and they ſeldom have any efficacy above 40 years. Therefore it is moſt ſafe for the young practiſers of Art, that they work by the offices of the Spirits alone, without their names; and if they are pre-ordained to attain the Art of Magick, the other parts of the Art will offer themſelves unto them of their own accord.

Divide the ſeveral quadrants into ſeven parts, that there may be in the whole 28 parts: and let them be again divided into four parts, that there may be 112 parts of the Circle: and ſo many are the true ſecrets to be revealed. And this Circle in this maner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, is the ſeal of the ſecrets of the world, which they draw from the onely center A, that is, from the inviſible God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole creature. The Prince of the Oriental ſecrets is reſident in the middle, and hath three Nobles on either ſide, every one whereof hath four under him, and the Prince himſelf hath four appertaining unto him. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the other princes and nobles have their quadrants of ſecrets, with their four ſecrets. But the Oriental ſecret is the ſtudy of all wiſdome; The Weſt of ſtrength; The South, of tillage; The North, of more rigid life: So that the Eaſtern ſecrets are commended to be the beſt; the Meridian to be mean; and the Eaſt and North to be leſſer. The uſe of this ſeal of ſecrets is, that thereby thou maiſt know whence the Spirits or Angels are produced, which may teach the ſecrets delivered unto them from God.

One hath the power of the ſword; another, of the peſtilence; and another, of inflicting famine upon the people as it is ordained by God. Some are deſtroyers of Cities, as thoſe two were, who were ſent to overthrow <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> and the places adjacent, examples whereof the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93270:103"/>
holy Scripture witneſſeth. Some are the watch-men over Kingdoms; others, the keepers of private perſons; and from thence, any one may eaſily form their names in his own language: ſo that he which will, may ask a phyſical Angel, mathematical, or philoſophical, or an Angel of civil wiſdom, or of ſupernatural or natural wiſdome, or for any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and let him ask ſeriouſly, with a great deſire of his mind, and with faith and conſtancy; and without doubt, that which he asketh he ſhall receive from the Father and God of all Spirits. This faith ſurmounteth all ſeals, and bringeth them into ſubjection to the will of man. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical maner of calling Angels ſucceedeth this faith, which dependeth onely on divine revelation; But without the ſaid faith preceding it, it lieth in obſcurity. Nevertheleſs, if any one will uſe them for a memorial, and no otherwiſe, and as a thing ſimply created by God to this purpoſe, to which ſuch a ſpirituall power or eſſence is bound; he may uſe them without any offence unto God. But let him beware, leſt that he fall into idolatry, and the ſnares of the devil, who with his cunning ſorceries, eaſily deceiveth the unwary. And he is not taken but onely by the ſinger of God, and is appointed to the ſervice of man; ſo that they unwillingly ſerve the godly; but not without temptations and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the commandment hath it, That he ſhall bruiſe the heel of Chriſt, the ſeed of the woman.

in prayer, for thoſe things which he deſires, and he ſhall not ſuffer a repulſe. Let not any one deſpiſe prayer; for by whom God is prayed unto, to him he both can and will give. Now let us acknowledge him the Author, from whom let us humbly ſeek for our deſires. A merciful and good Father, loveth the ſons of deſires, as <hi>Daniel;</hi> and ſooner heareth us, then we are able to overcome the hardneſs of our hearts to pray. But he will not that we give holy things to dogs, nor deſpiſe and contemn the gifts of his treaſury. Therefore diligently and often read over and over the firſt Septenary of ſecrets, and guide and direct thy life and all thy thoughts according to thoſe precepts; and all things ſhall yield to the deſires of thy minde in the Lord, to whom thou truſteſt.</p>

                  <p>As our ſtudy of Magick proceedeth in order from general Rules premiſed, let us now come to a particular explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. Spirits either are divine miniſters of the word, and of the Church, and the members thereof; or elſe they are ſervient to the Creatures in corporal things, partly for the ſalvation of the ſoul and body, and partly for its deſtruction. And there is nothing done, whether good or evil without a certain and determinate order and government. He that ſeeketh after a good end, let him follow it; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires an evil end, purſue that alſo, and that earneſtly, from divine puniſhment, and turning away from the divine will. Therefore let every one compare his ends with the word of God, and as a touchſtone that will judge between good and evil; and let him propoſe unto himſelf what is to be avoided, and what is to be ſought after; and that which he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth and determineth to himſelf, let him follow diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not procraſtinating or delaying, until he attain to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed bound.</p>

                  <p>Care is to be taken, that experiments be not mixed with experiments; but that every one be onely ſimple and ſeveral: for God and Nature have ordained all things to a certain and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93270:105"/>
appointed end: ſo that for examples ſake, they who perform cures with the moſt ſimple herbs and roots, do cure the moſt happily of all. And in this manner, in Conſtellations, Words and Characters, Stones, and ſuch like, do lie hid the greateſt influences or vertues in deed, which are in ſtead of a miracle.</p>
                  <p>So alſo are words, which being pronounced, do forthwith cauſe creatures both viſible and inviſible to yeild obedience, aſwell creatures of this our world, as of the warry, aery, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, and Olympick, ſuperceleſtial and infernal, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the divine.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſimplicity is chiefly to be ſtudied, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch ſimples is to be ſought for from God; otherwiſe by no other meanes or experience they can be found out.</p>

                  <p>And let all lots have their place decently: Order, Reaſon and Means, are the three things which do eaſily render all learning aſwell of the viſible as inviſible creatures. This is the courſe of Order, That ſome creatures are creatures of the light; others, of darkneſs: theſe are ſubject to vanity, becauſe they run headlong in<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o darkneſs, and inthrall themſelves in eternal puniſhments for their rebellion. Their Kingdome is partly very beautiful in tranſitory and corruptible things on the one part, becauſe it cannot conſiſt without ſome vertue and great gifts of God; and partly moſt filthy and horrid to be ſpoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it aboundeth with all wickedneſs and ſin, idolatry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, blaſphemies againſt the true God and his works, worſhipping of devils, diſobedience towards Magiſtrates, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, homicides, robberies, tyranny, adulteries, wicked luſts, rapes, thefts, lyes, perjuries, pride, and a covetous deſire of rule; in this mixture conſiſteth the kingdome of darkneſs: but the creatures of the light, are filled with eternal truth, and with the grace of God, and are Lords of the whole world, and do reign over the Lords of darkneſs, as the members of Chriſt. Between theſe and the other, there is a continual war, untill God ſhall put an end to their ſtrife, by his laſt judgment.</p>

                  <p>Therefore Magick is twofold in its firſt diviſion; the one is of God, which he beſtoweth on the creatures of light; the other alſo is of God, but it is the gift which he giveth unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of darkneſs: and this is alſo two-fold: the one is to a good end, as when the Princes of darkneſs are compelled to do good unto the creatures, God enforcing them; the other is for an evil end, when God permitteth ſuch to puniſh evil perſons, that magically they are deceived to deſtruction; or, alſo he commandeth ſuch to be caſt out into deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond diviſion of Magick is, that it bringeth to paſs ſome works with viſible inſtruments, through viſible things; and it effecteth other works with inviſible inſtruments by inviſible things; and it acteth other things, aſwel with mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means, as inſtruments and effects.</p>
                  <p>The third diviſion is, There are ſome things which are brought to paſs by invocation of God alone: this is partly Prophetical, and Philoſophical, and partly as it were The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophraſtical.</p>
                  <p>Other things there are, which by reaſon of the ignorance of the true God, are done with the Princes of Spirits, that his deſires may be fulfilled; ſuch is the work of the Mercurialiſts.</p>
                  <p>The fourth diviſion is, That ſome exerciſe their Magick with the good Angels in ſtead of God, as it were deſcending down from the moſt high God: ſuch was the Magick of <hi>Baalim</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Magick is, that which exerciſeth their actions with the chief of the evil Spirits; ſuch were they who wrought by the minor Gods of the heathens.</p>
                  <p>The fifth diviſion is, That ſome do act with Spirits openly, and face to face; which is given to few: others do work by dreams and other ſignes; which the ancients took from their auguries and ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth diviſion is, That ſome work by immortal creatures, others by mortal creatures, as Nymphs, Satyrs, and ſuch like inhabitants of other elements, Pigmies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeventh diviſion is, That the Spirits do ſerve ſome of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93270:106"/>
their own accord, without art; others they will ſcarce attend, being called by art.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe ſpecies of Magick, that is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all, which dependeth upon God alone. The ſecond, Them whom the Spirits do ſerve faithfully of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. The third is, that which is the property of Chriſtians, which dependeth on the power of Chriſt which he hath in heaven and earth.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="39" type="aphorism">
                  <head>Aphor. <hi>39.</hi> There is a ſeven-fold preparation to learn the Magick Art.</head>
                  <p>The firſt is, to meditate day and night how to attain to the true knowledge of God, both by his word revealed from the foundation of the world; as alſo by the ſeal of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and of the creatures; and by the wonderful effects which the viſible and inviſible creatures of God do ſhew forth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is requiſite, that a man deſcend down into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and chiefly ſtudy to know himſelf; what mortal part he hath in him, and what immortal; and what part is proper to himſelf, and what diverſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he learn by the immortal part of himſelf, to worſhip, love and fear the eternal God, and to adore him in Spirit and Truth; and with his mortal part, to do thoſe things which he knoweth to be acceptable to God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to his neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the three firſt and chiefeſt precepts of Magick, wherewith let every one prepare himſelf that covets to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain true Magick or divine wiſdome, that he may be accounted worthy thereof, and one to whom the Angelical creatures willingly do ſervice, not occultly onely, but alſo manifeſtly, and as it were face to face.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whereas every man is vigilant to ſee to what kinde of life he ſhall be called from his mothers womb, that every one may know whether he be born to Magick, and to what ſpecies thereof; which every one may perceive eaſily that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93270:107"/>
readeth theſe things, and by experience may have ſucceſs therein; for ſuch things and ſuch gifts are not given but onely to the low and humble.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place we are to take care, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand when the Spirits are aſſiſting us, in undertaking the greateſt buſineſs; and he that underſtands this, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he ſhall be made a Magician of the ordination of God; that is, ſuch a perſon who uſeth the miniſtery of the Spirits to bring excellent things to paſs. Here, as for the moſt part, they ſin either through negligence, ignorance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or by too much ſuperſtition; they offend alſo by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude towards God, whereby many famous men have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards drawn upon themſelves deſtruction: they ſin alſo by raſhneſs and obſtinacy; and alſo when they do not uſe their gifts for that honour of God which is required, and do prefer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Magician had need of faith and taciturnity, eſpecially, that he diſcloſe no ſecret which the Spirit hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him, as he commanded <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſeal ſome things, that is, not to declare them in publick; ſo as it was not lawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak openly of all things which he ſaw in a viſion. No man will believe how much is contained in this one precept.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In him that would be a Magician, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greateſt juſtice, that he undertake nothing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, wicked or unjuſt, nor to let it once come in his minde; and ſo he ſhall be divinely defended from all evil.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>Aphor. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>When the Magician determineth with himſelf to do any incorporeal thing, either with any exteriour or interiour ſenſe, then let him govern himſelf according to theſe ſeven ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent laws, to accompliſh his Magical end.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Law is this, That he know that ſuch a Spirit is ordained unto him from God; and let him meditate that God is the beholder of all his thoughts and actions; therefore let him direct all the courſe of his life according to the rule preſcribed in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:93270:107"/>Secondly, Alwaies pray with <hi>David, Take not thy holy Spirit from me; and ſtrengthen me with thy free Spirit; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: I beſeech thee, O heavenly Father, do not give power unto any lying Spirit, as thou didſt over</hi> Ahab <hi>that he periſhed; but keep me in thy truth.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let him accuſtome himſelf to try the Spirits, as the Scripture admoniſheth; for grapes cannot be gathered of thorns: let us try all things, and hold faſt that which is good and laudable, that we may avoid every thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the divine power.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, To be remote and clear from all manner of ſuperſtition; for this is ſuperſtition, to attribute divinity in this place to things, wherein there is nothing at all divine; or to chuſe or frame to our ſelves, to worſhip God with ſome kinde of worſhip which he hath not commanded: ſuch are the Magical ceremonies of Satan, whereby he impudently offereth himſelf to be worſhipped as God.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing to be eſchewed, is all worſhip of Idols, which bindeth any divine power to idols or other things of their own proper motion, where they are not placed by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, or by the order of Nature: which things many falſe and wicked Magicians faign.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, All the deceitful imitations and affections of the devil are alſo to be avoided, whereby he imitateth the power of the creation and of the Creator, that he may ſo produce things with a word, that they may not be what they are. Which belongeth onely to the omnipotency of God, and is not communicable to the creature.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Let us cleave faſt to the gifts of God, and of his holy Spirit, that we may know them, and diligently embrace them with our whole heart, and all our ſtrength.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place it is to be obſerved, what we underſtand by Magician in this work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93270:108"/>Him then we count to be a Magician, to whom by the grace of God, the ſpiritual eſſences do ſerve to manifeſt the knowledge of the whole univerſe, and of the ſecrets of Nature contained therein, whether they are viſible or inviſible. This deſcription of a Magician plainly appeareth, and is univerſal.</p>
                  <p>An evil Magician is he, whom by the divine permiſſion the evil Spirits do ſerve, to his temporal and eternal deſtruction and perdition, to deceive men, and draw them away from God; ſuch was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of whom mention is made in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and in <hi>Clemens;</hi> whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> commanded to be thrown down upon the earth, when as he had commanded himſelf, as it were a God, to be raiſed up into the air by the unclean Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Unto this order are alſo to be referred all thoſe who are noted in the two Tables of the Law; and are ſet forth with their evil deeds.</p>
                  <p>The ſubdiviſions and ſpecies of both kindes of Magick, we will note in the Tomes following. In this place it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that we diſtinguiſh the Sciences, which is good, and which is evil: Whereas man ſought to obtain them both at firſt, to his own ruine and deſtruction, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Hermes</hi> do demonſtrate.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to know, That a Magician is a perſon predeſtinated to this work from his mothers wombe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him aſſume any ſuch great things to himſelf, unleſs he be called divinely by grace hereunto, for ſome good end; to a bad end is, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>It muſt be that offences will come; but wo be to that man through whom they come.</hi> Therefore, as we have before oftentimes admoniſhed, With fear and trembling we muſt live in this world.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding I will not deny, but that ſome men may with ſtudy and diligence obtain ſome ſpecies of both kindes of Magick, if it may be admitted. But he ſhall never aſpire to the higheſt kindes thereof; yet if he covet to aſſail them, he ſhall doubtleſs offend both in ſoul

and body, Such are they, who by the operations of falſe Magicians, are ſometimes carried to Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or in ſome wilderneſs, or deſarts; or they are maimed in ſome member, or are ſimply torn in pieces, or are deprived of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; even as many ſuch things happen by the uſe thereof where men are forſaken by God, and delivered to the power of Satan.</p>

                  <p>The Lord liveth, and the works of God do live in him by his appointment, whereby he willeth them to be; for he will have them to uſe their liberty in obedience to his commands, or diſobedience thereof. To the obedient, he hath propoſed their rewards; to the diſobedient he hath propounded their deſerved puniſhment. Therefore theſe Spirits of their free-will, through their pride and contempt of the Son of God, have revolted from God their Creator, and are reſerved unto the day of wrath; and there is left in them a very great power in the creation; but notwithſtanding it is limited, and they are confined to their bounds with the bridle of God. Therefore the Magician of God, which ſignifies a wiſe man of God, or one informed of God, is led forth by the hand of God unto all everlaſting good, both mean things, and alſo the chiefeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things.</p>
                  <p>Great is the power of Satan, by reaſon of the great ſins of men. Therefore alſo the Magicians of Satan do perform great things, and greater then any man would believe: although they do ſubſiſt in their own limits, nevertheleſs they are above all humane apprehenſion, as to the corporal and tranſitory things of this life; which many ancient Hiſtories, and daily Examples do teſtifie. Both kindes of Magick are different one from the other in their ends: the one leadeth to eternal good, and uſeth temporal things with thankſgiving; the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93270:109"/>
other is a little ſollicitous about eternal things; but wholly exerciſeth himſelf about corporal things, that he may freely enjoy all his luſts and delights in contempt of God and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                  <p>The paſſage from the common life of man unto a Magical life, is no other but a ſleep from that life, and an awaking to this life; for thoſe things which happen to ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe men in their common life, the ſame things happen to the willing and knowing Magician.</p>
                  <p>The Magician underſtandeth when the minde doth meditate of himſelf; he deliberateth, reaſoneth, conſtituteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth what is to be done; he obſerveth when his cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do proceed from a divine ſeparate eſſence, and he proveth of what order that divine ſeparate eſſence is.</p>
                  <p>But the man that is ignorant of Magick, is carried to and fro, as it were in war with his affections; he knoweth not when they iſſue out of his own minde, or are impreſſed by the aſſiſting eſſence; and he knoweth not how to overthrow the counſels of his enemies by the word of God, or to keep himſelf from the ſnares and deceits of the tempter.</p>

                  <p>The greateſt precept of Magick is, to know what every man ought to receive for his uſe from the aſſiſting Spirit; and what to refuſe: which he may learn of the Pſalmiſt, ſaying, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? in keeping thy word, Oh Lord.</hi> To keep the word of God, ſo that the evil one ſnatch it not out of the heart, is the cheifeſt precept of wiſdom. It is lawful to admit of, and exerciſe other ſuggeſtions which are not contrary to the glory of God, and charity towards our neighbours, not inquiring from what Spirit ſuch ſuggeſtions proceed: But we ought to take heed, that we are not too much buſied about unneceſſary things, according to the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Chriſt; <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art troubled about many things; but Mary hath choſen the better part, which ſhall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93270:109"/>
not be taken from her.</hi> Therefore let us alwaies have regard unto the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> All other things, that is, all things which are due to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Microcoſme, as food, raiment, and the neceſſary arts of this life.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing ſo much becometh a man, as conſtancy in his words and deeds, and when the like rejoyceth in his like; there are none more happy then ſuch, becauſe the holy Angels are converſant about ſuch, and poſſeſs the cuſtody of them: on the contrary, men that are unconſtant are lighter then nothing, and rotten leaves. We chuſe the 46 Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme from theſe. Even as every one governeth himſelf, ſo he allureth unto himſelf Spirits of his nature and condition; but one very truely adviſeth, that no man ſhould carry himſelf beyond his own calling, leſt that he draw unto himſelf ſome malignant Spirit from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, by whom either he ſhall be infatuated and deceived, or brought to final deſtruction. This precept appeareth moſt plainly: for <hi>Midas,</hi> when he would convert all things into gold, drew up ſuch a Spirit unto himſelf, which was able to perform this; and being deceived by him, he had been brought to death by famine, if his fooliſhneſs had not been corrected by the mercy of God. The ſame thing happened to a certain woman about <hi>Fanck ford</hi> at <hi>Odera,</hi> in our times, who would ſcrape together and devour mony of any thing. Would that men would diligently weigh this precept, and not account the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of <hi>Midas,</hi> and the like, for fables; they would be much more diligent in moderating their thoughts and affections, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they be ſo perpetually vexed with the Spirits of the golden mountains of <hi>Utopia.</hi> Therefore we ought moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to obſerve, that ſuch preſumptions ſhould be caſt out of the mind, by the word, while they are new; neither let them have any habit in the idle minde, that is empty of the divine word.</p>

                  <p>He that is faithfully converſant in his vocation, ſhall have alſo the Spirits conſtant companions of his deſires, who will ſucceſſively ſupply him in all things.

Examples are not wanting in the Hiſtories of the whole World; and do daily happen in the world. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> before the victory of <hi>Arbogaſtus,</hi> is an example of the good; <hi>Brute</hi> before he was ſlain, was an example of the evil Spirits, when he was perſecuted of the Spirit of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and expoſed to puniſhment, that he ſlew himſelf, who had ſlain his own Father, and the Father of his Country.</p>

                  <p>All Magick is a revelation of Spirits of that kinde, of which ſort the Magick is; ſo that the nine Muſes are called, in <hi>Heſiod,</hi> the ninth Magick, as he manifeſtly teſtifies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Theogony.</hi> In <hi>Homer,</hi> the genius of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in <hi>Pſigioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.

                  <p>The concluſion therefore of this <hi>Iſagoge</hi> is the ſame which we have above already ſpoken of, That even as there is one God, from whence is all good; and one ſin, to wit, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience againſt the will of the commanding God, from whence comes all evil; ſo that <hi>the fear of God is the beginning of all wiſdom,</hi> and the profit of all Magick; for obedience to the will of God, followeth the fear of God; and after this, do follow the preſence of God and of the holy Spirit, and the miniſtery of the holy Angels, and all good things out of the inexhauſtible treaſures of God.</p>
                  <p>But unprofitable and damnable Magick ariſeth from this; where we loſe the fear of God out of our hearts, and ſuffer ſin to reign in us, there the Prince of this world, the God of this world beginneth, and ſetteth up his kingdom in ſtead of holy things, in ſuch as he findeth profitable for his kingdom; there, even as the ſpider taketh the flye which falleth into his web, ſo Satan ſpreadeth abroad his nets, and taketh man with the ſnares of covetouſneſs, until he ſucketh him, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to eternal fire: theſe he cheriſheth and advanceth on high, that their fall may be the greater.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Reader, apply thy eyes and minde to the ſacred and profane Hiſtories, &amp; to thoſe things which thou ſeeſt daily to be done in the world, and thou ſhalt finde all things full of Magick, according to a two-fold Science, good and evil; which that they may be the better diſcerned, we will put here their diviſion and ſubdiviſion, for the concluſion of theſe <hi>Iſagoges;</hi> wherein every one may contemplate, what is to be followed, and which to be avoided, and how far it is to be laboured for by every one, to a competent end of life and living.</p>
