            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Oh, that I had ne'r been born,</l>
               <l>or being born had dyed juſt then,</l>
               <l>Each Virgin will hold me in ſcorn,</l>
               <l>and ſhall be ſcoff'd by all young-men,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With ſighs,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>At ſix months end ſhe could perceive,</l>
               <l>her belly ſwell'd and big did grow,</l>
               <l>The Babe within her womb did ſtrive,</l>
               <l>and friends begun the cauſe to know,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With ſighs,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Poor <hi>Iſabel</hi> diſtreſt with grief,</l>
               <l>laments her folly, but too late,</l>
               <l>Inſtead of giving her relief,</l>
               <l>her friends do proſecute their hate.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With ſighs,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>But ſhe not able to indure,</l>
               <l>their anger and her own diſgrace,</l>
               <l>Reſolves to find a ſpeedy cure,</l>
               <l>in ſome convenient private place.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With ſighs,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>With this ſad reſolution bent,</l>
               <l>ſhe takes a dagger in her hand,</l>
               <l>'Twill make a heart of ſtone relent,</l>
               <l>the truth of this to underſtand.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With ſighs,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>She prays that heaven would her forgive,</l>
               <l>then to her heart her dagger ſent.</l>
               <l>And down ſhe dropt, let thoſe that live,</l>
               <l>take care betimes, and all repent.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>At laſt ſhe cry'd,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Lord <hi>Wigmore</hi> hearing of this deed,</l>
               <l>he never more had quiet reſt,</l>
               <l>His guilty heart did in him bleed:</l>
               <l>and privately his ſins confeſt.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fair <hi>Iſabel</hi> forgive, and I</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Will pine with ſorrow till I dye.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I muſt confeſs I did thee wrong,</l>
               <l>and openly will it proclaim,</l>
               <l>Let all young-men that hear this ſong,</l>
               <l>take care they ne'r commit the ſame,</l>
