         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving viewed ſome little in a late Diurnall, of the great activity of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Governour of Ruſhall in Staffordſhire; I was deſirous to make a more true relation of what was then publiſhed, and ſo ſignifie divers later paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the end that that faithful ſervant of the Parliament might be better obſerved, and his worthy acts (formerly too much neglected) might now be publiſhed, who upon the fourteenth of this inſtant Iune, with his ſmall Troop coaſting the Countrey (according to his conſtant cuſtome) for the ſecuritie thereof, diſcovered a partie of the enemies Forces, having a Coach, and a number of Horſe guarding the ſame towards Liechfield, whom this noble ſpirit ſaluted with ſo hot a charge, that in ſhort time he made him maſter thereof, wherein was the younger ſonne of Sir Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Devereux, whom the enemies had taken, and were carrying him to Liechfield: For his elder brother having beaten up the enemies Quarters at Lye Court where Captaine Debdale, a Peſtilent plundering perſon in Liechfield, loſt the moſt part of his horſes, and fled to Worceſter, and procured a partie of horſe to fetch in Sir Gualter Devereux his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſonne, intending to keep him priſoner untill all their Horſes and Armes were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: But the unconquered Champions of Ruſhall daſhed their hopes, reſcued the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ceized the Coach, with many priſoners and brave horſes, and forced the reſt to flie, leaving theîr luggage and portmantues, amongſt which were ſome belonging to the ſaid Debdale, and the Lord Carington, who eſcaped very narrowly. The ſaid garriſon of Ruſhall hath been now lately faced twice, and once ſummoned by the Kings forces: But the later time they ſallied out and encountred them, and tooke two good horſes and one Souldier, and ſince that went to the very towne of Liechfield, and took a Lieutenant, and three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſoners, with three very good horſes. It is much deſired for the ſafety of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and keeping the way open betwixt London and the Northweſt parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the Garriſon of Ruſhall were more countenanced, and the number of Horſe therein augmented.</p>
