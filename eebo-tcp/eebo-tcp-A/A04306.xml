            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">I being at Oxon: and not knowing that my father was
either dead, or sicke, neare about the time he dyed,
dreamed hee was dead; and the impression was so
violent, that it awoke me; and being awake, I found
that, that dreamed-sorrow had caused reall teares,
which had strangely wet even the pillow where my
head lay.</head>
            <l>IT was 'ith' night, when the earth's gloomy shade</l>
            <l>Involved had our hemisphere, and made</l>

            <l>Then in the dead of night, when sleepe did close</l>
            <l>My weary eyes, and nature did compose</l>
            <l>My outward limbes to rest, then did I see</l>
            <l>Strange apparitions, and a Tragedie</l>

            <l>The scene was changed, and amid the throng</l>
            <l>My father was to die: it was his fate</l>
            <l>(As I conceiv'd) onely to personate</l>

And act a funerall; onely to die</l>

            <l>My dearest father dead, cold dead, and wee</l>
            <l>All mourning by him; when anon they call</l>
            <l>Away, away, come to the funerall.</l>
            <l>And then o'rwhelm'd with woe, a thousand feares</l>

            <l>From true, not fained sorrow; though to me</l>
            <l>The ground was onely dreame, and phantasie.</l>
            <l>All this I dream'd, and neare about that day,</l>

            <l>ON whom shall I these blubbered lines bestow,</l>

            <l>And on you chiefly, for your secret woe</l>
            <l>The burthen of our griefe doth undergoe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:15199:6"/>
We but as strangers on the shore lament</l>
            <l>A common shipwracke: you that vessell rent,</l>
            <l>To whom such love and dutie you did owe,</l>
            <l>What wonder if your griefes doe overflow?</l>
            <l>But spare your teares, though you have cause to mone,</l>
            <l>Yet to persist in sorrow you have none.</l>
            <l>You see beneath the circuit of the sunne,</l>
            <l>All that's made best is instantly undone.</l>
            <l>Perhaps the greater is your happinesse,</l>
            <l>Because to you it seemeth to be lesse.</l>
            <l>It's ill to be too well, ease is disease,</l>
            <l>And deadly too, in parts that death doth seize.</l>
            <l>Then when in any part of us we joy</l>
            <l>More then we should; lest that might us destroy,</l>
            <l>Heav'n takes it quickly off (as 'twere by stealth)</l>
            <l>And by the want supplies our want of health.</l>
            <l>Wipe off those teares, sing Hallelujahs rather,</l>
            <l>Greive that you lost, joy that so good, a father.</l>
            <l>So good said I? stay muse and that rehearse,</l>
            <l>Here is a subject fitting for thy verse.</l>
            <l>Too good for us, with graces so inspir'd,</l>
            <l>Such heavenly mould the Angels long desir'd,</l>
            <l>And therefore they so quickly did transport</l>
            <l>His Saint-like soule, to their celestiall Court.</l>
            <l>There was no copper in this minerall,</l>
            <l>Not counterfeit, nor hypocriticall:</l>
            <l>With friends or strangers he us'd no disguise,</l>
            <l>His words, his thoughts, his deeds did symbolize.</l>
            <l>No harder yron did his temper marre,</l>
            <l>Malice to none, no envie, hatred, jarre.</l>
            <l>Friendly he was, soft, milde to all; and more</l>
            <l>Unkind unto himselfe, then to the poore.</l>
            <l>So just, so wise, s'upright in every thing,</l>
            <l>As stopt the venome of foule envies sting.</l>
            <l>A husband deare, a father tender, kinde,</l>
            <l>Though not in gifts, yet in a bounteous minde</l>

Exceeding most, nay all of his estate,</l>

            <l>More to those that feed sheep, or hew a blocke,</l>

            <l>Had wrong'd thee, in exalting thee; and bin</l>
            <l>Unmercifull, that from these times of sin</l>
            <l>Hath free'd thy longing soule. Alas wee know</l>
            <l>'Twas time for thee, for heaven long agoe.</l>
            <l>'Tis for our sakes we weepe; for whom God stay'd</l>
            <l>And held thy soule off; and this burden lay'd</l>
            <l>Of a long life upon thee, that so wee</l>
            <l>Might by thy stay be drawne for companie,</l>
            <l>That now are punisht in thy blisse, and see</l>
            <l>Gods wrath to us in being good to thee.</l>
            <l>To us thou still dyest young, and this thy slight</l>
            <l>Seemes earely taken, though not ta'ne till night.</l>
            <l>To our desires alas! what's one short span</l>
            <l>Whole natures date, for want of thee good man?</l>
            <l>Whom many dayes and yeares, yea no time could</l>
            <l>Make tedious to us; whom no age make old.</l>
            <l>But is he dead then? true, nay false it is,</l>
            <l>He did not dye, that in eternall blisse</l>
            <l>For life of comfort, chang'd but lifes annoy,</l>
            <l>And thus he dyed, and thus he lives in joy.</l>
            <l>Hee dyed in shew then; but yet lives indeed</l>
            <l>In heaven, and hearts of good men. Dy'd, to speed</l>
            <l>Of glory here: and in that surer place</l>
            <l>To weare a crowne of ever living grace.</l>
            <l>Then dye hee never can while vertue lives,</l>
            <l>For He and She are still correlatives.</l>

            <head>Vpon the lamented death of Richard Barlow,
late of Langill in VVestmooreland, who dyed
December 29. 1636. his sicknes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with a cold, and shortly after
he, and it ending with a fever.</head>
            <l>WIthin the bowels of this sacred earth</l>
            <l>Lyes one, as of no high, so no vile birth.</l>
            <l>His fortunes like to vertue, kept the meane,</l>
            <l>Not puff'd with this, nor pinch'd with that extreame.</l>
            <l>When he in peace had threescore yeares drawne breath,</l>
            <l>(Belov'd as farre as knowne) nature, not death</l>
            <l>With solemne joy ceas'd on him as a price,</l>
            <l>Glad she for heaven had such a sacrifice.</l>
            <l>Flames are to others tortures, but they come</l>
            <l>To him as triumph, or a martyrdome.</l>
            <l>He (like <hi>Elias</hi>) round begirt with fire,</l>
            <l>Ascended heaven; flames must needs aspire.</l>
            <l>His fever had not heat from surfet, passion,</l>
            <l>Or lust, the three inflamers now in fashion,</l>
            <l>But (as the purest fire the <hi>Chimicks</hi> hold</l>
            <l>Is forc'd from ice) was kindled with a cold.</l>
            <l>Had it beene rage of common heat, no doubt</l>
            <l>But his deare childrens teares had put it out.</l>
            <l>Although he doe in sixe * faire Emblems stand</l>
            <l>Transcrib'd to future ages: yet this land</l>
            <l>(The heat of his death generating) shall</l>
            <l>See that he multiplyed at's funerall;</l>
            <l>The good example of his life and fate</l>
            <l>Shall happ'ly all the vertues propagate.</l>
