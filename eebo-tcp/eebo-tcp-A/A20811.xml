            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THat at first I made choise of this argument, I haue not as
yet repented mee, for if the Muse haue not much abused
me, it was most worthy to haue found a more worthy pen
then mine owne; for the <hi>Barrons warres,</hi> (omitting the
qualitie of those Armes, whereof I haue not heere to speake) were
surely as well for their length in continuance, as for theyr mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
bloodshed, and multitude of horrid accidents, meet matter
for trumpet or tragedy. Therefore as at first the dignity of the
thing was the motiue of the dooing, so the cause of this my second
greater labour was the insufficient handling of the first, which
though it were more then boldnesse to venture on so noble an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
without leisure, and studie competent, eyther of which
trauaile hardly affoords; yet the importunitie of friends made
mee contrary to mine owne iudgement take, vndertake, &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it so as the world hath seene; but heerin I intend not to be too
exact, as if either it needed to much excuse (knowing that euen
as it was, it ought to haue passed for better then some would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
who can hardly thinke any thing hath sauour but their own,
though neuer so vnsauorie) or as if I should seeme now to haue
excelled my selfe, and failing in my hopes be kept without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
<hi>Grammaticasters</hi> haue quarreld at the title of <hi>Mortime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riados,</hi>
as if it had beene a sin against <hi>Syntaxis</hi> to haue inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
it in the second case, but not theyr idle reproofe hath made
me now abstaine from fronting it by the name of <hi>Mortimer</hi> at
<pb facs="tcp:10435:3"/>
all, but the same better aduise which hath caused me to alter the
whole; And where before the stanza was of seauen lines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there are two couplets, as in this figure appeareth,
<figure/>
the often harmonie thereof softned the verse more then the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of the subiect would permit, vnlesse they had all been Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
or couplets. Therefore (but not without new fashioning the
whole frame) I chose <hi>Ariostos</hi> stanza of all other the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
and best proportioned, consisting of eight, sixe interwouen,
and a couplet in base.
<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>The Quadrin doth neuer double, or to vse a word of Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,
neuer bringeth foorth Gemells. The Quinzain too soone.
The Sestin hath Twinnes in the base, but they detaine not the
Musicke, nor the Cloze (as Musitions terme it) long enough for
an Epick Poem; The stanza of seauen is touched before; This of
eight both holds the tune cleaue through to the base of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne
(which is the couplet at the foote or bottom) &amp; closeth not
but with a full satisfaction to the eare for so long detention.</p>
            <p>Briefely, this sort of stanza hath in it maiestie, perfection, &amp;
soliditie, resembling the piller which in Architecture is called
the Tuscan, whose shaft is of sixe diameters, &amp; bases of two. The
<pb facs="tcp:10435:4"/>
other reasons this place will not beare, but generally all stanzas
are in my opinion but tyrants, and torturers, when they make
inuention obey theyr number, which sometime would otherwise
scantle it selfe. A fault that great Maisters in this Art striue to
auoyde. Concerning the deuision which I vse in this Poem, I am
not ignorant that antiquitie hath vsed to distinguish workes into
Bookes, and euery one to beare the number of theyr order, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Iliads,</hi> and <hi>Vlysiads</hi> indeede are distinguished by seuerall
letters of the Greeke Alphabet, as all the world knowes, and not
by the numerall letters onely, which to Iota are digit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
compound, the Alpha beeing our vnit, for the Greekes had
no figures nor cyphers in their Arithmeticke. <hi>Virgils AEneis,
Statius Thebais, Silius</hi> worke of the Carthagenian war, <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Argonauticks, Vidas Christeis,</hi> are all deuided into books.
The Italians vse Cantos, &amp; so our first late great Reformer Ma.
<hi>Spenser,</hi> that I assume another name for the sections in this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
cannot be disgratious, nor vnauowable.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if I haue not already exceeded the length of an Epistle,
I am to intreat, that he who wil (as any man may that wil) make
himselfe a party to this of ours, would be pleased to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber that
<hi>Spartan</hi> Prince who beeing found by certaine Embassadors play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among his children, requested them to forbeare to censure til
also they had some of their owne. To such I giue a sample power
and priuiledge as euer <hi>Ius liberorum</hi> could in Rome, crauing
backe againe at their hands by a regrant, the like of that which
I impart, for great reason there is that they should vndergoe the
licence which themselues challenge, &amp; suffer that in their fames
which they would wrongly put vpon others, according to the
most indifferent law of the <hi>Talio.</hi> Fare you well.</p>

            <p>SEeing these Epistles are now to the world made publique, it
is imagined that I ought to bee accountable of my priuate
meaning, cheefely for mine owne discharge, least beeing
misttaken, I fall in hazard of a iust and vniuersall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
for.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Hae nugae feria ducent</l>
               <l>In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Three poynts are especially therefore to be explained. First,
why I entitle this worke <hi>Englands heriocall Epistles;</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> why
I obserue not the persons dignitie in the dedication; lastly, why
I haue annexed notes to euery Epistles end. For the first, the title
I hope carrieth reason in it selfe, for that the most and greatest
persons herein were English, or else, that theyr loues were obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in England. And though (heriocall) be properly vnderstood
of demi-gods, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>AEneas,</hi> whose parents were
said to be the one celestiall, the other mortall, yet is it also trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to them, who for the greatnes of mind come neere to Gods.
For to be borne of a celestiall <hi>Incubus,</hi> is nothing else but to haue
a great and mightie spirit, farre aboue the earthly weakenesse of
men, in which sence <hi>Ouid</hi> (whose imitator I partly professe to
be) doth also vse heroicall. For the second, seeing none to whom
I haue dedicated any two Epistles, but haue theyr states ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched
by them who are made to speake in the Epistles, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the order is in dedication, yet in respect of their degrees in my
deuotion, and the cause before recited, I hope they suffer no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,
seeing euery one is the first in theyr particuler inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb facs="tcp:10435:83"/>
hauing in some sort, sorted the complexion of the Epistles,
to the character of theyr iudgements to whom I dedicate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
onely the blamefulnesse of the persons passion, in those
poynts wherein the passion is blamefull. Lastly, such manifest
difference being betwixt euery one of them, where or howsoeuer
they be marshalled, how can I be iustly appeached of vnaduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For the third, because the worke might in truth be iudged
brainish, if nothing but amorous humor were handled therein, I
haue enter wouen matters historicall, which vnexplaned, might
defraud the minde of much content, as for example, in Queene
<hi>Margarites</hi> Epistle to <hi>VVilliam dela Pole,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Daizie flower, which once perfum'd the ayre,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margarite</hi> in French signifies a Daizie, which for the allusion
to her name, this Queene did giue for her deuise; and this as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more, haue seemed to me not vnworthy the explaning.</p>
            <p>Now, though no doubt I had neede to excuse other thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
yet these most especially, the rest I ouerpasse to eschue tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
recitall, or to speake as malicious enuy may, for that in truth
I ouersee them. If they be as harmlesly taken as I meant them, it
shall suffice to haue onely t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MAdam, after all the admired wits of this excellent
age, which haue laboured in the sad complaints of
faire and vnfortunate <hi>Rosamond,</hi> and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of inuention, haue sounded the depth of her
sundry passions; I present to your Ladiship this Epistle of hers to
King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom I may rather call her louer then beloued.
Heere must your Ladishippe behold variablenes in resolution;
woes constantly grounded; laments abruptly broken off; much
confidence, no certainty, words begetting teares, teares confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
matter, large complaints in little papers; and many defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
cares, in one vniformed Epistle. I striue not to effect singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
yet would faine flie imitation, &amp; prostrate mine own wants
to other mens perfections. Your iudiciall eye must modell foorth
what my pen hath layd together, much would she say to a King,
much would I say to a Countesse, but that the methed of my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
must conclude the modesty of hers, which I wish may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my euer vowed seruice to your honour.</p>

contrarie is true. Yet may <hi>Bandello</hi> be very well excused as beeing a
stranger, whose errors in the truth of our historie are not so materiall,
that they should neede an inuectiue, least his wit should be defrauded
of any part of his due, which were not lesse were euery part a fiction.
Howbeit, least a common errour should preuaile against a truth these
Epistles are conceiued in those persons who were indeed the actors:
to wit, <hi>Edward</hi> surnamed that <hi>Black Prince,</hi> not so much of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
as of the dismall battels which he fought in Fraunce, (in like
sence as we may say a black day) for some tragicall euent, though the
sunne shine neuer so bright therein. And <hi>Alice</hi> the Countesse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,
who as it is certaine was beloued of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> so it is as
certaine that many points now current in the receiued story can neuer
hold together, with likelihood of such enforcement, had it not been
shewed vnder the title of a King.</p>
                  <q>And when thou let'st downe that transparent lid.</q>
                  <p>Not that the lid is transparent, for no part of the skin is transparent,
but for the gemme which that closure is sayd to containe is transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
for otherwise how could the mind vnderstand by the eye, should
not the images slide through the same, and replenish the stage of the
fantasie? but this belongs to <hi>Opticks.</hi> The Latines call the eye lid
<hi>cilium</hi> (I will not say of <hi>celande</hi>) as the eye brow <hi>supercilium,</hi> and the
haire on the eye lyds <hi>palpebra,</hi> perhaps <hi>quod palpitet,</hi> all which haue
their distinct and necessary vses.</p>

dedication. It is seated by custome (from which wee are
now bolde to assume authoritie) to beare the names of our
friends vpon the fronts of our bookes, as Gentlemen vse to set

<hi>Heroes</hi> and braue spirits of the old world, which were desirous
to bee thought to patronize learning; and men in requitall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the names of those braue Princes. But I thinke some after,
put the names of great men in their bookes, for that men shoulde
say there was some thing good, onely because indeed their names
stoode there; But for mine owne part, (not to dissemble) I find no
such vertue in any of theyr great titles to doe so much for anie

loue you, &amp; in good faith, worthy of all loue I thinke you, which

of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, King of England, sirnamed <hi>Bulling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke.</hi>
This noble Duke for his great wisedome and iustice
called the good, was by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift (brother to this
Duke) at his death appointed Protector of the Land, during
the nonage of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt; this <hi>Elinor</hi> Duches of Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
a proud and ambitious woman, knowing that if young

called <hi>Onely,</hi> a great Magitian) <hi>Hun</hi> a priest, and
<hi>Iourdane</hi> witch of Eye, by sorcery to make away the king, &amp;

in the Ile of Man, from whence she writeth this Epistle.</p>

               <l>ME thinks not knowing, who these lines should send,</l>
