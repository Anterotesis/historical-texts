            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIs pretended by every one that chooſeth a Patron, that either the Worth or good Nature of the Perſon hath determined him to that choice; He profeſſeth that He hath very mean thoughts of his own performance, and ſo ſtands in need of a Protector: He begs a Name whoſe Luſter might ſhed ſome Reputation on his Work, or elſe hath been oblig'd,

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>QUintilian</hi> in the Firſt Book of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> inſtructs the Young Orator what to read, and after <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are chiefly commended to his Study; He tells him, That conſiderable improvement may be made from the <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poets, but there is great Care to be taken in the choice, ſome ſelect parts only out of each Author to be permitted Youths: And he ſays particularly of <hi>Horace,</hi> That He would not have all in Him interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: What He means by <hi>Interpretation,</hi> is evident to every one that underſtands the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the word, and the Antients Method of inſtructing: and why this Caution is reſtrain'd to the <hi>Odes,</hi> and not apply'd to the <hi>Satyrs</hi> as well, ſince the reaſon upon which He fixes it ſeems common to both must be taken from the deſign and ſubject matter of the Poems; To deſcribe and reform a vitious man, neceſſarily
<pb facs="tcp:32633:5"/>
requires ſome expreſsions which an <hi>Ode</hi> can never want: The Paint which an Artiſt uſes muſt be agreeable to the Piece which He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; <hi>Satyr</hi> is to inſtruct, and that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a knowledge and diſcovery of the Crime; Whilst <hi>Odes</hi> are made only to delight and pleaſe, and therefore every thing in them that justly offends is unpardonable. In our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Schools this Rule of <hi>Quintilian</hi> is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly neglected, all is permitted to every Eye, and laid open to the dullest ſight by the most ſhameful Notes that can be pen'd: You may ſee a Grammarian with a demure mouth cry out, <hi>O Foedum!</hi> at a looſe expreſsion, and yet preſently fill a Page with a more fulſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and the deſign of all his pains is only to indulge a petulant Humor, or aſsist the lazy Ignorance of the common Inſtructors of our Youth: If any ſhould reckon this amongſt the conſiderable Cauſes of the Corruptions of our Manners, certainly all thoſe would aſſent, who ſee that a Stream will be foul when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf is muddy: Nor is this a ſingle opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as is evident from their happy induſtry, who have corrected ſome of our Authors, and
<pb facs="tcp:32633:5"/>
ſent them abroad naked, and uncorrupted with forreign Notes; This Method as it ſpares the Modeſty of the Youth, ſo it must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable improvement to his Parts, ſince his Mind and Memory, and not only his Eye must be employ'd: I am bound thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Pious Care of Mr. <hi>Thomas Curgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> now of <hi>Shirburn</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> in this matter, He did not want, or if he had, His Vertue and Induſtry had contemn'd, ſuch helps, having ſearcht into the Secrets of the Claſsicks, and being an excellent Example of unweary'd Diligence, and regular Carriage to All under his Tuition: To his Inſtruction I owe what at preſent I underſtand of theſe Books, and to his Rules my hopes of future Attainments: The ſame Principles made me Cautious of ſome <hi>Odes,</hi> tho I have past by three more upon a different account.</p>
            <p>This juſt debt being paid to my Honored Inſtructer, the part that concerns my ſelf, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will give Thee little trouble: I cannot chooſe but ſmile now and then to think that I who have not Muſick enough to underſtand one
<pb facs="tcp:32633:6"/>
Note, and too little ill Nature (for that is commonly thought a neceſſary ingredient) to be a Satyrist, ſhould venture upon <hi>Horace:</hi> 'Tis certain our Language is not Capable of the numbers of the Poet, and therefore if the Senſe of the Author is deliver'd, the variety of Expreſsion kept, (which I must deſpair of after <hi>Quintilian</hi> hath aſſur'd us that he is moſt happily bold in his words) and his Fancy not debas'd, (for I cannot think my ſelf able to improve <hi>Horace)</hi> 'tis all that can be expected from a Verſion; This the Admirable <hi>Cowly</hi> conſider'd when he undertook <hi>Pindar,</hi> and hath drawn a ſhort and full Apology for the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings: <q>We muſt conſider, <hi>ſays He,</hi> the great difference of time betwixt his Age, and ours: which changes, as in Pictures, at leaſt the Colors of Poetry; the no leſs diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Religions and Cuſtoms of our Countrys, a Thouſand particularities of Places, Perſons and Manners, which do but confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to our Eyes at this diſtance; and laſtly (which were enough alone for my purpoſe) we muſt conſider that our Ears are Strangers to the Muſick of his numbers, which ſometimes,
<pb facs="tcp:32633:6"/>
(eſpecially in Songs and Odes) almoſt without any thing elſe makes an excellent Poet:</q> 'Tis true he improves this conſideration, and urges it as concluding againſt all ſtrict and faithful verſions; in which I must beg leave to diſſent, thinking it better to convey down the Learning of the Antients, than their empty ſound ſuited to the preſent times, and ſhow the Age their whole ſubstance, rather than their thin Ghost imbody'd with ſome light Air of my own:</p>
            <p>As for ill Nature, <hi>Horace</hi> requires none, nay diſclaims it in a Satyrist; his ſharpest touches, if we believe both himſelf, and thoſe that best understood him, are innocent Waggery, <hi>admiſſus circum praecordia ludit,</hi> He endeavours to laugh men out of their Vices, and doth not lance or cauterize the ſores, but tickles till He heals; and how much this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſurpaſſes the rougher handling, every one may imagine who knows that 'tis more grievous to any man to be Ridicul'd than beaten; and who is there that would not rather appear in Company with a black Eye, than a ſmutted Face? Some few advis'd me to turn the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:32633:7"/>
to our own Times, they ſaid that <hi>Rome</hi> was now rivall'd in her Vices, and Parallels for Hypocriſie, Profaneneſs, Avarice and the like were eaſie to be found; But thoſe Crimes are much out of my acquaintance, and ſince the Character is the ſame whoever the Perſon is, I am not ſo fond of being hated as to make any diſobliging applications: Such pains would look like an impertinent labor to find a dunghill, only that I might ſatisfy an unaccountable humor of dirting one Man's Face, and beſpattering an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: Some have taken this way, and the ill-Nature of the World hath conſpir'd to think their rudeneſs Wit; All their ſmartneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſharp Humor in their Body, which falls into their Pen, and if it drops upon a Man's Reputation that is as bright and ſolid as poliſht Steel, it ſullys it preſently, and eats thro. Such are never lov'd, or prais'd, but ſhun'd and fear'd, like Mad-Dogs, for their Teeth and Foam; and are excellently repreſented by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s Baſilisk,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Who drives all other Serpents from the Plains,</l>
               <l>And all alone in the vaſt Deſart reigns.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32633:7"/>
What I have borrow'd from others, if ever I have ſtock enough, I will honeſtly endeavour to repay; But the debt which I have contracted from my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi> is ſo vast, that I ſhall never be able to diſcharge; To his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Verſion I must gratefully acknowledge, That I owe the ſence, and the beſt lines in the Art of Poetry.</p>

                     <l>And All, if what <hi>Stertinius</hi> ſays be true,</l>
                     <l>Are mad: He taught me This when firſt He cheer'd</l>
                     <l>My drooping Mind, and bad me wear this Beard.</l>
                     <l>For when by Trading I was quite undone,</l>
                     <l>Thither I went, Poor Fool, reſolv'd to drown:</l>
                     <l>But He ſtood by, and in a lucky time</l>
                     <l>He cry'd, take heed Young Man, forbear the Crime,</l>
                     <l>'Tis fooliſh modeſty that makes Thee dread,</l>
                     <l>Amongſt Mad-men to be accounted Mad:</l>
                     <l>For firſt inquire what madneſs is, and ſee</l>
                     <l>If every Man be not as mad as Thee,</l>
                     <l>Tho They pretend to be ſo grave and wiſe,</l>
                     <l>Then go and hang thy ſelf, that's my advice.</l>
                     <l>He who's to Folly or to Vice inclin'd,</l>
                     <l>Or whom dark Ignorance of Truth doth blind,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> call him mad; thus every one,</l>
                     <l>Whether he holds the Plough, or fills the Throne,</l>
                     <l>Is counted mad, but their <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> alone.</l>
                     <l>Some call Thee mad, but thoſe that call Thee ſo,</l>
                     <l>Obſerve, I'le prove them quite as mad as You:</l>
                     <l>As Men that loſe their ways in Woods, divide;</l>
                     <l>Some go on this, and ſome on t'other ſide,</l>
                     <l>The Error is the ſame, all miſs the Road,</l>

Thus as they call thee, think that thou art mad;</l>
                     <l>But thoſe that call thee ſo are quite as bad.</l>
                     <l>For firſt, one ſort of madneſs is to fear,</l>
                     <l>When nothing frights, and when no danger's near;</l>
                     <l>As if when on an even Field he goes,</l>

                     <l>Others, altho through different ways They run,</l>
                     <l>Are quite as Mad, for they ruſh boldly on,</l>

I for my ſelf, to pleaſe the People you</l>

                  <l>If He could look but comely in a change:</l>
                  <l>The One will not expect a Purple Coat,</l>

                  <l>Thro Court and Town, and with a decent Art,</l>
                  <l>In either habit neatly acts his Part:</l>
                  <l>But Purple, or a Gown of Cloth of Gold,</l>

                  <l>Go give him Rags, and let the Fool be poor:</l>
                  <l>To War, and Triumph's near <hi>Jove</hi>'s glorious Throne,</l>

                  <l>Yet here or no where we may hope to find</l>
                  <l>What we deſire: By one the weight's declin'd,</l>
                  <l>Too great for his ſmall ſtrength, and little mind:</l>
                  <l>Another ventures, takes, and bears the ſame,</l>
                  <l>Or Vertue is a ſhow, an empty name,</l>
                  <l>Or He that trys, walks right to Wealth and Fame.</l>
                  <l>The Man that's ſilent, nor proclaims his want,</l>
                  <l>Gets more than him that makes a loud complaint:</l>

It differs whether fairly you receive,</l>
                  <l>Or rudely ſnatch the things the Great can give,</l>
                  <l>Yet that's the chifeſt meaſure how to live:</l>
                  <l>My Mother's poor, my Farm's too mean to ſell,</l>
                  <l>And yet not yields enough to keep me well,</l>
                  <l>My Niece a Portion wants, my Fortune's low,</l>

                  <l>He would not be content to be a Man,</l>
                  <l>He would be eager to be thought divine,</l>
                  <l>And gladly burn in Hopes to gain a Shrine:</l>
