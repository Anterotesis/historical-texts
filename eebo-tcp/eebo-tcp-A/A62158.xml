            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong those various delights and advantages which accrew to a Reader of <hi>Historie,</hi> one is, That no modern accident can seem <hi>strange</hi> unto him, much less <hi>astonish</hi> him: Hee scarce can wonder at any thing, in regard hee may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have read of the same, or much like the same, that happened in former times; therefore hee doth not stand staring like a childe at every sudden spectacle, like that simple <hi>American,</hi> who, the first time hee saw a <hi>Spaniard</hi> on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, thought the Man and the Beast to bee but one Creature, and that the hors did chew the Rings of his Bit.</p>
            <p>Now indeed, not to bee an Historian, that is, Not to know what Forrein Nations, and our Fore-fathers did, <hi>Hoc est semper esse puerum,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, this is still to bee a childe, who gazeth at any thing; whence may bee inferred, There is no knowledg that ripen's the judgment, and put's one out of his <hi>nonage</hi> sooner then Historie.</p>
            <p>If I had not formerly read the <hi>Baron's</hi> Wars in <hi>England,</hi> I had more admired that of the <hi>Liguers</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Hee who read the near upon fourscore years Wars in <hi>Low Germanie,</hi> never wondred at those thirtie two years late Wars in <hi>High Germanie.</hi> I had more wondred that <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was knockd down with a halbard, had not I read formerly that <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> died of a hot Iron that was thrust up his fundament; It was strange that <hi>Murat</hi> the great <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor should bee lately strangled in his own Court; yet considering that <hi>Osman</hi> his predecessor had been knock'd down by an ordinarie slave not many years before, it was not strange at all. The blazing Star in
<pb facs="tcp:47565:5"/>
               <hi>Virgo,</hi> 33 years since, did not seem strange to him who had read of that which appeared in <hi>Cassiopéa,</hi> and other constellations som years before, and how portentous they proved to poor Mortals. Hence may bee inferred, that among all other kindes of contemplations, <hi>Historie</hi> may bee called the great <hi>Looking Glass,</hi> through which wee may see with <hi>Ancestrall</hi> optiques, not onely the various <hi>Actions</hi> of men, and odd <hi>Accidents</hi> of time, but also discern the Constitutions, the Humors, and Genius of Nations.</p>
            <p>This faithful piece of Storie will displaie the very intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals of the <hi>Castillian,</hi> (who entitle's himself to bee the prime <hi>Spaniard</hi>) and make that opinion a meer paradox, whereby hee is cried up to bee so constant to his principles, so loial to his Prince, and so conformable to Government: for it will discover as much levitie and tumultuarie passions in him as in other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Which may bee the reason why these Annals were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and called in, in <hi>Spain,</hi> yet procur'd by a Gentleman of qualitie and of exquisite knowledg, and now made <hi>English,</hi> with much exactness and fidelitie; Therefore most worthie of the perusal, beeing a pure <hi>maiden</hi>-storie, never <hi>blown</hi> upon hitherto; for to my knowledg shee never travell'd over the Pyrenean Hills, or cross'd the Seas in any language till now.</p>

as beeing the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Ladie proprietarie</hi> of those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: whereunto hee answered That hee thanked them, and assured them that hee had nothing in greater recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then what concerned that particular, as they should finde by effects.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Infante Don Fernando</hi> might not go out of the <hi>kingdom,</hi> until hee were married, and had children: the <hi>king</hi> made answer, That hee was not more careful of anie thing in the world, then of the advancement of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Infante,</hi> and that hee would order nothing to bee don concerning his person, but what should bee for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and the good of those kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That hee would bee pleased to speak <hi>Spanish</hi>; for by practising hee would the sooner learn, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his Subjects, and bee understood by them. Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That hee was well contented, and would strive so to do, and the rather, becaus they desired it in the name of the Kingdoms: so, afterwards hee did speak <hi>Spanish</hi> with them and others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That hee would not alienate anie thing from the <hi>Roial Crown,</hi> and if anie should desire <hi>Iustice</hi> of him for their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, that hee would give order to have it don them. Hee answered, That hee would do therein according to his Oath, and would redress all those that came to complain.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this and the following Books, I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the the Insurrections or rising of the People (commonly called <hi>Communidades,</hi> or <hi>Communalties</hi>) which continued in <hi>Spain,</hi> from the year 1519 to 1522. A Subject, truly, very sad and unpleasant, and which I would willingly pass under silence, becaus som Illustrious Families, Noble Cities, and principal Towns of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were interessed therein, which never had been disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their <hi>Kings,</hi> but alwaies esteemed for their loialtie. Neither do I conceiv that they thought anie waie to disserv his <hi>Majestie,</hi> but rather to releas him out of that oppression (as I may term it) in which his Favorites held him. And, it is manifest, in that they so earnestly importuned and petitioned, that their <hi>King</hi> would not go out of the Kingdom, that they desired, and delighted to see, and enjoie his Roial presence; which was no sign, that they intended to do him anie disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: It will appear more evidently in the Progress of this Historie, and by the letters which passed between them,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47565:20"/>
whereof som I have set down in the same manner, as they were written in the originals, becaus the particularitie of the Historie doth require it, in a matter of such weight and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And since the <hi>Loialtie</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> come's in question, who have alwaies had their Princes in so high a reverence, that they honored and respected their verie Statues and pictures, as if they had been their <hi>Sovereign's,</hi> whom they represented: I will, before I go anie further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declare the ground and reasons, upon which the <hi>Castillians</hi> founded their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and grievances, as I have gathered them from those who were eie-witnesses, and have penn'd all the several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, with much discretion, respect, fear of God, and with a minde free from partialitie.</p>

               <p>THe familiaritie of <hi>Monsieur de Xeures</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> was so great, that hee rather seemed to bee the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> then to bee <hi>Xeures</hi> his <hi>Vassal</hi> and <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as hee was. There was no access, nor speaking with the <hi>King,</hi> but when <hi>Xeures</hi> pleased: if anie thing succceded well, <hi>Xeures</hi> assumed the glorie to himself, giving out that hee had don it; if ill, hee alwaies laid the fault upon the <hi>King,</hi> saying, The <hi>King</hi> would have it so. And, indeed, this was the first occasion that begat the innocent <hi>Prince</hi> the ill will of his <hi>People.</hi> I have seen a memorial of these Passages, which a Gentleman (one of the <hi>King's</hi> Domestick servants) wrote, and averreth to have been an eie-witness of them. Hee report's, that while the <hi>King</hi> was yet in his minoritie, and unacquainted with <hi>State-affairs, Xeures</hi> would suffer no bodie to speak with him, unless hee were first informed of the business, that so hee might put into the <hi>King's</hi> mouth, what hee would have him to answer; and if anie refused to impart their business to him, they were so far from having
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47565:20"/>
audience, that hee would not suffer them to enter into his <hi>Majestie's</hi> presence; Thus did hee deal with those that were sent from <hi>Toledo,</hi> and divers other <hi>Cities.</hi> Indeed, at that time all the <hi>Castillians</hi> were very much discountenanced, and not treated as their's and their Predecessor's services had deserved. The <hi>Flemings</hi> perceived the mindes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> disposed for all mischief; much ambition, and little friendship bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst them: for som devoted themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Mercurino Gatinara</hi> Lord high <hi>Chancellor</hi> was second in the <hi>Emperor's</hi> favor, and as the Autoritie and familiaritie with <hi>Princes</hi> admit of no Competitor, <hi>Xeures</hi> and this <hi>Chancellor</hi> could not endure each other: they both presumed so much, that each of them would command alone, and ambitioned a Power above the other; these made themselvs the Heads of those two Factions, and added more poison to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and discontents. <hi>Xeures</hi> favored those of <hi>Ferdinando</hi>: and the Chancellor sided with those of <hi>Don Philip's</hi> Partie. And all was ill (as the Proverb saie's) for the poor Pitcher; for the distressed Countrie of <hi>Spain</hi> had all the sufferings. <hi>Xeures</hi> was so corrupt and covetous, that he sold all the King's Favors, <hi>Offices, Bishopricks, Honors,</hi> and whatsoëver hee conceived would yield him money. The <hi>Chancellor</hi> did the like with all <hi>Iustice-ships</hi> and other Offices; so that secluded <hi>Iustice</hi> was enforc'd to give up her Seat, and Sword to the Tyrannie of over-ruling <hi>Avarice</hi>; onely monie then bore the swaie; no <hi>Right,</hi> no <hi>Equitie</hi> was able to counterpoiz the weight of <hi>Gold</hi>; all things and places (as in the times of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>) were then put to sale: The <hi>Flemings</hi> were much encouraged with this fine gold, and Ingots of pure Silver, that came from the <hi>Indies</hi>; and the <hi>simple Spaniards</hi> so blinde, in giving it for their pretensions, that it became as common, as a Proverb, for a <hi>Fleming</hi> to call a <hi>Spaniard, My Indian.</hi> And, indeed, it was not improper, for the <hi>Indians</hi> never gave so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47565:21"/>
much gold to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did to the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi>: this in time grew to such a pass, that it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly sung along the streets,

It is reported that a certain <hi>Pretendent,</hi> or Petitioner who had presented <hi>Xeures</hi> with a very handsom <hi>Mule,</hi> and hee beeing asked by another Gentleman, where hee had gotten that curious beast, answered, That hee knew not who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it him; beeing within hearing, and very much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved to see himself so soon forgotten, and the business hee had communicated to <hi>Xeures</hi> so neglected, give's forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with order to have his <hi>Mule</hi> cried, declaring all his marks, and describing the furniture hee had bestowed on him; which the same Gentleman hearing of, went presently, and told <hi>Xeures,</hi> that according to the marks, it must needs bee that this <hi>Mule</hi> had been stolen; Thus the poor Petitioner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what hee had given him, and lost not all, as most men do in such occurrences: for there is no memorie so weak, as that of a covetous man in Power, who digest's gold with more facililitie, then Estriches do Iron.</p>

This gave the rise of the People's general ill opinion of him: They presently spake him a man of a weak apprehension, and of an ill disposition, they call'd him <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and an Enemie to <hi>Spaniards</hi>; They said, hee wanted Judgment as well as years, neither was hee of a Talent fit to govern: by these prejudicial Censures of their <hi>Prince,</hi> which were for som time generally noised abroad amongst the People, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to his Mother: Som that never had seen him, said, It could not bee otherwise; and that, for that respect onely, <hi>Xeures</hi> would suffer no bodie els to confer with him, lest hee should too much discover his own imperfections. Others that had been admitted to speak with him, much vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his honor in that particular, protesting, That they found him verie discreet, and of no mean capacitie; That hee was no way guiltie of those pretended weaknesses, but his Favorites infinitely to bee condemn'd; neither was it to bee wondered at, if hee suffered himself to bee governed by them, in regard hee was but a youth, and unacquainted with the Customs of that Countrie, and the dispositions of

the People. Those that have near relations about the Persons of <hi>Kings,</hi> ought to bee verie careful and circumspect, how to avoid the occasions of Murmurings and Envie, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that <hi>Kings</hi> are like that Sun which diffuseth his light to all.</p>

               <p>THe whole Countrie of <hi>Castillia</hi> was imbrued with these factious discourses, before they ever thought of the departure of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Emperor,</hi> as will appear by the Letters, which were interchangeably sent from Citie to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But when they heard of his resolution to bee gon, and that his calling of a Parlament would en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reas their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions and Taxes, they out-stript the bounds of patience. The principal Causses of their Commotions were these three ensuing: First, to see the <hi>King</hi> go out of that Kingdom, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies accustomed to keep their Courts in <hi>Spain</hi>; for when <hi>King Alonso</hi> the Wise deserted it, out of an ambitious covetousness of possessing th' <hi>Imperial Scepter,</hi> hee not onely lost that Kingdom, but was incumbred with insurrections, not of the Common people, but of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t levied arms against him. Their second grievance was, To see all Offices, and places of Honor, Trust, or Profit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon strangers. The third was an universal crying out, That the <hi>Treasure</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> was all transported into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations. And wee may add for a fourth Reason, That in that verie occurrence, som evil Star dispersed the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it's influence over all <hi>Castillia, Sardinia, Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> which at one instant were all infected with the same poison, as if they had all conspired and agreed together. This they made the ground of their insurrections; becaus their King left them to live in a strange Countrie; becaus their wealth was exhausted, and their Countrie impoverished, to inrich foreigners; and becaus the high <hi>Treasurer-ship</hi> was given to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47565:22"/>
                  <hi>Xeures,</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> to <hi>William de Croy,</hi> his Nephew, and all presentations to spiritual preferments, and other Offices to strangers; But that which they chiefly resented was the <hi>King's</hi> going to the <hi>Empire,</hi> and had they really wished him ill in his own person, they would not have been so sensible of his departure.</p>
               <p>I cannot let pass with silence the audacitie of a certain gentleman of those parts, named, The <hi>Martial Don Pedro,</hi> who refused to swear Alleageance to <hi>Charls,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> alledging, that in regard hee was not born in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor descended from the blood of the <hi>Castillian Kings,</hi> by the Father's side, hee was not obliged to acknowledg him, <note place="margin">The <hi>Martial Don Pedro</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth the Oath of Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IN regard somtimes wee have written to you in particular, you may wonder why wee now write to you all in general: But considering the imminent necessitie that there is in this case, and the danger that may ensue by deferring anie longer; wee shall rather bee condemn'd as beeing too slack for not doing it before, then thought importunate for doing it now. You know, and may remember, how vehemently <hi>King Charls</hi> our <hi>Soeverign Lord's</hi> arrival in <hi>Spain</hi> was desired of all, and how sudden is his departure from us; his absence now is no less torment to Us, then his Presence at that time afforded us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and comfort; the long continuance of his <hi>Roial</hi> Person in the Kingdom of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and the small time hee hath vouchsafed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in this our kingdom of <hi>Castillia,</hi> hath been a great occasion that the affairs of this kingdom are yet in so unsettled a condition: And if his <hi>Majestie</hi> doth go away, as hee hath determined, the longer wee delaie, the wors our case will bee.

That the <hi>King</hi> shewed verie small affection to that Countrie; and despising it as too mean for him, would betake himself wholly to <hi>Germanie.</hi> That <hi>Xeures</hi> had robbed <hi>Spain</hi> of all her Treasure; That the <hi>King</hi> beeing at <hi>Burgos</hi> (<hi>Capital Citie of Castillia</hi>) did not staie one week there.

               <p>THe <hi>Emperor</hi> beeing at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and the People's mindes much distracted with these several grievances, hee sent for the <hi>Corregidores, Regidores,</hi> and all other Publick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to his Palace. Upon their appearance hee told them that beeing then to go into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to receiv the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> hee was in great distress for want of monies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraie his charges, to which hee desired, they would not onely give their consents, but bee assistant in the raising of three hundred <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Marauediz,</hi> which might bee easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly don in <hi>Castillia,</hi> by waie of <hi>Subsidie</hi> and <hi>Pole-monie,</hi> everie Town paying according to their qualitie and Cessments; Presuming, that if those of <hi>Valladolid</hi> subscribed, the other places of the Kingdom, would not bee backwards to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his exspectation; And in case they did satisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee promised to grant them all the Favors their <hi>Burgesses</hi> or <hi>Commissioners</hi> should demand of him in <hi>Parlament.</hi> There was present at this Conference, the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Santjago,</hi> the <hi>Bishop Mota,</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Venavente,</hi> the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Astorga,</hi> and <hi>Xeures</hi> who was never from the <hi>Emperor's</hi> elbow. Those of <hi>Valladolid</hi> desired som time to give in their answer, but (they said) They could see no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of effecting what the <hi>Emperor</hi> demanded of them. Thence began tumultuous <hi>meetings</hi> in the streets, <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and outragious <hi>murmurings,</hi> insomuch that they were even readie to rise in arms against the <hi>Flemings.</hi> At last <hi>Valladolid</hi> returned the <hi>Emperor</hi> this answer, That they humbly desired his <hi>Majestie</hi> would bee pleased to staie, and make his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Countrie, and that upon those terms hee should not onely command the three hundred Millions hee desired, but they would furnish him with much more, and if need required, they would not stick to part with their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47565:25"/>
lands and goods, but fell their Children also to do him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But, in their opinions, that hee should go away and deprive the kingdom of his <hi>Roial</hi> Person, besides, that vast summe monie which hee desired to carrie into forreign Countries, seemed verie unreasonable, and they would sell nothing to further anie such designe, neither did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev that <hi>God</hi> required they should paie him anie such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Upon this answer of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> there were several meetings and Consultations, but they prevailed nothing. But the <hi>Emperor's</hi> Favorites, (against whom <hi>Castillia</hi> was chiefly incensed) <hi>Viz. Xeures, Don Garzia de Padilla,</hi> and <hi>Mota, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Badajos,</hi> went again to the Magistrates, desiring them that they would consider well upon his <hi>Majestie's</hi> demands, since the performance thereof was so important to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent service, and so easie for them to accomplish: that the necessitie of his going to receiv the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely urgent, and redounded not a little to the reputation and honor of that Kingdom. That they should look upon what <hi>Castillia</hi> had furnished to <hi>King Alonso</hi> the <hi>Wise,</hi> when hee went into <hi>Germanie</hi> upon a pretended claim of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and how much more reason they had to do the like now, (which they might well do, the Kingdom beeing in a far better condition.) That the <hi>King</hi> undertook not that voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as <hi>Don Alonso</hi> did, upon a doubtful matter, his business was already most certainly concluded and agreed upon. This was closely followed, for during the three daies time which the <hi>Emperor</hi> staied in <hi>Valladolid,</hi> The <hi>Gentrie, Magistrates, and Burgesses</hi> of the Town, with <hi>Bishop Mota</hi> (whom the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> had sent, to entreat them to condescend to his desires) did nothing els all daie and night, but go from the Court to the Town-hous, and back again; the Bishop of <hi>Osma, Don Alonso Enriques</hi> and som of the Magistrates were of opinion, that they should do well to satisfie his <hi>Majestie's</hi> desires. Others stood strongly to the contrarie, and turned their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents out from their consultation, with manie reviling words, calling them disloial, disobedient, and other injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

was of so much concernment to his <hi>Majestie</hi> to hear them, that hee would not repent the deferring of his departure for a little while, especially the weather beeing (as it was) very rainie.

                  </note> wherefore the <hi>Emperor</hi> sent for them into his chamber, and with a severely frowning Countenance (as <hi>Don Pedro Lasso</hi> afterwards declared) told them, that hee was not pleased with what they did, and that if hee did not consider from what Parents they were descended, hee would have them punished according to their deserts, for medling with what they had undertaken, and that they should go to the <hi>President</hi> of his <hi>Council,</hi> who would tell them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they were to do. They began to excuse themselvs, but the <hi>Emperor</hi> not willing to hear them, retired himself. Then <hi>Don Garzia de Padilla</hi> taking them aside, gave them a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table schooling, and reproved them sharply for what they had done, telling them that their boldness in insisting so much to the hinderance of a journie, which so deeply concerned not onely the honor and reputation of the Emperor, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the securitie and preservation of his Estate, was beyond the thought of pardon. And that the things which they had done, had been the occasion of disaffecting and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting the mindes of other <hi>Commissioners,</hi> and of the whole Kingdom, by reason of the precedence and Autoritie, which <hi>Toledo</hi> had amongst all the Cities of <hi>Castilla,</hi> which they should do well to consider, and seriously to reflect upon.

The <hi>President</hi> told them, that what hee had to give them for answer, was that his <hi>Majestie</hi> was going to hold a <hi>Parlament</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Santjago,</hi> where all the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the Kingdom were to assemble, That <hi>Toledo</hi> should send theirs thither, with a memorial of the

things they desired, which beeing perused and examined, The <hi>Emperor</hi> would give such Orders as should bee most expedient for his service, and the general good of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Subjects, moreover hee willed them to desist from medling anie further in those matters, but to return and deal with their Citie, to send their <hi>Commissioners,</hi> as the other Cities of the Kingdom did, and not to affect such innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they had begun. Whereunto they made answer, that indeed they were not imploied by the Kingdom, but they desired however that those things might bee granted for the good of the Kingdom, And refusing to follow his advice, but rather thinking it a point of honor to persist in what they had begun, they followed the <hi>Emperor</hi> to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tjago.</hi>

And in so doing they would oblige them very much: but in case they were refused, they protested, that they would not stand to anie thing, that the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of <hi>Zamora</hi> should denie or grant; and of that they desired witness. Hence grew som hurlie-burlie and tumult in the Parlament. For one <hi>Garci Ruyz de la Mota</hi> (Bishop <hi>Mota's</hi> brother) who was Commissioner for <hi>Burgos,</hi> took upon him to answer, and thwarted the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Villalva,</hi> with language that was much displeasing.

The <hi>Bishop</hi> perceiving the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Villalva</hi> much incensed, to pacifie his choller, accost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with very smooth and civil Language, expressing much sorrow, that his brother had so much forgotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

The <hi>Emperor</hi> perceived it, and if hee had not remedied it in time, hee had found it trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som enough.

                  </gap> which hee had inflicted upon them, and much more. <hi>Ortiz</hi> replied, That since hee had the greatest privacie and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47565:38"/>
freedom with his <hi>Majestie,</hi> hee was the more obliged to see to this matter, and to consider with attention, that the whole Kingdom knew that <hi>Toledo</hi> had sent those gentlemen to treat of that which concerned them all, and that seeing them thus banished the Court, they would not think it was for anie disrespect to his <hi>Majestie,</hi> (for if any such thing were they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served double punishment) but that they were turned out of the <hi>Court,</hi> that they might not solicite the <hi>Kingdom's</hi> good, and thereupon they would bee all scandalized, and such mischiefs would insue, as they would not bee able to remedy when they listed. Whereto <hi>Xeures</hi> very formally thus replied, what lightness is this of <hi>Toledo,</hi> what lightness I say? is the <hi>King</hi> no <hi>King?</hi> why doth no body think of putting <hi>Kings</hi> in and out at their pleasure? <hi>Alonso Ortiz</hi> answered again, that hee wondred, hee should speak so much against <hi>Toledo,</hi> it beeing of such consequence, that it was reputed the best and most considerable Citie of the Kingdom, and had the greatest priveleges and immunities, which the natives did enjoie, for the notable services they had don to the deceased <hi>Kings.</hi> Therefore it could not bee thought, that <hi>Toledo</hi> treated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended anie thing, but what might suit with his <hi>Majestie's</hi> service; Moreover, if hee pleased to look upon what gentlemen had gon into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to serv his <hi>Majestie</hi> against King <hi>Fernando's</hi> will (venturing there, not onely their own lives and fortunes, but their friend's and Kindred's also) hee would finde that the most of them were of <hi>Toledo.</hi> And that those of that Citie, were the cheif means of paying the subsidies to <hi>King Phillip.</hi> And since that Citie produced such gallant men, hee ought not to beleiv that It's intention ever was other, then to do his <hi>Majestie</hi> service. The Secretary <hi>Francisco de los Covos</hi> heard all this discours. These and divers other means the <hi>Toledian Commissioners</hi> used by favor of som great one's about the <hi>Emperor,</hi> to obtain a revocation of their banishment, but nothing would do, for <hi>Xeures</hi> and other <hi>Castilians</hi> of the privie <hi>Council,</hi> opposed it. <hi>Don Alonso Suarez</hi> prudently considering that their business was foyled, and in

danger of beeing utterly lost, performed what hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and never after put himself into those troubles, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did hee meddle during all the commotions of <hi>Castilla,</hi> whereby hee lost nothing. <hi>Don Pedro Lasso</hi> did the like (though late) not understanding sooner that hee disserved the <hi>King.</hi> Thus ended the Embassage of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which was so boldly and couragiously performed by these gentlemen.</p>

               <p>ON Tuesday in the Holie week before Easter, a Post came from <hi>Toledo</hi> with an express to recall their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi>; This Post was dispatch't before there was any notice of their beeing banished from <hi>Court.</hi> Hee brought letters to his <hi>Majestie,</hi> som from the <hi>Assemblie</hi> of the Citie, others from the <hi>Chapter</hi> of their <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church, and from the Monasteries and Fryeries, humbly begging therein a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable treatment of their <hi>Commissioners,</hi> not as yet knowing what had passed. Moreover they mentioned how <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Cordoua</hi> (the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Cabra's</hi> brother) their Governor, then beeing at <hi>Toledo,</hi> had produced certain orders from his <hi>Majestie</hi> to <hi>Iohn de Padilla, Hernando de Avalos,</hi> and <hi>Gonsalo Gaytan,</hi> whereby they were commanded to make their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance at <hi>Court,</hi> within a certain time, under penaltie for default. The reason that <hi>Toledo</hi> gave, why these gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did not obey, was, that they were emploied about som affairs concerning the publick good, and that their absence would bee prejudicial to the whole Citie. And therefore they beseeched that his <hi>Majestie</hi> would suspend his command for the present. The gentlemen that stayed at <hi>Padron,</hi> sent

this dispatch, with the instructions they had from <hi>Toledo,</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonso Ortiz,</hi> who remained at <hi>Court.</hi> Hee presently went to the <hi>Monasterie</hi> of <hi>San Salvador,</hi> half a league from the Citie (where the <hi>Emperor</hi> had retired himself for the Holie week) and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter to deliver the letters to his <hi>Majestie,</hi> but hee found no admittance. Meeting Secretarie <hi>Covos,</hi> hee acquainted him with his business, and told him that hee had letters to deliver to the <hi>Emperor</hi> from <hi>Toledo, Covos</hi> told <hi>Xeures</hi> this, who forthwith sent for <hi>Ortiz,</hi> and bad him give him the letters.

Then they fell to discours again about those gentlemen's banishment, and grew so hot at it, that <hi>Xeures</hi> went away distasted, and <hi>Ortiz</hi> remained with small satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A little after <hi>Covos</hi> came, and told <hi>Ortiz</hi> that <hi>Xeures</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. <hi>Ortiz</hi> went, and <hi>Xeures</hi> told him, that resolvedly hee could say nothing as touching their banishment, so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more words hee went into another room. <hi>Ortiz</hi> stayed behinde with <hi>Don Garcia de Padilla,</hi> who blaming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly the proceedings of <hi>Toledo,</hi> said, if his counsel might bee taken, the <hi>Emperor</hi> should go thither (it would bee but ten daies work) and inflict som exemplary punishment upon them, that were occasion of those troubles, whereby the rest might bee deterred and quieted. I wish to God hee would, said <hi>Ortiz,</hi> for then his <hi>Majestie</hi> would see the great damages they suffered, and give order for som redress. So they parted, and <hi>Ortiz</hi> went that night to speak with the <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> for hee saw there was no possibilitie of delivering his letters to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> nor of speaking with him. The <hi>Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Ortiz</hi> spent a great part of the night, without concluding anie thing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperor</hi> remained at <hi>Santjago,</hi> untill the thursday in <hi>Easter</hi> week, and then departed for the <hi>Groyn,</hi> where hee made his entrance on Saturday following. Thither repaired also

the Parlament-men and <hi>Commissioners</hi> to conclude all their businesses. There were produced the testimonies, supplications and Acts, which the <hi>Regidores</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> had made concerning the commanding them to appear at the <hi>Court,</hi> and the Power which the <hi>Citie</hi> sent to <hi>Alonso Ortiz,</hi> charging him to do all the diligences therein expedient, which hee did, and presented himself to the Secretary <hi>Ramirez.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over were delivered the second Orders for their appearance, with greater penalties, which had bin sent to <hi>Toledo</hi> and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the gentlemen there.</p>

In that Citie there is a great <hi>Congregation</hi> or <hi>fraternitie</hi> called the <hi>frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> of <hi>Charitie,</hi> which used every year to make a Solemn <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>; upon this occasion there was one ordained to go from <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iusta's</hi> Church to the <hi>Cathedral.</hi> Som (especially <hi>Don Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando de Silva, Antonio Alvarez de Toledo,</hi> and others of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) knowing to what end this Solemnitie was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, highlie opposed it, saying that, it was prejudicial to the <hi>King,</hi> and that it was onely a plot and cunning trick of those that were disaffected, and <hi>Don Hernando</hi> required the chief of the Congregation not to make anie such tumultuous meetings (under color of devotion) to disturb the People to the <hi>King's</hi> prejudice and dishonor of justice, for if they did, hee with his friends and servants would hinder it.

which hee did accordingly, and spake to som of the Council about it, believing the matter had been really so, and urging for instance that his <hi>Majestie</hi> did not see what was most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Kingdome's good, as they desired. Som are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that if the Governor of <hi>Toledo</hi> had Punished that sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious tumult in stead of condescending to their desires (which hee might then have don) hee had prevented a world of miserie and mischief, that was occasioned by the succeeding war. For the beginners of that hubbub were not many, and of meanest of the people. And at that time there were divers gentlemen in <hi>Toledo,</hi> who would have assisted him in the suppressing of them, especially <hi>Don Iohn de Sylva</hi> with divers of his kindred and opinion, although som of them were drawn the other way. The <hi>Governor's</hi> timiditie and want of resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so much emboldned the <hi>People,</hi> that they seized on him and others that would have prosecuted against the first and chief instruments of this commotion. Which had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise carried if the Governor had had so much Spirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as hee ought, but that was so little, that hee retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into his hous, where hee continued som few dayes without anie power or respect, after which hee left the Citie for fear least the <hi>People</hi> should murther him.</p>

To this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47565:43"/>
effect they solicited som Fryers and Priests to declare with ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation in their Pulpits the damages and miseries the Kingdom then suffered, That no Offices nor Benefices of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue were bestowed upon the Natives, but the <hi>Flemings</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That no places of Trust or Honor were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them, for either their's or their Predecessor's merits or services, but must bee purchased with great sums of monie. Thus began the Priests to move the People's hearts, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and applauding much what they had don, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that the Kingdom was tyranised over: That the <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were debased and vilified. That they should bee loaded with new taxes, That every head of Cattle should pay such a rate, and every hous so much. And that in this respect whosoever would ingage himself in the defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with the liberties and freedoms thereof, should purchase an eternall memorie. Hereupon the fire grew so violent that those who discreetly would not ingage in these combustions, for fear of beeing murthered, were enforced either to flie from the Citie, or confine themselvs to their own houses. And the most considerable, amongst whom were som <hi>Regidores</hi> and <hi>Iurates</hi> of the Citie, took refuge in the Fort with <hi>Don Iohn de Rivera,</hi> or <hi>Sylva,</hi> who kept it at his own charge, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thither, with som of his Kindred, Children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Thence hee sent to his Tenants in several places to bring him in provisions, for the sodain and unexspected ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of his flying thither did not permit to furnish himself with what was needful. And those of the <hi>Communalty</hi> (as they already styled themselvs) which was the rest of the Citie, following them who took upon them to bee the most wise, set themselvs to fortifie and repair the wals and places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, fearing the damage they might receive from abroad (for within they feared nothing) and possessed themselvs of the gates and Bridges which were under <hi>Don Iohn's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

               <p>THe Common People of <hi>Toledo</hi> beeing thus distempered, they determined to possess themselvs of the Fort as well as of the Gates and bridges of the Citie. To this effect a nois was spread amongst them that <hi>Don Iohn de Sylva</hi> was a Traytor to the good of the Communalty, and that it was fit to take the Fort from him and turn him out of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The Multitude gathered together to assault it, and in regard during the Reigns of the Catholick <hi>Kings</hi> there had bin so much peace and so little use of armes, all Forts and places of strength were very ill repaired, and unprovided aswel of arms as victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> perceiving the People's fury and malice (as you have heard) fortified himself the best hee could, taking into the Fort with him divers gentlemen and others to the number of about four hundred, all resolved to defend themselvs against the People, if assailed by them. The multitude perceiving this, determined first to take the Gates and Bridges of the Citie; so they went forthwith to the Gate of <hi>Visagra,</hi> and to the Port of <hi>Cambron</hi> which they gained without resistance. One of the <hi>Iurates</hi> called <hi>Miguel de Hita</hi> (who the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ey made them quit the top of the Tower. The assault beeing thus hot from several parts, at last they made breaches and entred with such fury, that taking the Commander they wounded him sorely in two places and threatned to hang him, if hee would not send to command the other tower of the bridg towards the fields to bee surrendred to them; but hee couragiously putting his life to the venture would send no such Order. Hee beeing secured they fell desperately upon the other tower, but they within seeing the success of the former and their Commander taken, had not the courage to stand out, but delivered it immediately to the Citie, Thus they got all the bridges and Gates into their own hands. Thence they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in very great numbers (All armed) to the Fort, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to take it by assault if it were not sodainly surrendred to them. Som religious men grieving much at the mischiefs and death of divers persons which must needs ensue so violent an assayling, became mediators betwixt <hi>Don Iohn de Sylva</hi> (who defended the Fort) and the better sort of those that came against it: This treaty continued a good while; at length <hi>Don Iohn</hi> seeing divers of his neer kinsmen against him, his friends and Allies, and considering that hee wanted provisions to make anie long resistance, to avoid the damages his standing out might have occasioned, suffered himself to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to deliver up the Fort, upon condition that one of his own servants should remain as Commander having first taken the Oath of fealty. Thus on Saturday 21 of April <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and his Children with the other gentlemen and friends that were retired thither, came out of the Fort, and went to a village of his four leagues thence, from which place hee wrote again to the <hi>Emperor</hi> informing him how the People had taken the Fort from him, and possessed themselvs of all the Gates and Bridges of the Citie, which news incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his <hi>Majestie</hi> very much, yet hee did not resolve to send any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47565:45"/>
Souldiery thither, becaus every one told him that beeing a business of no foundation, it must needs fall again of it self. All this passed before the Governor went out of the Citie, or gave up his Staff. So all the Common People, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by their Chiefs, went next unto his hous and made him swear that hee should hold his staff, or acknowledg his autoritie and Office as from the <hi>Communalty</hi> of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Hee beeing affrighted with this tumult, condescended to what they would have him do; the People soon after broke out, and did what they listed, seeing him so helpless and so void of reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. The Citie thus wanting both <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn de Sylva,</hi> Those of the <hi>Communaltie</hi> became freemen and Lords of all, They constituted Deputies, and began to settle a form of government at their own pleasures, Saying they did it in the name of the <hi>King, Queen</hi> and <hi>Communaltie.</hi> In this manner began the great troubles and commotions of <hi>Toledo.</hi>

(Which I would it were well seen unto in these times.) There were likewise som complaints and Petitions given in against <hi>Pedrarias de Avila,</hi> a gentleman of good

note and quality (brother to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Punio en Rostro</hi>) and who had done great services; yet hee was accused by som of his enemies and charged for having put manie to death unjustly at the discoverie of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and committed divers Robberies and Tyrannies.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47565:52"/>
way of excise and a gratuity of one hundred thousand <hi>Maravediz</hi> for reparation of the walls, and for himself hee had procured a very good governement and received an office which the <hi>Mint</hi> or coyning house had given for lost. It is a custome in <hi>Segovia</hi> every Tuesday in whitsonweek that the <hi>Collectors</hi> meet to treat concerning the Revenue of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Church. It hapned that being all together one of them inconsiderately sayed, <hi>Gentlemen! you know that Don Iohn de Acunia is Governor of this Citie, and that hee never set foot in it, and yet not satisfied to under value us, hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein's here certain Officers to robb us, rather then to administer Iustice.</hi>

                  <hi>And I vow to God, if the former stole away our Cloaks, these strip us to the very Skins. Moreover know that the Governor hath put in here a Deputy, more fool then valiant: Hee is not satisfied with the injuries hee doth us by day, but hee leads a dog to catch men in the night. And my opinion is, That if any one hath done what hee ought not to doe, Hee should apprehend him in his house like a Christian, and not hunt him with doggs in the Mountains like a Moore; For a man of any credit is more troubled at his being apprehended in the open street then at his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A certain old man, called <hi>Melon,</hi> chanced to bee present at these words, who had for many years executed the office of a <hi>Sergeant</hi> or <hi>Catch-pole</hi> (as they call them); and therefore was hated and abhorred by all the people. This poore man having heard the other out, and every body else holding their peaces, stood up and spake these words in favor of the Justice. <hi>Indeed (Gentlemen!) that which this man hath sayed seemeth to me not well, and mee thinks it is wors that men of such honor and credit (as here are) should give eare to such a man: for hee that will speak in publick of the Ministers of Iustice ought to have some respect and moderation in his tongue; and in an officer of the King's, hee ought not to look onely at his person, but to consider what his staff represent's, As touching the dog hee speak's of, that my Master carrie's with him, I sweare by this cross, that, being a yong man, hee takes him with him more for his pleasure in the day time, then to catch men in

the night; and if it had been so you doe not, (I hope) take me to be so base, but that I should haue made it known to the people, for I am more beholding to my friends and neighbors then I am to Strangers. If the Officers doe any thing against Law and Iustice, (which hitherto they have not done) like Christians and Gentlemen wee are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to advise and reprove them in secret, and not defame them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if this which I say now unto you, soundeth not well in your ears, perchance that which will result hereof will please you wors; for ill words inconsiderately spoken somtimes are dearly repented.</hi> This speech was so ill taken by them all, that with shouting and great violence they seized on him, cast a rope about his neck, and with huge nois and exclamations they dragged him out of the Citie, but they bruised him with so many stripes that hee was dead before hee came to the gallowes, yet they hung up his body upon it. As they returned from hanging this unfortunate <hi>Melon,</hi> they met by the way a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his, called <hi>Roque Portalejo</hi>: To whom one of them said, as they came along, <hi>Portalejo! thy Companion</hi> Melon <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member's him to thee, there hee hang's upon the gallows, and hee saies hee hopes thou wilt beare him Company there to morrow, and t'were no great matter if wee made thee accept of his invitation, for since thou wast his companion in the fault, it is but reason thou shouldst beare a share of the punishment. Portalejo</hi> replyed, <hi>God preserve the King my Lord and his Iustice, for one day you may repent you for what you haue done and Segovia for permitting it. for the blood of the Innocent, although men doe forget it, is alwaies crying out for vengeance before God.</hi> Hereupon, and because they saw him with a pen and paper, one of them began to say, that hee tooke the names of those that had killed <hi>Melon,</hi> upon which words they all cryed out <hi>kill him, kill him,</hi> So with the same fury in a disorderly rout, as they had done to <hi>Melon,</hi> they layd hands on him, and dragged him to the gallows where they hang'd him by the feet, so the poore man dyed.

               <p>THis message which the Post brought from <hi>Segovia</hi> to the Governors, declaring the crueltie done in that Citie, possessed them with much trouble and care. These risings touched the <hi>Cardinal</hi> to the heart, and hereupon hee entred into consultation with those Gentlemen whom his <hi>Majestie</hi> had appointed to assist him. After this the Gentlemen and <hi>Regidores</hi> of <hi>Segovia</hi> sent another Messinger to make their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse to the Governor, alledging, <hi>That</hi> they had nothing to doe in the Death of <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> nor the other two men, neither were they able to hinder it in regard of the Mutinie of a great multitude of teazers of Wooll, who made that scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous uproar and outrage, men of strange places, vagabonds, and who were already dispersed and fled from the Citie.

The <hi>Cardinal</hi> beeing arrived at <hi>Valladolid</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1520, the day before <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> eve, (the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> beeing gon thither two daies before) Hee assembled all the Council and asked their opinions, which were very different concerning this matter. And becaus they are of so much importance to the Historie, I will set down som of the most remarkable which were then taken in writing. The first that spake was <hi>Don Antonio de Rojas President</hi> of the Council, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself in these words.</p>

You see, My Lords! if the dignitie of Arch-Bishop invite's me to Clemencie, the office of President (which is conferred upon mee) constrain's me to Iustice. This I say, My Lords, that you m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I denie not that our Lord God giveth a beginning to all things with his Providence, but yet manie of them hee persu's and concludeth with his rigor and Iustice. And this hee doth, that the Good may bee incouraged to serv him, and the wicked refrain from displeasing him, According to this saying of the Prophet, <hi>Misericordiam &amp; Judicium cantabo tibi Domine.</hi> To com to the Purpose which now is in agitation, This action of <hi>Segovia,</hi> for my particular I hold it so hainous and scandalous, that I cannot think of any Punishment great enough for it. For where the offence is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47565:55"/>
without weight, the Penaltie ought to bee beyond measure. Those of the Citie of Segovia have offended God in so barbarously putting to Death a man, who better deserved to live then They. Which wicked action is of no less consequence, then that it should wreak God's Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, for the blood of his Innocencie is no other then the Crier, or Proclaimer of Vengeance. Again, in my sense, they are guiltie of <hi>Crimen laes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Majestatis,</hi> and it is very palpable; for they did not murther <hi>Tordesillas</hi> for any offence hee had done them, but for the service hee did the King in the Parlament. And since for the King hee lost his life, the King is obliged to see him revenged: and in respect his Majestie is gone out of Castilla, to receiv the Imperial Crown in Germanie, It will bee sufficient, if hee return in prosperitie, that hee reward his wife and Children with some gratuity; And wee are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to Iustice, considering that the offence is as hainous, as if it had been done to his own person. For if I have served his Majestie, beeing here present, in giving him good Counsel, I shall serv him more now, My Lords, in punishing misdeeds in his absence. Moreover, Since the King our Sovereign took shipping at the Groyn, This is the first act of disobedience in Spain. Wherefore I judge their crime the greater. For an offence committed in absence, alwaies argueth the more malice, and where the malice is so great, the Punishment ought to bee corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent. <hi>Item,</hi> it is alleadged by those of Segovia, that the Citie in general is not guiltie of this fact, but only som particular men, Carders, did hang Tordesillas upon the Gallows. I would fain know of them, what was the reason, why they did not punish those fellows, since they were but few; for there is no such testimonie of Innocence, as to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Iustice upon offenders. In my opinion the Citie of Segovia cannot plead Non-Guiltie in this case, for Five Thousand Citizens (if they had listed) might easily have withstood the furious insolence of Fiftie Teazers, and those Strangers too. But some secretly with their counsels, others publickly using violence, committed this insolent outrage. For if it bee a crime in Wicked men to murther the good, It is no less crime in good men not to resist the Wicked. You have seen, My Lords, the peremptoriness of those of Toledo, The King our Lord beeing at his Parlament in Sant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jago and the Groyn: which was so great and scandalous, that for my part I know not which was more to bee condemned their malic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in so doing, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47565:55"/>
Xeures his negligence in not remedying it. Wherefore I say, that if that which was done, hee being here, hath pas't unpunished, and this, which hath bin committed in his absence, be not remedyed, from henceforwards I give all Castilla for lost and ruined. For this is a General maxime, if Iustice once lose her force, presently start's up insulting Tyrannie. <hi>Item</hi> since his Majestie's departure out of this Kingdom, This is the first scandal wherein it is requisite that the Council make appeare their Counsel and wisdom. And there is nothing that can give a greater evidence thereof, then in governing the People in such sort, that wee may gain the affections of the good, and bee no less feared by the evil. If the death of this <hi>Regidor</hi> bee thus smothered, and the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Toledo dissembled, the Carders of Segovia will thinke, and the Cap-makers of Toledo will Proclaime, that wee doe not let these things pass with our good wills, but that wee dare not punish them. And by this means Iustice will bee defamed in that shee cover's Feare, and which is worst of all, will lose the credite of being feared. In summ of all that I have spoken, I say, that my determinate will and opinion is, that an <hi>Alcalde de Corte,</hi> (who is in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I onely say thus much, that the Iudge ought to do wors to them by Iustice, then they did to Tordesillas without Iustice. Let all that I have said in this consultation bee under your most Reverend Lordship's correction: and if these Lords bee of any other opinion, I shall bee content to conform my self to them, for in matters of weight and moment, a man is not to defend his own opinion, but to follow that which is most expedient for the publick good.</p>

               <p>THe second that was remarkeable in this Consultation, was <hi>Don Alonso Tellez Giron,</hi> who in those times was esteemed a man of a good Conscience, a vertuous life, of a generous ofspring, and chiefly in the opinion (which hee

delivered) very circumspect, for hee would never give any counsel, unless hee had considered the matter throughly before hand. <hi>Don Antonio de Rojas</hi> having ended his speech, <hi>Don Alonso Tellez</hi> began, Saying.</p>

                  <head>The discreet Opinion of <hi>Don Alonso Tellez Giron.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT chanceth often-times amongst the most expert Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that being upon the point of giving battle, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the manner and order of their Combate, and if such men take oath of their dissenting opinions, I say that kind of discord proceedeth not from any particular difference betwixt them, but that each one of them thinkes, that what hee sayes is the best and most secure way to gain the Victorie that day. This I say, most Reverend Lord <hi>Cardinal,</hi> in order to my Lord Arch-Bishop and President his Speech, which was very good and beseeming a Prelate that is desirous of the publick good. But if hee and I doe differ in the meanes which is to bee used for the remedying of so great a scandal, wee shall not, I am confident, in our intentions be dissenting. I swear by the faith of a Christian and a Gentleman, and by this Holy habit of <hi>Santjago</hi> which I wear, that my soul desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing at this present more, then that wee may hit upon the right way of rectifying and providing for <hi>Segovia.</hi> For my mind giv's me, that if wee miss our aim in this first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, we shall not bee powerful enough hereafter to execute Justice. Hee that is to give his sens in such occurrences, ought not only to see to the remedying of mischiefs, but to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect and warie lest the fulfilling of his Vote should bee the occasion of a greater Inconvenience. For it may bee already (which God forbid) thinking to tile <hi>Segovia,</hi> wee have untiled it, and so bewetted all <hi>Spain.</hi> Vndoubtedly those of <hi>Segovia</hi> offended God in destroying his creature, and the King in murthering him for his cause. They scandalized the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by hanging him in that manner. And accordingly (if it were of no further consequence) nothing could bee more just,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47565:56"/>
then that the more cruel and barbarous they have shewd themselvs in that murther, the less pitie wee should shew in chastising them. I would say in this case, that wee are able to punish <hi>Segovia,</hi> or we are not able, and so likewise <hi>Toledo</hi> of their rebellion: and to speak the truth, to my best sens to chastise <hi>Segovia,</hi> or correct <hi>Toledo</hi> is yet too soon. For being, as we are, but newly come to the government, we should grant som privileges and libertie to the People at first, to win their obedience; and afterwards chastise them, that we may bee feared. Put case wee are not powerful enough (as I believ we are not) to quell that high couraged stubborn People, (if my Iudgment fail me not) I hold for most certain, that if <hi>Segovia</hi> lose their respect to us, the like we shall find through all the Cities of <hi>Spain.</hi> Moreover you know, my Lords, that it hath been averred to us, that there was never a Gentleman nor Citizen at the murther of <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> and that those Teazers which had committed the fact, were fled already. The Judge whom wee shall send thither, to seem that hee doth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, must rob the Poor, chastise the Innocent, disquiet the Rich, defame the Noble, and chiefly scandalize the bordering People, so that the untimely punishing of one man's death, may bee an occasion of destroying all. <hi>Item</hi> you know, My Lords, that the King, our Lord, had the ill will of all his Subjects for the ill Government of his Tutors, and certainly those of this Kingdom desire to express their discontents. Me think's, we should rather provide for and hinder the manifestation of the ill intentions of <hi>Castilla,</hi> then to stand so much upon the rigorous chastising of the Carders of <hi>Segovia,</hi> for it is the part of wise men to dissemble and defer the punishment of faults already past, and forthwith apply a remedie to a present evil. <hi>Item, Segovia</hi> cryeth out and desire's, that if Fifty or a Hundred weavers committed that outrage, the whole Citie should not lose its Innocence. And in my Judgment we should bee very injurious and unjust, if we should declare a whole Citie Traytors, when but few are guiltie, and I know the King hath manie faithful servants in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47565:57"/>
                     <hi>Segovia</hi>: therefore wee should commit a great offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Besides,</hi> it is as much the Propertie of Clement Princes to pardon many wicked men, for the respect of som few good, as it is the Practise of cruel Tyrants to condemn many good, for a few evil. <hi>Item,</hi> it is sufficiently known that <hi>Toledo</hi> is in Rebellion, and beeing (as it is) so powerful a Citie, wee cannot exercise Justice upon it. Now, if wee doe chastise <hi>Segovia,</hi> wee cannot do it so much dammage, as wee shall do favor to <hi>Toledo</hi> thereby. For all those whom wee take now for enemies, wee make friends to <hi>Toledo.</hi> And by this means there will bee manie favorers of their Tyranie, and but few to assist our Justice. <hi>Item,</hi> it is to be considered that the Citie of <hi>Segovia</hi> and the Town of <hi>Medina del Campo,</hi> by reason of the Cloaths of the one, and the fairs of the other, Those two People used alwaies to bee like Brothers. My end in saying this is, becaus the best Artillerie the King hath in <hi>Castilla</hi> is at <hi>Medina,</hi> and if the business were come to that, They would sooner give it <hi>Segovia</hi> for their defence, then to us to punish them. And by this means <hi>Segovia</hi> will get the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, and wee shall lose <hi>Medina. Item, Segovia</hi> hath not taken the Fort as yet, nor disobeyed the Justice, nor shut the Gates, nor taken up Armes; And if a Judge go thither to chastise them, perchance wee shall (the Guiltie beeing fled away for fear of punishment) give occasion of fear to those that are Innocent, and they put themselvs into a defensive posture thereupon. And this will bee the way to make those whom wee have as yet for subjects, declare themselvs our enemies, My Lords, I will not extend my self any further in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, but only that for the reasons which I have alleged, and for others which I could produce, I doe not deny but <hi>Segovia</hi> ought to bee chastised: But my vote is, that for the present, it should bee dissembled. For prolonging a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment never did harm: and an over-hastie execution of Justice never did good.</p>

After that they caused their pictures to bee set up in the Consistorie, with a writing at the foot of each, to signifie who they were, and what they had done against that Citie, and against the Faith they had sworn to them. At length, hearing that they were retired into that Monasterie, they sent to the Friers to turn them out, if not, they would go and set fire to the hous. And although they desired libertie to com with saftie of their persons to the Citie, and give them account of what they had done in <hi>Parlament,</hi> the People would not grant it, but used means to kill them.

               <p>THe Governor <hi>Cardinal Adriano</hi> desirous to go to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and to the end hee might make his entrance with the Autoritie that was requisite for his person and dignitie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Lord high Constable, who was at <hi>Villalpando,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie him, which hee did; and so they entered into <hi>Valla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid</hi> on <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> eve, whence the Constable returned presently.

They answered, That as a gentleman hee should protect them and free them from that slaverie wherein they lived. They would not hear him speak, but threatned him, if hee would not do as they required him: they continued pressing of him thus till night, and staied for his resolution till next daie. <hi>Don Diego</hi> at that time was Governor of <hi>Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and came thither onely to see the Ladie <hi>Isabel de Rojas</hi> his wife and his children, so hee presently got out of their hands, and that same night took his waie towards <hi>Cordova,</hi> leaving his hous to the charge &amp; care of <hi>Don Pedro de Cartagena</hi> Lord of <hi>Olmillos</hi> (who had married the Ladie <hi>Marie de Rojas</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to the Dean of <hi>Burgos Don Pedro Xuarez de Velasco,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Sarmiento,</hi> who was his kinsman.

and pulled down the hous of one of the King's Harbingers, named <hi>Garci Iofre,</hi> who, though hee was a Frenchman born, had been a long time in the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> service and the Emperor's. Hee was married, and had his dwelling in that Citie: they were incensed against him for no other reason, but becaus the Emperor had given him the command of the Hous and Castle of <hi>Lara,</hi> which <hi>Burgos</hi> pretended was theirs, and they demanded it of him, but becaus hee told them that hee had received that Castle of the Emperor, and that hee could not deliver it to anie but his Majestie, they went to kill him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither stopped their furie there; for poor <hi>Iofre</hi> being unfortunately there that daie, (beeing returned from <hi>France,</hi> whither hee went by the Emperors command with the <hi>French</hi> Embassador) and seeing how they plucked his Houses down, hee went to <hi>Lara,</hi> saying, <hi>That hee hoped in God to bee revenged, and to build up his Houses much better with those Rascal's monie, then they were when they pulled them down, and that hee should make morter of their bones, and temper the chalk with their blood.</hi> This being known in the Citie by the report of a Collier (to whom <hi>Iofre</hi> spoke it by the waie) they sent som men on hors-back privately after him, who overtook him in a little village called <hi>Vivar del Cid,</hi> three leagues from <hi>Burgos,</hi> where drawing him out of the Church, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him, &amp; had cut him in pieces there, but for som Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who qualified them for the present; yet they would not let him go out of their hands, but brought him to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> back again and clapt him into prison, where with blows and thrusts they soon dispatched him, and beeing dead, they tied his feet together, and dragged him first to his own door, striking and pinking his bodie with their swords all the waie: then they drew him through all the streets, and at last hanged him with his head downwards. <hi>Don Inigo Fernandez de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasco</hi> Lord High <hi>Constable,</hi> who was at <hi>Villalpando,</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hereof by a Letter from the Cardinal (wherein hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him for the love of God to go speedily &amp; set som remedie and order in that Citie) went presently to <hi>Burgos,</hi> and out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

The Towns-men sent to require them to surrender the Fort, if not, they threatned that none should go either in or out, but should bee either killed or taken; whereunto shee made Answer, that they troubled themselvs in vain, and shee would have them know, <hi>That</hi> although her husband was absent, neither shee, nor anie of the rest with her, were of

The Fort battered down all the neighboring houses, and the Gunners shewed much skill both within and without, yet did not so much mischief on either side, as they might have done. At last came som Religious men to mediate a peaceable agreement.

The next daie, the people returned to assault the Fort, and their Gunner killed the Gunner of the Fort, and left them none to manage the Artillerie.

to harken to an accommodation (but they continued not long in that mind) for the business depending of so many several People, that which was concluded one day, vvas quite broke off the next; and at last they fell into such a popular madness, that throvving aside all respect, they vvould lay violent hands upon <hi>Don Iohn Arias,</hi> peremptorily bidding him deliver up to them the places of strength, vvhich hee had under his command, and seeing hee would not do that, they demanded the Artillerie vvhich vvas in them; and becaus hee denyed that also, vvith great nois and tumult they gathered together in the hous vvhere the Assemblie vvas kept, and made an order that <hi>Iohn Arias</hi> should presently deliver the Artillerie, and in case of default, hee should suffer death as an enemie of the common good.

The Gentleman thanked him in the Citie's behalf, as beeing a member of it, and said, Hee did not certainly know their intention, but according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the onely waie to cure those mischiefs, was to applie the same medicine which they desired, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Majestie would bee pleased to grant to <hi>Toledo</hi> what their Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had petitioned him in Parlament; That his Eminence would command <hi>Ronquillo,</hi> the Judg, to rais his Siege before <hi>Segovia,</hi> and return with his men, in regard the Citie was much scandalized at his coming in such an hostile manner, they having sent two Prelates with their submission, and begging pardon of his Eminence; <hi>that</hi> hee knew how all the chief Cities of the Kingdom, beeing guiltie of the like Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, every one would exspect the like punishment, and out of that fear, they would rather join all their Forces to succor <hi>Segovia,</hi> then bee liable to anie such rigorous sentence; <hi>that</hi> he should be very careful in that point, for if the people once lost their respect, hee would not bee able to correct them: <hi>That</hi> for the present (although there were tumults and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions everie where) yet there was no publick War decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, onely dissentions amongst the people.

For these two families beeing the chief and most Ancient of the Citie, had each of them manie friends, kindred and abbettours; but in regard the <hi>Earl</hi> was out of favour with the people, and <hi>Ramiro Nunnez</hi> much beloved and followed by a great multitude, they fell upon the <hi>Earl</hi> and his partie with such furie, that they killed thirteen of his men, there were manie on both sides wounded. The <hi>Earl</hi> was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the swiftness of his hors, or else hee had born his dead followers companie. This news was brought to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and the Cardinall highly resented it, but knew not how to remedie it, seeing the fire so generally kindled throughout the kingdom, that of the eighteen Towns of <hi>Castilla</hi> which had Votes in Parlament, fifteen were risen for the Commonaltie, and had chosen Commissioners, or Burgesses, to goe to the <hi>Iunta,</hi> or, <hi>Assemblie,</hi> then held in <hi>Avila.</hi> The Cardinall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the fault of all this mischief upon <hi>Monsieur de Xeures,</hi> for

The Cardinal was out of heart, and perplext with continual fears, not thinking himself secure in <hi>Valladolid,</hi> by reason of these troubles and heart-burnings of the people, which no fault of the King's but the covetousness of his insatiable Counsellers, had occasioned. I have alreadie told you, that one Subsidie they desired was three hundred millions, and another time six hundred millions, in all nine hundred millions of Maravediz; therefore let no man marvel at the great difference of these sums, for in effect no bodie could rightly understand what they would have had; yet they saie, the Emperor desired no more then the ordinarie Subsidie that his Predecessors, the Catholick Kings had, (which was two hundred millions everie year) and that the over-plus they stole from him and the Kingdom, contrarie to his will or knowledg.</p>

               <p>THe Emperor had already received som intelligence of these troubles in <hi>Spain,</hi> by means of <hi>Flemish</hi> Merchants, and other particular letters; But when those from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Council came to his hands at <hi>Lovain,</hi> Hee was seized with unexpressible sadness. The necessitie of his going to bee crowned in <hi>Germanie</hi> was very urgent, and his returning into <hi>Spain</hi> seemed yet of more importance. The Letter's sad Contents br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Flemings</hi> condemned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for raising these tumults ond commotions in their King's absence: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> retorted the blame upon the <hi>Flemings,</hi> saying, That their ill Government had been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the ruine and loss of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that they had robbed it; and indeed to saie the truth, They were both in fault; for the <hi>Flemings</hi> were as short of discretion and prudence to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, as they abounded with a too insatiable Covetousness.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47565:82"/>
And the Spaniards, although they had som reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, could not bee excused for rising up in Arms. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Xeures</hi> grew much discontented and ashamed upon the report of this breaking out of <hi>Spain,</hi> partly becaus hee knew what opinion went of him in the Court, but chiefly becaus hee thought (as justly hee might) the Emperor would derive the fault upon him: who, whil'st hee was in <hi>Spain,</hi> commanded with so absolute a power, that it was commonly said, The Emperor <hi>Don Carlos</hi> is King by right, and <hi>Monsieur de Xeures</hi> in effect. The Emperor beeing thus disquieted, called a Council, and desiring to have their advices, hee propounded, That they would consider what means was to bee vsed, that Hee might go into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and receiv that Crown which Hee so much desired, and provide som reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to settle the disturbances of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was of no less importance to him, for his Coronation could bee no longer suspended, and the remedying of <hi>Spain</hi> ought not to bee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. Hee had of his Council in this occurrence, <hi>Germanes, Flemings, Italians, Aragoneses</hi> and <hi>Castillans</hi>; and their opinions were as different as their Nations.

But at last the resolution of the business was given by few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as great Princes use to do in like occurrences. The result of this Consultation was, <hi>That</hi> the Emperor should continue his journie into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and having received the Imperial Crown, there to remain until hee had fully settled the affairs of that Countrie, not being everie daie to return thither. It was likewise resolved, <hi>That</hi> his Majestie should send amiable and gracious Letters to all the Cities and Towns of <hi>Castilla,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47565:83"/>
som of them to return unto themselvs and his service, and expressing his thankfulness to others for their good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards him; <hi>That</hi> hee should desire and encharge the Nobles and Gentrie to favor and assist those of his Roial Council; promising to all upon the faith of his Roial word, that with all possible expedition hee would return into <hi>Castil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> (for the thought of the Emperor's never returning into <hi>Spain,</hi> bred in the Common people the boldness to commit such outrages and exorbitances). Moreover it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>That</hi> the Emperor should write unto the President and Council, condoling their troubles and persecution, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them withall, that in one place or other, six of them should alwaies bee about the Cardinal and hold Council: To the end they might serv as a Refuge for the good people to appeal unto, and bee a terror to the evil: for if the Council omitted the doing of Justice, the Roial Autoritie must needs fall. And also, <hi>That</hi> the Emperor should appoint two other Governors to bee joined in Commission with the Cardinal, and those to bee men of noble extractions, well experienced, and advanced in years, of generous dispositions, powerful in estates, but chiefly Natives of that Kingdom. This advice see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very sound and pertinent to the Emperor, whereupon hee gave order it should bee put in execution accordingly, and those whom they Voted to bee joined in Commission with the Cardinal were, <hi>Don Fadrique Enriquez</hi> Lord High Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Castilla,</hi> and <hi>Don Inigo de Velasco</hi> Lord High Constable, who were both antient Gentlemen of great generositie and gallantrie. Which Election gave no small satisfaction to the <hi>Castillan</hi> partie, for they had shewen themselvs in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not onely wise but valiant, and were alwaies fortunate in their undertakings. These Noblemen governed with such valour and prudence, that the Emperor in his Letters to the Lord High Constable, give's him thanks for his services, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that by his means hee was King of <hi>Castilla.</hi> And indeed the Emperor said but what was true. Besides all this, his Majestie sent an especial Command, <hi>That</hi> the subsidie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47565:83"/>
which was granted him at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> should not bee exacted from those Cities which continued in their obedience to him, nor from those which were willing to submit and bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for it was his will and pleasure graciously to forgive it them. This grace hee did likewise to the whole Kingdom, <hi>That</hi> the Roial Revenue should bee allowed for the Taxes, as during the Reigns of other Catholick Kings, his Ancestors. Hee resolved also to abrogate the sale, farming and enhaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Taxes and Impositions, (which indeed were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great): and besides hee sent to offer and certifie, <hi>That</hi> no Office in that Kingdom should bee conferred upon anie whomsoëver, unless hee were a Native; which if hee had granted when hee was desired, these Commotions had never happened. Of all this were ingrossed his Majestie's Patents and Commissions of sufficient power. Yet notwithstanding these three things were the principal grievances and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reasons that <hi>Toledo</hi> and the other Cities alleged for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of their tumultuous risings: The granting all these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands was not available enough to quiet their Commotions and reduce them to obedience;<note place="margin">Here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor flatter's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And in regard one of the most notorious Actors in these tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call disorders, was <hi>Don Antonio de Acunna,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Zamora,</hi> who is famous to this very daie, for the strangeness of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and manner of the death hee suffred, which was not suitable to the dignitie of a <hi>Prelate,</hi> (but very answerable to his Actions, since it was done with very great justification of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and by the Autoritie of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, as appear's upon Record in the Arches of <hi>Simancas,</hi> which I have seen) you shall briefly hear who this Bishop was, and what his conditions. During the time of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> the second his raign in <hi>Castilla,</hi> lived in that Kingdom <hi>Don Luis Osorio de Acunia,</hi> a Gentleman of eminent note and account, father to <hi>Don Diego Osorio</hi> and this <hi>Don Antonio de Acunia,</hi> to whom his father dying left the Arch-Deakonship of <hi>Valpuesta,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other meanes, In these times hee beeing in service to their Catholick <hi>Majestie's</hi> was sent by them Embassador into <hi>France,</hi> after which the Bishoprick of <hi>Zamora</hi> was conferred upon him. The King was not very well pleased with him, becaus hee was of a turbulent Spirit, a lover of broils, impatient, adventurously bold, and one that did take more upon him, then his profession and degree required. Hee was naturally inclined to Arms, his ambition was to make himself Lord and Master of <hi>Zamora,</hi> where the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Alva de Lista</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47565:85"/>
then lived, son in law to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva,</hi> a stout gallant Gentleman and a great lover of honor. The Bishop and the Earl meeting about certain affairs betwixt them they grew to such odds, that very good Mediators were not able to pacifie them. <hi>Zamora</hi> beeing in Rebellion, and paying no obedience but to the <hi>Junta</hi> or <hi>Assemblie,</hi> the Bishop on one side and the Earl on the other, used all means possible to draw the people to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir factions. The Earl was better beloved, and bore the greater sway in the Citie, so that the Bishop was forced to leav it: It made him half madd to lose his hous, and so desperate seeing his Enemie prevail so far against him, That hee presently went to <hi>Tordesillas</hi> (where the Commissioners of the <hi>Iunta</hi> were then assembled) with whom hee joyned in confederacie, desiring them to assist him and furnish him with forces to beat the Earl of <hi>Alva</hi> out of <hi>Zamora.</hi> They all received him with great respect and contentment, thinking it an honor to their caus, to have so eminent a <hi>Prelate</hi> amongst them, they gave him men and Artillerie, wherewith hee marched back towards <hi>Zamora.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bishop was threescore years of age, but as vigorous and lively as if hee had been but five and and twentie. I was acquainted with one that knew him and received orders from him, who told me that hee was excellent at handling his arms.

At last the Citie of <hi>Avila</hi> seeing what <hi>Ronquillo</hi> did against <hi>Segovia</hi>; and the adjacent Towns, that hee entred into the Villages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Avila,</hi> taking, killing and executing Justice in a severe manner, and that by order of the Cardinal and the Council, hee had taken from <hi>Segovia</hi> all the Places and Towns under its jurisdiction, commanding them not to obey or bee anie waie subject to that Citie, neither to furnish them with provisions anie more then if they were their enemies, under pain of death and confiscation of goods, giving them power and Autoritie to keep Justice amongst themselvs, as beeing a distinct jurisdiction, and other priviledges to the distruction of that Citie: They assembled in Council, and agreed to send a Petition in the name and with the subscriptions of the Officers of Justice, the <hi>Regidores,</hi> Gentrie, Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and of all the Commonaltie, humbly beseeching the Cardinal that hee would bee pleased to set a remedie to those disorders, and not proceed with so much rigor against <hi>Segovia,</hi> for that Citie would bee reduced sooner by fair means then by such severitie. That hee would command <hi>Ronquillo</hi> to rais his Siege, and that hee should not molest, nor use such crueltie against <hi>Segovia.</hi> The Cardinal and those of the Council did not weigh much this Petition of <hi>Avila,</hi> which so incensed that Citie, that thereupon they sent them word
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47565:86"/>
peremptorily, that since they would not rectifie those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they were resolved to seek their own remedie.

It happened that two young men coming out of <hi>Segovia,</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Ronquillo's</hi> Guards, who asking them whence they were, and whither they went? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That they were of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> that they came from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govia,</hi> and were returning to their own homes. At first the Guards were in the minde to let them go, becaus they seemed to bee but poor fellows, yet afterwards they laid hands on them and brought them before <hi>Ronquillo</hi>; who asking them who they were, whither they went, and whence they came? They said, they were Carders, who seeing <hi>Segovia</hi> streightned, and trading dead, they were upon their return to their ovvn houses. Hee examined them severally concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Tordesillas</hi> his death, and they agreed not in their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ronquillo</hi> thereupon began to press them further, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more and more &amp; more questions, till at last one of them confessed he fetched the rope vvherevvith they dragged <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillas</hi> along the streets, and the other that hee plucked him by the hair.

Yet becaus it was thought fit that a business of such weight (as that wherewith hee was intrusted to impart to them) should rather bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to them all in that place, then communicated to any members in particular, and in regard they were then all assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, hee again notified those Letters unto them, giving them to understand that the Lords of the <hi>Junta,</hi> moved with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holie zeal, and desire of procuring the Kindom's good and his Majestie's service, had found it convenient (to the end the Intent of the <hi>Junta</hi> might the better take effect) that there should bee no Council Roial at all, but that the President and the rest should bee sent prisoners to <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> and to shew that their Intentions were holie, and tending onely to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and the King, in the name of the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the <hi>Junta,</hi> hee did assure the lives of the Council,

but not their goods and estates. For they must know, that whosoëver of that Council had offended, his estate was liable to confiscation, according to the qualitie of his delict, and that the monie which should accrue, should repair in part the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which they had occasioned.

In the end, they agreed to give the Frier this answer, That if the <hi>Junta</hi> did desire to apprehend those of the <hi>Council,</hi> they should send their own Captains and souldiers to do it, for <hi>Valladolid</hi> would have no hand in either helping or hindering them in that design, neither would they favor the one side, or oppose the other.

The Holy man with much meekness, answered, that hee would willingly retire himself with the Lord Admiral at <hi>Medina de Rioseco.</hi> But those of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> holding it their best waie to keep him there, would not let him go. They present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set guards at the Gates of the Citie, that none of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people should go out, for they began already to feare, lest they should go joyn with the Lord high Constable, who was levying forces to resist and suppress those Tumults, which were grown so excessive in the Kingdom, to whom were repaired those of Council, that escaped from <hi>Valladolid,</hi> to the end that <hi>Castilla,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cardinal indeavouring to go out of <hi>Valladolid</hi> is stopped by the people.</note> might not remain without Justice. The next morning early the Cardinal, beeing fully resolved to bee gon, departed from his hous with an hundred and fiftie men on horsback and on foot, besides divers of the principal persons of the Citie, who guarded him on both sides. But coming to the bridg they would not let him pass, there hee stayed a good while, still commanding his people to bee quiet and offer no violence, for they would have broke down the Gates and forced their way through. This beeing known in the Citie, there was presently a great hubbub, and a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>The Governor's goeing away, The Governor's goeing away.</hi> Hereupon one <hi>Alonso de Vera,</hi> a Deputie of a ward, without any Command or Order from the Captain Generall of the Commonaltie, ran in great hast to ring the Council Bell, which beeing heard the Citie presently took the Alarme, and in a trice there was such a hurly-burly and confusion of people in the stree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

numerous Armie of compleat men, with new shining arms, but without order and without Captain. The Cardinal see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this tumult, turned back againe towards the Citie, and beeing half way ouer the bridg some of his servants said to him, <hi>My Lord! your Eminence should do well to stand still there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you see what is the meaning of this boldness of the People.</hi> So hee did remain a while, having a strong guard before him. But the people came swarming to that place like emmets. Whilest the Cardinal was at this stand, came <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> to whom all the people bore as much respect, as if hee had been their Lord. Hee was mounted upon a stately Ginnet, his body was covered with Armor as bright as silver, his head with a richly guilded helmet, his hors proudly praunsing along the streets, made waie through the disorderly throng, untill hee came where the Governor stood, to whom after salutation,<note place="margin">

                  </note> hee thus spake. <hi>My Lord! I am sorry that your Eminence would offer to go away thus without the consent of the Citie and Kingdom, if my Counsel might prevail, you should return to your lodging, for if you stay longer here, it will not bee in the power of man to remedie or hinder the mischief, which your departure may produce.</hi> The Cardinal's men not throughly understanding <hi>Don Pedro's</hi> speech, began to draw their swords; which some of the people, that had crowded neer, seeing, cryed out, <hi>Arm, Arm Commoners, help, help.</hi> Hereupon grew such a noise and so great a tumult, that had not the President of the Chancerie, <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> and other Gentlemen been there to appease the furie of the people, they scarse had left one man alive of all those that were with the Cardinal. But all beeing pacified, hee returned with his guards to his lodging, accompanied with other Prelates and divers Gentlemen of qualitie, and after all, followed his traine of bagage in the same order as they marched outwards. The Common People went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all armed, with sound of drums and trumpets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him to his lodging, with all due honor and reverence. By this time it was full twelve of the clock, so that they spent six hours at least in this contention. The <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi>

The newes beeing carried to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desillas,</hi> how those of <hi>Valladolid</hi> had opposed and detained the Cardinal, besides the good order they kept for the guard and defens of their Citie, The <hi>Iunta</hi> sent an express with Letters to give the People thanks in their names, extolling their valor to the skies, which puffed up the people's hearts with a kinde of vanitie, and incouraged them to commit greater exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies another time.</p>

No Noblemen or Gentlemen could pass through the streets, but those of the Confederacie would deride and flout them with base reviling language.

And his threats were accomplished; for they made their Election ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rights and custom of the Citie. Whereat the people were so enraged, that they committed those outrages which shall bee set down hereafter. In this distemper and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant hare-brainedness, <hi>Don Diego de Mendosa</hi> found the mindes of the people in <hi>Valencia,</hi> when hee came to bee their Governor. <hi>Sorolla, Vicente Periz,</hi> one <hi>Iohn Caro,</hi> and other lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of the <hi>Confederacie,</hi> understanding that the Vice-Roy had been fully informed of their demeanors, and of the state of things, but yet dissembled the knowledg thereof out of fear, considering what power and credite their <hi>Confederacie</hi> had with the people: they complotted that <hi>Sorolla</hi> should hide himself in his own hous, and that the rest should go up and down the Citie and acquaint all his friends and allies that the Vice-Roy had sent for <hi>Sorolla,</hi> and that (as they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) hee either had already hanged him, or was then about it, and that for manie respects, they ought not to let such a man suffer, who was the defendor and mainteiner of the publick good. This report beeing thus cunningly spread through the whole Citie, so incensed the people's mindes, that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant all was up in Arms, Drums beating, and Colours flying, and in this manner they marched to the Vice-Roy's hous, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Let the Vice-Roy die, if hee deliver us not Sorolla.</hi> The Vice-Roy, and som Gentlemen that were in the hous at that time with him, besides his servants, defended the windows and doors, where the assault was hottest all daie long, and night beeing com (as God would have it) a good woman one

All these Gentlemen's houses within the Citie, the people plucked down or burned, and plundered their goods; a thousand more abominable mischiefs they did, which I am ashamed to relate (so cruel and unruly is that Beast, the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when it hath broke the bridle.) They armed all the slaves, and received manie <hi>Moriscos</hi> for souldiers. From <hi>Cozentayna</hi> the Vice-Roy went to <hi>Xativa</hi>; the Inhabitants of that Citie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to give them leav to muster upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s daie, which hee denying, they marched out of the Citie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight and contempt of him, and mustered before his face. The Vice-Roy hereupon, fearing a second trick of <hi>Valencia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the Fort, which those of <hi>Xativa</hi> perceiving, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that no bodie, under pain of death, should furnish him with victuals, or anie provision whatsoëver. Hereupon hee went from thence to <hi>Denia,</hi> becaus if hee was pursued by land, hee might escape thence by sea. Those of <hi>Valencia,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Vice-Roy was fled to <hi>Denia,</hi> after that <hi>Xativa</hi> had rebelled against him, resolved to seiz upon all the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and Customs: which to effect, they went to the Custom houses and broke the Records, took away the Books, and spoke words which were wors then their deeds. Those of <hi>Valencia,</hi> seeing themselvs masters of the Citie, the Vice-Roy and all the Gentrie beeing gone, they ordered the Government thereof. They appointed thirteen persons to govern and defend it, whom they call'd the <hi>Thirteen</hi> of the <hi>Confederacie.</hi> These Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen chose for the General of their Armie <hi>Iohn Caro,</hi> (who was a Sugar-baker) and held intelligence with the whole Kingdom: Insomuch that assoon as the news was heard of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Valencia</hi> and <hi>Xativa,</hi> and that the Vice-Roy was fled, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the Citie of <hi>Oribuela</hi> &amp; the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Helche</hi> did the like, and at length there was no Citie or Town but rebelled also, in imitation of <hi>Valencia,</hi> treating the Gentrie and nobler Citizens with the like dis-respect and tyrannie. And the Gentrie, with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47565:101"/>
their servants, arms, goods, and all they could get, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their King's service. So that (which is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of note and esteem) there was not one Gentleman, nor person of any birth or qualitie through that whole Kingdom that sided with that vile <hi>Commonaltie,</hi> but valiantly and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously ventured their lives and fortunes in their Prince's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, although hee was out of the Kingdom; they suffered patiently their houses to bee pulled down, their goods to bee burned, their towns destroied, and all to shew their fidelitie to their King. The Citie of <hi>Oribuela</hi> chose for their Captain one <hi>Palomares,</hi> who made himself so absolute Lord of those people (beeing but a poor Serving-man) that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee drew out five thousand men into the field to fight, though hee paied dearly for it afterwards. The <hi>Confederates,</hi> having lost their respect to the Vice-Roy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to lose likewise the fear of God. They made a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie amongst them, the result whereof was to rob and take away all the riches of the Monasteries and Churches. Which beeing discovered, the loial Partie desired <hi>Don Rodrigo de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosa</hi> Marquess of <hi>Cenete,</hi> to take upon him the Autoritie of the Justice for the King, which hee did, and like a good resolute Gentleman, hee hung up three or four of the chief Conspirators, and so the robberie which they intended was prevented, and the Citie quieted for certain daies. But soon after the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates marched into the field towards <hi>Denia,</hi> to drive the Vice-Roy out of the Kingdom. Ten thousand men in Arms <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia</hi> furnished to that effect. The Clergie with their Hoods upon their heads, and Crosses in their hands, stood all at the gate of <hi>San Vicente,</hi> and as the Confederates passed by them, the Priests and Friers said to them, Sirs! <hi>Misericordia, Misericordia</hi>; and they answered, swearing, <hi>Cuerpo de Dios, Iusticia, Iusticia.</hi> And indeed God's Justice did abundantly fall upon their heads; for the greatest part of those that answered so, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther killed in battle, or executed by Justice afterwards. <hi>Iohn Caro</hi> and <hi>Sorolla</hi> were Captains of this Armie. The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates having the sole power and command of <hi>Valencia, Iohn
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47565:101"/>
Caro</hi> was sent with a sufficient force to besiege the Castle of <hi>Corbera,</hi> six leagues from <hi>Valencia,</hi> which while hee was batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with some peeces of Artillerie, <hi>Don Geronimo Vique</hi> (who at that time was at a Monasterie of Friers of the order of <hi>San Geronimo,</hi> half a league from the Castle) desired to speak with him, who, overcom with his persuasions and powerful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, raised his siege.

eight thousand Foot and some Hors, fleshed with their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie over the Vice-Roy, and recruited with many fresh men from <hi>Valencia.</hi> Whereupon the Duke sent <hi>Don Iayme</hi> with the Hors to discover, and according to his advice, hee would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as speedily as might bee with the Foot. This was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with so much discretion and valor, that the Duke gave them an absolute rout, leaving above five thousand men dead upon the place, for which it is called to this daie, <hi>The field of slaughter.</hi> This Victorie restored the Kingdom, which if it had otherwise succeeded, the Common People had become absolute Masters without any contradiction. Things beeing in this condition, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> returned with a fresh supplie, and incamped his Armie about <hi>Alcira</hi> and <hi>Xativa</hi>; The People were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amazed, and startled at the rout the Duke had given them. Yet those of <hi>Alcira</hi> and <hi>Xativa</hi> marched out very strong to meet with the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and finding him a league from the Citie, they gave him battle, the conflict was so hot, and so well maintained on both sides, that it was hard to saie which had the advantage, the combate continued all daie, and at night both Armies beeing very wearie, and great store of men hurt, they were both glad to retreat, seeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment and medicaments to dress their wounded men. About this time the Cities of <hi>Oribuela</hi> and <hi>Alicante,</hi> with all the Towns and Places under their jurisdiction, associated themselvs with the People of <hi>Valencia.</hi> But all the Gentrie and persons of qualitie followed their Governor <hi>Don Pedro Masa,</hi> who was inforced to quit those two Cities, and the Castle of <hi>Oribuela,</hi> whereof hee was Governor. But <hi>Don Iayme de Puyg,</hi> a valorous Gentleman (who was Lievtenant of the Castle under the Governor) with fifteen or sixteen men defended himself gallantly against the furie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, when in their violentest heat they killed, burned and sacked the Gentlemen's houses. The <hi>Marquis de los Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez, Don Pedro Faxardo, Adelantado Mayor</hi> (that is Lord Deputie or Lord Lievtenant) of the Kingdom of <hi>Murcia,</hi> having

The Governor advised with the Marquis about relieving the Castle of <hi>Oribuela,</hi> which was in great necessitie, every one of his Troopers carrying in, a sack of provision behinde him, whilest the Marquess amused the enemie with skirmishes, for hee doubted not to bee back with him time enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit them.

Upon a Fridaie morning in the same month, fell a sudden storm of hail, with most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Thunder-claps, after which, in a ground betwixt the Countie of <hi>Oliva</hi> and Dutchie of <hi>Gandia,</hi> were found three stones (which fell from the skie) in colour and make like flints. <hi>Fray Antonio de Guevara</hi> Chronicler to his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, and Bishop of <hi>Mondoniedo,</hi> reporteth, that hee saw one of them hung in a chain in <hi>Santa Maria</hi> Church, a league from <hi>Oliva,</hi> which weighed no less then five and twentie pounds. The passage which I am now about to relate is so remarkable, that men cannot but admire the blindness which possessed the miserable people that affected these novelties and Insurrections. There was nothing more certainly known in <hi>Spain,</hi> then that the Prince <hi>Don Iohn</hi> (onely issue male of his father and mother, the Catholick Kings, and immediate Heir to these Kingdoms) died at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> to the exceeding grief and resentment of his parents and all <hi>Spain,</hi> and in those daies there was no further scruple or question thereof. But since in the time of these unhappie Commotions, the Confederates of <hi>Valencia</hi> were so besotted, that a strange mean fellow of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt (who came in a fugitive manner out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and associated himself with them) that they received him, and beleiving, or seeming to believ him, to bee the <hi>Prince Don Iohn,</hi> they swore allegeance to him, as King, and hee Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and ruled over them for two years, until hee met with the end hee deserved, as shall bee seen hereafter. In the year of our Lord 1512, a certain Merchant of <hi>Biscaya,</hi> named <hi>Iuan de Vilvao,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bilbo,</hi> went to trade at the Citie of <hi>Oran.</hi> In the ship which carried him and his commodities, hee light upon a passenger, who addressing himself to him, told him that hee could write and read in several languages, and that if hee pleased to give him any competent subsistence,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47565:103"/>
hee would bee glad to serv him as his factor, and teach his children; the Merchant entertained him, and took him on board with him at <hi>Cartagena,</hi> thinking himself the happiest man living, that hee had so luckily met with a man of such abilities to instruct his children and follow his business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. This fellow was of a low stature, thin-faced, of a sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low complexion, hee had a terrible look, his eies beeing of a black and green color, little hair, and thin upon his head, his beard wors furnished; hee was a man of verie few words, in his Conversation somwhat too strict and austere, seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intemperate in his diet, a great eater, but drank little, hee spoke <hi>Spanish, Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi> It never was known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly who his father was, onely hee confessed, while hee was under the lash, that hee was a Jew's son, and that hee was Circumcised, but never Baptized, for his father carried him into <hi>Barberie,</hi> in the same year the Jews were driven out of <hi>Castilla.</hi> Hee remained in this Merchant's hous until the year 1516, which vvas four years: and to ingratiate himself the more vvith his Master, hee told him, thenceforvvards hee vvould call himself by his name <hi>Iuan de Vilvao.</hi> But the Merchant having occasion to absent himself often from his hous, leaving his wife, children, and goods, all in charge with this servant, one time at his return from <hi>Castilla,</hi> hee was told by his neighbors that <hi>Iuan de Vilvao,</hi> his man, was a slepperie companion, and that in his absence hee was too familiar with his wife; others said, hee had abused his daughter. Hereupon without any further examination, hee turned him presently out of his hous, not declaring anie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or reason hee had for so doing, becaus hee could not have his servant punished otherwise, without bringing his own honor in question. At that time there was a young man <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidor</hi> of <hi>Oran,</hi> who not knowing wherefore the Merchant had discarded his servant <hi>Iuan de Vilvao,</hi> entertained him to bee his Steward. The <hi>Corregidor</hi> having a handsom young wench, which hee kept privately in his hous, <hi>Iuan de
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47565:104"/>
Vilvao</hi> used all means possible to gain her acquaintance and affection, and withall to persuade her to learn witchcraft; for amongst other good qualities, this wicked fellow was a great Practitioner in Negromancie. The young maid beeing little pleased with his sollicitations, resolved at last to acquaint the <hi>Corregidor,</hi> how hee importuned her, and that hee would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade her to learn witchcraft, but chiefly that hee had made her promise to give him poison, that so they two might with more freedom enjoie each other's affection. The <hi>Corregidor</hi> was much startled and amazed hereat, for hee thought his hous and Paramour as secure with <hi>Iuan de Vilvao,</hi> as if hee had committed her to the custodie of an Eunuch, and therefore hee did not absolutely credit her accusation of him; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards observing with a more strict eie the carriage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee committed him to the publick Gaol, whence upon a market daie hee was fetch't out, set upon an Ass, with his sorceries about his neck, and whipped through all the principal streets of the Citie. The people were all asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that hee should bee so close a villain, for every bodie had a very good opinion of him; After this, beeing banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Oran,</hi> hee returned into <hi>Spain,</hi> and dis-embarked upon the Coast of <hi>Valencia,</hi> just in the time of these disastrous troubles. Hee, by his juggling inventions, begat himself a great esteem and credit first amongst the Confederates of <hi>Algecira.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee came to <hi>Xativa,</hi> under the name of <hi>Don Henrique Manrique de Ribera,</hi> and beeing a subtil Impostor, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates simple, and besotted with passion, hee wrought so much upon their blinde credulitie, that they made him their General, and by little and little hee so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagled them that they held him for their God, and their King. <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> (who was Captain General of the Confederate Rebels of <hi>Valencia</hi>) made great submissions to him, saying, that God had sent him to give them libertie, and that hee

                  </note> it was convenient for him not to bee publickly known in the world for long time past, but now since the Kingdom's were in so distressed a condition, and in so great necessitie of their naturall King, to own and defend them, and settle them in the same peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they injoyed during his Father's Reign, hee desired to reveal himself unto them, and that it was God's will also. This those wretched Confederates beleiving, followed and honored him, as if hee had been their God. Thus having gained the affection and esteem of these Rebels, hee conferred with divers of the Citie of <hi>Valencia,</hi> of <hi>la Huerta,</hi> and other places thereabouts, inticing them to put in execution what that Tyrant, <hi>Vicente Periz,</hi> had alreadie moved. Hee dealt likewise with some places of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Catalunia</hi> (which were alreadie tottering and half, at least, inclining to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, ingaging them, that at the same instant (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) as hee should make his Attempts upon <hi>Valencia,</hi> they should all rise in arms, and secure those parts for him. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Valencia</hi> hee had his intelligencers, and instruments, whom hee imployed to murder the Marquis of <hi>Cenete,</hi> then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the Citie; These were so faithful to him in this treacherous design, that hee wanted not assistants to convey him over the walls into the Citie, whereby hee might the better contrive his plot, seeing the disposition of the place, and (having a more free communication with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) allure and draw to his byas more complices, to strengthen his partie, and execute his wicked intention. This was so cunningly carried, that if God had not otherwise disposed it, the whole Kingdom at that time ran a notable hazard of beeing absolutely destroied. The Citie of <hi>Valencia</hi>

(as I have told you) beeing in so miserable a condition, the Religious men, with other good and loial people, went to petition the Marquis of <hi>Cenete</hi> (who then was in the Camp) to take upon him the Government of that distressed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

The Marquis was a man of such courage and resolution, that when, throughout the whole Citie of <hi>Valencia,</hi> no bodie durst so much as name <hi>God, King</hi> or <hi>Iustice,</hi> hee took divers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious disturbers and hanged them.

Soon after having notice of a band of these Confederates, which were fled from <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> hee marched out against them, and meeting them about <hi>Monviedro,</hi> hee brought away their Colors, having routed and put them all to flight. Amongst divers great hazards which the Marquis ran of losing his life, by the insolence or treacherie of these Confederates, one I shall give in particular; A mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous disorderly multitude of these wretches beeing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in <hi>Valencia,</hi> fell like a furious storm upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis his hous, with huge clamorous out-cries and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Marquis hearing the nois, went down to quiet the tumult, beeing well provided and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but his Ladie seeing him engaged amongst a throng of such vile respectless people, and fearing lest hee should bee murthered by them, took such a fright, that her weak Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution beeing not able to resist the violence of that sudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, shee presently expired. <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> Captain of the Rebells, with a numerous Armie intrenched himself and planted his Cannon within sight of <hi>Valencia,</hi> where hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained som time: In his Camp hee had a bell, at the sound whereof a numberless gang of thievs, such as his Armie was composed of, ran out of the Citie to him: And had not the

Marquis been very circumspect, without question they had suprised the Citie; but finding little probabilitie of effecting their design upon <hi>Valencia,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Monviedro,</hi> thinking to make the Vice-Roy rais his siege thence, but within two daies after <hi>Monviedro</hi> was surrendered to him (which was of no small importance) for thereby hee had an open and free passage to receiv succour out of <hi>Castilla.</hi> The Marquis hearing that the Confederates were marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Monviedro</hi> with their Cannon, and having intelligence of their intentions, followed them (but with no consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able force) and meeting some of his own foot companies, which having been much galled by their Cannon and small shot, were retreating towards <hi>Valencia</hi> quite disheartned, hee strove to incourage them as well as hee could, representing to them the service of God and their King; but prevailing not with them, howëver he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet his nobleness and generositie was such (though they deserved it not) that hee commanded his men (who were very busie in killing) to forbear further execution, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Let them not die, let them not die</hi>: having thus quite routed these Mutiniers, hee returned to <hi>Valencia</hi> with the spoil, and all their Artillerie, where hee was received with joy and tears. The Vice-Roy afterwards, beeing before <hi>Xativa,</hi> with intent to reduce it to the Emperor's subjection, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels dealt so cunningly with some of his Souldiers (who sowed the same dissention in his Camp, as was within the Town) that by certain signs they understood each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and they agreed at one and the same time to fall upon the Loyall Partie, and murther them; and having taken their Artillerie, to storm <hi>Valencia,</hi> sack it, and kill all that were for the Emperor in it. This conspiracie was discovered,

The Adversaries beeing mad at the good success the Marquis had wrought within <hi>Xativa,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired how <hi>Vicente Periz,</hi> their Captain might secretly convey himself into the Citie, and gathering as manie of the people, as hee could, together, apprehend the Marquis. This was effected, and <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> with a multitude of well armed men went to assault the Marquis, who beeing but slenderly provided, and weakly attended, and seeing a squadron of these thievs advance towards him, dissembled, and made as if hee knew them not, asking them thus, <hi>Are you our friends? do you com to serv the King?</hi> To which they answered neither yea, nor no, but seemed to bee daunted at the very sight of the Marquis. Hereupon with much seeming affection hee spake aloud, <hi>Nay then my boies, Viva el Rey; viva el Rey</hi>; which said, hee fell upon them, and took away their Arms. Presently upon this the rest of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies discovered themselvs, and began to fight, discharging
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47565:106"/>
their Cross-bows and Musket-shots as thick as hail against the Marquis and his men, which the Marquis seeing, hee cried with a loud voice, <hi>O you Traitors! now force is requisite</hi>; and flinging down his staff, hee took a pike, and saying, <hi>God preserv the King, and let the Traitors die</hi>; hee fell in amongst them, fighting so desperately, that before his men could com to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him, hee had made them turn their backs, but at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-powered and wounded in the left arm, hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner, and carried by the people into the Castle, where at that time the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> was also prisoner, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Marquis with much honor. The Marquis was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put into a Dungeon under S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>George</hi>'s tower, where they kept him close prisoner som time, thinking thereby to make the Vice-Roy, his brother, condescend to what they listed: But at last hee was released, and perceiving the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to bee infected beyond hope of remedie, hee retired to his own hous. Those of <hi>Valencia</hi> found a great miss of him, and seeing most of the people of the Citie becom of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> having possessed himself of <hi>la Huerta,</hi> and other places thereabouts, the <hi>Iurates,</hi> and Chapter of the Church called <hi>el Asseu,</hi> sent to beseech him, that hee would bee pleased to condole the miserie of that Citie, and bee tender of the King's service. The Marquis was at <hi>Ayora,</hi> a town of his, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receipt of this message, hee took his waie towards <hi>Valencia.</hi> Thursdaie 27 <hi>Februarie,</hi> 1522, the Tyrant <hi>Vicente Perez,</hi> trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude of his partie within the Citie, took the boldness to enter into <hi>Valencia,</hi> with intention to plunder it, and kill all that should resist him, and having intrenched and fortified himself within the walls to that effect, it struck great terrour into the loial partie. But the Marquis, well Armed, came to a large place, called <hi>la Placa del Asseu,</hi> and caused to bee rung that bell, which they used to ring in Uproars, to the end all those of the loial partie might repair thither to him; where hee staied until noon, having used all fair means possible to pacifie without blood-shed the advers partie; but seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could avail, hee took a view of his men, and what

Arms they had; and finding his no competent force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter <hi>Vicente Periz,</hi> who had made himself very strong; hee betook himself to his invention and policie, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so advantagiously, that <hi>Vicente Periz</hi> came short of his design, all his men beeing dis-banded, and returned to their own dwellings. This was a happie daie for <hi>Valencia,</hi> for if <hi>Periz</hi> his plot had taken, hee had been absolute master of the whole Citie; and ever after, that daie was called the Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie of <hi>Vicente Periz</hi>: Yet staying within the Citie hee rallied again, and what with those of <hi>Valencia,</hi> what with the fresh supplies which were sent him from <hi>Xativa,</hi> and <hi>Algezira,</hi> by the disguised Prince <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> or <hi>Iuan de Vilvao,</hi> who went thither to that purpose: Hee was so strongly recruited, that hee gave the Marquis Battle in the streets of <hi>Valencia,</hi> and had won the daie undoubtedly, if the Marquis had not shewed as much policie as resolution.

               <p>THe Earl of <hi>Salvatierra,</hi> and other Mountaniers, infected the people of the Mountains of <hi>Burgos,</hi> as far as <hi>Alava</hi> and <hi>Vitoria,</hi> with other places of <hi>la Rioxa</hi>; and <hi>Burgos</hi> was very near revolting also. All which was opposed by the Lord High Constable, not becaus the Emperor commanded him so to do (for hee received no orders from his Majestie to that effect till afterwards) but moved with the magnanimitie of his own generous spirit, and the sens of Loialtie, which was Hereditarie to that noble familie. I do not finde that any of the Grandees of <hi>Castilla</hi> were very forward to break the ice in this undertaking, though afterwards, like honest men, they all set their helping hands. The Lord High Constable at first prudently feared the Event, and was loth to engage himself in so perillous an enterprise, hazarding no less then his life and whole estate, in endeavouring to oppose so manie, especially without arms, monie, or order from the Emperor. For the enemies were very manie and powerful, no less then thirteen of the most considerable Cities of <hi>Castilla,</hi> with divers other Towns and Villages, beeing declared for the Commonaltie;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47565:108"/>
besides that many Gentlemen of qualitie &amp; great estates (much animated against the Emperor and his Ministers) had involved themselvs in the same Interest. It vvas an attempt of so much consideration and danger, that the other Grandees thought it the best vvay (seeing they vvere not able to do otherwise) to sit still and look on, and manie of them advised the Lord High Constable to do the like. But his Ladie <hi>Donia Maria de Tovar,</hi> onely daughter and heir to <hi>Don Luis de Tovar,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langa,</hi> beeing one of the discreetest and most magnanimous Ladies in all <hi>Spain</hi> of her time, was not of the opinion of those that gave her husband that Counsel; but she never ceased, representing to him the advancement of his Majestie's service, and that for the good of the Kingdom, hee ought to resist and suppress the exorbitances of the insulting Commoners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee put himself to the hazard of losing both life and fortune, in regard hee bare the Office of <hi>Lord High Constable, Captain General,</hi> and the second person of the Kingdom next his Majestie. The Dutchess beeing at her own hous at <hi>Haro,</hi> wrote to the <hi>Lord High Constable,</hi> her husband, this ensuing Letter, which is worthie to bee Chronicled.</p>

and flourishing Kingdoms of the World, was now bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the poorest and most miserable of all the neighboring Kingdoms: Which did not onely concern the publick, but was also particularly prejudicial to his Majestie's Roial Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and which was insufferable, That the desolation of his Majestie's Kingdoms, and the exhausting of his treasure, to his own exceeding inconvenience, and the ruine of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, was to no other purpose, then to enrich his evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and divers other persons strangers, who bare no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Majestie, nor had any zeal to advance his service, or the publick good, but to build their own fortunes.

That since his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's departure out of the Kingdom, the Cardinal, with the President, and rest of the Council, had given Commissions to <hi>Antonio de Fonseca,</hi> and the <hi>Alcalde Ronquillo,</hi> to sack and make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate the Citie of <hi>Segovia,</hi> notwithstanding they sent to excuse and submit themselvs to the Council, and that becaus of their so rigorous proceeding, they sent to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and other Cities, for assistance, who before they raised any forces to succour them, desired the Cardinal and Council by waie of Petition to deal more favorably with those of <hi>Segovia,</hi> but receiving no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie answer, they sent an Armie into the field.

That which they pretended to bee the caus of their respectless audacitie was, That when <hi>Medina del Campo</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege <hi>Alaejos, Segovia, Salamanca, Avila,</hi> and other Cities, having assisted them with men to destroie that Town, out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hatred which they bore <hi>Antonio de Fonseca: Burgos</hi> would do the like out of revenge of the Merchandise which they lost in <hi>Medina,</hi> by <hi>Antonio de Fonseca</hi>'s burning it: But the Lord High Constable satisfied them otherwise; And becaus his son offered himself to bee their Captain, which the people imagined hee did onely out of subtiltie and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to amuse them or for som other by-respect, they began to bee jealous of him; this suspicion ingendred a mortal hatred, insomuch that their furie grew beyond the bounds of moderation and obedience. The Lord high Counstable had privately conveyed into his hous four hundred Lances: Which beeing known in the Citie, the <hi>Regidores</hi> and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men assembled, and sent two of their companie to summon him. Hee excused himself, saying, hee was very ill, and could not go to them: But they told him, that they could not bee satisfied with that answer, hee must rise, and go with them. At last hee went, and was civilly received; beeing com amongst them, two of the Assemblie in the names of all the

This was not very pleasing to the Lord Constable, but it behoved him to satisfie their desires. Yet notwithstanding hee condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their wills,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Burgos</hi> riseth up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord High Constable.</note> the suspicions ceased not, neither were the people pacified. Upon our Ladie's daie of September their furie broke out, and all the Commonaltie rose up in Arms against him, in such a raging manner that they had killed him, if hee had not retired to his hous, where almost two whole daies they kept him besieged, and <hi>Don Diego Sarmiento</hi> the Earl of <hi>Salinas</hi> with the Dutchess and the Countess their wives. After this, seeing himself the object of the people's malice, and every hour in danger to lose his life; hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned with the people to let him go freely with all his familie out of the Citie; Which beeing granted, hee went to a Town of his called <hi>Briviesca.</hi> This example of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Burgos,</hi> made other places commit the like audacities against their Lords; as <hi>Haro</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Haro,</hi> Son to the Lord high Constable; <hi>Duenias</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Buendia</hi>; and also <hi>Naxara</hi> against the Duke; although that Citie doth allege and prove that they rose not for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie, but for the King, whose subjects and tenants (they saie) they are. The Lord high Constable beeing at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viesca,</hi> very full of care and sorrow to see the Kingdom in so great distempers, and so little probabilitie of any remedie; about the middle of September arrived <hi>Lope Hurtado de Mendoça</hi> with dispatches and orders from the Emperor, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that hee should bee Governor of <hi>Castilla</hi> and <hi>Navarra</hi> joyntly with the Cardinal and the Admiral of <hi>Castilla</hi>; Which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47565:130"/>

For the Cardinal was as yet at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and the Admiral in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunia,</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Cabra,</hi> whither the dispatches were sent to him, who was of opinion to defer the acceptance of that Charge, until his return into <hi>Castilla,</hi> and to use som means in the <hi>interim</hi> to agree and accommodate the differences of the Commonalties, as you have already heard. Which difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beeing related to the Emperor, beeing on the waie to <hi>Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gran,</hi> where hee was Crowned; hee sent other Letters dated the 17 <hi>October</hi> following, with special command to the Lord High Constable, that having assembled som of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, hee should, alone with them, execute the charge of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Kingdoms, &amp; provide for the remedying of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent disorders, until such time as the Cardinal, and the Admiral could com to join with him; which hee did, as shall appear hereafter.</p>

Whereupon they wrote to the Lord Admiral (who was their Countrie-man and neer neighbor) giving him account of the troubles of the Kingdom, and especially of the mischiefs which they feared would befall that Citie in particular. Whereunto hee sent an answer with an extraordinarie sens of sorrow, to see the danger whereunto the whole Kingdom was brought, counselling and admonishing them to have a care left they lost themselvs: Moreover, in regard that Citie had been noted particularly for their Loyaltie to their King, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hee had to it by his birth, it grieved him to the soul to see it in such extream distraction, which hee feared would not bee so easily remedied; with several other expressions of affection and tenderness for their welfare.

taken with these Letters, and said, they would do whatsoever therein was required, and that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> should bee welcom into the Citie; And the next daie hee made his entrie, all the people of <hi>Valladolid</hi> going forth to receiv him with great applause. This War beeing betwixt kindred, friends, and Countrie men, there was as much diligence used to gain places, and good wills, by Letters, as by force of Arms. The Earl of <hi>Venavente,</hi> and the Lord Admiral of <hi>Castilla</hi> were in a manner Natives and Citizens of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> their families from many generations, having had their principal mansions there, and the Citie bare them great respect, as they had reason. These Noble-men shewing their affection to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> as their Native soil, and seeing it so far plunged in these distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, either out of hope to reduce it by fair means, or meerly out of their love and desire of its good and preservation, they both endeavored by Letters to make them sensible of their errors. The Lord Admiral chiefly desired, <hi>that</hi> they would let him com into their Citie, promising, <hi>that</hi> hee would bee as vigilant and careful of their general good, as of any particular persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That</hi> hee would imploy in their defens his own life, and fortune: If that could not bee granted, <hi>that</hi> they would send any three, whom they thought fittest, to meet and confer with him, two or three leagues thence, where they pleased. But <hi>Valladolid</hi> would accept of none of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, alledging that such enter-views would bee ill taken, and that people would bee apt thereupon to saie, <hi>Burgos</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Articled and agreed with the Lord high Constable, that <hi>Valladolid</hi> would do the lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So they returned the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral no other Answer, then that for the present they could not condescend to any of those things which his Lordship desired. To the Earl of <hi>Venavente's</hi> Letter they briefly thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That since his Lordship was so Noble, as to offer them his own person, and men, they desired that hee would keep his promise, in letting them have the said men to send to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desillas,</hi> in the <hi>Iunta</hi>'s service, and upon that condition, they should carrie the Colours and Arms of <hi>Valladolid.</hi> These
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47565:136"/>
Letters were dispatched in the name of the Citie by the Prior of the great Church, who was a grand Commoner. These answers beeing sent to the two Noble-men, the Citie gave order for the raising of more men to send to the <hi>Iunta,</hi> becaus there were many wanting of the thousand which they had sent. Moreover, Command was given for the gathering of one hundred Duckets out of every Ward, which amounted to one thousand four hundred Duckets. Which was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with done, and the thousand men compleated.

I do not saie this in justification of these Commonalties, but onely to excuse, in what I may, my own Nation, and the Gentrie thereof. But to return to the purpose: Nothing was left unattempted on either side, that might conduce to the increasing or securitie of their Partie. You have seen in the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47565:138"/>
precedent Book, that the <hi>Iunta</hi> sent their Instructions to <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladolid,</hi> where <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> and other Captains of the Commonaltie, were assembled. The time beeing com (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the season was very sharp and unfit for an Armie to keep the field, beeing almost in the depth of Winter) they all put themselvs in a readiness, and in the name of the <hi>Iunta,</hi> they wrote fresh Letters to the Cities and Towns of their Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to send immediately all the forces they could possibly rais; which they did. Those of the <hi>Iunta,</hi> according to agreement, Voted <hi>Don Pedro Giron</hi> Captain General of their Forces, and sent him a Commission from the Queen, and the Kingdom, Thinking that hee beeing a person of so noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and allied to so many Grandees of <hi>Castilla,</hi> would gain a great reputation to their Partie; And most men were of opinion, that <hi>Don Pedro Giron</hi> accepted thereof, and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Interest of the Commonaltie meerly for his own ends, and that by means of these troubles and commotions, hee might get possession of the Dukedom of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dina Sidonia,</hi> which (as hath been already said) hee pretended was his right. This Election did not digest well in <hi>Iohn de Padilla</hi>'s stomach, who, till then, had executed the office of Captain General, and presumed it should bee confirmed upon him, and for his sake, neither the Commissioners of <hi>Toledo,</hi> nor of <hi>Madrid,</hi> would give their Votes for <hi>Don Pedro. Iohn de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla</hi> beeing informed of all these passages, before that <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro Giron</hi> came to take his staff, pretending I know not what occasion, rode poste to <hi>Toledo</hi>; and his men, seeing their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gone, would staie no longer in the Armie, but the next daie took the same waie after him. Notwithstanding all this, <hi>Don Pedro Giron</hi> accepted the Charge, and came to <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillas</hi> with fourscore Lances of his own, appointed a <hi>Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> for his Armie, wherein hee was much assisted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie and diligence of the Bishop of <hi>Zamora,</hi> who brought to the service of the <hi>Iunta</hi> near five hundred men with arms, of the antient Guards of the Kingdom, (for the rest were gone to the Lord High Constable) hee brought
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47565:138"/>
moreover, seventie Lances of his own, and almost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, four hundred whereof were Priests of his own Bishoprick, besides the people of <hi>Zamora,</hi> whom hee had at his devotion; for by favor of the <hi>Junta,</hi> hee had driven the Earl of <hi>Alva</hi> out of <hi>Zamora,</hi> and made himself Master thereof. Every daie came fresh supplies from the other Cities, both of Hors and Foot, all well armed, and with them som Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Commanders. From <hi>Salamanca</hi> came <hi>Don Pedro Maldonado,</hi> with about a thousand Foot: Other Cities appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those who were their Commissioners in the <hi>Junta</hi> to bee their Captains; As <hi>Leon</hi> chose <hi>Gonsalo de Guzman,</hi> son to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro Nun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ez</hi>; and the Citie of <hi>Toro, Don Hernando de Ulloa,</hi> who were their Commissioners; and so likewise did other places. Thus those of the <hi>Junta</hi> grew from daie to daie more powerful, beeing resolved to end the business by force of Arms. Their mouths were all filled with reproachful and threatning language, especially the Common-people's, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Grandees and Gentrie of the Countrie, Traitors &amp; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Kingdom, saying, they had destroied &amp; taken away their estates; (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> availed them nothing) but who can restrein a multitude? Amongst other impertinencies, they said, That the Queen should do well to marrie the Duke of <hi>Calabria, Don Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando de Aragon,</hi> son to <hi>Frederick</hi> last K. of <hi>Naples,</hi> who, since the time of the Catholick King, had been kept prisoner in <hi>Xativa,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Valencia</hi>; I believ this was onely put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those of the <hi>Junta,</hi> and that they neither did, nor thought any such thing. But the truth is, their passion was grown to such an height, that they never so much as named the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in their Proclamations, though they had sworn Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him, as their King, but all passed in the names of the Queen and Kingdom: Insomuch that the hatred and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betwixt the two parties became implacable, and both made all preparations possible for a war. In short time those of the <hi>Junta</hi> had put their forces in a readiness, and equipage to march unto the field, as was determined.</p>

But <hi>Valladolid</hi> having sent neer four thousand of their choisest men already to the Armie, and hearing that the enemie was like to fall upon them, desired to bee excused, thinking they might better have relief from the Armie, where were men enough.

However, that daie's work was of exceeding great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and was the means of giving a glorious end to these miserable distempers, although not so suddenly; For hereby the Common people were disabused, the allegations and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of those of the <hi>Iunta,</hi> appearing to bee no less fals then mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: for to give a more specious lustre to their forgeries, and gain credit with the People, they cunningly gave out, that the Queen was perfectly well, and in her right senses, and that all they did, was by her order (which was nothing so), whereby the blinde ignorant Commonaltie ran themselvs headlong into the precipice of those disasters, which I have, and hereafter shall relate. The glorie of this memorable exploit was properly to bee attributed to the Earl of <hi>Haro</hi>'s valor, who, contrarie to the Votes of divers others, would assault <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> in stead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Armie, to seek satisfaction for having been out-da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them to fight, and blocked up in <hi>Rioseco,</hi> according to the others opinions and propositions.</p>

                  </note> Whilest <hi>Valladolid</hi> was in this fright, came a Post from <hi>Don Pedro Giron,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Zamora,</hi> with letters, wherein they said, That they knew not, neither did they think that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> in <hi>Rioseco</hi> would have attempted to take <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillas,</hi> nor have offred that affront or disrespect to the Queen, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; That they could have no intelligence of their design, becaus they had stopt, and taken all the Messengers and Travellers, that might give notice of their march thither, and that when they did know it, and were prepared to go succor the Town, news was brought them, that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> were carrying the Queen away to <hi>Burgos,</hi> which made them turn towards <hi>Valladolid,</hi> thinking that waie to intercept them: And that now beeing at <hi>Villagarzia,</hi> they thought good to acquaint them with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end they might receiv provision and orders thence, to prosecute their design; Promising, since that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> had taken <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> and begun the War with fire and sword, that they would do the like, if <hi>Valladolid</hi> was so contented.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47565:146"/>
They wrote in like manner to the Bishop, and other Captains, but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> took no great notice thereof, neither did hee make any other shew, then that hee would go to <hi>Valladolid</hi> himself. Divers disorderly Captains, like sheep without a shepherd, with their Companies, came and took up their Quarters at <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubla,</hi> two leagues from <hi>Valladolid</hi>: Others went to <hi>Valladolid</hi> with their plunder, 'mongst others, two horsmen brought in a thousand Sheep, others fiftie, others two hundred Mules, Mares, and Carts loaden with linnen, and all manner of housholdstuff, taken from the poor Countrie-men, to the value of above three Millions of <hi>Maravediz,</hi> which they sold in the Citie, for little or nothing; a Wether was sold for two <hi>Ryalls,</hi> an Ewe for one, and a Cow for two <hi>Duckets</hi>; But the mischief was the greater, in that the poor shepherds and husbandmen, having ransomed their cattle and goods, before they had gon half a league, the Souldiers would plunder them again, spoiling and robbing friend and foe, as much as they could. By which exorbitancies they began to see, how much better it would have been to have satisfied their King's demands, although the tax was somwhat heavie; But so great acts of disobedience never passed long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such just punishments: Their outrageous impudence grew to such a height, that without any reverence or respect, they robb'd and spoiled the very Churches, as if they had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; Women were not secure in their houses, nor men by the high waies. <hi>Valladolid,</hi> to prevent further disorder in this kinde, Commanded that those straggling Souldiers, which were to the number of six hundred, should return to their Colours at <hi>Villanubla,</hi> where their Captains were, and there they gave them ten daies paie more to endear them to go before <hi>Tordesillas</hi>; whither also marched, with all expedition, men from <hi>Salamanca, Toro,</hi> and <hi>Zamora,</hi> in great numbers, thinking to catch the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> in the Climm.

Betwixt the Towns which were for the Commoners, and those wherein were Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for his Majestie, was such killing, robbing, and spoiling, as if they had been the most mortal enemies in the world, as shall bee declared hereafter. Artificers could get no emploiment; Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could not till their grounds, Merchants had no traffick, Cities lost their correspondence with each other, becaus the waies were unsecure; Justice was quite out of date; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, Tributes, Levies, Impositions increased daily, by reason of the excessive charges of the Armie, the Revenue of the Roial Crown (which they had usurped) not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient to defraie them. These, and such like, were the fruits and profit which <hi>Castilla</hi> reaped by their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: And yet for all their miserable condition, they did not humble nor submit themselvs, neither would they accept of the honorable and advantageous Conditions which were offered them: But everie daie they were sending fresh men to maintein and foment the War from <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where those, who cast the Kingdom into this precipice, had taken up their seat. Although they were so jealous and displeased at their Captain General DON PEDRO GIRON, (especially the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people) that they did neither obey nor respect him, neither did hee hold himself secure amongst them, and therefore hee left them soon after, as you shall see.</p>

In this occurrence arrived at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> a certain Priest, with Orders from the Emperor, and the Queen, to the President and Judges of the Chancerie there residing, wherein they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the College and Universitie, forthwith to depart that Citie. This coming to the people's knowledg, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly incensed therewith, seeing they should bee deprived of three main benefits they had; which to prevent, they gave out that those Orders were fals, and forged, or counterfeited by the pretended Governors, who studied to do them all the mischief they could.

The President, seeing their mad reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, thought it his best way to let them have their wills. Those Orders beeing brought, they forcibly entred into the Chancerie, and took away the great Seal also, which they delivered to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their own choosing. In the Orders they found, how the Emperor commanded the President, with the fore-named, within three daies to leav <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and repair to the Governors, under pain of beeing deprived of their Offices, and that for the present they should go to the Town of <hi>Arevalo,</hi> where they should attend his further pleasure, in regard <hi>Valladolid</hi> had declined his service, and adhered to those that were Traitors to his Roial Crown.</p>

of the times, persuading them to condescend to a peace, &amp; to bee reduced to the good, and tranquillitie of the Kingdoms, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that was the end of their Assembling and rising up in arms. Som thought this Proposition but just and reasonable, others absolutely dis-approved it.

Those of the <hi>Iunta</hi> (divers of them beeing indifferently well inclined, and seeing <hi>Don Pedro Lasso,</hi> who was one of the principal amongst them, lean that waie) were so far from dissenting, that without further delay, they appointed him, and <hi>Alonso de Guadalaxara,</hi> Commissioner of <hi>Segovia,</hi> to go in their names to <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> giving first notice to the Cavaliers thereof, and wishing them to send their Agents to <hi>Prado,</hi> as was agreed, both giving securitie and pledges that their Messengers should pass without danger or molestation.

The <hi>Iunta,</hi> to satisfie them, did name <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> but hee desired som time to think upon it, before hee would accept it, and those that bare him no good will, began to divulge his beeing made General, in a disparaging manner, saying, It was more honor then hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in regard hee had given them so much reason to suspect his fidilitie, for holding correspondence with the Governors to sell them, and that <hi>Iohn de Padilla</hi> was much more fit for that Command.

that they might bee Horsmen, but the Earl of <hi>Haro</hi> thought that not so convenient, hee having more need of the Cavalrie for the field-battle: Beeing com within sight of the Town in the Evening, they staied upon the top of a hill, whence the Earl sent a partie of his Hors to skirmish with som Arcabusiers, (who beeing betwixt the besieged, and the mud-walls, stood much to their advantage) but seeing his men cruelly galled, and able to do no good there, hee commanded they should retreat to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which was still upon the hill expecting <hi>Don Francisco Ossorio</hi> to put in execution their intended design: but whil'st they were thus staying, arrived a Gentleman with a Letter from the Lord Admiral, to the Earl of <hi>Haro,</hi> saying, That hee might return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for hee had notice since, that there was no such need of putting any succor into <hi>Torrelobaton,</hi> for there was already strength sufficient to defend it; notwithstanding this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, divers Gentlemen offered to go into the Town; but it could not bee attempted, the Lord Admiral having forbidden the Ladders to bee brought, which were agreed upon. So it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Earl to go back again that night to <hi>Tordesillas,</hi> without bringing his purpose to effect, to satisfie the Lord Admiral, who (as it afterwards proved) was very much over-seen therein: But som say, hee was angrie becaus the Earl of <hi>Haro</hi> did not follow his advice in the prosecution of that design. <hi>Iohn de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla</hi> beeing alarmed by these thousand Hors, and finding that hee had not force enough for the offensive and defensive both, sent presently to <hi>Valladolid</hi> for more.

men enough in <hi>Tordesillas</hi> to encounter <hi>Iohn de Padilla,</hi> who was very strong, besides all the Cities beeing their enemies, they sent to demand a Truce for eight daies of <hi>Iohn de Padilla,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he, and som of the Commissioners that were with him, were not unwilling to grant, yet they durst not, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with <hi>Valladolid</hi>; for in regard they stood in great need of that Citie, and were very much favored and assisted by them, they bare them a singular respect, and would determine nothing without their privitie. This was communicated to all the people of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and discussed; at length they all agreed to return this answer, That they should by no means grant them any truce, no, not for one hour, but proceed against them with all manner of rigor; for it was most certain, that they demanded a Truce for nothing els, but meerly to recruit themselvs of men and provisions, to the prejudice of the Commonaltie; and if they did grant them eight or fifteen daies libertie, by the ancient law of the Kingdom they might renew their Cessation still to ninetie and six daies, and so from ninetie six to ninetie six, until the year were out; by which procrastinations, the Commonalties would bee destroied and ruined, and the people lose their courage and good zeal, which at present did animate them to defend their Liberties: yet notwithstanding <hi>Valladolid</hi> sent this answer, the Commissioners of the Kingdom, and the Commanders of the Armie did grant the Truce for eight daies, from Sunday to Sundaie.</p>

               <p>THis Cessation was demanded after the taking of <hi>Torreloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> although that much displeased the Lord Admiral, and <hi>Fray Francisco de los Angeles</hi> went to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> in his and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's name, to treat thereof, whom <hi>Alonso de Vera</hi> a bridler and one of the worshipful Citie officers, meeting at the Gate <hi>del Campo,</hi> treated very uncivilly, and would not suffer to enter into the Citie. After this, <hi>Alonso de Ortiz,</hi> with danger enough of his life, ventured to return thither, with Letters of credence to treat about the same business. Who beeing entred into the Citie,

This infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the Frier gave the Commissioners of the Kingdoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides divers other particulars, which are too tedious to relate. In conclusion, hee told them that his advice was, that they should contract neither Peace nor Truce with the Grandees, but stand firm and unanimously persevere in their former resolution. So that if his Majestie would com again into their Kingdom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47565:172"/>
might make their own conditions, and have what securitie they pleased; besides, they might so make their bargain, that if his Majestie did not perform his agreement with them, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might remain united and agreed, That all the people should assemble whensoever occasion did require, and stick close one to the other in what concerned them for their defence, and have sufficent assurance that the agreement made with them should bee performed. Wherefore his opinion was, that they ought not onely, not to grant the Truce which was desired, but couragiously to persist in the War, until they had destroyed the Grandees, and made the Commissioners of the Kingdom with the <hi>Iunta,</hi> Lords of the Countrie. Notwithstanding this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of <hi>Fray Pablo,</hi> the Commissioners commanded <hi>Ortiz</hi> to continue the Treatie. After all this, it hapned that the Frier sitting next to <hi>Ortiz,</hi> and taking him to bee a Commissioner of som Citie, that was com to the <hi>Iunta</hi> since his departure, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repeat som thing of his discours to the other Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, but chiefly harped upon the Emperor's intent to punish the Commoners, notwithstanding any pardon the Governors should promise them in his behalf. Whereupon, not well brooking his speeches, <hi>Ortiz</hi> asked him how hee knew the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had any such thought: Hee answered hee was told so. Then <hi>Ortiz</hi> could hold no longer, but with a voice that might bee heard by all in the room, said, That hee wondred that a man of his coat and gravitie, beeing a Doctor of Divinitie, who ought to give good example, should positively saie a thing of such importance (as that which hee had verified to those Gentlemen in these words, (<hi>That notwithstanding any pardon the Gavernors should grant, confirmed by his Majestie, those who had raised the Commotions in the Kingdom, his Majestie would punish at his return, as if they had been taken in the fact</hi>) upon no other certaintie, but onely hear-saie; In regard those words were enough to disturb and hinder the conclusion of the Truce, which might produce a Peace, and those of his dignitie and profession ought rather to endeavour to make Peace, when other hopes failed, then to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obstruct the means of procuring it. The Frier hearing this, was very wrath, and asked who hee was; It beeing told him
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47565:172"/>
that <hi>Ortiz</hi> was the man that sollicited for the Truce in behalf of the Cavaliers, hee stole out of the <hi>Iunta.

In mean time <hi>Fray Pablo</hi> went to som of the Citie, telling them that they had suffered a Traitor to com in amongst them, whom the Grandees had sent under the notion of treating a Truce, to espie what was done in the Citie, and to sound the People's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations: That in his opinion they ought to turn him out of the Citie, or apprehend him, and make him confess the principal caus of his coming thither. Presently the Commoners, in whose heads hee had buzz'd these things, went along with him to the <hi>Iunta,</hi> all armed, and boldly rushed into the Chamber where they sate, asking them very peremptorily, why they suffered a Traitor to com into the Citie, to spie and make advantage of their proceedings; requiring the Commissioners forthwith to discharge him the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which they returned thanks in a Letter to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> wherein they made large expressions and protestations of their firm resolution to

                  <hi>JOhn de Padilla</hi>'s staying so long at <hi>Torrelobaton</hi> was very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Commonalties; for besides that hee lost many men, hee gave the Cavaliers time to recruit and strengthen themselvs notably, whereas questionless if hee had fallen upon <hi>Tordesillas</hi> assoon as hee had taken in <hi>Torrelobaton,</hi> hee had driven them to extraordinarie straits. But he remained there hugging himself with that small victorie, and the applaus of the people, which hee had thereby procured: Hee fell to repairing the walls which hee had battered down, as if hee intended to make that the seat and residence of his Armie, which lasted not long after.

               <p>THus the confusion and war daily grew more violent in the miserable Kingdoms of <hi>Castilla, Toledo,</hi> the Province of <hi>Alava,</hi> and in the Mountains of <hi>Burgos.</hi> In the Kingdom of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia</hi> there was nothing but cutting of throats, and robbing one another: And <hi>Valladolid,</hi> seeing the Kingdom in so distracted a condition, began to murmure against those that sate at the helm, charging them with the ill managing of the affairs, and that they did nothing but trifle and delaie the time, without knowing when or how to set a period to their miseries: They desired to bring their differences to an end, but chiefly by the conquest of the Cavaliers, that they might bee exempted and free'd from such great mischiefs. The fault of not concluding, either by a firm peace, or an open war, they imputed to the Commissioners of the Kingdom; who to enrich themselvs, and becaus they would not bee brought to an account of one hundred and fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Duckets, which they had received, were glad to keep things from a conclusion; of which <hi>Valladolid</hi> having suffered the most of

any place, and which had been at the greatest expences, was most sensible, and did exceedingly lament. To say the truth on both sides, as well of the Cavaliers, as of the Commonalties, there was trouble and hard measure enough.

They killed som of them that made resistance, and carried near two hundred prisoners to <hi>Rioseco.</hi> Thus both parties studied to weaken &amp; ruine each other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them consumed the whole Countrie. <hi>Iohn de Padilla</hi> kept his Court in <hi>Torrelobaton,</hi> like another <hi>Annibal</hi> in <hi>Capua.</hi> Upon a Mundaie, the 8 of <hi>April,</hi> all the people of <hi>Valladolid</hi> rose up in a tumultuous manner, beeing wearied out with those of the <hi>Iunta,</hi> and discontented at their secret and long consultations, without concluding any thing. In this disorder they went seeking them from place to place, beeing fully resolved to turn them out of the Citie, or know of them the reason of their delaies; for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which they daily receiv'd from those of <hi>Simancas</hi> was insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. There was no trading at all, every thing grew so excessive dear, that a bushel of wheat was worth eight hundred <hi>Maravediz.</hi> The people flocked in multitudes to the great Church, where the Deputies, with the Captains of the Citie, were assembled, with loud voices, and lamentable cries, beseeching them to seek som remedie, for their miserie was insupportable, desiring them moreover, to let them know the reason, why the war was so procrastinated, and urging, that fiftie daies were past without any action of war, neither could their imaginations reach to what they intended. The Officers answered them, That the occasion of those demurres was, the often going to, and coming from <hi>Tordesillas</hi> about the Treatie of Peace with the Cavaliers, bidding them return quietly to their houses, and before night they should know particularly all the circumstances and passages of the business. Whereupon the people praied them to consider well what they did, and not to let them suffer any further detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or bee burthened vvith any more expences, for vvithin less then seven months they had dis-bursed above one hundred

thousand and five hundred Duckets, besides other charges and losses, which they had sustained beyond number, yet they did grudg none of all this, if they could close up their miseries with peace, or revenge themselvs by war, and that they might bee permitted to fall upon <hi>Simancas</hi> and <hi>Tordesillas</hi>; for nothing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them so much, as that they could not have their wills on them. Towards the Evening, the people of every Ward bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called together, they were shewed certain Articles which two Commissioners of the <hi>Iunta</hi> had concluded with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and brought from <hi>Tordesillas</hi>; the substance of them beeing according to the contents of the General Articles of the Kingdom, specified at large already, I shall spare to trouble the Reader with a second relation.</p>

               <p>THe people having perused these Articles, would by no means approve of them, nor consent to any agreement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging, that what the Cavalier promised therein was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, neither was it certain to bee performed, for they had no warrant from his Majestie so especial, as a business of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence did require; besides, they refused to give any pledges, or deliver any strong holds into the Commonaltie's possession for their securitie. And since the conditions they offered them were neither good nor sure, they would have no Peace, but War with them: in regard they found no securitie of their persons or lives without it. The Commissioners and Captains, seeing all the people fully determined and bent to give the Cavaliers battle, and either live with libertie, or end their miseries with death, (most of them beeing of the same opinion, deeming that to bee their onely safe way) cherish'd them in that resolution, presently giving order to all the people of <hi>Valladolid</hi> to bee in a readiness, all the Artillerie to bee prepared and fitted to carrie into the field: the like was done through all the Cities and Towns of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie, every Commissioner repairing to his own Citie and Town to that purpose: Thus they intended in one daie to end all their troubles, and that this last bout should paie for all their

if they miscarried in this enterprise, their hopes were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied with their forces.

Soon after they were sent for thence to <hi>Villalar,</hi> and put into a hous, with a good guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.

So hee beeing returned, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors sent for the <hi>Alcalde</hi> of the Chancerie of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to execute Justice upon the persons of <hi>Iohn de Padella, Iohn Bravo,</hi> and <hi>Francisco Maldonado.</hi> The <hi>Alcalde</hi> presently went to the hous where they were prisoners, and bade them prepare themselvs, for the Governors had given order for their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Iohn de Padilla</hi> desired him to send him a learned Priest to confess him, and a Notarie to make his Will, and som witnesses. The <hi>Alcalde</hi> replied, That in the place where they then were, hee could not exspect to finde any men of extraordinarie learning, yet hee would enquire, and if hee could finde one, hee would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his desire therein: but as for a Notarie to make his Will, hee need not trouble himself, for all his goods and estate were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate. In the condemnation of these Gentlemen, there was no

A Gentleman of the Loyal Partie, the daie before the battle, wrote a letter to one of the contrarie opinion, telling him, that now the business was brought to such a push, that there was nothing to bee thought on els, but everie one to stand upon his guard, for whosoever fell, should bee sure to bear the ignominious brand of Traitor: As questionless it had been; for wee see all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exploits of this life are more esteemed, and censured by their successes and events, then any other waies.

Many tongues, doubtless, will busie themselvs in the relation of my death, which as yet I know not my self, though it bee very neere: My end will give Thee a testimonie of my desire. My soul I recommend to Thee, as the Patroness of Christianitie, of my bodie I make no account, since it is no more mine, neither can I write any more, for at this very instant, I feel the knife at my throat, with a greater sens of Thy displeasure, then apprehension of my pain.</p>

But first, beeing numerous enough, they possessed all the Towns and Villages thereabouts, and stopt up all the Avenues, suffering no provisions to bee carried in to them. Whereupon the most valiant and violent of all the people began to bee crest-fallen: Others that had (as much as they durst) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed those past Commotions, seeing the Governors victorious and powerful, declared themselvs. There was no Captain nor Commander left in the Citie. Whereupon to make short, and prevent a Summons, they thought their onely way was, to yield themselvs upon good conditions, which they hoped the Lord Admiral (though much offended) out of compassion and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to that Citie, would grant them. In which resolution they sent som religious men, and persons of respect, with much submission and humble acknowledgment of their faults, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire mercie and pardon of the Lord Admiral: Who at first shewed himself very much displeased and unwilling to hearken to their desires, saying, Hee ought, and would make an example aswel of the principal offendors, as of the Common people. The Souldiers, who exspected notable plunder, their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itching to measure out the silks and velvets with their Pikes, (as they bragg'd they would) were mad becaus the word of command, To fall on and enter the Citie, was so long a giving out; which the Inhabitants knowing, every one secured their commodities the best they could. But by God's help, and the indulgence of the Governors, a Peace and pardon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and proclaimed in the market places and streets of <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi> with great acclamations of joie, and sound of Trumpets,

Whosoever take's the pains to peruse the historie of these fore-related Commotions will finde, that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando de Avalos,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Toledo,</hi> was one of the greatest sticklers for the Commonalties, one of the chief Ring-leaders of these disorders, and one that persevered in them with as great obstinacie and perversness as might bee; for which hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, yet nothing was done to him. But whether out of fear, or otherwise, hee privately slunk away out of the Kingdom; for which the Emperor (as hee had reason) was the more displeased at him. And having continued in this voluntarie exile some time, at last having disguised himself, as hee thought, sufficiently, hee took the boldness to return to the Court and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to procure his pardon, which coming to the knowledg of one that was neer his Majesties person, hee thinking to do an acceptable piece of service, went presently and told the Emperor, that <hi>Hernando de Avalos</hi> was in the Court, and that, if his Majestie was so pleased, hee would apprehend him, for hee knew where to finde him. The Emperor took no great notice hereof at the first time. Two or three daies after, the Gentleman think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majestie had not well understood him, or els had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what hee had told him, gave him a second advice of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando's</hi> beeing there.
