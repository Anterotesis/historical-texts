            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT hath bin my conſtant Courſe for ſome Months, to Preach every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
either on the whole Epiſtle for the Day, or ſome part of it. And
finding I was commanded in the Brief for the Perſecuted Proteſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> (which was brought me in the Week before the 4th. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in <hi>Lent)</hi> to publiſh it the next Sunday; I found there was no
need to alter my wonted courſe, in order to my pitching on a Subject which
might ſuit with that Occaſion. The famous Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his Epiſtle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
before his Sermon Preached before the Lord Major, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the 21ſt.
Sunday after <hi>Trinity</hi> 1680. aſcribes his being directed to the Subject he
then Preached on, not ſo much to his <hi>own Prudence, as a Kind of Divine
Providence;</hi> becauſe having obſerved this ſame Courſe that Year, he did
not on that Occaſion <hi>go out of his way to meet with a ſitting Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Whether People will put the ſame Conſtruction on this Diſcourſe or
not, I neither know nor care. But I think I may truly ſay, I have diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on this Text, with a <hi>Freedom</hi> which becomes <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>a true Son of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>It may he ſome who pretend to the Church, will take Exception at this
<hi>Sermon,</hi> for there are ſome <hi>ſo ſhallow,</hi> and of <hi>ſo ſhort Diſcourſe,</hi> they
cannot underſtand how a man can except againſt their violent Proceedings
againſt ſome <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and yet he himſelf <hi>a thorough Conformiſt.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not of any moment what ſuch may either ſay or think, but yet to
give them ſome Satisfaction, if they ever happen to be favoured with any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and lucid Intervals, I will amongſt the many Inſtances I might mention
for this end, offer theſe few to their Conſideration.</p>
            <p>1. I could never yet underſtand that <hi>Conformity</hi> did oblige any man to
lay aſide <hi>all Bowels of Compaſſion.</hi> Nay I am ſure, to Convince and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
Men with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and by Humility, Gentleneſs, and Meekneſs is moſt
Chriſtian, and tends moſt to the Honour of particular Perſons, and whole
Churches. How much of Fierceneſs and Violence there is in any Party, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if countenanced by the Principles of that Perſwaſion, ſo much there is
of ſome Infernal and Deviliſh Mixture in it.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe who do generally Decry and Proſecute Diſſenters with greateſt
Paſſion and Virulence, are greateſt Strangers unto them. They uſually know
no more of them, than they learn from ſome <hi>falſe and ſcandalous</hi> Obſervator
<hi>or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They are commonly Ignorant of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controverſy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb facs="tcp:57668:3"/>
               <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> The true Reaſon, why <hi>Judicious and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conformiſts</hi> do uſe thoſe particular Ceremonies which are enjoyned, is
becauſe they are ſatisfied they come under the general Rule given by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>VIZ.</hi> that <hi>all things be done decently and in order.</hi> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they obſerve no other <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> (whil'ſt it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
there are others every whit as orderly and decently in themſelves
as theſe) is becauſe, theſe alone are enjoyned by an <hi>Authority,</hi> they are
perſwaded, has Power to interpoſe in theſe things. And now if others do
not break the general Rule given by the Apoſtle, but apprehend that a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Impoſitions in theſe things, is one part of the <hi>Liberty</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>to ſtand faſt in,</hi> why ſhould we quarrel with, and proſecute them?
eſpecially whil'ſt they acknowledg that it pertains to Authority to take notice
of them who are Indecent, and Diſorderly in their Worſhip. Is it not enough
that we may act according to our own more <hi>minute Perſwaſion,</hi> and have
the Countenance and Incour agement of thoſe in Power, but we muſt ruine and
oppreſs them who will not <hi>truckle</hi> to our <hi>Fancies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I have had the Opportunity to be acquainted both with <hi>Conformiſts,</hi>
and <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> And as I acknowledg I have great cauſe to bleſs
God for the <hi>worthy Labors,</hi> and <hi>exemplary Lives</hi> of very many in the
<hi>Church of</hi> England, ſo I ought to give others their due. And this I muſt
ſay, that thoſe of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> whom I have bin acquainted with, have
bin men of great <hi>Learning,</hi> exemplary <hi>Piety,</hi> ſtrict <hi>Devotion,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Loyalty.</hi> Men who have bin diligent Attenders on God in his
publick Ordinances, eminently Religious in their Families, who have had a
great regard to Conſcience in all the parts of their Converſation with Men.
They have neither bin Haunters of Taverns, nor obſcene and looſe in their
Diſcourſe, nor have they bin guilty of ſitting Days and Nights at Cards
and Dice. Indeed they have bin Perſons that could not be juſtly blamed
for any thing, but that they had <hi>ſtraighter Notions</hi> concerning <hi>humane
Impoſitions</hi> in the <hi>Service of God,</hi> than we <hi>Conformiſts</hi> have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And a very learned Gentleman had upon Conſideration given a very juſt
and good Reaſon of this.</hi>

               <q>But as then He that was born after the Fleſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it
is now.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere were ſome even in the Apoſtles days,
who laboured what they could to hinder the
progreſs of the Goſpel, by Preaching up the
neceſſity of the Jewiſh Law. Theſe having
inſinuated themſelves into the Churches of
<hi>Galatia,</hi> had infected many of thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
with their poyſonous and falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:
For though they did not openly declare themſelves ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Goſpel, yet they did ſupplant it as to its power and
efficacy, by alledging its inſufficiency alone, and the neceſſity of
their being circumciſed, and embracing thoſe old rules God had
anciently inforced under the former diſpenſation. They knew if
they could leaven and corrupt them with theſe Principles, they did
at firſt ſo ſpeciouſly diſplay, it would not be long before they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57668:4"/>
ſhould entirely undermine that foundation the Apoſtles had
laid amongſt them. For however innocent their pretences
might ſeem at firſt, it is cleareſt <hi>Paul</hi> perceived the conſequence
would be dangerous. <hi>Chriſt will not profit you at all,</hi> Gal. 5. 2.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe it is he doth labour with them ſo earneſtly, and
uſeth ſuch variety of Arguments to ſecure them from giving
place any further, to thoſe falſe and pernicious Teachers, and to
convince them of their errour and fault, in giving way unto
them at all.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Arguments he urgeth the different ſtate men
are in when under the Goſpel, from that they were in when under
the Law: And that the Law was primarily deſigned only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and fit men for the Goſpel, but not to continue in the ſame
Place and Power after, as before; no more than he that being
arrived to ripe and full years, is bound to continue under their
Tutorage, who had the care of him in his Minority, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>He afterwards proceeds to argue with them from the Nature
of that Law they are ſo deſirous to be under, <hi>v.</hi> 21. And then
explains himſelf by a Similitude of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two Sons; ſhewing
there is as great a difference between thoſe who are under a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
State, and them that are under the Law, as between that Son
which was his natural Child, and that which was conferred on him
by the ſpecial Promiſe and powerful Interpoſition of God's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And thus he takes occaſion to reflect on the great Alteration
that was wrought amongſt them, ſince they did hiſten to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
theſe falſe and deceiving Apoſtles. And does, as it were,
tell them, it was no wonder they ſhould thus vary, and that they
ſhould now approve ways of Severity towards Chriſt's apoſtles
and Followers, ſeeing they did receive and adhere to them, that
were directly contrary to Chriſt's Miniſters and Servants. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14, 15. whith this 29. <hi>v.</hi> It is no more than what
hath fallen out in all Ages of the World. The Servants of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and Enemies of true Godlyneſs, have always bin for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the faithful and obedient Children of God. And it ſeems
by this Epiſtle, to be the eſpecial and peculiar Character of them
that are irreligiouſly and immoderately hot and zealous about
Ceremonies, to be the greateſt Perſecutors of thoſe who are moſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57668:4"/>
Pious and Conſcientious. Look through all the Scriptures, nay
look through all the Ages of the Church, you ſhall generally find
that thoſe who were moſt for the Perſecution of others on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſome indifferences relating to Religion, were very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuperſtitious men: Men that were inordinately Zealous for,
and fond of ſome outward Ceremonies. Now if a fondneſs for
any Ceremonies would maintain and juſtify Mens Perſecution of
others, who cannot approve their Fopperies, one would think
theſe Teachers who were crept in amonſt the <hi>Galathians</hi> ſhould
be excuſed, becauſe they preſt only thoſe things that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bin of Divine appointment.<note place="margin">

inſupportable
Yoke of Jewiſh Ceremonies, certainly did never intend to
gall the Necks of his Diſciples with another inſtead of it.</hi> But here
we ſee how dangerous it is to give our ſelves too great a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Sathan doth ſuddenly ſtrike in on ſuch Occaſions, and
doth ſo powerfully affect mens Minds with ſome ſtrange Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
of the Beauty, Excellency, Uſefulneſs, and Neceſſity of
theſe things, they are quite taken off from minding the inward
Part and Soul of Religion. And by this means they come to lay
out all their Zeal about theſe trifling and worthleſs Parts, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſtarve their own Souls, by a conſtant feaſting on theſe meer
Husks, and do what they can to deſtroy others Souls, at leaſt their
Bodies, by perſecuting them, if they will not conceive and believe
as well of theſe things, as they do. It is a very ſhrewd Sign,
and token that a Man is a wicked unregenerate Man if he be of a
fierce and perſecuting Temper; if he be prone to endeavour to
Ruine and Trouble, or further the Vexation and Diſturbance of
ſerious pious People, only becauſe they cannot be as Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as he is.</p>

               <hi>He that was born after the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. The Words do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
relate to the Sons of <hi>Abraham, Iſmael</hi> is <hi>He that was born
after the Fleſh,</hi> viz. in a meer natural ordinary way. Now, as he
did Perſecute, and Mock, and Deride, and Inſult over <hi>Iſaack,</hi> who
<hi>was born after the Spirit,</hi> viz. who was the Son of the Promiſe, and
in order to whoſe Birth, there was the Exerting a Divine Power
in the accompliſhing of that Promiſe which was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
when both he and <hi>Sarah</hi> were paſt Hopes, and naturally uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57668:5"/>
of having Children, <hi>ſo it is now, viz.</hi> Even ſo, thoſe in theſe

him for their Father, and are outwardly Jews, or that pretend

<hi>are born after the Spirit;</hi> that is, thoſe who are the Children of
the Promiſe, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> truly ſo called in a religious
Sence, who ſucceed him in his Faith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> did very much boaſt of, and lay an extraordinary
ſtreſs on their being the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> they placed moſt of
their Religion on this, and thought it a ſufficient Plea for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on all Occaſions, and an effectual Security from thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that were ſometimes threatned againſt them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we find the Holy Men in Scripture often labouring to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them what a ſandy Foundation they did build upon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.
9. <hi>John</hi> 8. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14. It is indeed a great Mercy to be
Born of Pious and Religious Parents; Thoſe Parents that have a
great Familiarity and Intereſt with God, have uſually a great
Treaſury and Portion of Bleſſings laid up with God for their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. But People may lay too great a ſtreſs on
this outward Priviledge. And if Children do not labour to walk
in the Steps of Religious and Gracious Parents, but depend
wholly on their Predeceſſors Holyneſs, they will be fearfully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
at laſt.</p>
            <q>He that was Born after the Fleſh, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>He that is a looſe, wicked, Unregenerate, Carnal Perſon, is for
Perſecuting and Undoing him that is Born after the Spirit, him
that is Serious, Holy, Strict, and Conſcientious; thus it has bin,
and thus it is. I will ſum up all into this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Wicked,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> Unregenerate Men, always have bin, and ſtill are for
Perſecuting Holy, Religious, Spiritual Men. Look through all
the Books both of Old and New Teſtament, nay look through
all Hiſtory, and you will ſtill find, where ever you meet with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
that it was carried on by the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Agents,</hi> by Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Lewd Men, againſt Holy and Righteous Men. Obſerve the
Characters every where of Informers and Perſecutors, and ſee if
they have not bin branded with ſome notorious and hateful Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>

Indeed Men can ſcarce arrive to ſuch a height of Wickedneſs,
as this is, till they have by the habitual Exerciſe of other Crimes,
feared their Conſciences, and are become ſo inſenſible, that all the
commendable Notions and Sentiments that do uſually accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mankind, are loſt and eradicated out of their Breſts.</p>
            <p>Conſider theſe few Inſtances of Perſecutors as they now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
and then ſee whether all others be not of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.
What an obdurate Caitiff and Villain was <hi>Cain</hi> that
ſlew his own Brother, becauſe more Holy, and conſequently bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accepted with God than he was? What a vile Character is
<hi>Iſmael</hi> all along repreſented under to us? Were not they Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
that were againſt <hi>David,</hi> and made Songs of him? What
were the falſe Prophets that ſet themſelves againſt <hi>Micaiah?</hi> were
they not ſuch as did Prophecy Lies? Who were thoſe that were
for the Burning of the three Children? And for the caſting of
<hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Den? Were they not all Flattering and
Abominable Idolaters? What was <hi>Judas</hi> that Betrayed Chriſt,
that Informed the High Prieſts and Scribes againſt his Maſter the
Son of God? Was he not a Covetous Mercenary Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
What were thoſe that ſwore, and gave Evidence againſt
Chriſt? Were they not a couple of perjured Miſcreants? And
if you ſearch and inquire, you will find all Informers againſt, and
Perſecutors of the Juſt and Holy to be of the ſame Stamp. Are
not the Informers and Perſecutors of our Days like unto thoſe that
were before them? Is it not evident to all that they are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for Perjury, Falſneſs, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Prophane
and common Swearing? Are there any more regardleſs of the
Lord's Day, more Irreligious and Obſcene in their Diſcourſe,
more Vile. Contemptible and baſe in the Eye and Opinion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Honeſt, Pious, Good, or Sober Perſon? Are there any ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
ſo Falſe, ſo exorbitantly Vicious, Lewd, and Debauch'd as
they?</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt and Religion do not allow of Perſecutions, of
Troubling and Vexing, of Ruining and Undoing of any Men for
little Indifferences much leſs for Truth and Holyneſs. They are
for Advancing and Propagating Holyneſs and Peace, and Love,
and Condeſcention. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42. 2, 3. Chriſt came not to deſtroy
but to ſave Mens Lives; and ſharply rebukes his Diſciples when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57668:6"/>
they would have call'd for Fire from Heaven to deſtroy the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans:</hi>
It is a ſure Token Men are Enemies to Chriſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
when they are of a perſecuting Spirit. It hath always bin
the great Character and Glory of the Chriſtian Religion, that
where ever it came, it did promote and further Quietneſs and
Peace, and Love, and Brotherly Kindneſs; and did Baniſh Wrath
and Fury, and Malice, and every hateful and hurtful Diſpoſition
and Inclination. It was always thus, till Popery got ſome Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the World, and then more barbarous Villanies, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Cruelties were perpetrated under this Name, than were
known to the World before. And if it be carefully obſerved,
you ſhall find that in all ages, thoſe who have bin moſt for cruel
Methods againſt them that differ from them, have had moſt of
the Spirit of Popery in them; and it is deplorably apparent
that now in our Days, they who appear moſt vigorous and active
in Proſecuting thoſe Proteſtants who differ from others in ſome
accidental Matters, have a great affection for Popery, and are haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
towards Rome as faſt as they can.</p>
            <p>That the following part of my Diſcourſe may be as plain and
eaſy to you as poſſible, I will reduce what I deſign to ſay on this
Subject, to theſe following Heads. 1. I will tell you what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
is. 2. Name more particularly the Characters of them
that are Perſecutors. 3. Shew you whence it is that wicked Men
are ſo violently ſet againſt the Godly. 4. I will make ſome brief
application of the whole.</p>
            <p>I am firſt of all to tell you what Perſecution is.<note place="margin">1ſt.</note> And it is an
endeavouring to Trouble, Moleſt, Diſturb, Kill, or any way Hurt
and Injure another Perſon on ſome Religious account. Every
Proſecution of a Perſon, is not properly Perſecution, but only
when it is grounded on ſome Religious Affair. A Man may be
guilty of Sin in proſecuting another upon civil accounts, but this
Sin comes under another Denomination, as Oppreſſion, Injuſtice,
unpeacable Brangling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Perſecution is much what the
ſame in Religion, that Oppreſſion is in Civils. When Men will
not ſuffer others to enjoy that Liberty, and thoſe Rights in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which either Nature or Revelation do allow them; but will
be ſevere againſt them, if in every accidental Matter, they will
not be juſt of their Mind. When Men do hale others to Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57668:6"/>
and procure them either to be Puniſhed in their Bodies, or
in their Eſtates; or to be deprived of their Lives, or civil
Liberties, becauſe they either perform ſome Duty God has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
Commanded, in a way they do not approve, or becauſe
they will not conſent to, Embrace, and Comply with thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
they have juſt reaſon to Believe are Sinful. Whilſt
Men are not openly Wicked, but tho not free from common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
which do unavoidably accompany humane Nature in
this frail Eſtate, yet free from Groſs and Scandalous Sins, whilſt
they deny not any Doctrine of Chriſtianity, nor divulge any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to the Prejudice of Chriſtianity, nor do any way endeavour
to diſturb the Peace of the Government under which they live;
they have a right to a peacable and quiet Reſidence, and ought
to be free from any Moleſtation, tho they cannot in every acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
thing attain to the ſame Latitude with others. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes about to Diſturb and Injure, or Contract on ſuch as theſe,
Fines, or other Puniſhments, becauſe they cannot receive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with thoſe ſuper numerary Conceits ſome do too much pleaſe
themſelves with, and preſs with too much warmth on others, are
too lyable to this heavy Charge of Perſecution. And if we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider what it is they are ſo concerned for, we may ſee too
much reaſon, to conclude they have no great Portion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
properties. Wherefore I will now proceed to the</p>
            <p>Second Point,<note place="margin">2ly.</note> which is to account to you ſome of their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
more particularly, or to ſhew you what kind of People Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
generally are. They are commonly obſerved to be the
worſt, the moſt Brutiſh, and Degenerate part of Mankind. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
others, Read Hiſtories, or Conſider what you may Learn
from your own Obſervation; you will find them to come general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under ſome very Scandalous, and Offenſive Characters. They
are uſually taken to be the very Peſt of Society. It is almoſt as
dangerous to live amongſt them, as amongſt the Wild and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Beaſts of the Deſert. They are a ſort of Tygers and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the moſt Ravenous Beaſts of Prey with humane Viſages.
Were the Pythagorian Notion of the Tranſmigration of Souls
received, the whole World would then conclude them nothing
but humane Carcaſes acted with Wolviſh Breath. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
they have ſome or all of theſe Characters and Qualities
attending them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57668:7"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 1. They are Men of a very Superſtitious, Blind and Ignorant
Zeal. And there is no one thing that makes Men more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Troubleſom, than undue and miſtaken Zeal. It is like
Fire when it meets with Gunpowder and other combuſtible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It devours all before it, and its Flames become unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Superſtitious Bigots place Religion in things, that are at
beſt but bare humane Inventions, many times, pure Diabolical
Suggeſtions; and then Sathan to ingulfe them further, doth ſo
excite and irritate them, they contend and ſtrive for theſe things
as if Heaven, Soul, and Eternity were all at Stake; hence it is,
they repreſent all that are not of their Way and Mind, as the
greateſt Criminals and Malefactors. No ſooner do Men place
Religion where God placeth none, but Sathan obtains a great
Power and Influence over them, and at laſt hurries them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into ſtrange and wild Extravagancies in the Defence, and
for the Propagation of thoſe Points. Theſe are uſually the moſt
fierce and barbarous of all other People. For it is uſually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that Superſtitious Men are very Fearful, and that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Cowards are moſt Revengful and Cruel, if they can obtain an
Advantage. <hi>Paul</hi>'s blind Zeal made him a Perſecutor: <hi>He did
it Ignorantly.</hi> And our Saviour tells us of ſome that would kill
and murder Men,<note place="margin">John 16. 2.</note> and flatter themſelves with a Perſwaſion that
they were therein <hi>doing God and Religion good Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They are Men of inſufferable Pride and Malice, there is
an abſolute Neceſſity, that ſome degree of that Popiſh Conceit
of Infallibility ſhould prevail in all that are Perſecutors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
themſelves to their own Practices; For who can be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and fooliſh, as to endeavour to ruine others, becauſe they
will not Believe or Practiſe what they themſelves do acknowledg,
they are not ſo certain concerning, but that it is poſſible they may
be in an Errour and Miſtake? Thoſe who are Perſecutors do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
all ſhould yield to them, and take them for Oracles, and
if they be not thus received, they think the Affront is too great
to be endured, and therefore muſt be Revenged. Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
hath generally a very great Influence on all Perſecutions.
Your Perſecutors are uſually People, of a Haughty, Curſt, and
Poiſonous Nature, they love to be <hi>doing Evil:</hi> Their Delight
is to Hurt and Offend them, with whom <hi>God is Pleaſed.</hi> They are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57668:7"/>
canker'd and ill natured, and never pleaſed but when they have
an opportunity to intrap, and make the <hi>Innocent fall.</hi> They
cannot bear Contradiction. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was ſo impatient of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
he no ſooner hears <hi>Micaiah</hi> bring a different Meſſſage
from his, and diſcover how a lying Spirit was in the Mouths of
the other Prophets,<note place="margin">1. King. 22. 24.</note> but he falls upon <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and Buffets
him.</p>
            <p>3. They are Men of deſperate and broken Fortunes, or elſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
great Worſhippers of <hi>Mammon.</hi> They do commonly take up
Informing, and Swearing, and Perſecuting as a Trade to live by.
They ſcarce know how to ſubſiſt but by Preying on the Wealth,
and Eſtates and Goods, of thoſe honeſt, ſober, religious People
they do Inform and Swear againſt. Men that are ſo lazy they
cannot Work, ſo luxurious they have not where withal to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Luſts, and of ſo ill and blaſted a Fame and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
none dares truſt them. Theſe are indeed a fit ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Perſecute the Righteous: They cannot Live unleſs ſome
or other fall by their means. There are two ſorts of moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and wicked Ways, Men have found out to maintain
themſelves, and feed their Luſts by: The one is Robbing on the
High-way, and the other is Informing againſt, and Perſecuting
the Righteous. Now thoſe that apply to the latter Way, are
the moſt Infamous of the two; for as they are wicked enough,
to commit as great Villanies as the other dares, ſo they have not
Courage to adventure on ſuch dangerous Courſes, and to expoſe
themſelves to ſo much Hazard for a Livelyhood as the other do.
They think it eaſier to Swear, than Hector and afright Men out
of what they have. The wiſe Man ſeems to give a very lively
Deſcription of theſe People in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16, 17. <hi>They ſleep not
except they have done Miſchief, and their ſleep is taken away, unleſs
they cauſe ſome to fall, for they eat the Bread of Wickedneſs, and drink
the Wine of Violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any Perſecutors whoſe Fortunes are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo deſpicable and ſmall, they are ſuch as make a <hi>Mammon</hi>
their God; The Hopes of getting Wealth doth very powerfully
irritate them to what they do: Was it not thirty pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Men that are very looſe, prophane, and every way debauched:
Such as are common Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, and
profeſſed Enemies to every thing that is Serious, Holy, and Good.
Men that have proſtituted themſelves to every Luſt and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
that have no more of Religion than an outward Name,
being Atheiſts in their Hearts, and many times ſo in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Such as think there is no Happineſs but what agrees
with <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Conceit, making their Belly their God, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but the things of this World. Your ordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn,
and perjur'd Wretches, are the People that do moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſeek a Livelyhood by being ſuborn'd to Swear againſt them
that <hi>fear the Lord.</hi> They that never ſcruple to tear the Name of
God in Pieces, and to affront their Maker on every turn, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Name in Vain, who emboſs every Word they ſpeak, with
ſome dreadful Oath or other, who dare impudently ſwear a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Oaths in an Hour, without any Provocation, theſe are the
fitteſt Men to Inform and Swear againſt, and endeavour their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
who have a Religious and truly Conſcientious regard to the
Name of God, and every thing on which he hath ſtampt his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
No wonder ſuch as theſe, ſhould ſolemnly devore and
proſtitute their Souls to Hell, by ſwearing even falſly againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when they have the Temptation and Incouragement of
getting Wealth and Riches, ſince they are ſo accuſtomed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
their Maker, they think they never ſpeak gentilely, unleſs
they ſet their moſt high God at utmoſt Defiance, and do in Words
at length challenge him to Damn them. He that ſets himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to Sathan's Service by indulging to all the Luſts of the Fleſh,
that can boaſt of his Drunkenneſs, and Uncleanneſs, of his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Exceſſes, and every Days Debauch, that can unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or rather with Triumph ſpeak of his Hopes and Deſires of
being Damn'd for ever, that Defiles the Air he ſpeaks in, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
all he comes amongſt with his prodigious Oaths, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations:
This Man is ready prepared if an Occaſion do offer it
ſelf, or can by any means be obtained, to Swear a Conſcientious,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57668:8"/>
Religious Man out of his Right, and himſelf into it. That
Man that will ordinarily indanger his Soul, and Swear for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
will much more do ſo, be it right or wrong, when he hath
the Temptation of Wealth, and it may be the Applauſe and
Commendation of great Men for his Incouragement.</p>
            <p>Having given this account of the two firſt Particulars.<note place="margin">3ly.</note> I ſhall
now inquire whence it is that wicked Men are ſuch bitter and
inveterate Enemies againſt the Godly? Conſtant Experience is
an undenyable Proof of the Truth of it, for no Age hath paſſed,
but the worſt Men have bin contriving and endeavouring to do
the Righteous ſome Diſpleaſure. We need not conſult Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to Confirm what I am now treating of, for we may every
where take Notice of the Deplorable Truth and Certainty of it
amongſt our ſelves. But from amongſt the many Inſtances which
might be mentioned as having ſome influence in and concurring
to this, I will only name theſe few.</p>
            <p>1. There is a deſperate and deadly Enmity againſt Godlyneſs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and ſo againſt good Men, rooted deeply in the Nature of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men. Ever ſince we loſt the Image of God, we are <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Children of Wrath,</hi> not only as we are ſubject and lyable
to the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God, but as we are of a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
furious, and unreconcilable Temper. We are naturally E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
not only to God, but to one another alſo. And it is to
be aſcribed principally, rather wholly, to the wiſe Conduct and
Providence of God, that all Men are not conſtantly up in Arms,
and always endeavouring the utter Extirpation one of another.
But this Enmity is eſpecially ſet againſt all Goodneſs. When
Man loſt Holyneſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 5. 6.</note> he became a moſt violent Adverſary to it.
As you obſerve when a Man hath taſted of the good Word of
God, and the Powers of the World to come, if he apoſtatize, he
becomes the moſt Virulent and Implacable Enemy to it. So it
is with Man naturally ſince the Fall. The Devils that were ſuch
pure and holy Angels, are now the greateſt haters of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Wicked Men are of a Curſt, Envious, Malicious Temper, they
are of a Perſecuting Nature, and have a great deal of Savageneſs
in their Temper; they are againſt Holyneſs, as being contrary
to their Nature, and thus become ſo violent againſt good Men.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57668:9"/>
Look at any Creature, you will find it hath an averſion to thoſe
things, which are of a contrary Nature, and if there be any thing
of Wildneſs, and Cruelty, and Savageneſs intermixed, then it
is extraordinary violent againſt thoſe which are of the contrary
Nature. But thoſe things which have not ſuch a Savageneſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt,
they only teſtify their averſion by a peacible withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, not at all endeavouring the Deſtruction or Hurt
of the other. This is very apparent in the Wolf and the Lamb:
They delight not in the Society one of another, but the Lamb,
though of ſo contrary a Nature to the Wolf, doth not ſeek the
Life or hurt of the Wolf; but the Wolf is not ſatisfied but with
the total Deſtruction of the Lamb. Nor is this only becauſe the
Wolf doth uſually prey and feed on ſuch Creatures, for then when
the Hunger were ſatisfied, that rapacious and fierce Temper
would ceaſe. That Creature which is of a fierce and ravenous
Nature, will deſtroy and kill not only out of Neceſſity, but alſo
for Sport and Recreation. Thus wicked Men they are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Nature to the Godly, and have much wildneſs and rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs
intermixed. They <hi>cannot ſleep unleſs they make ſome to fall;</hi>
and therefore they are reſembled to and ſet forth by thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which are wholy ſet upon deſtroying the Harmleſs and
Innocent. <hi>They lye lurking privily in their Den, that they may catch
the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ask what the Reaſon is that the Righteous and Holy do
not Perſecute the Wicked, as well as the Wicked do them, the
Nature of each being equally contrary to each other? I anſwer,
the Roughneſs and Severity of good Mens Natures is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by that ſanctifying and altering Grace which is beſtowed on
them, and for which they are ſo much hated by the other. The
new Nature conferred on them, hath the harmleſneſs of the Dove
accompanying it. A ſanctified Nature ſo far as under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Influence of Sanctification, hath no Hatred, nor Envy, nor
Malice, nor any other Quality that is hurtful. It dares not hate
or hurt an Enemy.</p>
            <p>And the true reaſon why ungodly Men do no more hurt to the
Righteous, is becauſe God reſtrains them; he puts <hi>his Hook into
their Noſe, and his Bridle into their Lips,</hi> and checks them.</p>
            <p>Contrariety cauſeth their Averſion to the Godly, but it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57668:9"/>
that fierceneſs which is intermixed, which cauſeth the Violence
of the Perſecution; as you ſee Tygers, Wolves, Lions, and Bears,
do perſue, and kill, and devour Sheep, Lambs, and other Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Profitable Creatures, and as Hawks and Kites do fly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Prey on Turtle Doves and Pigeons, ſo do Wicked out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Ungodly Men Perſecute and Trouble the Juſt and Holy.</p>
            <p>2. Their Natural Enmity is very much increaſed and excited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
into act by very unjuſt Prejudices, which they imbibe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with Delight. A wicked perſecuting Perſon rejoyceth to
hear of any thing, which tends to the Defamation, and Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of one that is truly Religious. He labors to ſpread and
divulge it abroad, and aggravates every Miſtake, and almoſt
unavoidable Infirmity, repreſenting it as an hideous and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Crime. Nay he uſually attributes the Faults of ſome
particular Perſons to the whole Profeſſion. Thus the very Name
of a Pious Man is Odious and Inſupportable to him; and he talks
as virulently againſt, and deſires as vehemently the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of every one, how Harmleſs, Good, and Innocent ſoever,
who comes under ſuch a Denomination, as againſt the vileſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant
and Criminal in the World, tho he never knew or heard
of any Hurt by the one, or any good by the other.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to take notice now of a Sin, that prevails
exceedingly at this time amongſt our ſelves; which is, that we
have diſputed our ſelves into ſo much Wrath, ſuch an Averſneſs
and Enmity to one another, that Diſſenters, and thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Church, can ſcarce indure the Names of one another,
unleſs ſome diſgraceful and reproachful Term be annexed. Too
many of them are become ſuch fierce Adverſaries one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that they have not only abandoned themſelves from the
eminent Exerciſe of that Charity and mutual Forbearance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Chriſtianity doth very much inforce, but they do with too
much Appetite liſten and inquire after, and inſtead of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for, do rejoyce and almoſt triumph in the Faults which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons on either ſide are chargible with; and which is
yet a greater Fault, they are too frequent in applying the Guilt
beyond its due extent.</p>
            <p>By this means do thoſe who are Corrupt, Carnal, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
on each ſide, labor to increaſe our Animoſities, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57668:10"/>
make our Diviſions wider and more unhealable.</p>
            <p>But it is moſt of all deplorable, that the Malignity and Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this courſe, ſeems to diffuſe and ſpread it ſelf amongſt
them who have given undeniable and prodigious Evidences of
extraordinary Learning, and ſometimes of very great and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
imitable Moderation and Equanimity: Which diſcovers
that when People do apply themſelves to advance any Party
with undue Warmth, they forget to obſerve that Decorum, they
have formerly commended to the World, and are too eaſily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to uſe the meaneſt Arts in depreſſing the Cauſe they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>It is certainly very unbecoming and unworthy of Men of great
Learning, Holyneſs, and Gravity to indeavour to defame all
that are of the contrary Perſwaſion, by ſuggeſting to the World
evil Surmiſes and Opinions concerning all in general, by report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infamous Stories which concern only ſome few in particular:
for beſides the Injury they themſelves do by this Means to thoſe
that are Innocent; they both Countenance the unjuſt Methods
the worſt of Men do uſe in decrying thoſe they are againſt, and
they furniſh them with Materials to carry on their Deſign.</p>
            <p>This hath bin an ancient Method, People have uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
themſelves on the Innocent.<note place="margin">Jer. 20. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Report ſay they, and we will
Report.</hi> Do but either ſtart any one Story that is real, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to ſome Particulars, or fraim and coin a Story that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Plauſible, and let it once take Air, and we will ſoon help to
tranſmit it further, and by this means we <hi>ſhall take our Revenge
on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a dreadful Blow would be given to Chriſianity in
the Opinion of its profeſſed Enemies, ſhould all Parties labor to
rake together the foul and enormous Offences of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
amongſt thoſe they do Oppoſe, and then publiſh them to
the World, as what the whole Party doth either approve, or may
juſtly be charged with?</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but this Church (tho it's Government and
Conſtitution be ſo pure, juſtifiable, and Conſonant to Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Practice) would ſuffer very much, ſhould but the almoſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
miſ-carriages of a great number who pretend to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
be expoſed to publick view; with an account of the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57668:10"/>
they meet with, or at leaſt how free they are from Threats
and Moleſtations, whilſt others who lead better Lives, and are
more conſtant and diligent Preachers, and do expreſs on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
more of that Charity and Forbearance towards all men,
which Chriſtianity doth ſo much commend and inforce, are
frowned upon, and left open to the Rage and Fury of beſotted
Frantick and Debauch'd Bigots. There is no defence againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Prejudice.</p>
            <p>3. They apprehend, that the ſtrict and Holy Lives of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
men do very much reproach their lewd and vicious Courſes.
At leaſt they find that their pure and Holy Doctrines do occaſion
them anguiſh and unquietneſs, diſturbance and trouble in the
perpetrating of their beloved Wickedneſſes. Why could not
<hi>Herodias</hi> ſuffer <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt to keep his Head any longer? It was
becauſe ſhe could not live quietly in her uncleanneſs with her
Husbands brother, whilſt he was ſtill Preaching to <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>it
was not lawful for him to have her.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 3.</note> Indeed there is not any thing
doth more effectually diſcover the horrid Loathſomneſs of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mens Luſts and Practices, than the Chaſt, Holy, and ſtrict
Converſations of Pious men. And therefore they are ſo much
againſt them, even becauſe their Doctrines and Lives do ſo much
reprove their wicked Works of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>4. Holy men are carrying on a different work from that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ungodly lew'd men are Deſigning and Acting. They are ſervants
to different Maſters, and therefore it is not to be expected they
ſhould accord very well. The good Man's work doth defeat
and Ruin the Sinners, and therefore he is againſt him, and doth
perſecute him all he can, becauſe he belongs not to his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but is labouring to deſtroy his maſters Kingdom, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
what he eſteems his own greateſt Intereſt.<note place="margin">John 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>If ye were of the
World the World would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the World,
but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This proceeds many times from a very ſtrong and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
impulſe of Satan. As wicked men are his Slaves and doing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
his Work, ſo he doth irritate and excite in a ſpecial manner to
this very inſtance of Perſecuting the Godly. The Devil thinks
he has moſt work done when the greateſt number of Righteous
men fall: And he concludes that if he could by his Inſtruments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57668:11"/>
abſolutely ſuppreſs the Righteous, he ſhould Reign and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in the World without any Oppoſition.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> The Devil <hi>Rules
in the hearts of the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> And it is worth our
Obſervation, that immediately before <hi>Judas</hi> went to the High-Prieſt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to inform againſt and betray his Maſter, it is ſaid <hi>the
devil entred into him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22 3, 4.</note> So that one main inſtance, whence it is that
wicked People do perſecute the Righteous, is <hi>becauſe the Devil is in
them.</hi> The Devil doth as truly poſſeſs, Act, and govern them
that perſecute the Righteous, as he did thoſe that were called
Demoniacks, when our Saviour was upon Earth. And tho he do
not cauſe them now to Tear and Rent, and Torture themſelves,
as they did then, yet he has a more dreadful Influence on their
Souls, and indangers them much more as to their ſpiritual and
final Eſtate.</p>
            <p>I am now in the laſt place to apply what has been diſcourſed
concerning Perſecution;<note place="margin">4ly.</note> and will do it in a few Words.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. For the ſupport and Incouragement of the Righteous, when
Perſecuted and in diſtreſs. Take care that the reproaches and
Violences of the ungodly do not afright you from your upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor ſhake your ſtedfaſtneſs. Thoſe ſtorms and rufling
Winds, their Threats and Menaces, ſhould not break or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
you, but ſhould rather have the ſame Influence on you,
that blaſts and Tempeſts have on firm and thriving Trees, whilſt
they break and overturn thoſe that are Rotten and weak, they
do only cauſe the other to take deeper and faſter Root.</p>
            <p>This is no more than what you muſt expect, and what every
good man ought daily to prepare for. He that is reſolved for
<hi>Heaven</hi> muſt <hi>go through many Tribulations;</hi> you are warned of ſuch
Treatment before-hand. Our Saviour has dealt ſo plainly with
all his followers in this particular, that it is one great part of a
Chriſtians work to live alway in Expectation of thoſe things that
ſo he may not be ſurprized when they come. We have our eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
days Croſs to wait for, and muſt be willing to take it up, and
bear it away with Cheerfulneſs, when ever it comes. We have
not the cleareſt and moſt unqueſtionable Evidences of the Truth,
at leaſt the Power of Chriſtianity in and over us, till we can Cheerfully
part with and reſign up all, yea with Triumph bear away
Reproaches, and Fears, and falſe Accuſations, till we can lay
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57668:11"/>
down our very Lives rejoycingly for Chriſt, his Goſpel, and
Religion, if occaſion be.</p>
            <p>And if God ſees fit to bring you to the Tryal; it is that you
may have the ſtronger aſſurance of your unfeigned Love to him,
and unconquerable intereſt in him. And that you may diſplay
the Efficacy and Beauty of Religion unto the World in the moſt
undeniable and Conſtraining inſtances. The Perſecutions of the
firſt Chriſtians gained Chriſtianity a great Repute, and made
ſuch an entrance for it into the World, as could never be ſtopt
up or hindred, till Sloth, Carnality, and Superſtitious conceits
had corrupted the Minds and Lives of it's Profeſſors, and this
happ'ned after they were burthened and over loaded, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Eaſe, Preferments, and a multitude of unneceſſary, and
Superfluous outward Accommodations.</p>
            <p>The Saints and people of God have met with the ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all Ages. This has been their Lot and Portion, when
they have lived amongſt wicked looſe People. And we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
find that they took great Satisfaction in it. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was uſed thus himſelf. How was he reviled, ſcorned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't,
falſely accuſed, Spit upon, Buffetted, Whipt, and at
laſt diſgracefully Crucified, by a degenerate inhumane People?
You ſee the greateſt and moſt abſolute Innocence is not ſafe,
from the Malicious rage, and violence of ungodly men. The
Apoſtles preſently after, were ſerved in the ſame manner. And
when they were Scourged, to render them a publick ſcorn and
reproach they went away rejoycing, that they were counted
worthy to be thus uſed for Chriſt. It is one part of the Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you are called to, to ſuffer for Chriſt: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. The more
that wicked men do Load you with Contumelious Language, and
oppreſſive Fines and Mulcts, or do inflict on you Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
and Torments, the more they do to raiſe you to the
Likeneſs of the bleſſed Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is not the leaſt matter of rejoycing, that they
who Perſecute you, are only ſuch as <hi>are born after the Fleſh.</hi> Your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
are they that are Enemies to God and Chriſt; worldly,
ſenſual, Devilliſh men, <hi>who glory in their Shame, who make their
Belly their God, who are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and whoſe end
is Deſtruction.</hi> It is a much greater diſgrace, to be reſpected and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57668:12"/>
spoken well of, by ſuch as theſe, than to have them always ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out their Venom, and darting forth their forked Tongues
and Stinge againſt you: They will ſpeak well of none but ſuch as
are infeſted with their Diſeaſe. They that are the ſpawn of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun,
will undoubtedly have ill will to the Children of God.</p>
            <p>But what a rejoycing is it, that by this very means, you are
ſo particularly aſſured of a moſt glorious Recompence: Beſides
the inexpreſſible Conſolation, God will ſecretly Communicate at
preſent, he has provided, and in a ſpecial manner promiſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
Felicities hereafter. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>But then you muſt be ſure that what you ſuffer for, be the cauſe
of Chriſt. Let it be true and real Religion, Conſcience indeed,
and not any groundleſs Phancy, unreaſonable Humor, or unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Reſolution and ſtubborneſs you ſuffer for. Eſpecially
beware <hi>that none of you ſuffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an
Evildoer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>or as a buſie Body in other mens Matters.</hi> Theſe are the
faults and Characters of Perſecutors themſelves, and for theſe
things men ought to ſuffer. See that your Conſciences be clear
and well informed. Take care to underſtand the thing you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for. Weigh your Opinions and your Practices in <hi>the Ballance
of the Sanctnary.</hi> Be ſure your cauſe be Good, and then if you are
Perſecuted and do ſuffer, come under what Denomination you
will, and let your Perſecutors be who they will, of how great
Power and Authority ſo ever, I dare and will pray that <hi>Peace may
be upon you, and upon the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> It is the cauſe that
makes the Martyr, tho it is not alway the cauſe that makes the
Perſecutor.</p>
            <p>2ly. Let this caution you, that you be not guilty of this Sin.
It will be found at laſt, a very dreadful thing to be a Perſecutor;
for by this means you become fighters againſt God. And dare
ye reſolutely <hi>Provoke the Lord to jealouſie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 22.</note> 
               <hi>are ye ſtronger than he?</hi>
Did ever any ſet themſelves <hi>againſt God and proſper?</hi> The Lord
Jeſus doth take what is done to his Followers and Diſciples, as
done to himſelf. And he will terribly avenge himſelf of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
and Deſtroyers of his People. You cannot hurt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,<note place="margin">Zech. 2. 8.</note> but you offend and pierce God himſelf <hi>in the Apple
of his Eye.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 7. 2.</note> 
               <hi>And will not God</hi> (think you) <hi>avenge his own Elect which
cry day and night into him? I tell you be with avenge them ſpeedily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57668:12"/>
It were better for you, you had never been born or that ſome
fatal, and miſerable ſtroke had ended your Lives, as ſoon as you
ſaw the Light, than that you ſhould live to be Perſecutors. <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 6. have not Perſecutors alway come to ſome fearful end?</p>
            <p>If you would not pull down divine Vengeance on your own
Heads, if you would not make your ſelves and your Poſterity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
to all Generations, by inheriting the moſt dreadful Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
on your Bodies, your Eſtates, and all your Intereſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
if you would not be the general abhorrence of mankind,
if you would not Rot away Peice-meal whilſt you are alive, if
you would not be your own unpitied Executioners, if you would
not be filled with Horror and Conſternation by reaſon of a
Wounding, Terrifying and accuſing Conſcience, if you would
not Purchaſe to your ſelves the hotteſt Climate and Region in the
infernal Pit, but can be content with <hi>an ordinary Damnation,</hi> if
you have no deſire to be the worſt, the moſt miſerable, the moſt
Contemptible, of all that ſhall inherit everlaſting burnings, take
heed of this Sin. The Devil never feaſts ſo deliciouſly, as when
ſerved with Perſecutors and Informers.</p>
            <p>How variouſly and ſtrangely has God teſtified his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Wrath againſt Perſecutors? Whole Volumes might be
filled with bare Relations. Thoſe Judgments have been inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them, to make them a ſcorn an abhorrence, and a warning
to Poſterity, which were never known, or heard of in the World,
till they were puniſh't and made infamous by them.</p>
            <p>And if you be Perſecutors God has the ſame, and greater
Plagues and Judgments in ſtore for you.</p>
            <p>I know there are few who apply themſelves to this Courſe,
but they flatter themſelves, and endeavour to ſatisfie others,
with ſome or other falſe and pretended Excuſes. But alas what
will theſe avail you, whilſt they are ſo Thin and Hollow not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the All-ſeeing-God, but the ordinary ſort of People can ſee
thorough them? Unleſs the cauſe be too black and horrid to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Patronage of Hell, or the Actors be ſordid and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
enough to make the Devil aſhamed of them, he will furniſh
with ſome pretence to palliate and gloſs the Fact.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough that you have ſomething to Plead and
ſay in your own defence amongſt men, unleſs it be what will be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57668:13"/>
warranted and approved by the judge of all, for if you could ſo
varniſh the ſeverity you uſe to others, as to obtain the favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinion of the generality of men concerning it, what will
this avail you, if when you appear before the great Tribunal,
you be found amongſt Perſecutors? All falſe Colours, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retricious
Paint will then diſappear.</p>
            <p>Now to ſecure you from this danger, it will be needful to have
a conſtant regard to theſe two Rules.</p>
            <p>1. Have nothing to do with hurting, or contracting damages
on any ſerious, upright, Conſcientious Chriſtian. Be not acceſſory
for a World to the Ruine, or needleſs prejudice of any one, who
ſtands faſt in the faith of Chriſt. Thoſe who agree with us in all
the Subſtantials of Religion, and add no dangerous or Deſtructive
Tenet to theſe, who are Holy, Sober, Chaſt, Temperate, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Compaſſionate and merciful, and who no way indeavour to
diſturb the publick peace, but are Vigorous Proteſtants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
oppoſers of the common Enemies of our Religion, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Rights, they ought (eſpecially conſidering our preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances)
to be ſo far from being Perſecuted and oppreſſed,
as to have all the Incouragement and Countenance that pious
Chriſtians, and Loyal Subjects can claim and deſerve. Do not
hurt, perſecute, or revile any, whom you have reaſon to believe
the Lord Jeſus will own, approve and honour. <hi>Will Chriſt ever
thank men at the great day for keeping ſuch out form Communion with his
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. praef.</note> 
               <hi>whom he will vouchſafe not only Crowns of Glory to, but it may
be Aureolae too, if there be any ſuch thing there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been well for <hi>Pilate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 19.</note> if he had hearkened to that ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meſſage, <hi>have thou nothing to do with that juſt man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Take heed of, and avoid the very appearances of this Sin.
Keep at as great a diſtance from it, as poſſible. Do not Cheriſh in
your minds, any thing that may ingage, or incline to it. Caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all unjuſt Prejudices, Mortifie Wrath and Anger: and ſhut
your Ears againſt them that would incenſe you againſt thoſe, you
differ from, by reporting falſe and malicious ſtories of them.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing it could not properly be called Perſecution to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
and be ſevere with People about thoſe things, which you
are ſatisfied in your own minds, God has not concern'd himſelf
about, either by Commanding or forbidding them, yet your Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57668:13"/>
or making others ſuffer extremely for theſe things, whilſt
they have other apprehenſions either of the Nature or uſe
of them, will unavoidably look too like Perſecution (I think)
for a ſerious Compaſſionate Chriſtian to tolerate himſelf in.
This ſeems not to have any of that Meekneſs, Condeſcention,
and Forbearance our Religion doth ſo expreſsly and ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inforce.</p>
            <p>Nay your addicting your ſelves to ſuch Courſes will indanger
the indearing of a rough, ſowre, and unpeaceable temper to you.
And it may be it will at laſt hurry you, into ſuch <hi>Exorbitances,</hi> as
you did not at firſt either Deſign, or think of; nay which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to inexcuſable and down-right Perſecution.</p>
            <p>This will certainly make way for your entertaining very unjuſt
Prejudices againſt others. It will lay you lyable to greater Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports
in your Paſſions. It will expoſe you to more and ſtronger
Temptations, than you are at firſt aware of, it will lay you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the wiles of Satan, that cunning Adverſary, and great
deſtroyer of the Godly.</p>
            <p>Nay it is probable enough, that when thoſe Chriſtian Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reſolves, you do at preſent retain, are a little worn
off, and by diſuſe become feeble, the very deſire and ambition
of acquaintance with men of Power and Repute, who are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Proteſtants as ſuch, may ingage you in thoſe Practices,
which both your deceitful Hearts and the better hopes of others,
made you believe you ſhould for ever deteſt.</p>
            <p>Satan very ſeldom Attempts to draw any man to direct Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
at firſt; He only leads them at firſt to the out-skirts, and
Fleſhes them by degrees. But when he has once brought men to
take Pleaſure in ſeeing others ſuffer, tho not for real Religion, the
ſweetneſs of Blood, or the Satisfaction of getting Wealth, or
the Honour of being careſſed by great men, will indanger to
qualifie them to undertake with unconcernedneſs and Triumph
the moſt barbarous and inhumane Perſections imaginable.</p>
            <p>Men know not where they ſhall ſtop, if once they give way to
Satan, or their own corrupt Inclinations in matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
People do ſometimes Act thoſe things under the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their outward Eſtate and Condition, and become ſo
extremely Savage and cruel as they could not before imagine,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57668:14"/>
which they could not endure to think of without the higheſt
Concernment and Indignation. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, you may expreſs your, Love to, and
Zeal for the Church, its Service, and its Ceremonies, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
other ways. I diſſwade not from any Methods, which do
any way tend to the Honour of our Church, or to the making of
real Proſelytes: But only from thoſe which indanger its Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and are not at all Suitable to the Matter and Occaſion of
our Differences. I would perſwade you to be as Faithful as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the Church and its Intereſts, but not to expreſs your Zeal
in ſo confuſed and Prepoſterous away, as will be deſtructive to
humane Society, or indanger your waſhing your Hands in the
Blood of Innocents: Uſe all the Scripture, and rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you can, to Winn upon, and Overcome, and Convince
them that Diſſent, but beware of Extremity and Violence.</p>
            <p>How Ridiculous and Abſurd is it, to hear Men Talk very
Gravely at ſometimes, that the Church hath no Weapons but
Tears and Prayers, and yet preſently to ſee the ſame Men uſing
Rods, and Swords, and Axes in the Churches Behalf? When the
Church is in danger of being Clouded, Eclypſed, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and Suppreſt by Popery, then it is unlawful to endeavour
to help ourſelves, we muſt only lie Proſtrate, and try if we can
waſh away our <hi>Sorrow</hi> with our <hi>Tears,</hi> or at moſt, content our
ſelves with <hi>Lord help us.</hi> But when we conſider them we have
got an Aſcendency over, it becomes Glorious (and indeed is more
than Chriſtian) to Swagger and Triumph, and tread upon Men
of the ſame Regligion with our ſelves, only becauſe they differ
from us in ſome unhappy Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>When the Church doth ſtand upon its proper Baſis, and ſhines
in its Native Beauty and Luſtre,<note place="margin">Jſ. 65. 25.</note> there will be no <hi>hurting in
God's Holy Mountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Method which hath moſt of Lenity, Forbearance, Love,
and Meekneſs, doth beſt comport with the Nature and Deſign
of Chriſtianity, and moſt anſwers that Temper, our Saviour
and his Apoſtles commended to the World, both by their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Precepts. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
            <p>3ly. Let me ſay a few Words to you that are Perſecutors, you
that are Vilifying and Reproaching, Fining, and Diſtraining on,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57668:14"/>
Murdering and tearing in Pieces the Members of Jeſus Chriſt, if
you have any Shadow of Humanity yet remaining, be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to refletect on what you do, conſider what your Condition is,
If you are not <hi>become Cruel like the Oſtriches in the Wilderneſe:</hi> If
<hi>your Conſciences be not feared with a hot Iron:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 4. 3.</note> If you do not believe
that your Impieties are a ſure and impregnable Safeguard and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt all the Thuander-Bolts of God's Vengeance,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> if you
think they do not make you as Impenetrable by the Arrows of
the Almighty, as the Scales of the Leviathan, render him by
the Arrows which are commonly caſt at him, then deliberate a
while, and think ſeriouſly, whether one time or other, you ſhall
not be aſhamed of, and ſorry for what you now perpetrate? If
you Believe there is any Truth, or any Honeſty, or any things
that are Pure, or Juſt, or Lowly, or of good Report, or if there
be any Virtue, then conſider how contrary to, and inconſiſtent
with all theſe, Perſecution is.</p>
            <p>Perſecution is a Sin that deſtroys common Humanity: It makes
you much more fit to be baniſh'd from all Reaſonable Society, to
abide in the Wilderneſs and Deſert, with the Ravenous Devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monſters you reſemble, than to be permitted to Prey on thoſe,
who are as Humble as the Child, as Meek and Innocent as the

Pronounced on them, who have only with-held their Charity, and

            <p>You that Perſecute the Righteous, that you may maintain your

ready to appear againſt you. For all your Huffing and Hectoring,
your Swearing and Damning, your Carouzing and Quaffing, your
Healthing and Whoring, for all your ſeeming Jollity and Mirth,

great Men and Nobles, with your Wives and Concubines, will
not preſerve you from theſe Effects.</p>
            <p>What will you ſay for your own Vindication, when the Lord
Jeſus ſhall appear in all his Glory, and particularly charge you,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57668:15"/>
with Hurting, Defaming, Impoveriſhing, Starving, Fining, and
Murthering this and that Friend, Servant or Child of his? For
all your confident Domineering at preſent, tho you look and talk
now, as if you would Frown, and Threaten, and Swear them,
and all that are Advocates for them into Goals, nay in to their
Graves, and were it poſſible lower than that; a Time is haſtening
when Shame and Confuſion will cover your Faces, and an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
Silence ſhall betray your Guilt. A Day is now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when you will think it a kind of Happineſs, if you might
ſlink privately into the Places of Eternal Torment, and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the Solemn Reprimand and Condemnation you muſt have
for this Sin in particular, before all the World.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſeveral things you inſiſt on, to juſtify your
ſelves in what you do. But alas, they are ſuch poor, and thin,
and ſlight Excuſes, they will be ſo far from yielding you any
Relief in the Judgment-day, that had you any Shame, or Grace,
and Modeſty, you would bluſh to name them at preſent. And
that you may not any longer cheat your ſelves with a vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that you have enough to juſtify you in what you do; I
will briefly name what you principally truſt to, and then ſhew you
how fooliſh and impertinent ſuch Excuſes be.</p>
            <p>There are three things generally Inſiſted on by Informers, and
Perſecutors for their own Vindication: They are theſe. 1. They
ſay they do no more than what the Law doth Countenance them
in. 2. The Perſons they Proſecute are Dangerous, Seditious, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
People. 3. What they do, is out of Love to, and Zeal
for the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are commonly alledged, and People do depend
on them as Sufficient and Unanſwerable. But how unjuſt theſe
Pretences be, when pleaded by Foreign Perſecutors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
I hope all are ſatisfied who do heartily approve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Now the Proſecution of Diſſenting Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, is generally defended by the ſame Arguments.
And tho I acknowledge there is a great Difference in the things,
on the account of which the Proteſtants are Proſecuted here, and
in other palces, yet all thoſe Abatements being allowed for, the
generality of our Fierce and Furious Proſecutors cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from Guilt by theſe Inſtances. This will appear more clearly if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57668:16"/>
we conſider the Particulars pleaded diſtinctly, and by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1ſt.</note> You ſay you do no more than the Law alloweth. To this
I anſwer in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. You do generally underſtand the Law as little as any other
People.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Pref. to his Hiſt. of the Rights of Princ. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> And often times when the Law is on a Mans ſide, as to the
matter of what he does, it is againſt him in the Method he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
This is undeniably Evident in the Proſecution of the
Proteſtants in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thoſe who have had as good Opportunities as any others,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to find out the Intention and Meaning of the Laws, do put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Interpretation on them than you do. And therefore you
had need to have ſtrong aſſurance you are in the right, before
you adventure on thoſe Courſes you cannot juſtify, but by ſuch
a Pretence as in general, is a very blind and imperfect Excuſe.
For Inſtance, If the Law condemns Seditious Preaching, and you
will Proſecute and undo a Man only for Preaching, and not prove
any thing of Sedition, you are certainly ſo far from having the
Law to juſtify you, that this general Plea will not Excuſe you to
a Conſcience that is in any meaſure Senſible of ordinary Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Proſecution of theſe Laws hath bin declared Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and Hurtful to the Proteſtant Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Reſ. of Houſe of Comm. <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. 80. which ſeems very conſonant with our Soveraign. Judgm. when at <hi>Braeda.</hi>
               </note> by them who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Nature, the Tendency, and the Obligation of theſe
Laws, as well, or better than any of the Violent and Outragious
Proſecutors of them. And tho this cannot Repeal or make
Null the Laws, yet the publick Opinion of ſo great, Honourable,
and Auguſt an Aſſembly, ſhould have ſo much Influence, as to
check the inordinate Zeal ſome are too apt to lay out in their
unneceſſary Informations and Preſentments.</p>
            <p>4. If you muſt needs expreſs your Zeal for eſtabliſhed Laws,
there are others which you may underſtand more eaſily, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Tranſgreſſing of which will be more obvious to you, and in
the purſuance of which, you may do the Church and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
good Service, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Laws which are made againſt
Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Prophaning the Lord's Day <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Have
not thoſe Laws which are inforced by God as well as Men, as great
a Power and Authority over you, as thoſe which are only Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Sanctions? Your talking of the Law is of no weight, whilſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57668:16"/>
you your ſelves do reſolutely Tranſgreſs every Day, thoſe Laws
which are of greater and more general life.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> But you ſay in the ſecond Place, that thoſe you Proſecute
are Dangerous, Seditious, and Rebellious People.</p>
            <p>If you can prove this Charge againſt them, in Gods Name go
on and never ſpare them.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> But is it not very Unjuſt to ſay they
are Rebellious, and not prove any thing of this Nature againſt
them? Why do you not inform againſt them under this Notion,
and then prove it ſubſtantially againſt them? But to talk thus,
and when all comes to be inquired into, it is nothing but for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, when it may be, you were ſerving the Devil, and your
Luſts in a Tavern or Brothel Houſe, is the moſt villianous Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
imaginable.</p>
            <p>Is not this to write after the moſt extravagant Inſtance we have
in the French Perſecutors?<note place="margin">Preſent State of Proteſt. in <hi>France,</hi> p. 21.</note> Nay is it not to out-do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of the Intendant of <hi>Rochefort</hi> who Suppreſſed a Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Miniſter, when the Deponent could ſay no more, but that
<hi>tho there was nothing to be found fault with in his Words, yet he
perceived his Thoughts were not Innocent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides many of thoſe you Proſecute, have given great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of their Loyalty, having ſuffered more in the late
Times of Uſurpation, for the King, than many, if not all of
you have, and contributing much more to the bringing of him
back to his Crown, and other juſt Rights. Thoſe who never did
more for the King, than make themſelves Drunk with drinking
his Health, are not fit to compare in Point of Loyalty with them
that loſt their Eſtates, and hazarded their Lives for him. And
<hi>many of the moſt conſiderable Diſſenters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Faſt Serm. on 30 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1681 p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>did even then, when it was
not ſo ſafe to do it, as it is now, openly declare againſt it (i. e.</hi> the
Murder of the late King) <hi>both in their Sermons and Writings. This
is what in Juſtice cannot be denyed them, and many of them were no
leſs Active and Induſtrious, and were indeed highly Inſtrumental in the
bringing home of his Majeſty that now Reigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3ly.</note> You pretend that all you do is out of Love to, and Zeal for
the Church. To which I offer theſe following Conſiderations,
which may diſcover how falſe this Pretence is.</p>
            <p>1. You are not qualified to do the Church any Service. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Church ſuffers more by the Ungodlineſs, and Debauchedneſs of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57668:17"/>
your Lives, than by any one thing whatſoever. All the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
in the Nation cannot prejudice the Church half ſo much,
as you drunken, ſwearing, prophane Informers and Perſecuters do.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Church would be much better without you, than
with you. And could ſhe proceed againſt you in ſome of thoſe
ways, you would have her uſe againſt others, ſhe would do her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
great Right, and very much commend that Purity, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs
and Strictneſs, which would greatly adorn her, and which
is by your means very much Obſcured.</p>
            <p>Can any thing reflect more upon a Church, than to have thoſe
Men countenanced in Proſecuting others, who do themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
no real Love to God or Religion, and of whom no good
can be ſaid by others, nay who have nothing to ſay in their own
Vindication, but that when they are in the height of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
when they are Drunk and Prophane enough to be the
Reproach and Abhorrence of all Society, they do then pretend
to admire and applaud the Church, and to decry, and rail at, and
ſwear againſt Diſſenters?</p>
            <p>You do the Church an unſpeakable Injury, you prejudice her
almoſt beyond Repair, by pretending either Love for, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
unto her. For by this means you do what you are able to
Repreſent her to Strangers, as the only Receptacle of, and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
for the moſt infamous Criminals and Villains. It is no Cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
to any Woman, be ſhe never ſo Chaſt, Sober, and Honeſt,
that the greateſt Debauches, and lewdeſt Miſcreants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
for her Service, and claim her Patronage.</p>
            <p>And that which renders you ſtill more unfit for this Service.
you intrude your ſelves into, is, that you would make the Church
conſiſt only of ſuch as your ſelves, and dare impudently decry
all the Sober, Moderate, and Pious Conformiſts, with the ſame
Virulence you ſet your ſelves againſt them you call Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.
So that were it in your Power, you would turn the Church
into a meer Stew, or Alehouſe, or School of Sin and Debauchery.</p>
            <p>There are,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>'s Aſſize Serm. 1681. p. 29.</note> God knows, too too many Debauchees in the Nation, who
would be thought great Champions for the King and the Church, but do
infinite Prejudice to both, by the mad and frantick Expreſſions of their
Zeal, who do mighty honour to Fanaticiſm, by charging all with it,
that run not with them to the ſame Exceſs of Riot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57668:17"/>
As to all thoſe who pretend to be of our Communion, and yet live
ſcandalous Lives,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi>'s Serm. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of Commons <hi>April.</hi> 11. 1679.</note> and think that their owning themſelves for the Sons
of the Church, will make Atonement for their Immoralities, it is to
be fear'd they have done us more hurt, then ever they will do us good.
And unleſs they would reforme, it may perhaps be wiſhed that we were
rid of them. Let them declare themſelves Fanaticks, Papiſts, any
thing rather than Members of the Church of England. It would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be more deſirable to Live in a mean, low, afflicted Condition
without ſuch Company, than to govern the World with it.</p>
            <p>2. This is an old Hypocritical pretence with which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of God and Religion have uſually cover'd their wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
and barbarous Cruelties. This cannot ſecure you from
Vengeance. God incourages his people to hope that he would
appear for them, and againſt ſuch as ſhould make this pretence
for their Perſecuting them. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord ye that
tremble at his Word, your brethren that hated you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 66. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that caſt you out for
my Names ſake, ſaid, let the Lord be Glorified, but he ſhall appear to
your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> They pretended what they did
againſt them that trembled at the word of the Lord, was for the
Church, and that God might be Glorified, but yet God would
bring them to ſhame for their Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>I am afraid there are many who talk high for the Church, who
would be glad to ſee her welter in her own Blood, or conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Aſhes with thoſe flames they hope to kindle by their own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or intemperate Zeal. People who are wicked enough
notwithſtanding their loud Crys for the Church, to ſet her on
Fire themſelves, and then like <hi>Nero,</hi> Triumph, and Dance, and
Sing, when they behold her devouring Flames, and utter Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.</p>
            <p>As ſome in the late times did very wickedly face Rebellion
with the name of Religion, ſo it is to be fear'd ſome in theſe
days do Cloak Popery, Revenge, and hatred to all Piety, with
the name of the Church. <hi>All that ſwear by the name of the Lord,
and make mention for the God of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 48. 1.</note> 
               <hi>do not do it in. Truth nor in
Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Your not Proſecuting them, who play and drink, or walk <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
&amp; loiter away the Lords day, and other times they ſhould alot for
the publick ſervice &amp; worſhip of God, does plainly demonſtrate it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57668:18"/>
is not any hearty Concernment for Religion, or the honour of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ingages you in theſe Methods,
but rather an invincible Deteſtation to Holineſs and Truth as
ſuch. Could you with the like Impurity, ſhut up our Church
doors, and revile our Liturgy, and caſt contempt on our Biſhops,
and all the other ſerious and hearty Officers of our Church, who
oppoſe and contradict you in your Luſts and wickedneſs, it is not
much to be doubted, but you would be as ſevere and Tyrannous
this way, as you be the other.</p>
            <p>If you have ſuch Love to the Church, why are you ſo mild and
favourable, and gentle towards the Papiſts, who are as great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the ſtate as to the Church? Why are you not for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe Laws executed which are in force, againſt Field and
Street walkers, and thoſe that haunt Ale-houſes, and Taverns,
and who are playing at Cards, or Dice, when they ſhould be at
Church? And thoſe who are rattling about in their Coaches, or
other ways Conveying themſelves from one place to another, on
the Lords day, and in time of divine Service, to perform ſome
idle and Sacrilegious viſits?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The methods you uſe are no way becoming the Church.
They will never do the Church any Service. Force and violence
will never ſatisfie mens Judgments. They will not extirpate
thoſe unjuſt Prejudices, People have ſuckt in againſt our Church,
but will rather Confirm them. Theſe Courſes will not fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
mens Scruples.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you ſhould force many to come within the Doors of
our Churches, by harſh and ſevere Proceedings, what is our
Church the better for this? Can you, together with outward
Compulſion, infuſe into their minds an affectionate Love to, and
unfeigned Approbation of our Service and worſhip? If not, you
may make our Church fuller of Hypocrites than ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but not fuller of real and Cordial Proſelytes; you may
turn the places for our publick worſhip into Priſons, if you pleaſe,
but you cannot by theſe mean's make the Diſſenters <hi>a willing
People in the day of your Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The members of the Church muſt be Volunteers, and not
Preſs'd men. Such as are forced will never do acceptable Service.
They will embrace the firſt Opportunity to relinquiſh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter

It has hitherto been the certain Property and Character of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox,
Heretical, Popiſh, and Anti-Chriſtian Churches
and People, to Perſecute and oppreſs others, or to uſe violent,
fierce, and ruining Courſes to advance themſelves and their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.
And it was the way of the pure Chriſtian Church, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and ſince the Reformation, to uſe no Methods with their
Enemies, but what were full of Reaſon, Scripture, Meekneſs, and
Chriſtian Forbearance.</p>

            <p>Theſe Courſes do not agree and ſuit with the Temper and

uſe theſe Methods, or countenance and incourage them who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
boiſtrous in them, are either ignorant of, and Strangers to
our Conſtitution, or implacable Enemies to our Church. Inſtead

            <p>It was one thing that did not a little Commend the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to the world, that after it's Eſtabliſhment in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tho Popery gained Power again in theſe Kingdoms, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
it's Profeſſors to treat the Proteſtants with all the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and outrage that Religion doth inſpire men with, or direct
them to, yet when in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign Popery was caſhier'd,
and the Proteſtants had the Power and Laws on their ſide, they
uſed no Violence, Fury, or revenge at all; <hi>Tho living in the midſt
of them, whoſe deareſt Friends and Relations they had Murdered, and
tho Proteſtants could ſay there goes he that burnt my Father, or he that
Murdered my Brother,</hi>

moſt inſolently and barbarouſly with her, yet when ſhe came to be their

had often in his Perſecution of them exceeded what the Law
allowed, yet this was not revenged upon him, no, ſo far were the
Reformers from doing any thing that might look like Revenge
that he was ſuffered to go about in ſafety, and was not made a
Sacrifice to the Revenge of thoſe who had loſt their next Friends
by his means.</p>
            <p>It was Peace, and Love, and Mercy, and Condeſcention and
Meekneſs, which brought Repute to this Church formerly, and
adorned it in it's moſt flouriſhing ſtate: And why ſhould you now
change it's ancient Methods, if your Love to it, be the ſame,
and your Zeal as Regular, as was that of our firſt and beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers?</p>

(whether they be of the Clergy, or in other places of Power)
who are continually Exciting people to inform againſt all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

over-heated already. They are caſt into too Violent a
ferment; And therefore rather then uſe any means to exaſperate
their Paſſions more, we ought all in our places, to do what we
can, to cool theſe hearts, and reduce men to more calm, and
gentle Tempers. Eſpecially ſhould this be the care and ſtudy of
them, who pretend they have a Right to that Character, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ill apprehenſions of the way you pretend to, in the minds of
the Soberer and more harmleſs ſort. Such kind of Preaching
will be Interpreted, but like clapping your Hands, and lowing

will be apt to drive them out of the Church-yard. St. <hi>Paul</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects

            <p>You have this day heard that your Neighbour-Proteſtants are in a

               </note> I
will lay before you the ſame Account, which is given of it, by the
moſt impartial, learned, and Celebrated Hiſtorian of this age. The
account is this.</p>
            <p>Thoſe born in the Communion of the Church of Rome are required not to
change their Religion, which was left free before. Schools and Colledges are
ſuppreſſed in moſt places. The Churches which the Proteſtants had in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57668:20"/>
Country or ſmall Towns, are generally raiſed, and all Religious meetings in
private houſes are forbidden. The Synods and Colloquies of their Clergy
are fordidden except a Popiſh Commiſſioner is preſent, the ſinging of Pſalms
is Prohibited. When they are ſick, they are forced to admit the Popiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
to come with Witneſſes to exhort them to change their Religion: no
Midwives are permitted to Practiſe but Papiſts, that ſo they may baptiſe
their Children,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>France,</hi> and the policy of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Fran.</hi> to deſtroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> upon which it may be afterwards pretended, if they continue
Proteſtants, that they are reliapſed, becauſe they were baptiſed by a Papiſt,
and the Puniſhment of this is Terrible. No Miniſter, Elder, or Deacon
may go and viſit their flocks, to confirm them in their Relgion, when they
are Wavering in it; Accuſations are brought upon the ſleighteſt Pretences
againſt the Miniſters or others that are noted for their Zeal in the cauſe of
Religion, upon which Orders for their impriſonment are eaſily given out, and
they are either forced to fly, or are ruined by a long impriſonment. And the
intendants of the Provinces oppreſs them moſt unmercifully, with deſign, as may
be eaſily gueſſed, to drive them into a Rebellion, that ſo a pretence may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to deſtroy them all at once. No Proteſtants can be admitted to any
Charge or Employment, how mean ſoever it be. Nor may they be received
to any Trading or Mechanical Corporation. And to take from them all
Confidence, or Credit in Trade, if any Proteſtant merchant turns Papiſt he
cannot be ſued for his Accounts, or Debts, for three years thereafter. And
theſe Orders are much heavier in the manner in which they are Executed.</p>
            <p>The preſent Proceedings in <hi>Poictu</hi> ſhew what the reſt are to look for, the
Mercenary Agents of Mr. <hi>Peliſſon</hi> prevailed ſo far on the Weakneſſes and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of many,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> p. 59.</note> as to draw them to adjure their Religion, but not a few of
theſe ſoon after repenting of that baſe Bargain, by which for a few Crowns,
they had ſold their Souls, and openly Expreſſing their Horror for it, were
clapt in Priſon, where they lye ſtill in great Miſery, only their Numbers are
ſuch that it ſeems it is not thought fit to proceed to Extremities againſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at once.</p>
            <p>But the Intendant of that Province, Mr. <hi>De Marilliac,</hi> whether directed
by ſecret Orders, or ſet on by the fierceneſs of his own Temper, or by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
is not known,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> p. 62.</note> is reſolved to take a ſevere Revenge of the reſt of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for the ſake of thoſe unhappy Relapſes, and has treated them not as Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Obedient Subjects, but as open Rebels, and declared Enemies. Their
Goods and their Houſes are Robbed, and their Perſons violently aſſaulted,
and all that, is done by the Intendants Order. The Soldiers under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
are lodged only in the Houſes of thoſe of the Religion, where they do
not only ruin their Hoſts, by the Exceſſive Charge they put them to, and by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57668:20"/>
the Contributions they exact from them, but uſe all the means they can think
of to frighten them out of their Religion; tho the horrid Oaths and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
they break out daily in, are but ill Arguments to perſwade Men to turn.
If they refuſe to go to Maſs they Cudgel them, they Drag the Women by the
Hair of the Head, with Ropes about their Necks, they Torture ſome with
their Screws, they bind Men of eighty years of Age, and abuſe their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
before their Eyes. And ſuch of the Souldiers as are not Guilty of
thoſe Cruelties, yet ſpoil and rob their Goods, and ſell them publickly, they
threaten them often with Death, if they will not change, having naked Swords
in their Hands, or holding Piſtols to their Breaſts. And if all theſe Means are
Ineffectual, then they carry them in Sheets to Churches, and fling Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on them, and tell them now they are made Catholicks, and if they
return again to their Hereſy, they threaten them, they will Accuſe them as
Relapſers. And when Houſe-keepers are by theſe Means quite Ruined, yet
they muſt not give up their Houſes, tho they can keep them no longer, but are
Fined 500 Livers if they quit them. And that which has always bin the
Priviledge of the Miſerable, is now denyed them, for when they come to
Complain of theſe Violences to the Intendant, He without hearing them, or
obſerving the common Forms of Juſtice, ſends them preſently to Priſon, and
keeps them ſtill there, without framing any Proceſs againſt them, and not
content with all this, tho it is ſcarce to be imagined what can come after it,
or riſe beyond it; when he heard that Complaints were made of theſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
to the King, he ſent upon that, his Officers to may of their Houſes,
to force them to Sign a Denial of the Truth of theſe Violences, which they had
Suffered.</p>
            <p>And that which aggravates their Miſery, and therefore renders
them more deſerving of our Commiſeration and Help, is, that they
are a People, who have done extraordinary Services for the Crown,
and could never yet be charged with any undutiful Demeanour to the
Government. And they have the ſame Rights and Priviledges with
the other Subjects, aſſured to them by as firm Edicts, and binding
Laws, as any by which that Nation is govern'd: And yet purely on
the account of their Religion, without the Guilt or Charge of any
Fault, and in direct Contradiction to thoſe Laws which were made,
and often Confirmed for their Security, are they now Perſecuted to
the Degree before mentioned.</p>
            <p>This ſhews that neither the beſt Services, the greateſt Innocence,
the higheſt Merits, nor the moſt Sacred and Solemn Tyes, Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Laws can ſecure a Proteſtant People from being treated as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57668:21"/>
the vileſt Criminals and Rebels, when under the Power, Influence and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Popiſh Bigotted Prince:</p>
            <p>6<hi>ly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6ly.</note> Which in the laſt place calls us all to prepare our ſelves for Perſecution.
What Clouds do hang over us? What Storms do threaten us! We are none of
us Ignorant of the Attempts which have bin made, and are ſtill carrying on, to
Supplant and Overthrow the Proteſtant Religion, and to bring in Popery amongſt
us, as an overflowing Stream.</p>
            <p>And that which greatly threatens our loſs of the Goſpel, and thoſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we have long enjoyed, is both the great and general Increaſe of Wickedneſs
and Debauchery amongſt us, and that too many of thoſe who have pretended to
deſire and endeavour our Security and Reformation, have ſet up for Atheiſm, or
at leaſt have declared themſelves Enemies to the Scripture, the Deity of
Chriſt, the publick Miniſtry, and all Ordinances. And it is not much
different whether we have our Bibles, our Services, and publick Adminiſtrations in
Latin, or whether we have none at all. Theſe things do Witneſs againſt us, and
unleſs we do throughout the Nation, ſet upon a ſerious and vigorous Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we may expect our <hi>Candleſtick will be removed;</hi> and that we ſhall either
be ſtript of all our preſent Enjoyments, or at moſt but Inherit the Name of them.
And if ſuch days do come, then all <hi>who will Live Godly, muſt certainly ſuffer
Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I at all doubt, but if either Popery, or Atheiſm, or both, have in theſe
Nations, the Countenance and Incouragement of a Prince, the very ſame Men
who are now Violent againſt Proteſtants, and pious People, will then with greater
Fury Perſecute, Oppreſs and Deſtroy all that will either own and worſhip God,
or reprove themſelves avowed Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſtudy the Scripture diligently, be thoroughly informed in the
Chriſtian Faith, get our Hearts raiſed to an unconquerable Admiration and Love
of the Bleſſed Jeſus. Let us take heed of placing too much Confidence on a
Natural Reſolution, or Humane Strength. Let us learn to reſign up our ſelves
entirely unto Chriſt; and Pray daily that we may not fear any of thoſe things
which we ſhall Suffer, but that we may be ſo ſtrengthened and aſſiſted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace, that we may approve our ſelves Faithful unto Death. Thus we
may attain to Inherit a Crown of Glory, which God of his infinite Mercy bring
every one of us unto, for the Merits Sake of Jeſus Chriſt, our Bleſſed and only
Saviour, and Redeemer, to whom with the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
