            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the same may we professe of our selves concerning you. And because at thus many hundred and some thousand miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, we cannot make known our true and great desire after you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> salvation by word of mouth, therefore we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to testifie the same by a few lines in writing, humbly desiring that for that purpose a word or two of Christian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in this way of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may not be unwelcome to any of you, but graciously blessed by the God of heaven unto you all, to those good ends which we intend therein.</p>
            <p>Indeed we could have wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (had it been the will of God) that as we were born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, and for some years have been Preachers of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Gospel in your coasts (though the weakest for such a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101225:3"/>
work, and the most unworthy of thousands we do acknowledge) so we might also have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live and to die together. For your Christian communion as long as we could enjoy the same, whether in publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies or private families was very dear unto us: and to this day in our conferences one with the other, we do often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the remembrance thereof with much comfort of heart. And when the iniquity of the times was grown to such an height, that amongst others, far more eminent lights, our selves also must be put under a bushell, and might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any publike employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to seek the salvation of your souls; yet God knows, and many amongst you, we doubt not, do remember how we could not leave your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101225:4"/>
nor depart out of your coasts, without much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection of heart and many tears, because you were dear unto us. And when that saying of the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.25. did come into our mindes (as it came into our mindes very often) you will scarcely beleeve how our hearts were affected at the remembrance thereof; considering with how little variation those words of his unto those <hi>Ephesians</hi> might be applied to our condition and yours at that time, when we did plainly perceive that most of you <hi>amongst whom we had gone preaching the Kingdom of God, in all likelihood should see our faces no more:</hi> which was unto us no small grief; Neverthelesse though we thus speak concerning our hearty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards you (which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101225:4"/>
was and is as much as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and very cordial in Christ Jesus) yet we would not be so understood, as if we were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our present place and portion; For we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that since our coming into this countrey (and the one of us hath been here above the space of ten years, and the other not much less then nine) that of all this time we have had one repenting thought of this transmigration of ours. True it is, we were most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing you may be sure to turn our backs upon our dear native countrey, and upon your selves in many respects. But those things which the wisdome and will of God had determined before, concerning our transportation into these Western parts of the world, he hath thus fulfilled: and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101225:5"/>
be his Name for the same; For whatever others say or think of <hi>New-England,</hi> we for our parts must both think and say as long as we have a day to live, that great was the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our God, that ever he was pleased to bring us hither. For considering what light of truth doth here plenteously and clearly shine forth, what Churches are here gathered and planted, with what liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and purity the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ Jesus are here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, by what Magistrates civill justice is here dispensed, and the Common-wealth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, how holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is countenanced and encouraged, and all known im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and iniquity prosecuted to condign punishment, both in Church and Common-wealth, in a word, considering what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101225:5"/>
means of grace and glory are here plentifully afforded, and peaceably enjoied, we must therefore needs say, that if it be not our own fault, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it go with others, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath been with us in times past, we may now be happy and blessed in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, both in this and in another world.</p>
            <p>And indeed we cannot but stand amazed at the free grace of God, and wonder with great admiration at that wise, and gracious, and holy dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine providence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to passe that such unworthy ones as we be, must be here in a land of peace, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the many good blessings of God, both for earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in quiet habitations, when in the mean time it fares full ill, God knows, with the land
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101225:6"/>
of our Nativity, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands therein far better then our selves, whom the Lord hath left after all their other pressures, under which they have formerly groaned, now at last, to see the most dolefull daies that they have ever seen in <hi>England,</hi> because that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly-flourishing Kingdom is now wofully at warre within it self, and that sore plague of the devouring sword (as sore an one as any of the four, which are thus called by the holy Ghost, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21.) hath already devoured much English flesh, and drunk much English bloud; many hundreds and thousands of all ranks and degrees, both great and small, since these warres begun, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already lost their lives, and ended their daiet in these grievous Nationall calamities,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101225:6"/>
and (God knows) how many more may shortly do the like, because for ought we can hear the wrath of the Lord is not yet turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. In regard whereof we may take up the complaint of the Prophet, and say,<note place="margin">Jer. 9.1.</note>
               <q>Oh that our heads were water, and our eyes were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of tears, that we might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of our people.</q>
For indeed we desire to bewail the sorrows, distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and distresses of that dear countrey where we were born, and wish we had hearts to do it more compassionately and effectually then these dull and dry spirits of ours can yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto; though we hope it is not our distance for the space of three thousand miles from that land, nor our absence from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101225:7"/>
thence for the space of nine or ten years, nor all the water that in all this time hath flown in this great Atlantick Ocean between <hi>England</hi> and us, that hath or ever shall wash away the thought and remembrance of <hi>England,</hi> and of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein out of our hearts, but that we shall preferre the comfort, peace, and prosperity of it and them, before our chief joys.</p>
            <p>And being thus minded, we hope you will give us leave out of that hearty affection and good will which we bear unto our Nation, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to you-ward, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you our dear coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen a few words of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian counsell and advice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some things which we deem conducible to your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comfort and salvation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101225:7"/>
which we so heartily long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and which advice is none other but the very same which we would wish to be given to ourselves, if our soul were in your souls stead.</p>
            <p>You have seen (right dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved) how the great Judge of the world, and King of the Nations, by a sore and long continuing warrre, for the space of seven or eight and twenty years together, or thereabouts, hath been afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Germane Nation for their sinnes: and how of late time he hath brought the like judgement even to your doors, in that distressed if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied Kingdome of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
and now you plainly see also that he will bear with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> no longer, but they also must drink of the same cup of bloud, whereof others have so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101225:8"/>
deeply drunk before. In which and other Kingdomes and countries that might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the dispensation of the Almighty is and hath been such, as if he were resolved
<q>
                  <hi>by</hi> fire and by sword to plead with all flesh,<note place="margin">Isa. 66.16.</note> and that the slain of the Lord shall be many.</q>
And we doubt not but many of you do well know the saying that is written,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.9.</note>
               <q>That when the judgements of God are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</q>
Yea truly, though his judgements were not upon our selves, but only upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet he would have us learn righteousnesse thereby, or otherwise it will be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our iniquity and impenitency, and a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; As it was against <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>

                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.20, 21, 22.</note> and his minde hardned in pride, was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from his Kingly Throne, and they took his glory from him, and he was driven from the sonnes of men, and turned out among wilde

beasts, and thou his sonne (<hi>O</hi> Belshazzar) hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est all this.</q>
Whereby we see it is very much displeasing to the Lord, and dangerous unto our selves, if we see and know the Judgements of God upon others because of their sinnes, and do not humble our selves, and turn from our iniquities, and fear before him that is so dreadfull and holy a God, and terrible, though righteous in his doings unto the sinfull sons of men. But if the calamities upon others should thus strike all our hearts with a holy fear in regard of our selves, how much more ought this fruit to be found in us, when the Judgements of God do fall upon our own backs? Surely at such a time the Lord consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth what courses he hath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101225:9"/>
taken with a people for their amendment, and is not a little displeased if his corrections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them be in vain: as you may reade at large, <hi>Am.</hi> 4.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <q>I have sent famine amongst you <hi>(saith the Lord)</hi> and yet you have not turned unto me: I have sent drought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, and yet you have not turned unto me: I have sent blasting and mildew, I have sent pestilence amongst you, after the manner of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and other judgements more there mentioned, and yet ye have not turned unto me.</q>
So that the Lord takes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what corrections he hath corrected men withall, and what amendment hath been wrought thereby, and if it be otherwise he is very much displeased that men should be so incorrigible, yea, in such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101225:10"/>
case the Lord will either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue such persons and people with more and sorer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>seven times and seven times more judgements, and one seven after another. till their uncircumcised hearts be humbled;</q>
or else he will utterly leave them, and give them up, as those whose case is incurable, and their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion desperate. For so we reade, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.5.
<q>Wherefore should you be smitten any more? for ye fall away more and more:</q>
which condition is exceeding fearfull and lamentable: But by all this you may see that when the judgements of the Lord are in the Earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon our selves or others, they that see them, or feel them, or hear tell of them, ought to learn righteousnesse thereby, or otherwise it is like
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101225:10"/>
to be worse for them. Sith therefore you have known the judgements of God which he hath brought upon <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> for many years together, and upon <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> of late times: God would be very angry if you should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impenitent, unhumbled, and unreformed, though you have known all this.

It is but too apparent, (the Lord knows) how the glorious and holy Name of God hath been impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously prophaned and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in that County by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of vain and wicked Oaths, in the mouths of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and mean men too, yea, and very children; how the holy Sabbaths of God which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101225:13"/>
he hath commanded to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for ever, and for that end hath bid us remember the same, have been greatly prophaned and polluted, not only by neglect of publick and private worship, whereby the same should have been sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but also by the contrary prophane and impious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in stead thereof, such as are carding, dicing, drinking, bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bear-baiting, shooting, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, dancing at greens, ales, may-poles, and such like. And when the licence for sports and recreations upon the Sabbath, came forth from <hi>Houghton</hi>-Tower, (to the lasting shame and infamy of the place and County where such an unhappy birth was brought forth) oh how gladly was the same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and embraced by multitudes of people in that

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101225:17"/>
any feeling of their need of Christ, any high prizing of him, any earnest longing for him, any true relying or resting on him. That it is incident to professors to offend in this kinde, is plain, by that which is written of the Pharisees,
<q>that they trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others,</q>
and accordingly one of them is brought in boasting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before God,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.9, 10, 11, 12.</note> that he was not like other men, he was no extortioner, no adulterer, no unjust person, nor like that Publican, but he fasted twice a week; he gave tithes of all that he possessed, and the like. And it is said of the nation of the Jews generally,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 3</note> 
               <hi>that</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101225:17"/>
to the righteousnesse of God.</q>
Which place doth also shew the dangerous condition of all such justitiaries in this respect, that being so full of their own righteousnesse, they submit not themselves to the righteousnesse of God, nor unto Christ Jesus <hi>who is the end of the Law, for righteousnesse to every one that beleeves.</hi> But of this you may be sure, that whatever a mans righteousness may be, unlesse he were one that had never sinned, he hath nothing in him that is of any worth for the present justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his person, nor for the everlasting salvation of his soul. For the text is plain, that

            <p>It may be you will say, We have no need to be told of this, for we are not Papists to hold justification by works, but do beleeve that justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by faith only without the works of the Law. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse we cannot think it needlesse for men to be put in minde of this matter, I partly because there are many (the Lord knows) in that dear countrey of ours, who disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themselves to be deeply
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101225:18"/>
tainted with this as well as other points of Popery; and partly because this Popery, this pride and self-love is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to all the sons of men, being a part of that originall sinne which is common to all as well as to those that make direct profession of popery; and therefore your selves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you were free from all originall corruption, are in danger of this relying upon self-righteousnesse as well as Papists; nay we fear (be it spoken without offence) that there are sundry amongst you that do so rely indeed, and though they be not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable in respect of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and prophanenesse, but professe a stricter and purer way, yet in very truth are in no better condition to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then others are as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101225:19"/>
utterly without part and portion in Christ Jesus. For the manifesting whereof, we hope you will easily grant, that whoever hath no more religion in him, but what might have been attained if Christ had never been, such an one, whatever relgion he may seem to have, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Christ, and in a state of death unto this day. And that so it is with many professors may appear by this; that trouble of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for sinne, and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, after that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler is all the religion that is found in many professors; for let a man attain to these two, to be stung in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his sinne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to take up a stricter course of life in the practice of good duties, as praier in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101225:19"/>

Whenas the truth is, all that is here mentioned, is no more then might be wrought by the Law though Christ Jesus had never come into the world. For a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration of the curses of the Law being threatned might produce the one, and the serious consideration of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Law being pressed &amp; urged might produce the other; but both the one and the other without Christ, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both the one and the other without salvation, sith there is no salvation without Christ.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (dear friends)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101225:20"/>
in the bowels of Jesus Christ we do beseech you, examine your selves whether it be thus with you or with any of you; ask your selves this Question, whether any Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall and saving work of grace and faith in Christ be yet wrought in your souls; or whether all that yet you have had experience of, doe amount to no more but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall affrightment and legall amendment? And if upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, any soul amongst you shall finde his condition to be no better then this that here we are speaking of, in the name of God, let such a soul be deeply humbled and repent in dust and ashes, for this amongst all his other sinnes, that he hath prized Christ no more, thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be rich and encreased
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101225:20"/>
in goods, and to have need of nothing, because of legall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mmon graces, not knowing how through want of Christ Jesus in his soul, he hath all this while been
<q>miserable, and wretched, and blinde, and poor, and naked.</q>
And let a man consider with himself, (and the Lord grant that he may consider it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously) that it is not all this humiliation and reformation that can make satisfaction to the justice of God for any one, though but the least of all his manifold transgressions, nor justifie his person in the sight of God; and therefore if he die in this condition, (which God forbid) he will certainly die accursed, and notwithstanding all his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profession of religion, his good estimation amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101225:21"/>
or the good opinion that he hath or hath had of himself, he will at death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly perish from the glorious and saving presence of God; because it is a most infallible and divine truth that must stand for ever, and all flesh shall finde it so; that
<q>he that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne hath not life, <hi>1 Joh. 5.12.</hi>

which was purchased for her by the price of his precious bloud; and lastly, it should grieve every Christian heart, in regard that many a soul (God knows) hath been endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to everlasting perdition, as by the rest of the corruptions fore-mentioned, so especially by that dumb and unfaithfull Ministery which hath been set over many a Congregation, the Lord having said that
<q>where vision fails, there the people perish; and if the blinde leade the blinde, both must fall into the ditch, <hi>Pro. 29.18. Mat. 15.14.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Unlesse therefore you will say (which we hope you doe abhorre to think) that though the corruptions brought in by the Prelacy and Hierarchy, have been the destruction of the souls of thousands, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101225:26"/>
have been most injurious to Christ Jesus your Lord and ours, and to his Church which he so dearly bought, yet all this is nothing to you, you have no reason to be affected with these things, unlesse (we say) you will thus carelesly passe over these matters of this high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and importance, we know not how you can satisfie your consciences in the sight of God, without a serious and deep lamenting and bewailing of the fore-mentioned corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Church-administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as any other ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the land. For sure it is, many have heretofore been deeply guilty of sinne in these things, and our dear Countrey of <hi>Lancashire</hi> hath had her part in this guilt as well as other places; yea, and ourselves (the Lord be mercifull to us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101225:26"/>
of this and the rest of our sins) have not been free when we lived amongst you from a great deal of ignorance and guilt in this kinde. In regard whereof we are now the more desirous to provoke our selves and our Christian acquaintance and friends to a serious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for these things; willing also by this means if it were the will of God to make some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of our defectivenesse in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of this kinde in times past, when (as we must needs acknowledge) we fell a great deal short of duty herein; but being now and long ago con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of the things afore-mentioned, we think it our duty both to lay the same deeply to heart, and to provoke our acquaintance to do the like. Wherefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, let it not seem a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101225:27"/>
small thing unto any of you, that there have been such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the house of God, and the administrations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But let every soul seriously learn to be ashamed in the sight of God, that men have
<q>set their posts by Gods posts, and their thresholds by Gods thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.</q>
Eze. 43.8. that is to say, their own inventions by Gods institutions. And if men be once ashamed of these things as well as of other their sins, then the Lord hath promised in this Scripture, <hi>Eze.</hi> 43.11.
<q>to shew them the pattern of his house, the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the Laws and Ordinances thereof.</q>
But there is no hope that men should ever come to see the beauty and comely order of a pure Church, and the holy things of God therein, unlesse
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101225:27"/>
they be humbled and ashamed of their own iniquities and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, as in other things, so also in this particular of mixing the devices of men with the holy institutions of God, which we heartily wish all the servants of God seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider and to lay to heart.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, we doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that your condition stands in need of consolation as well as exhortation, though we thus speak; For we have heard of sad and doleful things that have befallen that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as well as other parts of the Kingdom, by means of the bloudy distempers of warre wherewith the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the land. It hath been reported to us by printed Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantoes and by letters, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bloudy battels have been
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101225:28"/>
fought in your coasts, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Towns have been besieged and taken, many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in <hi>Lancaster</hi> and elsewhere burnt to the ground, many men robbed and plundered of their estates, many fain to fly from their houses and habitations for fear of the enemy, and glad to wander they and theirs for succour and relief where they could finde the same amongst strangers, that much bloud hath been shed at the battel at <hi>Houghton</hi> Common, at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Liverpool,</hi> of <hi>Bolton,</hi> and other places in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and such as have escaped with life have been forced to endure and undergoe much hardship and misery, though their lives have been given them for a prey. In regard of all which we confess you have need of cordials and comforts,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101225:28"/>
and oh that we had the skill to minister the same unto you in such sort as might be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing of your disconsolate hearts. But the best is, <hi>he that counts the wandrings of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and putteth all their tears into his bottle,</hi> he is able to comfort the comfortlesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, that have suffered for his sake, and will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do it in due time. In the mean season be entreated (dear Brethren, all you children of affliction) to stay your hearts a little from sorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, while we propound to your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration such grounds of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as we finde in the blessed book of the Scriptures of God, and which have been sanctified and blessed unto us through his grace, for the bringing of our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101225:29"/>
hearts to some measure of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et contentation and comfort in the saddest hours of affliction that have befallen us in the passages of our pilgrimage, from our first times until this day. Which grounds of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we trust the Lord may be graciously pleased to blesse in like sort unto your souls.</p>
            <p>First of all, All our afflictions in this world do not happen by chance, or meerly by the will of devils or men, but they are all such as our heavenly father hath appointed us unto; and as our Saviour sometimes said
<q>Shall we not of the cup that our Father hath mixed for us?</q>
Joh. 18.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that sometimes said,
<q>I have seen, I have seen the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of my people that is in Aegypt, <hi>Exod. 3.7.</hi>
               </q>
he is still the same allseeing and allsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101225:29"/>
God, and so beholds and observes all the sufferings of his servants, and all the injurious and outragious dealings of their enemies, <hi>Psa.</hi> 10.14 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor doth he only see our sufferings and no more but so, but also (such is his goodnesse) he doth sympathise with us in the same: so that our Lord and Redeemer in all our afflictions is afflicted with us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts our sufferings as his own. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Our heavenly father like a good Physitian doth never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his children willingly nor giveth them bitter potions to drink, but as it were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and being necessitated thereunto, when they in regard of some spirituall distemper or corruption doe stand in need thereof. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:101225:30"/>5. And to shew how unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he is of the sorrows of his servants, he saith he is angry but a little against them, but for their enemies that are so fierce and handle his servants so severely, he professeth to be sore displeased with them for this dealing of theirs, and for their eager minde to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their affliction, which he counts a going beyond their Commission. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The power of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enemies of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants is so limited by the Lord, that not the most malicious of men, nor yet any of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell can go one jot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his leave and commission, who as he hath set bounds to the sea, saying
<q>thus far shalt thou go, but no further, and here shall stay thy proud waves.</q>
Job. 38.11. Even so in like sort
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101225:30"/>
doth he restrain the rage and tumult of the wicked against his servants. <hi>Psa</hi> 65.7.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The afflictions of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are alwaies so ordered by the Lord, that for measure they shall not be immoderate, <hi>nor more then they are able to bear,</hi> Jerem. 30.11. 1 Cor. 10 13. nor shall they in the issue do them any hurt, but great good, both in purging out their sinne and corruption <hi>that they may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holinesse,</hi> Heb. 12.10. Isa. 1, 25. Joh. 15 2. <hi>and in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.29. and to the blessed Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Martyrs that have been before them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Lord doth not love his children ever a whit the lesse because they are afflicted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. but on the contrary is many times then nearest unto you, when they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101225:31"/>
are in greatest tribulation, and then affords unto them the most of his gracious presence, the most mighty support, most rich supply of patience and long-sufferance and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the sweetest glimpses and apprehensions of heavenly glory, with the most lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of future blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. &amp; 4.16. God was never nearer to the three Princes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. then when they were in the furnace, nor to <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in glorious vision of God, then when they were in captivity and banishment, nor unto <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> then when the stones came thickest about his head.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This is the common way in which all have gone that have gone to heaven, and why should we expect to be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly priviledged above all the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101225:31"/>
rest of the Saints, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be content to bear these things with patience,
<q>the same afflictions being accomplished in our brethren that are in the world, <hi>1 Pet. 5 9.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. All the sufferings of this life are but for a moment, for yet a little while, and <hi>he that shall come</hi> to work our perfect deliverance, <hi>he will surely come, and will not tarry,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. Heb. 10.37. And sure it is, that if our lives were the longest that ever any were, and that of all this time we should never see good day, yet all this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of eternity were such a nothing, that that eternall weight of glory will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompense us for the same. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
            <p>These and such like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of consolation against all the sufferings of the Saints
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101225:32"/>
in this world, we doubt not but many amongst you have been long ago taught of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.

            <p>And besides these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afore-mentioned, which are more generall, and applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whatsoever the Saints may be exercised withall in this life; there are sundry things in the ground and cause of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sufferings, as also in respect of the condition of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by whom you suffer, that may also be grounds of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to every sincere and Christian heart.</p>
            <p>As first of all, because the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101225:32"/>
war wherein you have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have suffered so great things, was not (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) offensive and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but meerly defensive and taken up upon necessity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise it could not have been avoided, but your estates, your wives, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, your liberty, your laws, yea, your very lives, and (that which ought to be dearer then your lives) the true Religion of Christ Jesus, these must all have been prostituted to the pleasure of Papists and other prophane and impious people, the sworn servants of Antichrist, and bloudy enemies of God and of the Kingdome; And therefore if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> spake to good purpose when he bad the rulers and people of <hi>Iudah</hi>

               </q>
your selves we doubt not may have comfort in your fightings, whatever you may hazard or loose therein, because you have as many relations and interests to fight for, and of as precious importance and concernment as any that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> doth there mention, and some of a great deal more, so that if any ask why you would engage your selves in this war, the events whereof have been to many so sad, such may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves if they will but consider what matters you had lying as it were at stake: and you may well answer in the words of <hi>David</hi> for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of your own and others consciences, "<hi>Was there not

Now inasmuch as your suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are sufferings for that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that worship and that government of the Church, which is prescribed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, against Popery and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and other corrupt inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, we therefore doe esteem the cause of them to be no other but the very cause of

God, and of his Christ: and so you may well claim a share in those consolations which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to those who suffer for the cause of God and for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse sake.</p>

Your brethrens bloud that is already poured out in this cause, you cannot tell how much good it may have done, and will doe, nor what good your selves may doe by your constancy.

And if your own present sufferings may produce the like effect (as why may it not?) we trust you will not so much sorrow for the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the things you suffer, as rejoice and be glad for the happy and sweet fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

For Popery (we trust) you so far do see the vanity and loathsomenesse thereof, that you will never decline nor turn aside thereto: but take heed of Arminianism, Familism, and all other erroneous doctrines, of which these daies are so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: especially take heed of the leaven of the Anabaptists: which (if we be not mistaken) is so dangerous and pernicious, and yet withall so contagious, and apt to spread in these daies, that we scarce know any other, of which Christians had so much need to take heed, and to be advertised and exhorted so to do.

testimony of our love, and so we hope you will take it, that we advise you to beware lest you also or any of you be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with that or any other error, and fall from your own stedfastness. Love one another, and cleave together in firmness of Christian and cordial affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The enemies of the truth are not so weak, nor you so strong, that there can be any need of your dissentions and divisions for the weakning of your selves or the strengthning of them.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>Divide &amp; impera.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them and make your selves Masters of them all, is one of <hi>Machiavels</hi> principles, and a most perillous one it is. It will be your wisedom to take heed lest the Jesuites should practise the same design amongst you, whether among your military Commanders or otherwise,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101225:41"/>
your safety and strength under God doth in great part consist in your unity and agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selves; Beleeve the truth when it is held forth unto you either in books and private discourse, or specially in the publike Ministry, &amp; <hi>receive it in the love of it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.11.</note> that you may not be deluded with lies. Content not yourselvs with literal knowledg in the brain &amp; head, but chiefly look after spirituality and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, and manifest and shew forth the same by the power of godlinesse in all your conversation. What upon sober and serious consideration you shall finde your selves shall have most need of another day, whether the day of death or the day of judgement, or any other day of deep distresse, of that (if you be wise) doe you chiefly make your choice now:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101225:42"/>
and what will be most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable then, do you now aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; And to apply this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the day is coming and not far off neither, when the favour of God through Christ Jesus, true interest to his speciall love, as reconciled through the bloud of his son, with the amiable and sweet light of his countenance, will be of more worth to the soul, and yield more satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the heart, then all that this world can afford, from the rising of the Sunne to the going down thereof. Yea, the day is coming when these things will all be miserable comforters and physitians of no value, but those other will then be found to be of such absolute alsufficiency to the soul, as that he shall be most happy for ever that hath them, and of such necessity that he shall be most wretched and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101225:42"/>
that shall live and die without them. Wherefore we beseech you, consider wisely what now you have to doe, and now with <hi>Mary</hi> make choice of the better part, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be taken from you. Choose the Lord God in Christ for your portion, and the lot of your inheritance; choose not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way of sin, or errors, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for your God, for they are no Gods: but now make a choice (and the Lord direct you so to doe) that you may have the comfort of the same here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and for evermore.</p>
            <p>We doe not think our selves to be the only Prophets, nor that we only are able to give a word of counsel or comfort to our countreymen: we trust we are so far conscious to our own weaknesse, that such arrogant apprehensions are far from us.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101225:43"/>
Nor doe we doubt but <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> is blessed of God with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faithful and able Watchmen, who are continually blowing the trumpet in your streets, and imparting the message of the Lord amongst you, much more suteably to your condition, then we at so many miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance can possibly do, of whom we have no other thoughts but that the meanest of them might adde much unto either of us. But because we dearly love our Countrey, though we live not in it, therefore we think it meet to seek the weal thereof in the best manner we are able, and we hope we may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so to doe. We also consider, that sometimes the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may give as great a blessing to weaker means, as to those that are more excellent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, that so himself and not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101225:43"/>
the means, may have all the glory. Finally, we are both of us well stricken in years, and posting on apace towards our dissolution, and never like to see your faces, nor you to see ours in this world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are willing to doe this office of love unto your souls, conceiving it may be the last that we can do unto you in this kinde before we die: and glad we should be if you may have the Lord Jesus Christ, and the things that concern your own peace in remembrance after our decease. Upon these and such like considerations we have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to do as here you see, hoping our sincere and loving intentions will be accepted in good part. For which we desire no other recompence at your hands, but the benefit of your praiers on our behalf, and this
