            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

importunitie (rather to preuent the
wrong that by imperfect Copies prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to satisfie such as were earnest sutors

Notes to a friend, (with reference of

not in common vse of Speech,
which is the Emperour of Words,
My Conscience tels mee I did or
did not such a thing, which is an
Action of the Memory? My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
bids mee doe, or forbids
me to doe this or this, which is
but an Action of the Will: It
smites mee, it checkes mee, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
or it torments mee: what
are these but Actions of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
recoyling vpon the Soule?
But if any list to contend about
these subtilties, <hi>Conscience</hi> tells
them, it hath no such custome.
<hi>Conscience</hi> falsely so called, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to languish about Questions
not tending to Edification; Let
vs rather turne our eyes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and wonder at the Diuine
royalties and endowments of it,
it being in man the principall part
of GODS Image, and that by
which Man resembleth most the
<hi>Autarchie</hi> and selfe-sufficiencie of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20112:15"/>
GOD, which I graunt is proper
to his Infinitenesse, to be content
and compleat within it selfe: but
vnder him, and with his leaue
and loue, this Facultie makes man
selfe-sufficient and independant of
other Creatures; like vnto those
selfe-mouing Engins, which haue
their Principle of Motion within
themselues. Thus, <hi>Adam</hi> when hee
was alone, was not yet alone &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
but might conuerse with this
his Conscience, as well as with a
thousand Companions and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God hath giuen it
more force and power to worke
vpon men, then all other Agents
whatsoeuer: It being internall and
domesticall, hath the aduantage
of all Forraigne and Outward.
Man in this respect being like to
the Earth, immoueable of all the
windes, though at once they
should blow from all the points of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20112:15"/>
the Compasse, yet easily shaken
by a vapour from within: whence
it is that the Approofes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes
of it, are so powerfull and
terrible, the one chearing more
then any Cordiall, the other gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then any Chest-worme;
tormenting worse then hot Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
boyling Caldrons, Rackes,
Strappadoes, or what other the
cruelty of Tyrants hath inuented.
If one had Angels daily ascending
and descending, as <hi>Iacob</hi> had to
comfort him, it were not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
or if langold or coupled
to Diuels, no more terrible.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it being indiuiduall

they prosper and flourish in the

Creditors with their debters:
whiles they are in trading and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
say nothing to them, but if
once downe the winde, in sicknes,
crosses and pouerty, then Arrest

then come the Fowles of the Aire
and seaze vpon the sicke Soule, as
the Rauens vpon sicke Sheepe,
write bitter things against them,
and make them possesse the sinne

Businesse also and Cares

And such Consciences are

then my Conscience. If any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
say to any man, hee hath
no sinne, it lyes in the throate, and
is a Lyer. <hi>Adam</hi> onely had such
a Paradise, such a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
walking with God, without
sinne, without feare, in the state
of Innocencie. There is but one
way now to come to it: our peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is now to be had by Mediation and
Reconciliation; being iustified by
Christs bloud wee haue this peace.
In stead of many, marke one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
place of Scripture for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20112:22"/>
this purpose. If you aske what
makes a good Conscience, there is
but one thing in the world will
make it, <hi>Hebr. 9. 14. The bloud of
Christ once offered by his eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
without fault, purgeth our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
from dead workes.</hi> Yea, so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
is the force of this bloud,
that it leaues no more conscience
of Sinne within it.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 2.</note> This Lambe
takes them away, and carries them
out of Gods remembrance into
the Wildernesse of Obliuion. If
thy Conscience rage as the Sea,
Christ cast into it, as <hi>Ionas,</hi> whists
all the waues of it. If the Law make
it as Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> couered with
darknesse, the Gospell calmes and
lightens it presently. If tossed as
the Ship where the Disciples say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the night, hee rebukes the
Windes, and they are still: if the
Diuels rend and rage in it, he casts
them out presently.</p>
                     <p>The Iaylor came in trembling,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20112:22"/>
ready to fordoe himselfe, <hi>Beleeue
in Christ,</hi> sent him out leaping and
reioycing. It's strange how freely,
effectually, and speedily hee quiets
all. Oh all ill Consciences, heare
and beleeue; this is the honour,
royalty, and peculiar dignitie of
Christs bloud, to pacifie and make
good our Consciences! I doe not
so much admire at all his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
healings of Diseases, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pries,
Blindnesse, and Lamenesse,
Daemoniackes of all sorts, as I
doe at his gracious and sodaine
quietting of the Conscience of
<hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> of
<hi>Paul;</hi> and so the like vertue this
bloud hath still, to day and ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
the same. Nothing else in
the world hath this vertue saue
his bloud: all other merriments
haue no more power to quiet
Conscience, then Holy-water and
Charmes to coniure the Diuell.</p>
                     <p>I finde in a French Comedie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20112:23"/>
one brought in as troubled in
Conscience for sinne, and he runs
vp and downe like a Hart with
an Arrow in the side, for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
hee buyes a Pardon, runnes
to Shrift, whips himselfe, goes on
Pilgrimages; and all this while, like
an Aguish man that drinkes water,
or leapes into a Poole, his disease
increaseth; then fals hee to seeke
merry company, to see if hee can
play away his trouble; but like
<hi>Sauls</hi> ill spirit, it returnes with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
violence, &amp; brings seauen worse
with it to torment. In the end hee
findes Christ, or rather is found of
Christ, and so findes peace, &amp; this is
the good Conscience we speake of,
to which being in Christ, there is no
Condemnation, no Accusation.
Wouldst thou purchase a good
conscience at an easier rate? wouldst
thou haue it for sleeping? When
thou hast tried al conclusions, come
hither &amp; buy salue for thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

here is that which will doe it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and proue, and thou and thy
Conscience shall be safe and quiet:
this is approued, thus <hi>Paul</hi> got his.
Yea, but is this all? Is it so cheape
and easie athing? May we now sing
a <hi>Requiem</hi> to our Soules, lay the
reynes on our neckes cast care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and doe what we list? I feare
not such an obiection from a true

                     <p>Let me not daube your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

Faith as it pacifieth, so it purifieth
Conscience. Christ purgeth our
consciences to serue the liuing <hi>God,</hi>
and after all his cures, bids the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

against such Consciences,
which I omit to rehearse, least as
<hi>Abners</hi> body, they hinder the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

stands not with a purpose

against sin. He is a foole and
a vaine mocker, no true penitent,

                        <hi>Titus,</hi> a Trades-man or Lawyer
here present, happily is desirous to
haue peace of Conscience, is sorry
for his oathes &amp; frudulent courses
this week past, but knowes he shall
fall to the like the week comming,
hates them not, and meanes not to
striue against them, but to returne
to the myre, my Text saith not to
him, <hi>Goe in peace,</hi> to such loose and
licentious Consciences that make
Christ a bawd of sinning, &amp; Faith
a cloak of liberty. I haue heard that
the Pope hath sold a Pardon for a
Murther past, with a dispensation
annexed for the next.: but Christ
my Lord and master (as bountifull
&amp; gracious as he is) grants no such.
If he forgiue that which is past, hee
giues at least so much Grace, as to
deny vngodlinesse for the time to
come. To conclude this point; thou
desirest a good conscience, without
indending or conditioning, I bid
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20112:25"/>
thee beleeue in Christ, &amp; thou hast
one; yet take this, not into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but as an after prouiso: Art
thou willing to haue a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and to be assured thereof,
here follow foure infallible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
and marks of a good one,
which I desire you to mark atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
and by them to try your
Consciences throughly. Hitherto
I haue shewed how you may get
one: now how you may proue
one. Here are foure Elements or
humors, which well compounded
&amp; mixed, make vp a perfect health
of Conscience: if any one be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or faile in a iust measure or

the first in euery good action, that

It implyes first; that hee that
hath a good Conscience, doth
not onely doe well, but wills to
doe well, doth it voluntarily, not
forcedly, or out of externall and

principle, a sanctified and
rectified will, which God accepts
for the deede, and aboue the deed.
Secondly, that he doth not onely
wish and faintly desire, which
Translation may flatter an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
that hath some sluggish lusts
and some sodaine good pangs
and moodes, and such as for the
time little differ in sicknesse and
starts from a regenerate will: but
the word notes a strong and setled
resolution, a constant purpose, and
such as produceth endeuour. Hee

through with many sorrowes,
where the same word is vsed; I
graunt it is <hi>Carnificina,</hi> a racke to
a good Conscience, to say, It must

it's a true ground of comfort, to
say, that a will and purpose is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
testimonie and approofe of
a good one: but then it must be
meant, not euery languishing and
lazie flash of euery wisher and
woulder, but of a willer; and this
word is equal with the other two,
which are good Synonimaes and
Glosses vpon this, vsed by <hi>Paul,

                     <p>It may be said of some, They

imperfect Essayes and profers, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

Sanctified Will may be crossed,

Humane, of Charitie and Piety,
whatsoeuer is done for Gods sake
and for Conscience sake, is done
equally: No man makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of one, but hee that doth
of all: hee that delights in the
breach of one Commandement,
hates all the rest. The rich and
precious boxe of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is polluted and made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
if but one dead Flye be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
I say not, if one Flye of
Infirmitie light in it, against
the will fore-mentioned, but if
with our will it lye, and dye, and

                        <hi>Maries</hi> conscience, hee casts

yea, hee leaues not one of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
remaining, not one spot of
Leprie in any one member, but
saith, <hi>Faith hath made thee whole.</hi>
Here I see many fall short, and I
pitie to see so many ciuill men and
hypocrites to come so neere the
Kingdome of heauen and a good
Conscience, and yet one thing is
wanting. Foolish <hi>Herod,</hi> that doest
many things and stickest at one:
Foolish <hi>Ananiah,</hi> that spilst and
losest all thy cost with a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.
Foolish hypocrite, why
takest thou paines to climbe so
high on the hill of Piety, and yet
for one step of iniustice to thy
neighbour, ascends not into Gods
Mountaine, though thou commest
often into Gods Tabernacle. Thou
ciuill honest man, why giuest thou
Almes, liuest fairely with man, and
forgettest the maine, art so farre
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20112:28"/>
short of this <hi>All things,</hi> that thou
forgettest that which should be
all in all, that is, Pietie to God?
Vniuersall and Catholicke obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is the best distinguishing
Touchstone of trueth and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
of good &amp; bad Consciences.
This Vniuersality must also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to great and small duties. I
say Vniuersality, not equality: A
good Conscience mainely desires
to please God in the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
as Christ cals them,
and then in euery complement, in
euery hoofe and naile, so neere as
he can, yet obseruing a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
It most of all straines at
grosse sinnes, yet swallowes not
Gnats. It trembles a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Wounds and
Blood, feares Faith and Troth. It
abhorres Adulterie, hates Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
It payes Tithe-sheaues care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
it detaines not Tithe, Mint,

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20112:29"/>
faults must be wincked at; and in
this sence may well be said to be
scrupulous, because it being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feeles scruples: onely here I
lay a Caueat, that it be not erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or ignorantly dubious and
scrupulous, like the wall-eyed or
bird-eyed Horse, that starts vpon
euery shaddow without occasion

vnfainedly in all things to
walke honestly, I giue them these
solemne charges.</p>
                     <p>First, that they study the peace
of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that they study their
liberties.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that they be humble
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20112:29"/>
towards God and their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and willing to illuminate and
regulate their Consciences by the
Word, and be established in what
they are to doe, not admitting eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
feare of the contrary without
ground, yet remembring <hi>Pauls</hi>
rule, to follow the <hi>Dictate</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
rather then of Angell, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
or Prelate, yea of Apostle.
For, after the Apostle had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
that, in the 14. to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
he yet requires in the Eater
a <hi>Plerophorie,</hi> and blesseth him that
doth it with consent of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and makes all other Sinne a
Sinne against Conscience, being
worse then a Sin against Man, yea,
next to the Sinne against the Holy
Ghost. An erronious Conscience
holds the Wolfe by the eares,
bindes to the Act, frees not from
the fault: Oh therefore labour to
get a Salue, and thinke not your

with the beauty and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
of his Spouse, and they
often mutually inuite one another
to walkes and feasts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, which is more, in the
faile of all other comforts; yea, in
despight of the greatest discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and disgraces that can be, in
the greatest stormes and stresse, in
the foulest weather, this Shippe
raignes and rides at Anchor, as in
a Harbour and Lee, hangs out the
Flag of comfort and defiance. Let
the Iewes thinke and speake what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20112:37"/>
they will, it stirs not <hi>Paul:</hi> he soares
like an Eagle, not respecting the
chitting of Sparrowes; is aboue the
scourges and razors of tongues.</p>
                     <p>I am much taken vp with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when I reade <hi>Acts</hi> 27. How
<hi>Paul</hi> in the angry <hi>Adriaticall</hi> Sea, at
midnight, when the tempestuous
<hi>Euroclydon</hi> blew, after fourteene
daies want of meat and light, when
the Marriners despayred, how
couragious he was: but I wonder
as much and more, to see his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
passe with top-saile &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
displayed, through the Sea
and waues of good report and bad
report; to see him singing &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at midnight in the Dungeon,
all manacled &amp; fettred, in a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
skinne, but whole and merry
Conscience.</p>
                     <p>Censures and rumors, the world
is full of: who escapes? Not <hi>Paul</hi>
himselfe; yet is aboue them, and
giues a secret <hi>Item</hi> to all such as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20112:38"/>
censure him, that they wronged
him in iudging a good Conscience.
The fashion is, to iudge and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all courses wee reach not, or
sauour not; and so we smite many
a good Conscience. In this respect
what neede haue wee all of good
Consciences, seeing tongues spare

                     <p>There be three dayes especially,
the day of Sicknesse, of Death, of
Iudgement; in which Comfort is
worth a world, and then all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts and comforters, like
run-away Seruants and drunken
Seruing-men, are to seeke when
one hath most vse and neede of
them, as <hi>Iob</hi> complaineth of the
Brooks of <hi>Teman</hi> in the drought of
Summer: which makes the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of the wicked (<hi>Iob</hi> 20.) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany,
and as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ght Vision,
when as the Prophet said, <hi>One
dreames of bread, and wakes hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.</hi>
In these times you shall see the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20112:38"/>
merry and iolly worldling hang
the head like a Bul-rush, and the
Ruffians brags lagge like a starcht
Ruffe in a storme. How doe such
droope, euen in old age, and say, the
dayes are come, wherein there is
no pleasure? The storme comes
after the raine, that which is worst,
an ill Conscience like a Blood-hound
hunts dry-foot, and brings
the scent of sins of his youth; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Conscience of a well-passed
life is the staffe of age, <hi>Pabulum se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile,</hi>
better then all the Sacke and
Sugars, and such pittifull comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
When the stomacke failes, and
the grinders waxe few, and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
ceaseth, this is a continuall
feast. In the decay of sleepe, this is a
Downe-pillow. In all our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this <hi>Simon</hi> helps vs to beare
our crosses. In all our euill daies, it's
at hand. It sustaines the infirmities
of the body. When Princes sat in
counsell against <hi>Dauid,</hi> this was his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20112:39"/>
                        <hi>Ionathan</hi> to solace him. When the
Lyon roares, the righteous is bold
as the Lyon, and feares not what
man can doe vnto him.</p>
                     <p>But if once Death begin to looke
vs in the face, how doth <hi>Naball</hi>
dye like a stone? How doe <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi>
and <hi>Iudas</hi> dye the death of
cowardly Harts and Hares, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the full cry of their sinnes,
which makes them dead in the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
before they dye: then a kingdome
for a good Conscience. Then send
(as in the Sweating sicknesse and
the Plague) for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Minister, but
alas he is come, hee can but speake
to the eare, and all in vaine, vnlesse
God open the Conscience to heare
and be quiet, to heare and imbrace
comfort. But when speech failes, &amp;
all thy Senses shut vp their doores
and windowes, then who or what
can auaile but a good Conscience?
When thy Wife &amp; thy friends doe
augment thy griefe with parting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20112:39"/>
and loath to depart, as <hi>Pauls</hi> friends
broke his heart with weeping; then
this onely and alone dies, or rather
liues with thee, and seeing Land
approaching, bids thee be of good
comfort. More cheerefully haue I
seene it make some dye, then other
wed.</p>
                     <p>All the Martyrs from <hi>Stephen</hi> the
Proto martyr, down to the last that
suffered, are clouds of witnesses: it
hath inabled them to imbrace their
stakes, clap their hands, leape, as
Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> did, within two stiles
of the stake, or (as hee said) of his
home and Fathers house.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, at the Last day, and after
the last day, when all these sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
shall flye away, this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
shall abide. A good Wife is
a good thing, but <hi>Sarah</hi> must part
with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and these relations
shall cease in Heauen, but a good
Conscience, attended with good
workes, shall follow: and the better
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20112:40"/>
it hath beene here, the better in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
it shall be there, the wider en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
and entertainment it shall
finde there. When all Bookes shall
perish, and Heauen melt like a
Parchment scrole, this Booke shall
be of vse; when all Diuels and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
shall tremble, and wish the hils
to couer them, this shall lift vp thy
head, for thy redemption approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
when neither friends, nor a full
purse shall pleade, nor the wicked
stand vpright in iudgement, then,
then, well-fare a good Conscience;
then shal conscience haue it mouth
opened, tongue vntied, &amp; God will
bid it speake. Happy hee then that
hath an excusing one, miserable he
that hath it an accusing aduersary.</p>
                     <p>Yet still further: Faith and Hope
are excellent things here in this
valley; these shall cease, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
abides. A good one was a
petty heauen vpon earth, a mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> a glimpse of glory here: a bad
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20112:40"/>
one was a Hell, a Purgatory, or
Limbo, at the least, tasting of the
flashes and smoak of hel: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

the ioyes of the other.
Without this worm that dies not,
hell should not be hel; without this

be heauen. Next the happy vision
of God shall be the company of a

                     <p>Besides, if you would heare vs,
wee are Strangers to your secrets,
to your hearts and wayes; we are

compounded by an Oculist, of whom as I

Next vnder the sacred Fountaine of
light (the light of our Israel) I worthily
accompt your Lordship most sufficient in
law to accept, to make vse, to iudge, to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize

principall obiect of your Office, to elect,
direct and correct inferiour Magistracy.
To which purposes, Nature, Literature

should faile the worlds expectation, they
will hardly trust any other in hast. Many
in rising haue followed the stirrop, pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered

But your Lordship had neuer
any other graces them your birth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;
to which, hereditary dignity hath
so gently tendred it selfe, that you haue
not let fal your name of religion in getting

be exactly honourable. For my part,
