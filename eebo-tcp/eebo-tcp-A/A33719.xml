         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter my humble dutie remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, &amp;c. In my laſt, not by the laſt Poſte, but by the Poſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I certified you what then had been done by our Armie abroad; and that night our Lieutenant Generall came home, and all the Armie (bleſſed be God) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſafe and well. And have not ever ſince been forth but once, <hi>viz.</hi> on Saterday laſt Sir <hi>Simon Harecot</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Collonel, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and twenty horſe, went forth to view the Countrey ſix miles from this Citie toward the County of <hi>Wicklowe,</hi> and eſpying ſome Rebels made toward them: whereupon the Rebels fled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves unto the Caſtle of <hi>Kilgobbon,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63842:3"/>
where our horſemen watching them that none ſhould get forth, ſent hither for aid. And there was preſent aid ſent them about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and Horſe, and that night they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Caſtle, the next day there was (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sunday the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) ſent unto them two peeces of Ordnance to batter the Caſtle: and after 21. ſhot made, it was very hardly won; but in placing the ordnance, Sir <hi>Symon</hi> being directing how it ſhould be done, was ſhot in the left ſhoulder, and on Monday laſt he died; And with him was ſhot Lieutenant <hi>Cooke</hi> dead in the place, and Serjeant Major <hi>Berry,</hi> both which came over the laſt week with the 400 Fire-locks out of <hi>England,</hi> and with them were about ten more of our men loſt, Serieant Maior <hi>Berry</hi> is yet living, but not like to recover. And that night was the Caſtle wonne, and about two hundred men, women and children in it (of the Rebels) ſlain, and that night our men blew up the Caſtle with powder, ſince which we have had no further proceedings here. On Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt the 28 news came from Sir <hi>Henry Tichborne,</hi> that he had taken <hi>Dundaulke,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63842:3"/>
it is credibly reported of all, that he hath ſlain eight hundred men in the taking of it, and hath recovered in <hi>Dundawlke,</hi> three peeces of ordnance, and about thirtie thouſand pounds in money, plate, and goods for pillage. He wonne before that <hi>Ardee,</hi> and ſet a gariſon there, and another in <hi>Bewly</hi> Caſtle. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he ſlew ſince he went from <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath</hi> eleven hundred men with the loſſe of a very few men; and he would now go for the <hi>Newry,</hi> where is the chief Magazine that the Rebels have, and moſt of their Treaſure, but that he wants men; for the whole Armie of his was but three thouſand; of which, part were left to keep <hi>Tredath,</hi> part at <hi>Bewly</hi> Caſtle, part at <hi>Ardee,</hi> and now if he leave a Gariſon alſo at <hi>Dundawlke,</hi> he will not have men enough to go againſt the <hi>Newry,</hi> for that is a ſtrong place. Thus hath God proſpered that man, for he is a good man; we cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly heare what ſtrength they have on our ſide in the North, nor what my Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Mounſter</hi> hath done, I am afraid it goes hard with our friend there. We heare that my Lord Preſident of <hi>Connaugh</hi> is forſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63842:4"/>
to retire to the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone.</hi> And that divers Caſtles where our friends are, are hard beſieged, and that the Caſtle of <hi>Gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell</hi> is ſurrendred upon compoſition, where our Ladie <hi>Affa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y</hi> kept, but not with the ſafetie of all their lives that were in it. The nineteenth inſtant came my Lord <hi>Dunſany</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſubmitted himſelf, and is in the Caſtle, and his ſonne, aud ſome other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with them; We are yet in great ſtraight for moneyes, and I am afraid we ſhall be in as great want of Corne ſhortly, except we have good ſupply out of <hi>England,</hi> for our Armie burnes all before them, and we are not ſtor'd before-hand, but from hand to mouth. It is yet ſomewhat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe men have not money to ſtore up any, and for feare of burning: ſome quantitie ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

At <hi>Tredath</hi> they have a very great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and betweene this and that the way reaſonable cleare; but on <hi>Wicklowe</hi> ſide, to the Southweſtward, the Rebels are in great number, I think our Armie goes that way

ſhortly. Thus with my humble dutie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and my love to my brother <hi>John Cole,</hi> and ſiſter his wife, and the reſt of my brothers and ſiſters, I take leave. Reſting ever,</p>
