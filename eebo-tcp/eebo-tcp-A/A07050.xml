            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The third tricke is, what Apes by flattering waies</l>
               <l>Cannot come by, with biting they will snatch:</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Martin</hi> makes no bones, but plainlie saies,</l>
               <l>Their fists shall walke, they will both bite and scratch.</l>
               <l>He'il make their hearts to ake, and will not faile,</l>
               <l>Where pen cannot, their penknife shall preuaile.</l>

               <l>But this is false, he saith he did but mocke:</l>
               <l>A foole he was that so his words did scan.</l>
               <l>He only ment with pen their pates to knocke:</l>
               <l>A knaue he is, that so turnes cat in pan.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Martin</hi> sweare and stare as déepe as hell,</l>
               <l>Thy sprite thy spite and mischeuous mind doth tell.</l>

               <l>The thing that neither Pope with Booke nor Bull,</l>

               <l>Our <hi>Martins</hi> here at home will worke at full;</l>
               <l>If Prince curbe not betimes that rabble rout.</l>
               <l>That is, destroy both Church, and State, and all;</l>
               <l>For if t'one faile, the other néedes must fall.</l>

               <l>Thou <hi>England</hi> then whom God doth make so glad,</l>

               <l>Take heede least thou at last be made as sad,</l>
               <l>Through <hi>Martins</hi> makebates marring, to thy paine:</l>
               <l>For he marres all, and maketh nought, nor will,</l>
               <l>Saue lyes and strife, and workes for <hi>Englands</hi> ill.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>And ye graue men that answere <hi>Martins</hi> mowes,</l>
               <l>He mockes the more, and you in vaine loose times:</l>
               <l>Leaues Apes to dogges to baite, their skins to crowes,</l>
               <l>And let old <hi>Lanam</hi> lash him with his rimes.</l>
               <l>The beast is proud when men wey his enditings:</l>
               <l>Let his worke go the waie of all wast writings.</l>

               <l>Now <hi>Martin,</hi> you that say you will spawne out</l>
               <l>Your broyling brattes in euery towne to dwell;</l>
               <l>Wée will prouide in each place for your route</l>
               <l>A bell and whippe, that Apes do loue so well.</l>
               <l>And if ye skippe and will not wey the checke,</l>
               <l>We'il haue a springe and catch you by the necke.</l>

               <l>And so adiew mad <hi>Martin</hi> marre the land,</l>
               <l>Leaue off thy worke, and more worke, hear'st thou me?</l>
               <l>Thy work's nought worth, take better worke in hand:</l>
               <l>Thou marr'st thy worke, &amp; thy worke will marre thée.</l>
               <l>Worke not a newe, least it doth worke thy wracke,</l>

               <l>And haue alreadie rimde thée staring mad.</l>
               <l>But if thou ceasest not thy bald iests still to spread,</l>
