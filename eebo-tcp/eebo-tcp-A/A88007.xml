            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my laſt of the eighth inſtant, I acquainted you with
the News in theſe parts touching the proceedings of
the Navy at Sea, under his Excellency General Blake:
for your further information in what hath hapned ſince
his departure hence, take this. The 13 inſtant, the wind
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118423:3"/>
ſerving very fair for his purpoſe, he ſet ſail from hence
to meet with the Dutch, who (as he was informed) were
returning homewards, with a very ſtrong guard of Men
of war to ſecure them from our Fleet. His Excellency
(being in the Reſolutiou) with great Reſolution and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
ſailed headmoſt of the Fleet, the whole Fleet chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bearing up after him; and being come in ſight of
the Dutch, prepared themſelves for the fight, making
ſuch a ſhout that it ſeemed to have thundred: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſomewhat nearer to them, was deſcried by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
whoſe hearts began to melt, and their courage fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they declined engagement; but our Heroick General
would not loſe ſo fair an opportunity, but cloſely purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, forcing them to a diſpute, maugre the haſt they
made to eſcape away. The conflict was hot for about
the ſpace of two hours and an half, after which time our
General became victorious, ſunk four, and took many
of their Men of war; I have not yet the exact particulars
of this fight, but it is ſaid, that he hath taken above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all good ſtout ſhips, which carry ſome thirty, many
fourty Guns a piece. Whileſt his Excellency was thus
engaged, the enemies Fiſhermen endeavoured to eſc<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe
from us, but our men perceiving it ſome of our ſhips
made after them with all ſpeed, and notwithſtanding all
the haſt they made, ſeized upon an hundred ſail of them,
wherein they found Fifteen hundred men, which (as I
hear) they intend to ſend into Harbours in theſe parts.
Thoſe that eſcaped, have ſecured themſelves in a Harbour
or Iſland belonging to this Country, called Breſſies Bay;
they think to fortifie themſelves there, but I hope they
will be prevented. His Excellency purſued the remainder
of the enemies Fleet, who having got off, ſailed up the
Sound, where he now rides with his fleet. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the Sound, the Danes fearing an invaſion, beat
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118423:3"/>
up their Drums and roſe up in arms, preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to withſtand the landing of any that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. But General Blake to prevent all miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſent a Letter to the King; wherein he deſireth his
Majeſty, <hi>That he would be pleaſed to prohibit the Dutch to
remain in his Harbours, and to give no Protection to them,
being the known and open Enemies of this Common-wealth;
but to command them to put forth to Sea, and to depart out
of his Ports and Harbours; which if his Majesty pleaſe to
do, there ſhould not any Hoſtility in the leaſt be offered to any
within his Dominions.</hi> Whether his Majeſty will agree
to this we know not, but it is conceived that he will, by
reaſon that he is in Treaty with the Parliament of the
Common-wealth of England.</p>

            <p>THeir Majeſties are ſtill at Ponthois, and there are
but few forces left there for the guard, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not above two thouſand ſouldiers in all, the
Marſhal de Seneterre is come with ſome forces from
Lorrain, and is joyned to Marſhal de Thuren near Noyon.
The death of the Lord Mancini Nephew to the Cardinal
Mazarine, hath much grieved the King and Queen, and
other of the favourites, being dead three days ſince of his
wounds that he had at St. Anthony gate of this city; the 20
inſtant the Parliament being ſate in the Chambers aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
the buſineſs which for ſo many days before was in
debate, was paſſed, being a ſubſtance to conſtitute the
Duke of Orleans Lievt. Gen. of the Kingdome during the
Kings reſtraint; alſo to appoint the Prince of Conde as
Generalliſſimo, and the Duke of Beaufort his Lievt. Gen.
with a ſtrict command to all perſons his Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to obey the ſaid Duke of Orleans his orders and no
others, forbidding all Receivers, Treaſurers, Farmers,
not to pay any money but by the ſaid Dukes order and
direction, as it is at large contained in the ſaid Arreſt or
Decree two days ago, the Parliament alſo ordered, that
ſuch goods as yet remain to be ſold of the Cardinals
ſhould be ſold without delay, to make up the 50000
Crowns for the reward of him or them, that will bring
the Cardinal alive or dead. The Princes is ſtill quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Suburbs of St. Victor, they are not very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118423:4"/>
and ſo are not in a capacity to attempt any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
buſineſſe; the dearth of proviſion is not ſo great in
this City as it hath been, the price being much abated.</p>
            <p>The Parliament hath paſſed an order that the ſentence
paſſed the 20 inſtant ſhall be imparted to all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and other high Courts of Judicature, that ſo they
may ratifie the ſame and confirm it, giving each of them
a ſentence to the ſame effect, it is doubtfull what will be
the ſucceſs, ſome Parliaments ſtanding affected for the
Prince and ſome for the King, among them is the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Brittany, and that of Daulphine, beſides the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of Roan, which is much divided; the Province
of Normandy ſeeing the Court within their borders,
hath therefore proffered a very large ſum of mony, that
they may be excuſed of quartering any ſouldiers, and be
oppreſſed with the like evils. The City of Rochel is ſtill
blocked up by ſea, the Duke of Vendoſme with his Fleet
not yet appearing for their relief. The City of Barcelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
is ſtill cloſe beſieged, and little hopes of any relief from
France, ſo that it is thought the Ctty will be yeelded up
ere long.</p>
            <p>Fhey write from Bourdeaux that the Marqueſſe of
Liſignam is gone from hence with ſome forces to Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to retake that place from the Kings forces, but at his
arrivall he found the work already done; they began to
batter the Caſtle with three pieces of Ordnance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken it by ſtorm, all thoſe within it found in arms,
were all put to the ſword. The Count d'Harcourt is
with his forces before Villanova, which he hopeth to
take in few days, at this leagure he hath been like to be
killed with two musket ſhot, but both did miſſe him,
onely pierced his hat.</p>

by here 5 or 6 days ago, he had a very fair wind till he
came near our road, but then the wind turned full againſt
him, ſo that he was conſtrained to put in to us for a little
ſpace, and then taking the benefit of the tide, he bore up
again to Sea-ward, and by night got clear of Bembridge
point. His putting in here, was ſurely a ſpecial act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
though it was contrary to his intent; for that the
Councel of State had ſent letters to him, which came here
an hour before night, and ſo were inſtantly ſent to him,
and the boat was within a league of them by night, in our
ſight; the wind yet favours not his purpoſe, but continues
almoſt South-weſt, and yet he is reſolved not to anchor,
but to tide it Weſtward higher, where I hope God will
make him inſtrumental for his praiſe, as he hath formerly
been in thoſe parts. Pyrats infeſt theſe parts very much,
