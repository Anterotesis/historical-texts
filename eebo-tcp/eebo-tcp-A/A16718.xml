            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it was the language of all the Isles in the Aegaean sea; of all those Ilands I say, that are

And specially I find the North coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> euen as farre as <hi>Trebizond,</hi> to haue bin exceedingly well stored with them. But, it may be further obserued likewise out of histories, that not onely al the maritime part of <hi>Anatolia</hi> could vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and speake the Greeke tongue, but most of the inland people also, both by reason of the great traffique, which those rich Countries had for the most part with Grecians, and for that on all sides,

the East onely excepted, they were inuironed with them. Yet neuerthelesse, it is worthy obseruing, that albeit the Greeke tongue preuailed so farre in the Regions of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> as to be in a manner gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet for all that, it neuer became vulgar, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished the vulgar languages of those Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt at this day, the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue is very much decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not onely as touching the largenesse, and vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, but also in the purenesse and elegancy of the language. For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, First, in <hi>Italie, Fraunce,</hi> and other places to the West, the naturall languages of the countries haue vsurped vpon it. Secondly, in the skirts of <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe, namely in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and that part of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that lieth towards the <hi>Adriatique</hi>

sea, the <hi>Sclauonique</hi> tongue hath extinguished it. Thirdly, in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> the <hi>Turkish</hi> tongue hath for a great part suppressed it. And Lastly, in the more Eastward, and South parts, as in that part of <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> that is beyond the riuer <hi>Piramus,</hi> in <hi>Siria, Palesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Libia,</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it: Abolished it I say, namely, as touching any vulgar vse, for, as touching Ecclesiasticall vse, many Christians of those parts still retaine it in their Leiturgies. So that, the parts in which the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue is spoken at this day, are (in few words) but these. First <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe (excepting <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,</hi> and the West part of <hi>Macedon.</hi>) Secondly, the <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Aegaean</hi> sea.

            </p>
            <p>But as I said, the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, is not onely thus restrained, in comparison of the ancient extention that it had, but it is also much degenerated and impaired, as touching the purenesse of speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouergrowne with barbarousnesse: But yet not without some rellish of the ancient elegancie.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ordinary bounds of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire were, on the East part <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Tigris:</hi> On the North the Riuers of <hi>Rhene</hi> &amp; of <hi>Danubius,</hi> and the <hi>Euxine</hi> sea: On the West the Ocean: On the South the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in the vtmost border of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and in <hi>Afrique</hi> the mountaine <hi>Atlas.</hi> Which, beginning in the West, on the shoare of the Ocean, ouer against the <hi>Canarie</hi> Ilands, runneth Eastward almost to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> being in few places distant from the Mediterrane sea, more then 200 miles. These I say, were the ordinary bounds of that Empire in the Continent: for, although the Romanes passed these bounds sometimes, specially toward the East and North, yet they kept little of what they wan, but within those bounds mentioned, the Empire was firmely established. But heere, in our great Isle of <hi>Britaine,</hi> the <hi>Pictes</hi> wall was the limit of it, passing by <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>Carleil,</hi> from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> on the East sea, to <hi>Solway</hi> frith on the West, being <note n="*" place="margin">Spartian. in Hadriano &amp; in Seuero.</note> first begunne by the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> and after finished or rather repaired, by <hi>Septimius Seuerus.</hi>

beginnings were indeed, considering the huge do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to which she attained. For first, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Cittie wall, at the first building of it, by <hi>Romulus</hi> in Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> could not be fully one mile: for the Hill it selfe, as is obserued by <hi>Andrea Fuluio,</hi>

And that within these bounds, it stretched farre and wide, (in such maner as I will afterward declare) two Principall causes there were. One was, the multitude of colonies, which partly to represse rebellion in the subdued Prouinces, partly to resist forrain inuasions, partly to reward the ancient soldiers, partly to abate the redundance of the City, &amp; relieue the poorer sort, were sent foorth to inhabite in all the Prouinces of the Empire: Another, was the donation of <hi>Roman</hi> freedome, or Communication of the right and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of <hi>Romane</hi> Citizens, to very many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, both Cities, and Regions. For first, all <hi>Italie</hi> obtained that freedome in the time of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Appian. l. 1.

               <note place="margin">Dion. l. 41.</note> But not long after, the forraine Prouinces also, began to be infranchized, Fraunce being indued with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Roman Citizens by <hi>Galba,</hi> as I find in <hi>Tacitus;</hi>

            <p>These two as I haue said, were the principall causes of inlarging that language: yet other there were also, of great importance, to further it. For first, concerning Ambassages, suites, appeals, or whatsoeuer other businesse of the Prouincials, or forraines, nothing was allowed to be handled, or spoken in the <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the Latine tongue. Secondly, the Lawes whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces were gouerned, were all written in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as being in all of them, excepting onely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall Cities, the ordinarie Roman law.

Fourthly the generall schooles, erected in sundry Cities of the Prouinces, wherof we finde mention in <hi>Tacitus,</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6757:21"/>
when <hi>Rome</hi> was become a Monarchy, and in the flourish of the Empire) great care to inlarge their tongue, together with their dominion, is by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Ciuitate Dei,</hi>

               </note> for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and at their suite, that they might publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse the <hi>Romane</hi> tongue, not fully 140 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the Emperours: And yet was <hi>Cuma</hi> but about 100 miles distant from <hi>Rome,</hi> and at that time the <hi>Romanes</hi> had conquered all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Sicilie, Sardinia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet in all the Prouinces of the Empire, the <hi>Romane</hi> tongue found not alike acceptance, and successe, but most inlarged and spread it selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, and West, and South bounds, for first, that in al the regions of <hi>Pannonia</hi> it was known <hi>Velleius</hi> is mine Author:<note place="margin">Vellei. lib. 2.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it seemeth the sermons of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> yet extant, (of <hi>Augustine</hi> it is manifest) that they preached to the people in latin. But in the East parts of the Empire, as in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and so likewise in <hi>Afrique,</hi> from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Syrtis</hi> Eastward, I cannot in my reading finde that the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue euer grew into any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vse. And the reason of it seemes to be, for that in those parts of the Empire it became most frequent, where the most, and greatest <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6757:22"/>
were planted. And therefore ouer all <hi>Italy,</hi> it became in a maner vulgar, wherin I haue obserued in Histories, and in registers of ancient inscriptions, to haue beene planted by the <hi>Romanes</hi> at seuerall times aboue 150 Colonies: as in <hi>Afrique</hi> also nere 60, (namely 57) in <hi>Spaine</hi> 29. in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as it stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Rhene</hi> 26, and so in Illyricum, and other North parts of the Empire, betweene the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> sea, and <hi>Danubius</hi> verie manie. And yet I doubt not, but in all these parts, more there were, then any historie or ancient inscription that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines hath remembred.</p>
            <p>And contrariewise in those Countries, where fewest Colonies were planted, the Latine tongue grew nothing so common: as for example heere in <hi>Britaine,</hi> there were but foure: those were <note n="1" place="margin">Eboracum</note>

            <p>And indeede, how hard a matter it is, vtterly to abolish a vulgar language, in a populous country, where the Conquerers are in number farre inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the natiue inhabitants, whatsoeuer art bee practized to bring it about, may well appeare by the vaine attempt of our <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour: who although he compelled the <hi>English,</hi> to teach their young children in the Schooles nothing but <hi>French,</hi> and set downe all the Lawes of the Land in <hi>French,</hi> and inforced all pleadings at the Law to be performed in that language (which custome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till King <hi>Edward</hi> the third his daies, who disanulled it) purposing thereby to haue conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the language together with the land, and to haue made all <hi>French</hi>: yet, the number of <hi>English</hi> farre exceeding the <hi>Normans,</hi> all was but labour lost, and obtained no further effect, then the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

of a few <hi>French</hi> words with the <hi>English.</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such also was the successe of the <hi>Franks</hi> among the <hi>Gaules,</hi> of the <hi>Gothes</hi> among the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and may be obserued, to be short in all such conquests, where the Conquerors (being yet in number farre inferiour) mingle themselues with the natiue inhabitants. So that, in those Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries onely the mutation of languages hath ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon conquests, where either the ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants haue beene destroyed or driuen forth, as wee see in our Country to haue followed of the <hi>Saxons</hi> victories, against the <hi>Brittains,</hi> or else at least in such sort diminished, that in number they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inferior, or but little superior to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, whose reputation and authority might preuaile more then a small excesse of multitude. But (that I digresse no further) because certaine Countries are specially alleaged, in which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> tongue is supposed most to haue preuailed, I will restraine my discourse to them alone.</p>
            <p>And First, that both the <hi>Punique</hi> and <hi>Gallique</hi> tongues, remained in the time of <hi>Alexander Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the Emperour (about 230 yeares after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours birth) appeareth by <hi>Vlpian,</hi> who liued at that time, and was with the Emperour of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall reputation, teaching, that <note n="*" place="margin">Digest. l. 32. lege.

            <p>And as for these reasons it may well seeme that the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue became not the vulgar language in any of these parts of the Empire, which yet are specially instanced, for the large vulgarity of it So haue I other reasons to perswade mee, that it was not in those parts, nor in any other forraine Countries subiect to the Empire, either generally or perfectly spoken. Not generally (I say) because it is hard to conceaue, that any whole Countries, specially because so large as the mentioned are,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6757:27"/>
should generally speake two languages, their owne natiue and the <hi>Romane.</hi> Secondly, there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie law at all of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to inforce the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations, either to vse vulgarly the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, or not to vse their owne natiue languages (and very extreame and vnreasonable, had such Lords bene, as should compell men by lawes, both to do, and to speak, only what pleased them.) Neither doe I see any other necessitie, or any prouocation, to bring them to it, except for some speciall sorts of men, as Merchants, and Cittizens, for their better traffique and trade, Lawyers for the knowledge and practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, which carried force through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Empire (except priuiledged places) scholers for learning, souldiers, for their better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing with the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions, and with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> Trauailers, Gentlemen, Officers, or such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as might haue occasion of affaires and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Romans.</hi> But it soundeth altogether vnlike a truth, that the poore scattered people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the Country, dwelling either in solitarie places, or in the small townes, and villages, either generally spake it, or could possibly attaine vnto it.

            <p>Which opinion if it were true, the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue must of necessitie haue it beginning about the 480 yeare of our Sauiour: Because, at that time, the Barbarous nations began first to inhabite <hi>Italie,</hi> vnder <hi>Odoacer,</hi> for although they had entred and wasted <hi>Italie</hi> long before, as first, the <hi>Gothes</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Alaricus,</hi> about the yeare 414: Then the <hi>Hunnes</hi> together with the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and the <hi>Herula,</hi> and the <hi>Gepidi,</hi> and other Northerne people

began to crie out, <hi>torna, torna,</hi> and so fell to flying away.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> tongue, if that afore mentioned were the cause of it, began a little before, in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the 3, when in a maner, all the West part of the Empire fell away, (and among the rest, our Country of <hi>England,</hi> being first forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Romans</hi> themselues, by reason of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous warres at their owne doores, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conquered and possessed by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whose posteritie for the most part we are) namely, about the yeare 450: <hi>Fraunce</hi> being then subdued, and peaceably possessed, by the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Burgundions</hi> nations of <hi>Germanie:</hi> the <hi>Burgundions</hi> occupying the Eastward and outward parts of it, toward the riuer of <hi>Rhene,</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> all the inner region.

            <p>Whereby you may see also, when the <hi>Romane</hi> tongue began to degenerate in <hi>Afrique,</hi> (if that also, as is supposed spake vulgarly the Latine tongue and if the mixture of barbarous people were cause of the decay, &amp; corruption of it) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about the yeare 430, for about that time, the <hi>Wandali</hi> and <hi>Alani,</hi> partly wearied with the <hi>Gottish</hi> warre in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and partly inuited by the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> entred <hi>Afrique,</hi> vnder the leading of <hi>Gensericus,</hi> a part whereof for a time, they held quietly, for the Emperour <hi>Valentinianus</hi> guift: But shortly after, in the same Emperours time, when all the West Prouinces in a maner fell vtterly away
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6757:30"/>
from the Empire, they also tooke <hi>Carthage</hi>; and all the Pronince about it, from the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the dominion of <hi>Afrique</hi> was regained by <hi>Bellisarius</hi> to the Empire almost 100 yeares after, in <hi>Iustinians</hi> time, yet in the time of the Emperour <hi>Leontius,</hi> (almost 700 yeares after our Sauiours birth) it was lost againe, being anew conquered, and possessed by the <hi>Sarracens</hi> of <hi>Arabia</hi> (and to this day remaineth in their hands) bringing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their victories, the language also, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (<hi>Mahumetanisme</hi>) into all that coast of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi> euen from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the Strait of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> aboue 2000 miles in length.</p>
            <p>About which time also, namely during the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the 3. <hi>Bulgaria, Seruia, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scina, Hungarie, Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, Bauaria</hi> and <hi>Sueuia</hi> (that is, all the North-border of the Empire, along the riuer <hi>Danubius</hi>) and some part of <hi>Thrace,</hi> was spoiled and possessed by the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> who yet principally planted themselues in the Lower <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi> whence it obtained the name of <hi>Hungarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of which discourse you may obserue these two points. First, what the Countries were, in which those wandring and warring nations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many transmigrations from place to place, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last their finall residence and habitation. Namely the <hi>Hunnes</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> the <hi>Wandales</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi> the East <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Langbards</hi> in <hi>Italie</hi> the West <hi>Gothes</hi> in <hi>Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which being both originally but one Nation, gained these names of East and West <hi>Gothes,</hi> from the position of these Countries which they conquered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6757:31"/>
the other barbarous nations of obscurer names, being partly consumed with the warre, and partly passing into the more famous appellations. And Secondly, you may obserue, that the maine dissolution of the Empire, especially in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> fell in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 450. being caused by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations of the North (as after did the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the same Empire in <hi>Asia,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> in the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> about the yeare 640) and together with the ruine of the Empire in the West by the inundation of the foresaid barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Latine tongue in all the Countries where it was vulgarly spoken (if it were rightly spoken any where in the West) became corrupted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if the <hi>Spanish, French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> tongues, proceeded from this cause, as a great number of learned men, suppose they did, you see what the antiquity of them is; But to deliuer plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my opinion, hauing searched as farre as I could, into the originals of those languages, and hauing pondered what in my reading, and in my reason I found touching them, I am of another minde (as some learned men also are) namely, that all those tongues are more auncient, and haue not sprung from the corruption of the Latine tongue, by the inundation and mixture of barbarous people in these prouinces, but from the first vnperfect impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and receauing of it, in those forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Which vnperfectnesse notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue in those parts, although it had, as I take it beginning from this euill framing of forraine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6757:31"/>
tongues, to the right pronouncing of the Latine, yet I withall easily beleeue, and acknowledge, that it was greatly increased, by the mixture and coalition of the barbarous Nations. So that me thinkes, I haue obserued three degrees of corruption in the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, by the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating whereof, these languages are supposed to haue receaued their beginning. The first of them, was in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, where, towards the latter end of the Common wealth, and after, in the time of the Empire, the infinite multitude of seruants (which exceedingly exceeded the number of free borne Citizens) together with the vnspeakeable confluence of straungers, from all prouinces, did much impaire the purenesse of their language, and as <hi>Isidore</hi> hath obserued brought manie barbaris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and solaecismes into it. Insomuch, that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in his time,<note place="margin">Isidor. Origin. l. 9. c. 1. Tertul. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologet. adu. Gentes cap. 6.</note> when as yet none of the barbarous nations had by inuasion touched <hi>Italie</hi> (for he liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder <hi>Septimius Seuerus</hi> gouernment) chargeth the <hi>Romanes</hi> to haue renounced the language of their fathers. The Second steppe, was the vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect impression (that I touched before) made of the <hi>Romane</hi> tongue abroad in the forraine prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among straungers, whose tongues could not perfectly frame to speake it aright. And certainely, if the <hi>Italians</hi> themselues, as is remembred by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> failed of the right and perfect <hi>Romane</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation,<note place="margin">Cicer. l. 3 de Oratore.</note> I see not how the tongues of strange Nations, such as the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Spanyards</hi> were, should exactly vtter it. And the Third, was that mixture of manie barbarous people (to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6757:32"/>
attribute the beginning of the languages in question) which made the Latine, that was before vnperfect, yet more corrupt then they found it, both for words and for pronouncing: So that, I rather thinke the barbarous people to haue beene a cause of increasing the corruption, and of further alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and departure of those languages from the <hi>Romane,</hi> then of beginning them. And me thinkes I haue very good reasons so to bee perswaded bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all the arguments abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the auncient writers (and they are many) which haue written of the miserable changes, made in these West parts of the world, by those infinite swarmes of barbarous people, I finde not one, that mentioneth the change of any of these languages to haue beene caused by them: which me thinkes some auncient writers among so many learned, as those times, and those very Countries, abounded withall, and whose writings yet remaine, would certainely haue recorded. But though wee finde mention in soundrie auncient writers, of changing these languages into the <hi>Romane</hi> (whom yet I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of that vnperfect change before touched) yet nothing is found of any rechanging of those
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6757:32"/>
languages from the <hi>Romane,</hi> into the state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in now they are. But it is become a question onely of some late searchers of Antiquitie, but of such, as determine in this point, without either sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or good countenance of Antiquitie.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese reasons perhaps (ioyned with the other aboue alleaged whereby I endeauoured to prooue that the latine tongue perfectly spoken, was neuer the vulgar language of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prouinces) may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you as they haue done mee, that the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations of the north, were not the first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of the latine tongue, in the prouinces sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Rome, nor the beginners of the <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> tongues: yet some difficulties I finde (I confesse) in writers touching these points, which when I haue resolued my opinion will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more credible.</p>

            <p>A third, how it falleth if these vulgar tongues of adulterate latin be so ancient, that nothing is found written in any of them of any great antiquity?</p>
            <p>A fourth, how in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Latium,</hi> where the Latine tongue was out of question, natiue, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin could so degenerate, as at this day is found in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, except by some forraine corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>To the first of these I answere, either that as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines are wont to interpret many generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, <hi>Plutarch</hi> is to be vnderstood <hi>de generibus sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum,</hi> not <hi>de singulis generum:</hi> So that the latine tongue was spoken almost in euery nation, but not of euery one in any forraine nation: Or else, that they spake the latine indeed, but yet vnperfectly and corruptly, as their tongues would frame to vtter it.</p>
            <p>To the second I answere: first, that <hi>Strabo</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not generally of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> but with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to certaine parts of both, the Prouince of <hi>Narbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the tract about <hi>Boetis</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Secondly, that although they speake it, yet it followeth not, that they speake it perfectly and aright, (except perhaps in the Colonies) so that I wil not deny but it might be spoken abroad in the Prouinces, yet I say it was spoken corruptly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the peoples tongues would fashion to it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6757:33"/>
namely in such sort, that although the matter and body of the words, were for the most part latine, yet the forme and sound of them varied from the right pronouncing: which speech notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was named <hi>Latin,</hi> partly for the reason now touched, and partly, because they learned it from the Romanes or Latines, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call their language <hi>Romance</hi> till this day, which yet we know to differ much from the right Romane tongue:<note place="margin">Nithard. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To the third I answere, that two reasons of it may be assigned: One, that learned men would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write, in the learned and grammaticall, then in the vulgar and prouinciall latine.

            <head>Of the ancient Languages of Italie, Spaine Fraunce and Afrique. CHAP. VII.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt if the discourse of these points of Antiquitie, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof I haue declared, that while the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire flourished, it neuer abolished the vulgar languages, in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Afrique,</hi> howsoeuer in <hi>Italie.</hi> If that discourse I say, mooue in you perhaps a desire, to know what the ancient vulgar languages of these parts were: I will also in that point, out of my reading and search into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, giue you the best satisfaction that I can.</p>
            <p>And first for <hi>Italie:</hi> Certaine it is, that many were the ancient tongues in the seuerall Prouinces of it, tongues I say, not dialects, for they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. In <hi>Apulia,</hi> the <hi>Mesapian</hi> tongue: In <hi>Tusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> and <hi>Vmbria,</hi> the <hi>Hetruscan,</hi> both of them vtterly perished:<note place="margin">Inscript. ver. pag. 143.144.145.146.</note> Yet in the booke of ancient Inscriptions, set forth by <hi>Gruter,</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> there be some few monuments registred of these languages, but not vnderstood now of any man. In <hi>Calabria</hi> both the higher and lower, and farre along the maritime coast of the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> sea, the <hi>Greeke.</hi> In <hi>Latium</hi> (now <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi>) The <hi>Latine.</hi> In <hi>Lombardie,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6757:36"/>
               <hi>Liguria,</hi> the old tongue of <hi>Fraunce</hi> whatsoeuer it was. Of which last three, the two former are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceased to be vulgar: and the third, no where to be found in <hi>Italie,</hi> but to be sought for in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countrey, And although, beside these fiue, we find mention, in ancient writings of the <hi>Sabine,</hi> the <hi>Oscan,</hi> the <hi>Tusculan,</hi> and some other tongues in <hi>Italie,</hi> yet were they no other then differing dialects of some of the former languages, as by good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, out of <hi>Varro, Festus, Seruius, Paul. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus,</hi> and others, might be easily prooued.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of <hi>France</hi> what the ancient tong was, hath bin much disputed, and yet remaineth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vncertain; Some thinking it to haue been the <hi>Germane</hi> others the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and some the <hi>Walsh</hi> tong. But,<note place="margin">

But, to omit the speech of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth to haue had much affinitie with the <hi>Spanish</hi>: And, of that part, (in <hi>Caesar</hi> called <hi>Belgia</hi>) that at the riuer of <hi>Rhene</hi> confined with <hi>Germanie,</hi> which for that neighbourhood, might partake much of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tongue: To omit those I say, the maine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, about the language of the <hi>Celtae,</hi> which as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the middle part of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> were least of all infected with any forraine mixture.

Secondly, it seemeth to be so by <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. in Iulio Agricola.</note> writing, that the speech of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> little differed from that of the <hi>Brittaines.</hi> And thirdly, by <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caes l 6. de Bel.

            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue as now it is, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of the old <hi>Spanish, Latine, Gottish,</hi> and <hi>Arabique</hi> (as there is goood reason it should, <hi>Spaine</hi> hauing beene so long, in the possessions of the <hi>Romanes, Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Mores</hi>) of which, the latine is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part, (next it the <hi>Arabique</hi>) and therefore they themselues call their language <hi>Romance.</hi> And certainely I haue seene an epistle written by a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> whereof euery word was both good <hi>Latine</hi> &amp; good <hi>Spanish,</hi> &amp; an example of the like is to be seene in <hi>Merula.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Merul.

Now the ancient and most generall language of <hi>Spaine,</hi> spoken ouer the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6757:37"/>
before the <hi>Romanes</hi> conquest, seemeth to mee out of question, to haue beene, the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> tong, that namely which yet they speak in <hi>Biscay, Guipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoa, Nauarre,</hi> and <hi>Asturia,</hi> that is to say, in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne and mountainous parts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> neare the <hi>Ocean,</hi> with which the <hi>Vasconian</hi> tongue also in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaine,</hi> neere the <hi>Pyrene</hi> hilles, hath as there is good reason (for out of those parts of <hi>Spaine</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Gascoigne</hi> came) much affinitie and agreement. And my reason for this opinion is, that in that part of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the people haue euer continued without mixture of any forraine nation as being neuer subdued by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> nor by the <hi>Mores,</hi> no, nor by the <hi>Romans,</hi> (for all their long warring in <hi>Spaine</hi>) before <hi>Augustus Caesars</hi> time, and for the hillinesse, and barenesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasantnesse of the Countrey, hauing nothing in it, to inuite strangers to dwell among them. For which cause, the most ancient Nations and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are for the most part preserued in such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes: as by <hi>Thucydides</hi> is specially obserued,<note place="margin">Thucyd. l. 1. paul. a princip.</note> of the <hi>Attiques,</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> dwelling in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren soiles: Of which nations the first, for their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, vaunted of themselues that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the second, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they had beene bred immediately of the Earth, or borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moone. Another example whereof wee may see in <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe, for in the steepy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Granata,</hi> named <hi>Alpuxarras,</hi> the progeny of the <hi>Mores</hi> yet retaine the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue (for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it <hi>Arauiga</hi>) which all the other remnants of the <hi>Mores</hi> in the plainer region had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6757:38"/>
forgotten, and receiued the <hi>Castilian</hi> (till their late expulsion out of <hi>Spaine</hi>) for their vulgar language. The like whereof, is also to be seene in the old <hi>Epirotique</hi> speech and nation, which yet continueth in the mountainous part of <hi>Epirus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for the tongue) vtterly extinguished in all the Country beside. And (to let forraine instances goe) in the <hi>Brittaines</hi> or <hi>Welsh-men</hi> in the hillie part of our owne Country. What the reason thereof may be, I will not stand now curiously to enquire: whether that being inured to labour, to watching, to sundry distemperatures of the aire, and much other hardnesse (for otherwise their liuing will not be gotten of such barren ground) they prooue vpon occcasion good and able souldiers? Or, that the craggie rockes and hilles (like fortresses of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures owne erecting) are easily defended from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine inuaders? Or that their vnpleasant and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse? soile, hath nothing to inuite strangers to desire it? Or, that wanting richesse, they want also the ordinary companions of richesse, that is proud and audacious hearts, to prouoke with their iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries other nations to be reuenged on them, either by the conquest or desolation of their Countries? But whatsoeuer the cause may be, certainely in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect so it is, that the most ancient Nations and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, are for the most part to be found in such vnpleasant and fruitlesse regions: Insomuch that the <hi>Biscaynes</hi> who gaue me occasion of this digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vaunt of themselues among the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that they are the right <hi>Hidalgos,</hi> (that is gentlemen) as some also report of the <hi>Welsh-men</hi> heere in <hi>Brittaine</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:6757:38"/>
to say of themselues, which yet I that am their neighbour, (to confesse a truth) neuer heard them say.</p>

            <p>Of the great spreading &amp; inlargement of which religion, if the causes were demanded of mee, I should make answere, that beside the iustice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, punishing by that violent and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sect, the sinnes of Christians (for we see that by the conquests of the Arabians, and Turks, it hath cheefly seased on those regions, where Christianity in ancient time most flourished, both in Afrique and Asia, and partly in Europe) one cause J say, of the large spreading of their Religion, is the large spreading of their victories. For it hath euer beene the condition of the conquered, to follow for the most part the religion of the conquerors. A seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, their peremptory restraint, (euen on the paine of death) of all disputation touching their religion, and calling any point of it into question. A third, their suppression of the studie of Philosophy, by the light whereof, the grosnesse and vanity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of their religion might bee discouered, which is inhibited to bee taught in their vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so hath beene, about these 400. yeares, whereas till then, it greatly flourished among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in <hi>Cordoua,</hi> in <hi>Fess,</hi> in <hi>Maroccho,</hi> in <hi>Bagded,</hi> and other cities.

Secondly, because, (as the Patrons of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6757:60"/>
this phantasie say) they haue alwaies embraced (the ancient character of <hi>Iudaisme</hi>) Circumcision. And thirdly,<note place="margin">2 Esdras 13. v. 41.42.43.44.45.</note> the authority of supposed <hi>Esdras,</hi> (the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry spring I take it, whence hath flowed this streame of opinion) is alleaged. Namely, that the Tenne <hi>Tribes tooke this course to themselues, that they would leaue the multitude of the heathen, and goe foorth into a farther Country, where neuer mankinde dwelt. That they might there keepe their statutes, which they neuer kept in their owne land. And that they entred in at the narrow passages of the Riuer Euphrates. The most high shewing them signes, and staying the Springs of the floud, till they were passed ouer.

            </p>
            <p>But, to the first of these arguments, I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> obtained that name, neither from <hi>Hebrew</hi> nor <hi>Syriaque</hi> originall, and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but, from the riuer <hi>Tartar,</hi> saith <hi>Leunclauius,</hi>

Or else from the Region, as sayth <hi>Haitho,</hi> where the principall of them anciently dwelled. Secondly, that the name <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> or <hi>Syriaque</hi> signification, importing a resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due or remainder, can but full ill (as it seemes) be applied to the <hi>Tartars</hi> in relation of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whom they exceedingly surpasse in multitude, as ouerspreading halfe the vast continent of <hi>Asia,</hi> or thereabout. For all the Nations of <hi>Asia,</hi> from the great riuers of <hi>Wolgha</hi> and <hi>Oby,</hi> Eastward, and from the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea, the riuer <hi>Oxus,</hi> the Countryes of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> northward, are contained vnder the Appellation of <hi>Tartars:</hi> and yet without these

And what if the innumerable people of so many Nations, as are knowen to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and ouerspread the huge continent of <hi>America,</hi> be also of the same of-spring? Certainely, if I bee not greatly deceiued, they are no other. For first that their originall must bee deriued from <hi>Asia</hi> is apparent, because, (as he that readeth the relations and histories of those Countryes of <hi>America</hi> may easily obserue) they haue no rellish nor resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance at all, of the Arts, or learning, or ciuility of <hi>Europe:</hi> And their colour restifieth, they are not of the <hi>Africans</hi> progenie (there being not found in all that large Continent, any blacke men, except a few about the Riuer of <hi>S. Martha,</hi> in a small Countrey called <hi>Quarequa,</hi> which by force and violence of some tempest, are supposed to haue beene trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thether, from the parts of <hi>Guinie</hi> or <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>) Therfore it seemeth, that they had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall from <hi>Asia.</hi> Which yet, will appeare more credible, if it be obserued, which by the <hi>Spanyards</hi> discoueries is well knowen to be true, namely, that the West side of <hi>America</hi> respecting <hi>Asia,</hi> is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much better peopled then the opposite or East side, that respecteth toward <hi>Europe.</hi> And, as for these reasons it is very likely, that <hi>America</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her first inhabitants, from the East border of <hi>Asia:</hi> So is it altogether vnlike, that is receiued them from any other part of all that border, saue from <hi>Tartarie.</hi> Because, in <hi>America</hi> there is not to be discerned, any token or indication at all, of the arts or industry of <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>Cataia,</hi> or any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6757:61"/>
other ciuill region, along all that border of <hi>Asia</hi>: But in their grosse ignorance of letters, and of arts, in their Idolatrie, and the specialties of it, in their inciuilitie, and many barbarous properties, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the olde and rude <hi>Tartars,</hi> aboue all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth. Which opinion of mine, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Americans</hi> descending from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then from any other nation in that border of <hi>Asia,</hi> after the neere vicinitie of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> this reason aboue all other, may best establish and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade: Because it is certaine, that that Northeast part of <hi>Asia</hi> possessed by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> is if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent with the West side of <hi>America,</hi> which yet remaineth somewhat doubtfull: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and without all doubt, it is the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned by sea, of all that coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> for that those parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> are continent one with the other, or at most, disioyned but by some narrow channell of the Ocean, the rauenous and harmefull beasts, wherewith <hi>America</hi> is stored, as Beares, Lions, Tigers, Wolues, Foxes, &amp;c. (which men as is likely, would neuer to their owne harme transporte out of the one continent to the other) may import. For from <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, which rested af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deluge, in <hi>Asia,</hi> all those beasts must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie fetch their beginning, seeing they could not proceede by the course of nature, as the vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sort of liuing creatures doe, of Putrefaction: or if they might haue Putrefaction for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, or receaue their originall (by any other new sort of generation) of the earth without special procreation of their owne kinde, then I see no nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6757:62"/>
why they should by Gods speciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be so carefully preserued in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke (as they were) in time of the deluge. Wherefore, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is certaine, that those rauenous beasts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> are the progenie of those of the same kinde in <hi>Asia,</hi> and that men, as is likely, conueighed them not (to their owne preiudice) from the one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the other, it carrieth a great likelihood and appearance of truth, that if they ioine not together, yet are they neer neighbours, &amp; but little disioyned each from other, for euen to this day, in the Isles of <hi>Cuba, Iamaica, Hispaniola, Burichena,</hi> and all the rest, which are so farre remoued from the firme land, that these beasts cannot swimme from it to them, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> record,<note place="margin">Ioseph Acosta De N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(For <hi>Alhazen</hi> I omit, because he onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth the height of hilles,<note place="margin">Alhazen. de Crepuscul. propos. 1.</note> as namely, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed 8 miles, without determining what their height should be) But yet, all these, are to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, I take it, with relation to the Mountaines in and about <hi>Greece,</hi> with which themselues were acquainted, which may in no sort compare with the huge Mountaines of vast Continents, such as are the <hi>Alpes</hi> in <hi>Europe, Atlas</hi> in <hi>Afrique, Caucasus</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and such other.</p>
            <p>But, whatsoeuer the height of Hilles may bee aboue the common <hi>superficies</hi> of the Earth, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me after good consideration, that the depth of the Sea, is a great deale more. For declaration of which point, I require to be supposed, first, that the Earth at the first forming of it, was in the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, regular, and sphericall: which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture directs vs to beleeue, because the water coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and compassed all the face of the Earth: And secondly, that the face of the Land is in largenesse and expansion, at least equall to that of the sea: And thirdly, that the vneuennesse and irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is now seene in the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Earth was caused (as is noted in <hi>Damascen</hi>) either,<note place="margin">Damascen. l. 1. de fide Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxa c. 10.</note> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of some parts out of the vpper face of the Earth in sundry places, to make it more hollow, and laying them in other places, to make it more conue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or else (which in effect is equiualent to that) by raysing vp some, and depressing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make roome and receite for the sea: that mutation being wrought by the power of that word,<note place="margin">Genes. 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>Let the waters be gathered into one place, that the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6757:69"/>

               <note place="margin">Aquin. in Sum pa. 1. q. 69. a. 1. Dionys. Carth Catharin. &amp; Alij in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. cap. 1. Genes.</note> 
               <hi>Catharinus</hi> and some other Diuines namely, that that gathering of waters and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Earth, was made, not by any mutation in the Earth, but by a violent accumulation of the waters, or heaping them vp on high, it is too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable. Because it is vtterly against the nature of water, being a flexible and ponderous body, so to consist, and stay it selfe, and not fall to the lower parts about it, where in nature there is nothing at all to hinder it. Or, if it be hindered and restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned supernaturally, by the hand and bridle of the almighty, lest it should ouerwhelme and drowne the Land, it must follow thereof, that God in the very institution of nature, imposed a perpetuall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence vpon nature: And this withall, that at the Deluge, there had beene no necessitie at all, to break vp the springs of the deepe, and to open the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts</hi> of Heauen, and powre downe water conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, so many dayes and nights together vpon the Earth, seeing, the only withdrawing of that hand, or letting goe of that bridle, which restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the water, would presently haue ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all.</p>
            <p>But, to come to the Point. It seemeth vpon the former suppositions (of which, the holy scripture establisheth the first, Experience of Trauailers, and Nauigators the second, and Reason the third) that in making estimation of the depth of the Sea, wee are not to reckon and consider onely, the height of the Hilles, aboue the common <hi>superficies</hi> of the Earth, vnto which the extraordinary depthes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6757:69"/>
or whirlpooles, that are found in the Sea, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly answere (descending beneath the ordinary bottome of the Sea, as the Hilles ascend aboue the ordinary face of the Land) but, the aduantage or height of all the dry Land aboue the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Sea. Because the whole Masse of the Earth, that now appeareth aboue the waters, being taken as it were out of the place, which the waters now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, must bee equall to the place out of which it was taken, and consequently it seemeth, that the height or eleuation of the one, should answere the depth or descending of the other. And therefore as I sayd, in estimating the deepenesse of the Sea, wee are not to consider onely the erection of the Hilles, aboue the ordinary land, but the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all the dry land aboue the sea. Which later, I meane the height of the ordinary maine Land, (euen excluding the hilles) is in my opinion more in large Continents aboue the Sea, then that of the Hilles, is aboue the Land. For first, that the plaine and common face of the drie Land, is not leuell, or equally distant from the Center, but hath great decliuity and descent toward the Sea, and accliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or rising toward the Midland parts, although it appeare not so to the common view of the Eye, is to reason notwithstanding manifest.

In such sort I say, that the line by which it falleth maketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly equall and right angles on all sides, with the face of the water whereon it falleth. Therefore it is manifest, that the earth so falling, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the center of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Because no straight line insisteth perpendicularly, on the face or circumference of any special body (as the water is) except only those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede directly to the center of the sphaire: But certaine it is, that the earth is withal direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried toward it own cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore there is but one common center of the water and of the earth.</note> And thirdly, that the center of the earth &amp; of the water are all one (both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being indeede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the center of the world) which though some phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical heads haue called into question yet no sound philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher euer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: It followeth thereupon, that the earth should in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable measure and proportion, lift it selfe and appeare aboue the face of the sea, on the south side of the line, as it doth on the north.

And consequently, that what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the South parts of the two foresaid continents towards the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruailing of the North parts (which is about three fiue parts of both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continents lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together) must of necessitie be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of the South. And yet I omit all the land, that may be about the <hi>Arcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> Pole, beyond the <hi>Scythian</hi> or <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian</hi> sea, which must be also coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoysed in that <hi>Antarchtique</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for nothing comes within the compasse of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, to bee hereto replied, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any would perhaps imagine, that either the sea
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6757:74"/>
on the South side of the equator, is verie shallow, or that the land of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, may be much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aboue the face of the sea, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the land of the other two (&amp; so equal in masse, though lesse in circuit) or that the earth on the south side of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, should be of a more ponderous disposition, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the North, in which cases, some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pensation of weightines, may be made for the want of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But of these three, the experience of sailers eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently refelleth the first, who in equall distance from the land, obserue an equall deepenesse of the sea, in both South and North latitude. And neither is there any experience, nor good reason that can be alleadged to establish either of the later: which, but that I haue alreadie too much offended by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, I could prooue I doubt not against all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. But this for a conclusion to this discourse, I dare pronounce touching that South co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent, that it wil certainely be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (in the after times, when it shall be better discouered) much larger then any globe or map hitherto extant, hath represented it.</p>
            <p>Such therfore (as I haue declared) is the general state of Christianity at this present in the world, &amp; the proportion of it to other religions.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6757:103"/>
condition, which phantasies the fourth generall councell condemned.

Secondly, (the absurdity of that being discerned) it occasioned an other extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite, namely of the Impassibility of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Sauiour, (but on the same ground) because namely, it was become one nature with the deitie, which now we know to bee vnpassible. Thirdly, when the fondnesse of both were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, It bred a new deuise, touching one nature in our Sauiour (as the wit of <hi>Heretiques</hi> will better serue them, to deuise a thousand shifts to delude the truth, then their pride will suffer them once to yeelde and acknowledge it) It bred I say a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, namely, to be one, not by permixtion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of substances, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> first taught, but onely by composition, the deitie and humanitie,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6757:104"/>
by coalition becomming one nature in Christ, as the bodie and soule grow into one nature in Man. And fourthly, when this phantasie began also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to abate, and relent in manie: yet still a fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it were or rather a consequent of it was retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (for indeede it implieth by necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the vnitie of nature) namely that there was but one will, and one action of both natures in the person of our Sauiour. And God knowes what a traine and succession of heresies might haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed these, if that Lord, whom they had infinitely wronged by their wanton and wandring conceats of him, had not, to stop the course and streame of their wickednesse and follie, brought on them, the <hi>Sarracens</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> for euen while the Church, specially that of the Easterne parts, was in great perplexitie and trauaile, with the heresie of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethelites</hi> (which I last mentioned) the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> like a mightie inundation brake forth, and ouerwhelmed all, and them first, that first, and most had wronged the Sonne of God, by fostering the forenamed heresies, and the infinite brood that sprung of them, I meane <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and to this day, both they, and the neighbouring nations that had beene infected by them, remaine in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But yet as in the diseases and distempers of our bodies, contraries are vsually healed by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so seemeth it to haue fallen out in the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of these mens religions, for as worldly prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and wantonnesse of wit (ordinarie compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) wherewith these nations in those times aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, bred in them their ordinarie children, namely,
