            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and dayly experience for ſome years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cure of the French diſeaſe with as good ſucceſs, as my own heart could deſire; I thought it neceſſary to publiſh all thoſe ſeveral ways which I have made uſe of in the cure
<pb facs="tcp:46064:4"/>
of this diſeaſe, in ſeveral conſtitutions, that other people might receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit alſo of our labours and ſtudies that I might ſhew my ſelf a profitable member of the Common-wealth wherein I lived, and in that City wherein was my preſent abode: but now having found that that which we then did only for a tryall, hath bin ſo well received into the world, we thought it our duty to make it publick again with additions, being aſſured that only the benefit which it brought along with it, gave
<pb facs="tcp:46064:4"/>
it ſo free a welcom and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in the world. And certainly for the time of publiſhing it, it never could have bin more ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, in regard that beſides the multitude of thoſe that are infected with venereal diſtempers, ſuch is the dark ignorance of moſt in this City, who publickly profeſs to cure the ſame, by ſticking their bills upon poſts, to catch ignorant Countrie people, that ſcarce one in twentie can give cure of that diſeaſe which they profeſs to cure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46064:5"/>The patient tells them, and then they tell the patient again that he hath got a clap; which ſignifies juſt as much as if they had ſaid nothing at all.</p>
            <p>And then out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or deceit they ingage the patient into a long and tedious Courſe of Phyſick until the time of the year ſhall have cured the diſeaſe for the preſent, which they wholly aſcribe to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick he took, but the next Spring the patient finds by wofull experience the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for as the year getts
<pb facs="tcp:46064:5"/>
up, ſo doth the diſeaſe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe which theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyricks pretend to have cured.</p>
            <p>Then he goes to another ſuch like Mountebank which deales no better with him then did the former.</p>
            <p>And thus is he miſerably deluded for two or three years together, until at length he concludes that the diſeaſe is incurable, and ſo he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to make much of his diſeaſe, untill it brings him into ſome other diſtemper which kills him.</p>
            <p>Tis a vain thing, and I am
<pb facs="tcp:46064:6"/>
ſorry that poor people ſhould be ſo far deluded to think their diſeaſe incurable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Quackſalvers tell them ſo. For I here publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs by Gods bleſſing to cure this diſeaſe within the ſpace of forty days in any that have had it above a dozen years, by ſuch means as are here ſet down in this ſmall treatiſe, which we have once more, by reaſon of the publick recommendations that have bin given it, publiſhed for the comfort of all thoſe that are diſtreſſed, and for the benefit of the
<pb facs="tcp:46064:6"/>
young Practitioner, of whom now I am ſpeaking. I ſhall take leave to give him theſe few exhortations, firſt to avoyd the common fault of all practitioners which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; and not to exact upon the neceſſities of others that are in diſtreſs: in the next place let him not be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive of any patient who he is, or where he dwells, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he have a mind to conceal himſelf, thy buſineſs being only to cure him which eaſe, ſpeed, and ſafety. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if thou knoweſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, judge not raſhly of
<pb facs="tcp:46064:7"/>
him; for as an Artiſt you muſt know that the French diſeaſe may be got by lying in a hot bed with another, or by drinking with him, or by ſetting on the Cloſe ſtool after him, and ſo the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reins may be got by riding lifting or any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtreining, as uſing too frequent copulation with a mans own wife. Fourthly ſo to contrive the buſineſs that not any one of thy patients may know that the other is thy patient, that each patient may be with all poſſible pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy. Fiftly neither flatter
<pb facs="tcp:46064:7"/>
nor dally with any patient whatſoever. Tell him not that the cure will not be troubleſome, when thou in thy conſcience knowſt that it will, and on the contrary doe not affright him, when thou knowſt that he is in no danger. The obſervation of thoſe inſtructions will give a repute to the practiſe of whoſoever ſhall have a care not to deviate from them; which I wiſh to all honeſt and painfull practitioners, and that the abuſes of Mountebanks may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and avoyded, which as
<pb facs="tcp:46064:8"/>
it will be profitable to the judicious practitioner ſo it will not be a little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the patient.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the name, cauſes, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the French Diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THE French pox is certainly a new diſeaſe, and not known in Europe till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this hundred years: For when Charles the eight king of France beſeig'd Naples, which was in the year 1494. it firſt began to ſpread it ſelf, not only through his army, but through all Italy, being brought by the Spaniards from the American Iſlands into theſe parts of the world. It hath been vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly named, ſome calling it the Spaniſh, ſome the Italian, ſome the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46064:9"/>
French diſeaſe. Others not willing to injure any nation, have ſtil'd it the Venereal plague.</p>
               <p>Now what it is, whence it dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it's original, and to what kind of diſeaſe it ought to be referr'd, it is a great difficulty to determine. Some will have it to be the effect of divine juſtice. Others ſay it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a manifeſt diſtemper of the aire, that is, when it is very moiſt. But this ſtands not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when we find that this diſeaſe is contracted as well in times of drowth as well as moiſture. Nor can the aire be the cauſe of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that never any man was yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the breath of the moſt diſtemper'd perſon. Some blame the copulation of a leprous ſouldier with a noble courteſan in Spain to have been the original thereof; for when other young men came and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46064:9"/>
made the ſame uſe of her, the Foulneſs of the former mixture diſpers'd this contagion to their bodies, and they to others.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe of this diſeaſe as the Galeniſts affirm, is a certain venom which preys upon the blood, is hurtful to the liver, and works by ſecond qualities, heat and drowth. The Chymiſts not much differing from them, define it to be a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ferment, that like a ſtink ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth upon the ſolid and liquid parts of the body. But moſt commonly it aſſociates it ſelf with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the matter of diſeaſes, that have not the power to reſiſt its virulences.</p>
               <p>This contagious diſeaſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted many wayes, as by touch in coition, by reaſon that the active force of the poyſon communicates its venome by means of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46064:10"/>
matter, or thoſe ſtinking va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours that proceed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſon. Now becauſe that cannot happen but by touch, it follows that the ſigns of the diſeaſe muſt firſt appear in thoſe parts which firſt are lyable by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taction to receive the infection. And therefore we alwaies find the firſt ſymptoms in the privie parts. Sometime it is contracted by lying together in the ſame bed, by reaſon that the ſweat and impure vapours that exhale from a defil'd body corrode and penetrate the skin of him that is ſound. In the ſame manner the chaps are infected by drinking together, the noſtrills by receiving the evil ſents of his body. As to the parties receiving, ſome whoſe skins are ſoft and tender, their veſſels larger, their ſpirits more ſubtile, and more inflam'd,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46064:10"/>
their blood more thin and hot, have a leſs force to reſiſt, and are conſequently more apt to receive this poyſon. So we ſee the tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt parts of the ſame body ſooneſt infected, as the privities, which are very tender, and ſtill heated and rarefy'd by copulation. The mouth alſo and jaws are in the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by reaſon of the ſoftneſs and thinneſs of the ſubject. Young men alſo are ſooner infected, then aged, and the weaker young men ſooner then thoſe who are of ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. But women are leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to infection then men, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the coldneſs of their temper, as alſo becauſe thoſe parts are waſh'd by their natural evacuations.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſigns and ſymptomes of this diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THE ſignes and ſymptomes how you ſhall know thoſe that are infected with this grief, appear by the following effects. Now becauſe the ſigns doe proceed and are taken either from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the effects or from the cauſes of the ſickneſs and alſo from ſome ſymptoms or cauſes thereof, and alſo becauſe this diſeaſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the liver, which cannot be look'd into, let us not look for any ſigns which may be common to other diſeaſes, but let us ſeek for ſuch ſigns as can give certain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſhew thereof, as being contained under the effects, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46064:11"/>
conſequently proceeding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the diſeaſe. Of theſe ſigns there be two ſorts, ſome are ſymptoms, as falling off of the hair, aches in the head and members and ſmall infection of the skin. But thoſe which I call <hi>diſeaſes</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the diſeaſe, are thoſe ſore and vehement ulcers, tumors of the ſhins and other parts of the body with puſtules. Of theſe ſymptoms ſome happen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſome when the diſeaſe is grown more prevalent and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Thoſe of the firſt ſort are theſe that follow. When a man is firſt infected, He feels a certain wearineſs come upon all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, without any outward occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch as walking or violent exerciſe. There will be alſo a lumpiſh heavineſs over the whole body, a dulneſs, faintneſs and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46064:12"/>
to move in all the members. The occaſion of this is the infection of the natural ſpirits, which are the immediate inſtrument that give livelyneſs to the whole body, which being infected it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the whole body ſhould be more weary and heavy then it was before. There is moreover a certain pain or ache, which wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth throughout all the body and the ſeveral parts thereof. Firſt the head aketh, then it leaveth the head and goeth into the ſhoulders, by and by it leaveth one ſhoulder and goeth into another, out of the ſhoulders it flyes to the leggs, ſometimes in one leg and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another. The cauſe of this is a certain vapor which taketh it's courſe from the liver. 'Tis true that the evil humour is not yet quite begotten, but by reaſon of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46064:12"/>
fervent heat of the liver, which is cauſed by the infection, there is a certain ſmall vapour ingendred, which is the cauſe of theſe pains that wander up and down the body. Now after that the diſeaſe hath a little prevailed, the colour of the face is quite altered; Thoſe that before were of moſt lively and clear complexions, are in very ſhort while all diſcoloured. The lively ſpirit of the eyes, and the comely colours of the mouth and cheeks will be altogether of another Hew; and beſides this there will be under the eyes of a wan colour'd or blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh circle, ſuch as appears in women that have Their ſtomachs will be much taken off from their meat, they will have pains in the night coming upon them much about the time they goe to ſleep, will many times wake them out of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46064:13"/>
ſleep. They are colder then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and more over they have an itching pain in their ſhin-bones, which abates no longer then while you are gently rubbing of the part. Beſides all this, they will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with drowſineſs or a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſleep, which ſhall be often interrupted. There is wont alſo to be a notable heat in the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet, though it be in the winter time. Neither is ſadneſs of the mind to be left out, for though the party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſhould be of a pleaſant and merry nature, yet will this diſeaſe cauſe him to be ſad even to ſuch a height as to groan therewith. The infection now increaſing burneth the blood which cauſes a feaver, by reaſon of the heat which is about the <hi>diſtemper'd</hi> parts. By this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the putrify'd matter which is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46064:13"/>
a ſign to diſcover the malady; for when you ſee this putrify'd matter yet in ſmall quantity about the yard, knowing no occaſion thereof to have gone before, you may ſafely pronounce it to be the French diſeaſe. For this <hi>matter</hi> cannot proceed but from two cauſes; either becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the womans Matrix, which may have eaten and gnawn the fine skin of the yard; or elſe by reaſon that the contagion being imparted unto the Liver by the naturall ſpirits, the liver therefore expells thoſe infected ſpirits and ſanious matter down again upon the privie <hi>parts.</hi> Beſides theſe common ſigns there are others, of another nature, as bubo's, which are ſmall tumors in the armholes or groyn and privie parts, afterward a general itching over the whole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46064:14"/>
body, and ſometimes ſore and angry puſtules or breakings out in the head, face and other parts.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the cauſe of the coming forth of thoſe puſtules and other tumours.</head>
               <p>THE chief cauſe why theſe puſtules break forth, are firſt, becauſe the infected matter is ſent thither by the liver; Secondly becauſe the parts infected doe not digeſt and expel the excrements by way of tranſpiration, and therefore it remains there and grows into cruſts. But there are beſides theſe puſtules other ſigns of the diſeaſe, as the hanging down of the Uvula
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46064:14"/>
in the further part of the mouth, which cauſeth much moiſture to come into the mouth, by reaſon wereof happens a very great hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wherefore if you hear your patient ſpeak hoarſely, open his mouth and you ſhall perceive the Uvula full of moiſture, which if the patient have no Catarrhe, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd ſign of the diſeaſe. The cauſe of the moiſtneſs of the Uvula is the change and infection of the naturall ſpirits, which being carried with the blood throughout every vein of the whole body, by reaſon of their infection loſe their ſtrength, ſo that their function grows weak and feeble in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which cauſes and engenders flegm, and unnatural humours in the brains; which abundance of humours falling down upon the Uvula, are the cauſe of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46064:15"/>
it's being preſs'd down: if the blood be ſharper, it conſumes the rootes of the hair which cauſeth them to fall off; it exulcerates the mouth, the palate, and the noſe. Now the cauſe of hoarſneſs of the voice is humidity and excrements which ſtop and let the wayes of the voice. There be other tumours denoting this diſeaſe as, ſuch are the tumours of the glandules in the further part of the mouth, which when ere you ſee be out of doubt that the infection of this diſeaſe is confirmed. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection being now ſent to the head, is expelled by his emunctory places which are the glandules. There are in the laſt place certain other tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours called <hi>gummata</hi> or <hi>bumbata,</hi> by reaſon that the matter contained in them reſembleth the gum of trees, which happens either becauſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46064:15"/>
the partie is not well nouriſh'd, but heapes up abundance of undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted excrements, or elſe becauſe the liver continually feeds them with the infected matter of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. Note here that if an <hi>aſthma</hi> happen upon this diſeaſe, it declares the party to be paſt cure and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let never any man ſeek to put ſuch a one to pain by medecines or other means, for they ſhall never heal ſuch a one. Theſe ſigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the certainty of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, care muſt be had that you know the time of the infection, for, if it be new and lately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it requires a ſhorter and eaſier cure; if it be of a long ſtanding, it requires a longer and more artificial cure.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46064:17"/>
are ſaid to be phlegmatick, ſanguine, cholerick, or melancholick.</p>
               <p>If the patient be Phlegmatick, firſt prepare his body, and then purge him, let him be prepared with this following Apozeme.</p>
               <p>Take rootes of Parſley, Fennel, Graſs butchers brome, and Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus an ounce. Maidenhaire one handful, Penyroyal half a handful, Cinamon and Liquorice an ounce; cut, ſlice or bruiſe them according to Art; then boyle them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in white wine and ſpring water, of each a pound and half, until half be waſted, ſtrein away the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and ſweeten the Liquor with ſix ounces of Oxymel Julianizan; drink of this four ounces faſting in the morning, and as much to bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo long as it ſhall laſt.</p>
               <p>The next day after he hath taken his Apozeme in the morning faſting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46064:17"/>
give him this following Purging potion, and if need require two days after purge him again.</p>
               <p>Take Senna three drams, Agarick two Scruples, Caraway-ſeeds half a dram, Cinamon and Squinanth one ſcruple; infuſe them all night in four ounces of white wine, ſtrein it, then added Manna and Syrrup of Roſes ſolute half an ounce, Tartarum vitriolatum ten grains. The next day after proceed to the particular cure.</p>
               <p>If the patient be of a ſanguine conſtitution take from his right arm ten ounces of blood, more or leſs according to his age ſtrength and time of the year. The next day after bleeding proceed to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cure.</p>
               <p>If the patient be cholerick, purge him with this following potion.</p>

The next day after he hath taken all his Apozeme let him purge with this following potion.</p>
               <p>Take Senna three drams, black Hellebore one dram, Agarick half a dram, Galingale and Squinanth an one ſcruple, Spikenard ten grains. Infuſe them all night in four ounces and a half of Borage water, in the morning put to the ſtreyned Liquor one ounce and a half of ſyrup of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46064:19"/>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46064:19"/>As for example: Pilulae Maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinae, containing Agarick, doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly purge away groſs choler and flegme, which are made this. Take Maſtick half an ounce, Aloes one ounce, Agarick Trochiſcate and powder of <hi>Hiera ſimplex</hi> ana three drammes and a half, incorporate them with Malmſey; take three pills at a time going to bed eating no ſupper. The Pills <hi>ſine quibus eſſe nolo</hi> doe draw choler, flegm and melancholy out of all parts of the body. They are to be taken in a morning faſting, keeping your ſelf warm by reaſon of the ſcammony which is in them. Thus with ſuch Receipts as theſe are, of which there are many more, when you find the mixt humours ſufficienly prepared, proceed to the particular cure of the diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>TAke of this following deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Wood <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> half a pound, the bark of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> four ounces, <hi>Saſſaphras</hi> an ounce; boyle them over night in three Gallons of water in an Iron pot cloſe covered, and let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all night.

gentle fire, untill the liquor be half waſted, then take it off from the fire, and when it is cold ſtrain away the liquor from the ingredients, and put it up in ſtone bottles and keep it in a cellar or cool place for your uſe.</p>
               <p>Take of this decoction a quarter of a pint in a morning faſting, at four in the afternoon and at night to bed ward, for the ſpace of forty days together, and every time let him ſweat moderately after it. Then let him uſe this following decoction at meals in ſtead of beer.</p>
               <p>Put a gallon and a half of water to the ingredients that were left of the firſt decoction, and boyle them a little, then take it from the fire and keep the liquor together with the ingredients in an Earthen veſſel two or three days, in the mean time drinking of it as aforeſaid, then

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46064:22"/>
in the cure, of this diſeaſe and that their goodneſs or badneſs doth much conduce either to retard or haſten the cure we have thought fit to ſet down ſome few ſignes whereby to know which is good and which is naught.</p>
               <p>In chooſing this wood you are to conſider the time of the year, for in a cold ſeaſon as in the winter you are to uſe the hotter, ſharper and bitterer ſort, which is eaſily judg'd by the ſenſe, in the ſummer that which is leaſt ſharp or bitter either of an old or young tree. Now the marks whereby you ſhall diſcern the beſt from the other are theſe. Firſt the old wood is very big and hath a groſs and thick rind, which ſo cleaves to the wood that you can hardly ſeparate it with a knife, for as often as you ſee the bark come eaſily from the wood
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46064:22"/>
it ſhews that it hath bin moyſtened with ſalt water and it is of the worſt ſort; in the ſecond place, if you raſp a little of this wood, and find no ſmel to come from it, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is either very old or elſe corrupt. The third ſign to chooſe this wood by, is, that if in raſping it appeareth very oyly, ſo that you perceive the duſt thereof to gliſter. Fourthly, taſt of that duſt, and if it bite your tongue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and afterwards yeildeth a bitterneſs, it is very good. Fiftly, if there appear in the ſubſtance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt pores and holes, and that the place where it is raſped appear not very ſmooth and equal, 'tis not good. Sixthly, you muſt chooſe it very ponderous and heavy. The laſt proof thereof, is to boyle the raſpings, and if the decoction be thick, very bitter and ſharp, it is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46064:23"/>
very good. The ſignes of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the rind are theſe. If it be taken from a tree which is old or of a middle age; for that which cometh from ſmal boughs is naught; now that which cometh from an old tree or a tree of a middle age, hath great peices and large cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Secondly, let the rind be very thick and hard. Thirdly, let the rind be ſomewhat black, ſprinkled with an aſh-colour, for this is the colour of the moſt excellent bark.</p>
               <p>The beſt China, is that which is rough in colour, not ponderous, nor worm-eaten nor corrupted, though of the two, they which be worm-eaten are the better of the two. For the ſpongious rootes ſoon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, and give little ſtrength to the decoction.</p>

               <p>THis is by ſalivation or fluxing. To which purpoſe let the patient anoynt the palms of his hands and the ſoles of his feet with this following unguent untill he begin to ſpit.</p>
               <p>Take of Quickſilver one ounce, and put it into a little mortar with four or five ſpoon-fulls of vinegar, and ſtir them together in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with a peſtle, until the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver be divided into ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, leſs then pins heads, then poure away the vinegar, and put into the mortar to the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, Venice Turpentine and Hoggs ſeam of each an ounce, ſtir
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46064:24"/>
them together with the peſtle until the quickſilver be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them; then mix with it <hi>Unguentum Neruinum</hi> two ounces, and keep it in a coole place for your uſe.</p>
               <p>Let it be very well chafed in, otherwiſe it will not let him ſpit at all; when he begins to ſpit let him leave off to anoynt himſelf, and keep very warm. Let him continue ſpitting, till his ſpittle leave off its brackiſh taſte and become either inſipid, or elſe of a ſweetiſh taſte, which is commonly in fourten or fiteen days during the whole time of his ſpitting. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of his ſpitting let him drink a draught of warm poſſet-drink for three or four times a day. When you would abate the ſpitting which muſt be, upon ſome very extraordinary occaſion, as if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46064:24"/>
he ſpit blood, ſo that you perceive any of the vitals to be offended, then give him every after-noon at four of the clock this following clyſter.</p>
               <p>Take new milk a pint, brown ſugar two ounces, two yolks of eggs, and three dramms of common ſalt; mix them together according to art and give them Clyſterwiſe blood warm: Give him alſo at night when he goes to bed this following Bolus:</p>
               <p>Take of Diaſcordium two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Gaſcoynes powder twenty grains, oyle of Vitriol two drops, with a little ſyrrup of white Poppy, mix them into a Bolus.</p>
               <p>If while he ſpits, his teeth are very looſe, let him keep a piece of gold in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Some people are ſo ignorant as to procure ſalivation by anointing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46064:25"/>
all the joynts; but this Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe: for there be many that have been ſo anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which have had feeble joynts all the year after.</p>
               <p>Salivation may be alſo procured by the mouth, as well as by unction, as thus.</p>
               <p>Take of Turbith minerals ten grains, and make it into a ball or pill with conſerve of Roſes, and give it the patient; the next day but one give him eleven grains ſo made up as before, and the next day but one to that give him thirteen grains of the ſaid Turbith.</p>
               <p>When he takes his doſes he muſt receive it early in the morning and ſleep after it an houre, and then riſe and keep himſelf very warm for an hour, nor muſt he drink any thing but poſſet-drink warm while the flux continues, which will be for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46064:25"/>
twenty days, he ſhall eat no meat but broth of mutton or hens: after he hath done fluxing let him take this drink.</p>
               <p>Take of Sarſaperil two ounces; Guaiacum four ounces; Hermoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyles two ounces; Senna two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Annis-ſeed &amp; Cominſeed two ounces; Liquorice ſliced Twenty two ounces; boyl all theſe together in ten quarts of liquour half beer half water, and let them boyl twelve hours on a ſoft fire till three quarts be conſumed, and then drink thereof half a pint in a morning and half a quart about four in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till you have drunk it up. You may when you take this drink eate boyl'd mutton or veal or hens roſted.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the French diſeaſe by ſalivation or ſpitting ſurpaſſeth any other cure, provided it be uſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46064:26"/>
to thoſe bodies unto which it is moſt convenient; otherwiſe it is moſt uncertain and dangerous. For it proves deſtructive to thoſe that have a moiſt brain, and are ſubject to pain in the head, and are inclin'd to cold diſeaſes.

               <p>ACcording to each particular aforeſaid of curing the French diſeaſe there are diverſe dayly cured. Yet would we not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe any to undertake the cure of this diſeaſe by any of theſe ways
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46064:36"/>
indifferently without reſpect had to the patients conſtitution, age, courſe of life, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever. After he hath obſerved the ſeveral ways of curing this diſeaſe which I have here ſet down, let him ſatisfy himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly upon what accompt each particular way is moſt ſuitable to ſuch a particular conſtitution. As for example for effeminate perſons and thoſe which are of a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate temper there is a balſome preſcribed in the twelveth Chapter. Now why ſhould theſe be cured by this way rather then by any other. The reaſon is becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other in all the other ways of curing this diſeaſe which might prove deſtructive to a tender habit of body. The decoction mentioned in the firſt Chapter would dry them too much and be apt to breed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46064:36"/>
a ſchyrrhus in ſome of the inward parts, as the liver, the ſpleen, the pancreas; ſalivation which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of curing would preſently conſume them. Wherefore if this ſafe and eaſy way will perform the cure, why ſhould we put the patient to the trouble and inconvenience of any other, as fluxing ſweating or the like. To which I anſwer, that although this way doth cure it in thoſe that are of a tender habit, yet it will not be effectual to thoſe of a ſtonger conſtitution. Thus a prune or an apple will move ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when as others ſhall not be moved with an ounce of Manna or two ounces of ſyrrup of Roſes: ſo great is the diverſity of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>When the practitioner is fully ſatisfied in reaſon why each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way of cure is moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46064:37"/>
to ſuch a particular tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him obſerve whether there be not a complication or mixture of ſymptoms in the patient, that is whereas I have ſet down after each particular cure, that ſuch a way is proper for effeminate perſons, and another way proper for thoſe that have extream paines, whether the perſon be not only an effeminate perſon and troubled alſo with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal pains, with ſome other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſet down ſeverally in other chapters, and if there be, let him ſo compound theſe particular ways of cure that they may be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the complication of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſymptoms; as for example, ſuppoſe I had a patient of a ſtrong conſtitution having nocturnal pains, both in his head and other parts, and puſtles in his face and outward parts, I would uſe the decoction in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46064:37"/>
the ſeventh chapter, but yet I would borrow the pill mentioned in the fourtenth chapter, which I would give him inſtead of that draught of the decoction which he ſhould take every night when he goes to bed and beſides that I would uſe unto him firſt the water for his puſtles ſet down in the eight chapter. If I had a patient of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different hot temper, who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pains ſometimes in his head, but not very often, as perhaps once in fortnight or three weeks I would firſt flux him according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſet down in the ninth Chapter and after his fluxing I would give him the decoctions mentioned in the ſeventh chapter, for the ſpace of ten days. By which inſtances it is plain how little difficulty there is in contriving a fit remedy for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe in each particular conſtitution.</p>

               <p>THere is a much prudence and diſcretion required in the Phyſitian or Surgeon in the cure of the Gonorrhea, as in the cure of the French diſeaſe, in regard of the great danger there is in ſtopping of the Gonorrhea ſuddenly in ſome bodyes, and the ſafety of curing it with all ſpeed in others; in thoſe bodyes that are extream foul, upon a Gonorrhea, nature takes her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to purge the whole body by the ſeminary veſſel.</p>
               <p>Now when this paſſage is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopped except there be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46064:45"/>
ſome other way to carry away the matter, which doth continually flow to theſe parts, experience teaches us that there doe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſymptomes ariſe from thence as intollerable pain in the back, ſickneſs in the ſtomack, vomiting or a deſire to vomit, inflammation ſwelling and extream pain in the ſtones, feavers, and fainting fitts, and ſometimes death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In ſome ſuch body's as thoſe are, whether you would cure them after the firſt or ſecond way ſet down in the twenty firſt and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond Chapters, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what is mentioned in the aforeſaid Chapters there will be occaſion to uſe the ſweating po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mentioned in the twenty third Chapter: and on the contrary there are ſome bodyes that doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo much circumſtance of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46064:46"/>
medicine as is mentioned in the foreſaid Chapter, but may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be cured onely by the potion in the twenty firſt Chapter, or the plaiſter and electuary in the twenty ſecond Chapter or elſe by the pills in the twenty third.</p>
               <p>This depends wholly upon the prudence honeſty and knowledge of the Surgeon.</p>
               <p>The like prudence and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh a ſimple Gonorrhea, from a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gonorrhea, as alſo in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a fit dyet according to the ſeveral Circumſtances of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as whether he be young, or in years, whither he have a full or a ſpare body, and laſtly whither he be of a hot, cold or indifferent temper.</p>
