            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all things, which the Lord hath made in this <hi>great World,</hi> Man is the most noble; for whose sake other Creatures were created; to whose feet the things below are subjected. Of all the Essentials, which Man (the <hi>little World</hi>) doth consist of, the Soul is the most excellent; It is infused by God, which notes out the Dignity of it; It hath command of the body, which notes out the Authority of it; It is a work (as one calleth it) both great, Divine, and admirable. Of all the powers in the Soul, none is comparable to the <hi>Reason.</hi> Of all the Branches in the <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> part, none is equal to the <hi>Minde,</hi> none excelleth the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> Of all the vertues in the <hi>Minde, Wisdom</hi> gives the greatest light, <hi>Wisdom</hi> swayeth with chiefest might. Oh the breadth, that Wisdom spanneth! Oh the length, that Wisdom reacheth! Oh the heigth, that Wisdom climbeth? Oh the depth, that Wisdom gageth, when once it comes into a Soul, cleared by Gods Spirit, in some good measure, from those duskish Clouds of Ignorance and Errour, with which before it was obscured. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, how can men discern of things that differ? how can they see what is good and what is evil, and so exercise the power of their reason in ensuing the one, in eschewing the other? When dangers are imminent and coming against us, Wisdom foreseeth them, forecasteth against them; When troubles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent and lying upon us, it doth either remove them, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb facs="tcp:61677:3"/>
us in them. In a word, what Walls are to Cities, what skins are to beasts, scales to fishes, feathers to birds, and shells to some creeping and baser Creatures, the same is wisdom to (<hi>that naked born Creature) Man,</hi> even a <hi>Covering</hi> a <hi>defence.</hi> Yea, <hi>Wisdom</hi> (saith the Preacher) <hi>strengtheneth the wise, more than ten mighty men, which are in the Citie.</hi> And they are truely endowed with wisdom, who by the light of it do distinguish Gospel-truths from errours, and keep their Souls pure and undefiled from the infection of false and time-poysoning Doctrines. Wisdom truely is in them, who by the light and guidance of it have found out and continue in the true Church of Christ, the true <hi>Zion</hi> of God, where salvation is truely placed, where pardon of sin is onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, where Soul-feastings and Divine teachings are truely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, where are protections on every dwelling place, where are true Ministers cloathed with salvation, where the Saints do shout aloud for joy, where all afflictions are sanctified, where all good news are to be heard, and where God hath commanded the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and life for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And such a gift of wisdom (Worthy Sir) have I admired in you; by which light in your far and forraign travails you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes discerned good from evil, Truth from Errour, Religion from Superstition, <hi>Zion</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> It is true in you, that wisdom hath preserved you from many snares to folly. If Riches be snares; the Riches of the <hi>West-India's,</hi> even those Treasures amongst the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> never ensnared your conscience; If honour entice; who of our <hi>English</hi> Nation was ever more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>West-India's</hi> than your self? as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ime of your abode in <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> and at the Court of <hi>Santo Domingo</hi> doth sufficiently witness. If favour of Great men and Princes doth allure, and often obscure the light of true wisdom; who ever of our <hi>English</hi> Nation enjoyed such a favour from that <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Don of</hi> Spain, the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> as your self? as also from the Duke of <hi>Nacara,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Maqueda</hi>; the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Chief favourite, that great <hi>Conde Dugue,</hi> Earle of <hi>Olivares</hi>; and the Count of <hi>Castilia,</hi> then President of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia's,</hi> being trusted by the first to go and view the Silver and
<pb facs="tcp:61677:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Golden Treasures of <hi>America</hi> (a favour denied unto others) and fully empowered by him to make choice of what Ports you pleased, and there to lade your Ships with what Commodities might seem most advantagious unto your self. If pleasures and vanities do tickle; where do they abound more than in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia's,</hi> and in that place especially, where with so much honour from the best and Noblest in <hi>Santo Domingo</hi> you did sometime abide? Yet in the midst of all these snares, with wisdoms light you eyed <hi>Zion</hi> still, you kept your self free from errours, you were never defiled with <hi>Babylons</hi> superstitions; Yea, when troubles and evils were incumbent, and lying upon you, even the loss of ship and of Riches at your return into <hi>England,</hi> wisdom preserved you in the midst of evils, and as a true Member of <hi>Zion</hi> you found your losses and afflictions sanctified unto you. Zion <hi>and</hi> Babylon, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Errour,</hi> are the subject of these my weak indeavours, which must be known by the light of wisdom. With which light, as you have hitherto discerned good from evil, so I desire you may with the same take notice of <hi>Zion,</hi> and of <hi>Zions true Ambassadours,</hi> pointed out unto you in this my Treatise, and eschew those Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Antichristian fallacies, which, as Rocks and Sands under the waters, are here discovered to be amongst us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of Christian and Gospel-Truths.</p>
            <p>I must confess that when I called to minde that Proverb, <gap reason="foreign">

But as a Commanding Authority of the Spirit within me for a just defence of the Parochial Churches and Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> both cried down with scandal by an opposing Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was the cause of the former, so overruling importunity of
<pb facs="tcp:61677:4"/>
some friends well-wishers to <hi>Zion</hi> hath effected the latter; and now like an Infant new born, my Book and Dispute is come na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into the World, subject unto the nippings and bitings of the times. It was the saying of the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles, We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts</hi>; And I may say the like of this; I have a little Bird and she wanteth wings; yet fly she must into the open air, and shift for her self. But, Alas! what can she do, before her wings be grown, or her weak feathers come to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? It is impossible that she should escape, and not be torn in pieces by the sharp eyed vultures (the time-consuming Criticks) of our time, except some Eagle shall in pity to so poor a wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, shadow her with the wings of protection. Your ever known disposition (Worthy Sir) in giving incouragement to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, in doing Justice and Right to such as suffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, hath imboldned this little Bird to shrowd herself under the roof of your Protection and favour, and my self to Dedicate this small fruit of my Studies unto you; whom (with a most thankfull heart) I must ever acknowledge my chief incourager in my work, since, after my Conversion from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Zion,</hi> I have been a poor and unworthy labourer in the Vine-yard of Christ. And if at this time I may obtain your Love in accepting this small token of my thankfulness for those many and undeserved favours conferred by you upon me, I shall receive a most comfortable incitement to go on forwards in my Studies, and be for ever bound to pray for a blessed increase of all Graces spiritual and temporal, both for this life and the life to come, unto your self, with your most vertuous aud truely Godly and Religious consort, unto all yours both at home and abroad, and their succeeding posterity for ever; <hi>And so I commend you to God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance amongst all them that are sanctified. And the Lord of Peace himself, give you peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by all means.</hi> So prayeth he who is</p>

How happy then may I think my labours imployed, if by these small pains I may rightly instruct you all, not in moral vertues, but in Divine and Gospel-verities; not in precepts of manners onely, but in Mysteries of true Religion; On which, I will not say the Civil Nurture, or gay Deportment of the outward Man, but the life of your Souls, and hope of all eternity dependeth. With which if you covet to enrich your Souls, two things I request at your hands; The one is, not to frame an overweening conceit, or bear too partial affection to such as are of contrary judgement unto me; the other, to peruse this Treatise with an indifferent and single eye, and with a greedy zeal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing truth, from whose mouth soever. I know the subtilty of Sathan and snare of Schismaticks hath ever been, as the Apostle saith, <hi>By good words, and fair speeches to deceive the hearts of the simple. By faigned words to make merchandize of you.</hi> Their chiefest project, and principal study is, with meretricious and painted Eloquence to entertain their followers; and whilest they fill their ears with delight, to instill into their Souls most poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned Doctrine. But the great Oratour <hi>Demosthenes</hi> can tell you, <hi>that the riches of</hi> Greece <hi>consist not in words;</hi> And the Apostle pronounceth, <hi>Not in lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tiness and sublimity of speech; not in the perswasible words of humane wisdom, are the Mysteries of Christ; but in the power of God, and Doctrine of the spirit.</hi> Be not therefore, be not (I beseech you) inveagled with the smooth tongue, or filed speech and stile of our new Novations, but consider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, weigh the Reasons, examine the proofs they all alleadge, and you shall finde such silly Arguments, such slender stuff, as <hi>Augustine</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61677:5"/>
espied in the eloquent and lofty discourses of <hi>Faustus Manichaeus,</hi> and the rest of his crew; when not regarding (as he saith) what gallant dish, or vessel of speech, but what food of knowledge he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto him; not hearkening to the sound of words, but to the pith of matter. Albeit they bragged much, and promised nothing more than Truth, Truth, yet he is discovered, as he witnesseth, <hi>No truth amongst them</hi>; nothing but lies, vanities, and vile supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The like shall you discern in some new upstart Professours of these times. For although they vaunt of the word of God, vaunt of Scriptures, and Scriptures onely seem to follow; yet because, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> teacheth, <hi>By the word of the Law they impugne the Law, framing their private sense, and construction to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the perversity of their mindes, by the Authority of the Law,</hi> It is more than evident they follow not the Oracles of God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fancies of their own brain, the suggestion of Sathan. <hi>For,</hi> by perverse interpretation (<hi>as</hi> Hierome <hi>testifieth</hi>) of the Gospel of Christ, is made the Gospel of man, or, which is worse, the Gospel of the Devil. <hi>And</hi> Martial <hi>the Poet speaketh to this purpose.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, they boast of their pure preaching of the word; whereas in this my small Treatise, and disproof of Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his errours, you shall discover, that some of them have no Authority to preach, no laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, no Mission, no Vocation; much less to Administer the Sacraments, which requireth the power of the Keyes. <hi>They are Theeves</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>who enter not by the door, but climb another way to steal, kill, and destroy your Souls.</hi> They are the false Prophets, who cry, <hi>Thus saith our Lord, when our Lord said it not, nor sent them,</hi> nor gave them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to speak. And the purity, of which they crack, is (as <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> declareth) <hi>A lying Vision, and Divination, and deceit, and beguiling of their heart, which they prophesie unto you. Thirdly,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61677:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They glory to have purged and Reformed the Church of many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; but you shall see their Reformations have been but abuses and innovations; they have broken the peace, departed from the unity of the flock of Christ. You shall finde their ancient Faith a <hi>new Belief,</hi> as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> said of the <hi>Arrians</hi>; their refined Doctrines meer Novelties, new broached Errours; Which I pray God, both you, and all others may have grace to discern in time, least you open your eyes, and begin to lament these things too late, as <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour did, of whom the same <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> writeth; <hi>That lying on his Death-bed, he repented him of three things; First, that he had commanded his Son in Law to be slain; the other, that he had nominated</hi> Iulian <hi>the</hi> Apostate <hi>to succeed him in his Imperial Throne; the third, that he had given ear to new devised Doctrines. And with these words, he yielded up the Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place ye live in (my beloved) hath formerly been the subject of Learned Authors pens, among whom Mr. <hi>William Lambard</hi> of <hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> Gentleman, in his book intituled <hi>A Perambulation of Kent,</hi> and published in the year 1576. was not unmindefull of you. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> out of Learned <hi>Nennius,</hi> forgot you not, when he derived the very name of the place wherein ye live, not so much from the Saxon <hi>Pylle,</hi> which is a plain floor, or Level, as from the <hi>British Dole,</hi> signifying a lower place, or Dale. <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at this place (being repulsed from Dover) with his Trenches upon your Coast (called <hi>Romes work</hi>) and his own report of you in his Commentaries hath made you known abroad. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight having shaken off the intolerable yoke of the Popish Tyranny, and espying that the Emperour was offended for the Divorce of Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> his wife, and that the <hi>French</hi> King had coupled the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> his Son to the Popes <hi>Niece,</hi> and married his Daughter to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> so that he might more justly suspect them all, than safely trust any one; and fearing least the ease and advantage of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending on Land at this part, should give occasion and hardiness to his enemies to invade him, amongst other Castles, Plat-forms, and Block-houses, which he builded in all needfull places; more especially gave strength to your place, and fame abroad by erecting near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:61677:6"/>
the three Fortifications of <hi>Sandown, Deal,</hi> and <hi>Walmer,</hi> which might at all times keep and beat the landing place. Yea, this special matter of <hi>Deal,</hi> Iohn Leland <hi>in Cygnea Cantione</hi> comprehendeth featly in these two verses.

            </p>
            <p>And soon after the building those Castles, which make you strong and renowned in the Authors verses, your place was further ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the landing of the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve.</hi> Oh since then Antiquity hath blazed abroad your Name, Writers of Fame have made your place the subject of their Pens, Princes have strengthened you with Turrets and Castles; Live you so in this your place of Fame, that for your godly lives you may be yet more famous; for your strength and greater renown: To your three Fortifications and Castles add yet one Tower more, and let it be that which wise <hi>Salomon</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth unto you, <hi>The name of the Lord is a strong Tower; the righteous run unto it, and are safe.</hi> Oh, Let this Name be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, be glorious among you; Let this Name be called upon by you with reverence, whilest too much irreverently it is spoken against, and reviled by others. Let this Name be your strength against all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, Let it be your strong Tower to run unto in all your fears and assaults of Sathan; and when Sathans Emissaries and Agents study the ruin of your Souls, be ye strong and safe under <hi>this holy and reverend Name,</hi> Psal. 111. vers. 9. And since Errours are rise, and begin to weaken our strength, and bonds of Love and Vnity, and some begin to creep in amongst you, to draw you from the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let me perswade you unto these things here following.</p>
            <p>First then, be real Christians; and think it not sufficient that you are Christians in name, and that you have a form of Godliness, but let Christs Name be great and glorious among you, be ye Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb facs="tcp:61677:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and walk in the power of Godliness, be ye true <hi>Nathanaels,</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites indeed; then, and never till then you are worth beholding and admiring, <hi>Behold, an Israelite indeed,</hi> Ioh. 1.47.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Get your judgements rightly informed; the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the eye and guide of the Soul; if that be corrupt, and do mislead you, you must needs fall into the ditch; If a disease get the brain, it is hardly cured; And hence the Learned observe, that Corruption in <hi>Judgement</hi> is worse than Corruption in <hi>Manners,</hi> especially, when the minde hath been enlightned with the Truth. Leprosie in the head was of all other Leprosies the most dangerous. He was unclean that had the Leprosie in his hands, or feet; but if it were in his head, then he was utterly unclean.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Get meek and humble Spirits; To these the Lord hath promised that he will teach them his way, when spiritual pride is punished with a fall. Hunt not after novelties, neither be wise above that which is written.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let your principal care be about practical fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, such as Faith, Obedience, a good Conscience, how you may mortifie your special Corruptions, and crucifie the flesh with its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and lusts. Live soberly in the use of the creature, religiously towards God, righteously and justly in all your dealings with the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>And finally I beseech you by all the tender mercies of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that you all minde the same things; Let there be no divisions, no Sects, no Schismes found amongst you; but labour to keep the Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. <hi>Paul</hi>'s farewell to his <hi>Corinthians</hi> shall be mine to you, <hi>Finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</hi> Which peace that ye may enjoy, it hath been the indeavour for above these five years, and shall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant prayer of him, who is the weakest of all his brethren, and the meanest in his Fathers house, even</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant what uncharitable censures will be east upon these innocent Meditations and the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them by some turbulent spirits. When first I took upon me to encounter with Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> in a publick Dispute, <hi>The poyson of Asps</hi> was presently perceived under the lips of some, <hi>whose mouths were full of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and bitterness.</hi> Others, since the Dispute, have spoken high, and threatned much, in case I should commit to the Press and to the view of the World what on the day of the Dispute was by Arguments strongly controverted, and weakly answered. And these later wait still to catch me in some false relation, either of Arguments, or Answers. Of both these I may say truely with the Poet.

               </gap>, <hi>what will this Babler say?</hi> And among many such Bablers (as they count us) I doubt not but they will place me, and even slight what here I propound to thy view (Courteous Reader) from the Scriptures themselves, and from such Syllogistical Demonstrations, as in the School of Logick I have been taught to frame. All which their slightings and unjust Censures I weigh them not, nor any more than I deserve them. <hi>Male de me loquutus es, quiabene loqui nescis.</hi> Some speak evil of their Neighbours, because they know not how to speak well of
<pb facs="tcp:61677:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any man; <hi>Hoc facis, non quod mercar, sed quod soleas</hi>; This they do, not because their Neighbour deserves it at their hands, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is their custom so to do. I have much observed in my far travails abroad, and of late at home, that commonly Authors of new devices are self-pleasing, and like onely their own inventions. I perceive it is in vain to perswade such. Easier it is to draw a prophane person from Hell-gates, than to remove an Opinion from a wilfull minde. Schisme (as a Learned man very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) is the ship whereon go aboard Malecontents, the windes, that set it foreward, are violent passions, Will is the Rudder, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie the Anchor. Schismaticks are head-strong, they will not see evident conviction; Self-love makes them judge the best of themselves, but their want of Charity very badly of others. They beguile themselves with a shew of piety, heat of affection, and with a strong apprehension of things greatly amiss in others. These can they see with both eyes, themselves with neither. No Church can pass them, wherein they cannot see a Rock of offence, and a stone to stumble at. The common Road of the best Reformed Churches is too foul for their sincerity. Our Arguments against them are paper shot, as they hold; but their weakest Reasons against us (if themselves may judge) are shot of Canon. They despise every mans indeavour against them, and are in admiration with their own works. Let any man confer with them, and they shall hear it; I my self have sufficient experience of it. By this might I be moved to cease this labour; but I am not hopeless to hold some men back, and to gain some also, though I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what is wholy already lost. If I might speed in both, I would be glad; if but in one, I am content; in both to loose my labour I cannot doubt. But from my Adversaries mouths I have been warned by some other friends, to take heed of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that they doubt not but that with the help of one, or two of their Scribes (who nimbly penned my Arguments and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them upon the day of Dispute before many hundred more) they shall have occasion to accuse me of false-hood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating my Arguments and the Answers to them; a meer policy (as I conceive) to stop my proceedings to the Press, which in truth
<pb facs="tcp:61677:8"/>
must witness, what Authority of Scripture hath been produced (hitherto to little purpose, for Conviction of a self-conceited peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and what slight Answers have been returned, to keep self conceitedness yet still on foot. But this threat and policie hath no whit daunted me from appearing in publick. True it is, I must confess, I have observed, that it hath alwayes been the usual trade and inveterate guile of Schismaticks in former times to corrupt, falsifie, and deprave, not onely the books and writings, but the words, sayings, and other conferences, which they have held with the Professours of the true Reformed Churches. <hi>Origen</hi> of old complained, how his books were thus abused by the enemies of God, and sowers of Cockle, even in his own dayes. <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Donatists</hi> being convicted of falshood in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with them, and did after maliciously calumniate &amp; traduce the sentence given against them, as falsly pronounced. The <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> were attainted of the like Crime. Of this fraud and deceit were guilty also those Popish Confederates, who being vanquished in the meeting at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> divulged not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding many false reports of their Triumph and Victory against <hi>Hunnius, Hailbronner,</hi> and the rest of their Reformed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Thus of late was Mr. <hi>Hart</hi> guilty, who after his Conference with Doctour <hi>Reynolds,</hi> having acknowledged and confessed to be true, what the said Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> was committing to the Press con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the said Conference, yet when it came to the light, M. <hi>Hart</hi> falsly and maliciously forged divers things to the credit of his own, and disadvantage of Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Cause, of which he never so much as dreamed. In which kinde, most notable and most fresh in memory is the pride and arrogancy of Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. <hi>Sweet,</hi> who impudently boasted of their supposed conquest in a meeting which they had with Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> and Dr. <hi>White</hi>; from which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless they cowardly fled, wholy discomfited and blotted with the ignominy of a desperate retreat. No less shamefull is the vanity of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> alias, <hi>Norrice,</hi> in bragging of the conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> which himself caused to be printed, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1624. beyond the Seas, and (as he saith) <hi>permissu Superiorum,</hi> which he stuffeth with such a heap of false and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:61677:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Relations, as he may seem (according to the Prophet) <hi>to have made lying to be protected,</hi> and his Superiours to yield unto it. Of these and such like <hi>Gregorie</hi> truely averreth, that, <hi>by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and disquisitions, they indeavour not so much to attain the truth, as to seem victorious</hi>; they more eagerly thirst after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of men, than the glory of God; <hi>they seek such things as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to themselves, not such as belong to</hi> Jesus Christ. Such boastings and beggings of a victory against me having already been spread abroad by a wilfull and self-conceited people, and threats divulged of accusing me of falshood in my Relation of my Conference with Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi>; I have (Gentle Reader) thought fit to give thee notice of the Subject of our Dispute, which were these three Propositions sent unto me by Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Parochial-Churches are Babylonish-Churches.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>We</hi> (i.e. <hi>The Church I serve in Christ) are the house of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Officiating Parish-Ministers are Babylonish.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Against the two first I propounded those Arguments, which in my Sermon thou mayest peruse; the answers were such as I do there also faithfully relate. True it is, I confess I have added more, than was spoken upon the day of our Dispute, yea, more Reasons and Arguments than that day were handled (the time being short) for the better inlarging my judgement, and for the better instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my people in points of so high a nature. Of the Dispute I shall give thee no further account, than what I give in my Sermon, which took up three Sabbath-dayes work; and I have conceived it might seem too much pressing the Press with the same Relation twice. What in my Sermons I relate concerning the Arguments Objected, and the Answers of Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> I have indeavoured to relate with a clear Conscience, as to the full substance, judging my self not bound to relate in particular every flying word in heat of Argument from him and from my self (which would be hard to perform, or remember) and to this purpose, that my Arguments may see the light, and the World may judge whither the Answers be satisfactory, or not; so that, in case they shall appear too slight and light, Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> may reply again in publick to all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars objected in my Sermon against him. All which that I might
<pb facs="tcp:61677:9"/>
perform more faithfully, I have intreated the Censures of three, or four able Divines, who were present at the Dispute; who having perused my writings, before I sent them to the Press, have judged them to contain nothing false, as contrary to the reality and truth of the Arguments and Answers upon the day of our publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Dispute.</p>
            <p>I leave thee therefore (Gentle Reader) to peruse this my small labour; I commend the Cause, as of great moment, to thy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; Weigh well the matter, judge of our Reasons, Answers and the Replies without partiality. Let thine upright heart affect, as thy right knowledge in every thing shall settle thy judgement &amp; convince thy conscience. I leave every one to their own liking, approve, or disallow, do their own will (so will men in these dayes) I am one in my self, to them indifferent. Let truth prevail, and God receive glorie, and his <hi>Zion</hi> prosper. Amen. Farewell.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rovidence (dearly Beloved in the Lord) hath fitly pointed out unto me this portion of Holy Writ in a seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time; you having seen and beheld this week past in this very place a great difference, and strugling of Judgements concerning <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Zion.</hi> Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two Nations, two manner of people strugling in the bowels of this Text, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau, Zion,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>; Yea, further behold how this strife and strugling disquiets the bowels of this Nation, which now lies groaning in its throws and pangs, in its agony and bloudy sweat, while two differing parties, pretending both to be the <hi>Zion</hi> of God, cry to be delivered from both practises, and errours of wicked and cursed <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh that we might fall into a devout agony and penitent sweat! Oh if we cannot sweat bloud, that we might sweat tears! Oh that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pore of our body might be a weeping eye, a crying, a praying mouth, to beg a safe delivery for our labouring Mother, who travails in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of her spirit! God formerly comforted <hi>Rebekah</hi> in the like case to ours at present, when <hi>Genes.</hi> 25. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. <hi>The Lord said unto her, two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels.</hi> Oh that the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort may be afforded unto us from the God of all comfort! Let it be our hearty and earnest prayer, that either <hi>Babylon</hi> may be separated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of the bowels of <hi>Zion</hi>; or <hi>Zion</hi> delivered out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh let us blow off the ashes from our Zeal, let us inflame our hearts with sad, but fervent devotion. Sure if (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> dreamed) our Soul were but an exhalation, the heat of our devotion would melt it into one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible tear; Our Soul would be its own tear, and we might well weep out our eyes and Souls together in these dayes of strife and strugling.</p>

                  </gap>lf, O</hi> Zion.</p>
            <p>The words of the Prophet present unto our serious consideration two things very observeable.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That it is sometimes the hard Lot of</hi> Zion <hi>and the people of God, to dwell with the Daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and among such whose Practises and Principles are</hi> Babylonish <hi>and</hi> Antichristian. This point is so clear by our own experience, that I shall not need to explain, or confirm it. So I will let that pass and hasten to the second.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obs.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That</hi> Zion <hi>must take all fair opportunities, and use all lawfull means to deliver her self from</hi> Babylon, <hi>and from those practises and errours, which are</hi> Babylonish, <hi>or any way</hi> Antichristian.</p>
            <p>For the better opening the point, I shall speedily (having in other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions more largely cleared unto you the extents of <hi>Zion</hi>) now again walk the Rounds, and survey the Bounds of <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> By <hi>Zion</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet means the people of God, whose hearts were set on <hi>Zion</hi> (as <hi>Bernard</hi> observes, <hi>Anima est ubi amat, non ubi animat</hi>) because God had of old set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p his Ordinances there, and made them a gracious promise, that they should return thither again, and enjoy him once more in the beauty, the glorie of holiness. There were two Mounts which did belong unto <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> and Mount <hi>Zion</hi>; Though the Temple was built upon Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> yet till that time the <hi>Ark</hi> of God was placed in <hi>Zion,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. compared with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and there was said to dwell; And therefore <hi>Zion</hi> was the Mount of Holiness, and as it were the Throne of God here below; Thither did the people flock, <hi>Micah.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Come and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, for the Law shall go forth of</hi> Zion; where you may plainly see that <hi>Zion</hi> is the Mountain of the Lord. But further we must consider, that besides the Jewish <hi>Zion,</hi> there is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Zion</hi> spoken of in the Prophets. Yea, this very place of <hi>Micah</hi> now cited points at the Christian <hi>Zion,</hi> a Church consisting of all Nations, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as well as Jews, if you please to peruse and well consider the words, which are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the last dayes it shall come to pass, that the Mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the Mountains, and it shall be exalted above the Hills, and people shall flow unto it; and many Nations shall come and say, Let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord,</hi> verses 1.2. That this is me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt of the Christian <hi>Zion,</hi> the 12. verse of the third Chapter of this Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> doth sufficiently declare in these words, <hi>Therefore shall</hi> Zion <hi>for your sake be plow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mountains of the house as the high places of the forrest.</hi> Which being spoken of <hi>Zion</hi> in the Letter, was to be fulfilled in the last dayes, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. And whereas in the second verse he saith: <hi>The Law shall go forth of</hi> Zion, he must be understood of the Christian <hi>Zion</hi> (for to the <hi>Iews</hi> the Law came forth of <hi>Sinai</hi>) when the Spirit was plentifully powred down upon some of all Nations at <hi>Hierusalem, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 4.5. So <hi>Paul</hi> also writes unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 12. <hi>vers.</hi>18. <hi>You are not come unto the Mount that burned with fire,</hi> and <hi>verse</hi> 22. <hi>But ye are come unto Mount</hi> Zion; which the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth yet more fully, <hi>Galat.</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 24. compared with the 26. and 31. verses. And these are briefly the Bounds of <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for a shorter view of <hi>Babylon</hi>; Omitting to speak of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> my Text points to <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Assyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cum in</hi> Babylone <hi>versa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, &amp; purpuratae meretricis essem Colonus, ac Iure Quiritium viverem,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, we need not travail so far as <hi>Rome</hi> to finde out <hi>Babylon.</hi> Is there not an <hi>English Babylon</hi> here at home? Are there not among us untruths taught, and practised expresly against the Rule of the Scriptures, against the word of Christ, against the examples of the best Reformed Churches that ever were Reformed from <hi>Babylonish</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> Rites, Ceremonies, Principles, and Practises? But finally if we will be impartial in the search of all the Bounds of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we shall certainly finde nearer yet within our selves somewhat of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh are there not some malignant lusts, some Brats of <hi>Babylons</hi> in our bosoms, for the which we are unhappy, because we have not taken them and dashed them against the stones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 137. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Are there not within our hearts hid some <hi>Babylonish</hi> garments, though they be the rotten rags of our own righteousness, <hi>Isai</hi> 64. vers. 6. Are there not hid within us some Golden wedges, some Golden sins, some <hi>dilecta delicta,</hi> some beloved ones, from the which we are loath to be dissolved, that we may be with Christ? Thus you see the Bounds of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the Bounds of <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what reasons might move the Jewish <hi>Zion</hi> to deliver herself from the Assyrian <hi>Babylon</hi>; you shall finde the same calling upon the Christian <hi>Zion</hi> to deliver herself from all those ways, and practises, which may be found Babylonish or Antichristian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reas.</hi> Should not <hi>Zion</hi> separate from <hi>Babylon</hi> having so many Calls of God to that purpose; Were not the people sufficiently awakened by <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi> Prophecy?

Proclamation.</hi> Behold a call from God, a call from the Prophet, and a call from the King; whereby doubtless the Lord did also stir up the Spirit of his people to answer this Call, and depart from <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you may see in those of the Captivity, who immediately went up to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> under the conduct of their General <hi>Zerubbabel, Ezra</hi> 2.

And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes, Nehemiah</hi> began to stir and call those lingerers behinde, <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so you see call upon call, Which hath not been wanting to the Christian <hi>Zion</hi> of God, especially in <hi>England,</hi> where since so many new opinions have been broached amongst us with such difference and Antipathy of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as is well known unto you, the true Orthodox, faithfull and zealous Ministers of the Gospel have most earnestly, both from the Press and the Pulpit, called upon the people to deliver themselves from <hi>Babylonish, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi> untruths and practises, which have no warrant from any word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reas.</hi> But secondly Gods people have great reason to separate from <hi>Babylon,</hi> if the dwelling in <hi>Babylon</hi> were well considered by them. <hi>Barthold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And was it fit that the people of God should lie loytering in the Citie of the Devil? <hi>Babylon</hi> was a place of slavery, the sink of sin, the stall of beasts, the Throne of Idols, the Temple of Devils, and Mother of confusion. No place more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well might Gods people be weary of such a loathsom prison, and noisom dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which could not but be offensive by its stench and darkness. And the like should move the Christian people of God to forsake whatsoever may relish, or favour of Mystical and <hi>Antichristian Babylon,</hi> which by <hi>Iohn</hi> is called, <hi>The hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hatefull Bird, Revel.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 2.

Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there God hath commanded not onely his blessing (as I said before) but especially life for evermore, <hi>As the dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of</hi> Zion; <hi>for there the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blessing, even life for evermore,</hi> Psal. 133. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. Behold (beloved) the place to which Gods people are called from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh what Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in <hi>Babylon,</hi> what Bond-slave to sin and Sathan, what wretch ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Antichristian darkness would not willingly shake off his shackles, and with <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 12. Chap. Come out of a Prisons darkness to enjoy such liberty, such light, such comforts, such security, such blessings, such salvation, such Amnesty and general pardon, such tydings and news from heaven, such protections, such sorts of salvation, such presence of Grace, such Soul-feastings, Soul-banquetings, as out of Scripture I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto you from <hi>Zion</hi>? Who would be any longer a loytering Jew in <hi>Babylon?</hi> Who would hanker after any Antichristian practices, dote any longer upon any Anti-scripture untruths, serve man, serve times, serve self-ends to endanger his Soul, to be wedded to ignorance, to forfeit <hi>Zions</hi> Jewels, riches, blessings, yea life for evermore?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reas.</hi> But fourthly, The Prophet stirs up the people to deliver themselves from <hi>Babylon</hi> upon this ground and reason. God had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all rubs, he had opened the <hi>Kings</hi> heart, and the prison doors. If they would be active, it was in their own power to deliver themselves;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61677:13"/>
and therefore the Prophet calls upon them to use their power, and to take that fair opportunity which was offered for their deliverance, and their glory, <hi>Deliver thy self O</hi> Zion. As if he should say, thy shackles are knockt off, the Ports are open, the Commission is now sealed, Come out, be not cruell to thy self. What wilt thou be thine own torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, thine own prisoner? Before the seventy years were expired, thou wast detained in <hi>Babylon,</hi> thou wast a prisoner there, but now thy time is out, and therefore if thou stayest longer yet, thou art not a prisoner, but a dweller in <hi>Babylon, Deliver thy self, O</hi> Zio, <hi>that dwellest in</hi> Babylon; In which word the Prophet seems to put the Emphasis, and strength of his exhortation. And so indeed all Christians may be said to dwell willingly in sin and ignorance, when truth being cleared unto them, all scruples removed, Adversaries objections answered, fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shadows under a pretence of substantiall truths discovered, yet, to please men, to maintain faction, to uphold Schisme, to carry on further their spight and malice against the Ministery, they will live in errors, grope in darkness, follow blinde leaders, dwell in Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au practises, and continue Members of such societies (under a pretence of the house of God) whose foundation is not unmoveable like <hi>Zions,</hi> nor of materials taken out of the Scripture word, or example of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the next builders the Apostles. And thus (beloved) having cleared my Doctrine, and by four reasons shewed unto you, why <hi>Zion</hi> must take all fair opportunities, and use all lawfull means to deliver her self from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and from those practises and errours which are Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, or any way Antichristian, I come to use and Application, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I shall spend more time than in the explication, and inlarge my poor and weak indeavours for your better instruction and information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these two chief terms in my text <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Vse.</hi> Is it so that <hi>Zion</hi> must separate and deliver her self from <hi>Babylon?</hi> Then my first use shall be of search and inquiry into <hi>Zion</hi> and into <hi>Babylon.</hi> For how can Gods people deliver themselves from <hi>Babylon,</hi> if they be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true <hi>Zion,</hi> and of the errors and Antichristian practises of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Oh what a grief is it to think how in these times the true <hi>Zion</hi> is mistaken, unknown, yea by seducing spirits even termed <hi>Babylon</hi>! Oh (beloved) if so many blessings, comforts, Soul-feastings (as I have shewed unto you) belong to <hi>Zion,</hi> what enquiry, what search ought we all then to make to finde out this true <hi>Zion,</hi> that our Souls may not be deprived of the blessing and life for evermore, which God hath en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My conscience leads me to this work, the spirit commands me to clear this point unto you; &amp; though some Adversaries do threaten me with stones as the <hi>Iews</hi> did <hi>Christ,</hi> and to heave me out of this place, to deprive me and mine of the lively-hood I

here enjoy, because with Scripture and reasons I oppose their contrary judgements; yet I must not be unfaithfull to that trust and charge, which from my Master <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> I have over your Souls. I may say with <hi>Paul, I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly,</hi> Acts 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. and <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsell of God</hi> these five years together; and therefore, though now so much threatned by some, I resolve to say with <hi>Paul</hi> in the worst triall of my Adversaries spight and malice, <hi>None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that I might finish my work w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But not for my trust over your Souls onely shall I make a large search into <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> but also for mine own Souls sake, so dear unto me, that I must ingenuously confess before you, that for the saving of it I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto forsaken the pleasures of sin and <hi>Egypt,</hi> which for twelve years I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the parts of <hi>America,</hi> from whence the Lord in mercy hath brought me to his marvellous light, <hi>unto Mount Zion, and unto the Citie of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and to an innumerable companie of angels to the generall assembly and Church of the first born,</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. For the which <hi>Zion</hi> I have forsaken all kindred after the flesh; and in the which <hi>Zion</hi> I acknowledge to have enjoyed these fourteen years many sweet comforts, many Soul-feasts and banquets. And now to hear from Mr. <hi>Charles Nichols,</hi> that neither you nor I belong to this <hi>Zion,</hi> but rather unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> hath so much troubled me, that I could not in conscience shun a publick dispute with him about it, resolving with my self, that (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many steps as may be in nine thousand miles, which through Gods mercy I have travailed to finde out <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) if he could shew me by the word on step further out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> cheerfully to go out of her, and according to my present observation from <hi>Zechariahs</hi> Counsel, to loyter no longer about <hi>Babylon,</hi> but to take so fair an opportunity to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my self and you also from whatsoever he might prove to be Babylonish in our Church and worship. Let us therefore (beloved) with care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for our Souls good, search the Scripture, and in them search out <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>; and what the last Thursday want of time allowed us not; let us again examine Mr. <hi>Charles Nichols</hi> his three Propositions, as stated by him against us, against our Parochiall Churches, and against ours and all Parish officiating Ministers; affirming further his Congregation separated from us and our Parochiall meetings to be the true house of God; which in these words he thus laies down.</p>

You may then remember, that my first Syllogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me was from the essential parts constituting and describing a Parochial <hi>Babylonish,</hi> or <hi>Romish</hi> Church, in the Major, or first Proposition; And in the Minor, or second Proposition, shewing that those parts were not to be found in our Parochial Churches, and then concluding our Parochial Churches not to be <hi>Babylonish,</hi> thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Argument.</hi> A Parochial <hi>Babylonish Romish</hi> Church is a people living under obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi>; gathered together under the Advocation, or Patronage of some particular <hi>Popish</hi> Saint; for whose greater glory on his day yearly they enjoy from <hi>Rome</hi> pardon of sins and Indulgences; Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated under a <hi>Popish</hi> Priest, whose Mass they hear, to whom au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But our Parochial Churches are not a people living under obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor gathered together under the Advocation, or Patronage of any particular <hi>Popish</hi> Saint, nor for any such Saints greater glory on his day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying from <hi>Rome</hi> pardon of sins and Indulgences; nor congregated under any <hi>Popish</hi> Priests, whose Mass they hear, to whom Auricularly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and from whose hands they once a year at least receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper under transubstantiated Bread and Wine.</p>

But at last as to the Major he answered, that for his part he could not certainly tell, whether the particulars in it were true, or no. To which I replied, that he could not safely call us <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish,</hi> if he knew not what was practised in <hi>Babylon</hi>; And further that if as a

What else mean those Titles from old to our meeting places at <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thirdly I told him, he could not be so ignorant as not to know that the people there were congregated under Mass-mongers and <hi>Popish</hi> Priests, and that by them Mass was said before the people, and that they did hear the peoples Confessions of their sins and did absolve them; And lastly, that it was by all known, and therefore could not be unknown to him, that Transubstantiation of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Bloud of Christ was one of the gross errours of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus helping Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his memory with a rehearsal of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in my Argument, I brought him with much ado to grant my Major, or first Proposition defining a Parochial <hi>Romish</hi> Church. But when I drove on to the second Proposition, the Minor, his Conscience began to be troubled for calling us <hi>Babylonish</hi>; and finding those parts describing a <hi>Romish Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish</hi> Church not to agree truely with our Parochial Churches; without any formal granting, denying, or distinguishing, he confessed he did not intend to call us <hi>Babylonish</hi> in such a sense as my Major Proposition did describe.</p>
            <p>At this his Confession squeezed from him by the rack of my Syllogisme, you may remember (beloved) my expression to you (for indeed I desire in truth to lay before you the substance of our dispute, till I come to add a further Comentary unto it) I turning my face &amp; body to you and to the rest of the people, wished you not to be dejected in spirit; for now by M. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Confession, it appears we are not so <hi>Babylonish</hi> as we though he judged us to be; and bending my speech to him again, I told him it appeared then that he did falsly term and denominate us <hi>Babylonish,</hi> which I proved thus:</p>

            <p>This <hi>Lion</hi> (if you well remember beloved) pulled Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> upon his back, and so tore and tormented him, that he knew not well how to be rid of him; in so much that I, perceiving he intended again to make long Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his refuge (wherewith indeed he much takes the people and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs before them) cried out for a formal answer, and to disprove (if he could) my first, or second Proposition, that so the stream of my Syllogismes (as had been agreed on before our dispute) might run forward. But when I saw no answer would be given in form, I wished you and the rest of the people to take notice, that no satisfaction was given to the strong <hi>Lions</hi> Argument. For indeed hitherto Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> never discovered himself for what reason, or upon what ground he so publickly had asserted our Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches to be <hi>Baby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which he replied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, that <hi>as Parishes</hi> we were <hi>Babylonish.</hi> Against which reply of his, I formed this following Syllogism.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Argument.</hi> If <hi>qua Parishes</hi> we are <hi>Babylonish,</hi> then the Constitution of <hi>Parishes</hi> must needs be <hi>Babylon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ergo. <hi>Qua Parishes</hi> we are not <hi>Babylonish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here like a Schollar (without Orations) he answered me in form, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Major Proposition, and denied my Minor, which I immediately proved thus:</p>

            <p>I beseech you (beloved) take notice of the Succession of these several Syllogismes; and as you tender your consciences, and desire truely to continue in <hi>Zion,</hi> judge impartially whether these Arguments do not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free our Parishes, <hi>qua Parishes,</hi> in the constitution of them from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of christianity, from any Babylonish corruption, by Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> scandalously and erroneously imputed to us.</p>
            <p>Having thus with undeniable Arguments pursued him, driven him from hedge to hedge, discovered his false refuges, and as yet not discovered in our Parochiall Churches any thing that might justly deserve that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Brand of Babylonish, finding yet no satisfaction given to my Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes, and challenging the impartiall judgement of the people, whether or no upon such slight answers the ignominious title of Babylonish were to be fixed upon our Churches. But at last out of School-form he breaks out into his usuall Orations, declaring his meaning thus, that we were Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, <hi>qua mixed,</hi> as consisting of all sorts, wicked and good together. And this was his last refuge, &amp; a pretty one indeed, for to unchurch a people, because some wicked are among them. I must needs acknowledge that from Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his acute wit, I expected some deeper and wittier reason to prove our Parochiall Churches Babylonish beyond a mixture of good and bad together. Alas! Is it such a property to <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> onely to have mixed congregations, that wheresoever such are, they must need be known by this name Babylonish, and no other? If upon no other ground we are to be called Babylonish, but because we have some wicked amongst us, he might as well have said, our Parochial Churches are <hi>Danish</hi> Churches, <hi>Swedish</hi> Churches, <hi>Polandish</hi> Churches, <hi>Dutch, German</hi> C<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But before I rehearse unto you my Arguments against this refuge, I pray take notice from hence, that if we are Babylonish because mixed, good, wicked and bad together; it followeth from this Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Babylon</hi> then and <hi>Rome</hi> is mixed of good, bad and wicked together, and so he grants some good in <hi>Babylon</hi> as well as among us, or else we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be like to them in our mixture, without they also be mixed. But to this I shall speak hereafter. Thus then having taken away the covering from the face of Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his intention and meaning, and fully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon what ground we are <hi>Babylonish,</hi> I told him, I would prove by Scripture that a people under corruption may yet be called truely a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Church of God; and so the corruptions of the wicked amongst us to be no lawfull Plea against our Parochial Churches; which Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, I proceeded forward to a Syllogisme, thus:</p>

            <p>In the 32. of <hi>Exodus, verse</hi> 11. <hi>Moses</hi> calls the <hi>Israelites</hi> the people of God. But in the 1 and 6 <hi>verses</hi> they are observed to be a people not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the wickedness of the World, but at that time were in the height of corruption, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them off. A pretty evasion; as if God were bound to a people never so corrupt; as if love to one people must make him wink at their corruptions, and notwithstanding their gross corruptions, to own them and call them his people. And why may not we plead as much love to us since Christ exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited? Why must we be cast off from being a people and Church of Christ, because some corruptions and corrupt Members are amongst us? Is God an accepter of persons, or of one people more than of another?

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> thought fit to breath a little after my hot pursuing him, and turning his coat of a Defendant into an Opponent (though against the practise of all School Disputants) propounded a few Arguments of little worth to my Moderator, all to that purpose of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>What concord hath</hi> Christ <hi>with</hi> Belial? <hi>Or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols?</hi> To which my Moderator answered both learnedly and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly, insisting upon the same Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> unto the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and to the Saints at <hi>Corinth</hi>; and yet (as he shewed) there were amongst them many wicked and corrupt persons, as I shall hereafter shew from some particulars. I confess (besides much froth and shadows of truth) the most that I could observe in Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Arguments to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, was a kinde of wondering exclamations against wickedness and against corruptions in a Church, as if he knew not any difference between a visible, and an invisible Church, nor would take any notice of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions shewed unto him in the visible Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to the very last end of his Argunents wondring at our prophaneness in affirming cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and wickedness possible in a Church and people of God.

But no answer to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> all this while.

            <p>Having (I say) thus shewed him the height of Popery in, and out of <hi>England,</hi> and still a party dissenting from the gross errours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in them a light of a Church and people of God, he aiming at those abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought in and setled (as he imagined) without any party dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> as from other Councels, would needs frame his Argument from Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Object.</hi> In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes there were no Churches in <hi>England.</hi> Ergo: Now Parochial Churches are <hi>Babylonish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument (beloved) concludes nothing in the consequence; for suppose there had been no Church, or people professing the truth, doth it therefore follow; Ergo, now there can be no Parochial Churches. He might as well have argued thus. People in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes believed not; Ergo, People now do not believe; Or, People then were Papists in <hi>England,</hi> Ergo, now they are not Protestants, and then what shall we say of Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his believing people? Even such is this Argument; <hi>In Queen</hi> Maries <hi>dayes there were no Churches; Ergo, now Parochial Churches are</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish. But, to let my Opponent go on with more such Enthymema's; I denied his Antecedent, shewing him that in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes there was a glorious Church of believers, who witnessed their Faith with the bloud of Martyrdom, as the Stories tell us of <hi>Cranmer, Brad-ford, Taylor</hi>; Yea, some tell us of eight hundred innocents, whose lives in the space of less than four years, that cruel Popish Queen sacrificed unto her idols. Yea, such was the abundance of true believers and Protestants in those dayes, that as a fruitfull Vine they were spread abroad also into <hi>Germany, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and a Church of <hi>English</hi> true believers was apparent at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61677:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from whence came Godly Bishops that setled our Churches in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. But then he went on a little more Schollar like in suiting his consequent with his Antecedent, though still fallaciously, thus:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes Parochial Churches were <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>; Ergo, Now Parochial Churches are <hi>Babylonish.</hi> I might well have granted here his Antecedent, for ought any true illation from it to these times; it proving nothing, but that we must needs be now as our Fathers were in those dayes; which is a false illation; for though there were no Churches then, there may be Churches now; &amp; though Parochial Churches then were <hi>Babylonish,</hi> yet Parochial Churches now may not be <hi>Babylonish,</hi> neither <hi>qua,</hi> as <hi>Churches,</hi> neither <hi>qua,</hi> as <hi>Parochial</hi>; As <hi>Churches,</hi> the people being converted; As <hi>Parochial,</hi> it having been already shewed, that <hi>Parishes</hi> as <hi>Parishes</hi> were no invention of Antichrist; which distinction Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> all along his Arguments and answers seems much to mistake, or forget, varying these terms as he pleaseth, sometimes insisting upon the word <hi>Churches,</hi> as when the Argument of the ancient Coustitution of Parishes before Antichrist convinced him, he then falls to the word <hi>Churches, qua</hi> as <hi>mixed</hi> Congregations. So here from <hi>Churches</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, he falls to <hi>Parishes</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. But to try further what this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster would bring forth, <hi>In Queen</hi> Maries <hi>dayes Parochial Churches were</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish; <hi>Ergo, now Parochial Churches are</hi> Babylonish. I distinguished the Antecedent, to that word <hi>Churches</hi> (supposing what was left behinde, as Parishes they were not <hi>Babylonish.</hi>) They were <hi>Babylonish,</hi> or <hi>Popish</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, I denied the Antecedent; They were <hi>Babylonish,</hi> or <hi>Popish,</hi> as the whole Land (wherein were some Protestants in all corners dissenting from <hi>Babylonish</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> principles) I granted the Antecedent. And this (beloved) I doubt not but it will appear unto you most true, that where eight hundred in less than four years suffered Martyrdom, they were not all taken out of one Parish, but out of several Parishes in the Land; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus I can further prove unto you Protestants to have been then in Parishes from the instance of a Parish not far from us in this part of <hi>Kent,</hi> where I am informed by a Neighbour of this Parish, that he often heard his own Father relate from his Grand Fathers mouth, that in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes there lived in that Parish a <hi>Priest</hi> named <hi>Stacie</hi>; and that many times his Father and his Fathers Brothers going to Church and observing M. <hi>Stacy</hi> his superstitious ceremonies in the Church and at the Altar, would go home to their Father telling, &amp; relating to him; Father, Mr. <hi>Stacie</hi> in the Church doth sprinkle his face with water, makes crosses with his fingers upon his

But as if this known truth were not satisfactory, Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> following his usual way of Arguments (as I have observed in him) either changing new terms, or not minding what hath been granted, denied, or distinguished, gives a sudden leap from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence fetcheth a reply thus:</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> In those dayes Parochial Churches were subject to <hi>Rome.</hi> Ergo, In those dayes Parochial Churches were <hi>Babylonish.</hi> All this being answered before in substance, carried not his Argument one step further than it was gone before, though he went so many steps to fetch it. Who doubts, but then the major part were subject to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so were <hi>Babylonish?</hi> But here is no reply to what had been distinguished of the Martyrs, of the holy remnant in those dayes, who would not be subject to <hi>Rome.</hi> But perceiving what a formal Disputant I had to deal with, I grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all (according to my former distinction) and let him run on to this ensuing Enthymema.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Object. Rome</hi> then was no Church. Ergo, <hi>England</hi> then was no Church. Here you see again, how Parishes are laid aside, and the word <hi>Church</hi> (as if his terms were now altered from Parochial Churches to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church) is revived.</p>
            <p>But here though I might again have answered with my former distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Godly remnant in <hi>England,</hi> and shewed him that though <hi>Rome</hi> was not a Church then, yet there was a Church and people of God in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The ground therefore whereon at present I say this Opinion may be grounded, and by me was truely intended when I answered Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> saying that <hi>Rome</hi> was, and was not a Church, in several respects, was this.</p>
            <p>First. Although it be true that the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> convocated in the year 1547. did desperately wound the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; first, in that it did heighten and multiply her damnable errours. Secondly, in that it did draw all the poison into one entire monster and body of errour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it all to the world as the Doctrine of the Church. Yet as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting parties from other councels, setling the Popes Supremacy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in one kinde, of worshipping of images, disallowing the use of the Bible to the people, forbidding Priests to marry, and in <hi>England</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Wickliffs</hi> Tenents (as I have shewed before) were ground suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to discover a party, a people, a Church in <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> himself opposed not, but rather seem to grant it) then the like may be said since the councel of <hi>Trent</hi>; for if any have opposed, or dissented from, or disallowed that councel, they must be said to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow those damnable errours, that poison drawn into one entire monster and body of errour. But many there are who have opposed, dissented
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61677:21"/>
from, and disallowed that councel. Ergo, They must be said 'to disallow those damnable errours, that poison drawn into one entire monster, and body of errour. The Minor is known to such as have travailed beyond the Seas, and no doubt to all learned Divines, who have perused such Bookes, as do lay down the State of <hi>Rome</hi> since the councel; Wherein they shall finde, that the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> to this day hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that councel; besides many other learned Divines, and among them the whole University of the <hi>Sorbonites</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who unanimously and strongly maintain the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to Kings, Princes, Governours of Nations against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and so vigorously have opposed the <hi>Popes</hi> supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy voted in the councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> that had not <hi>Vrban the Eight</hi> comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Court of <hi>Paris</hi> when <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> was in his height of command and prosperity, either he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etled by it. The same Oath of Allegiance hath been vigorously maintained and the <hi>Popes</hi> supremacy strongly denied these many years in <hi>England</hi> by some also of the Popish Religion, as by Mr. <hi>Roger Widrington in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> but especially by the order of the <hi>Bendictines,</hi> amongst whom <hi>Price</hi> the superiour of that family in <hi>England,</hi> and before him <hi>Doctor Preston</hi> a Prisoner formerly in the <hi>Clinke,</hi> who being excommunicated by the <hi>Pope</hi> for his opinion, was by <hi>King Iames</hi> protected against the <hi>Pope,</hi> the like Sir <hi>William Howard,</hi> otherwise a Papist, hath opposed in print all these, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the councel of <hi>Trents</hi> determination as a point of faith, and disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Popes</hi> thundering out excommunications against them. Besides these, what dissenting parties must needs be there, whereas many confess among them, that were it not for that rack of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> they would oppose many practises among them, and many Canous of <hi>Trent</hi> (as truly I have heard many of their Priests and Divines say) which now for fear they dare not do.</p>
            <p>But secondly doth not Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> say the like? when first he calls <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when he sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th that we are <hi>Babylonish,</hi> because <hi>mixed,</hi> good and bad together. But we cannot thus be called <hi>Babylonish,</hi> except there be amongst us in this respect, what is also in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit, good and bad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Ergo, he acknowledgeth that in Romish <hi>Babylon</hi> there are good and bad together. Then further, thus I reason; Good people are Gods people, and Gods Church. But by him in <hi>Rome</hi> there are good people. Ergo, By his own Assertion, in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> there is a people and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61677:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church of God. Then further yet thus; if there be good people amongst them, as he implies in his Assertion, I argue then from the Philosopher, <hi>Verum &amp; bonum convertun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur, True and good are Convertible, and mutually predicable one of the oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi>; so that where <hi>true</hi> is, <hi>good</hi> is also. But good people are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound among them; Ergo, True people found also among them. Then thus; Good people are a good Church in that respect wherein they are good, and true people are a true Church in that respect wherein they are true. Ergo, In <hi>Rome</hi> the good and true people in that respect wherein they are good and true, are in that same respect a good and true Church of God. Then further in my judgement (laying aside Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> his ground for their goodness) they are good and true in no other respect, but in respect of some substantials of truth, in respect they believe in Christ born, dead, risen, and ascended into Heaven, in respect they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Gospel as from him, Baptisme as his Ordinance, Ordination by imposition of hands by the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sbytery as his institution. Ergo, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some substantials they are a good, and true Church.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, I confess I cannot tell how to uphold a lawfull succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Ordination from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

For had not Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then been held in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For a true and lawfull and right effect must proceed from a true, lawfull, and right cause. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>go, if your Ministers ordination, and our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers baptisme were a true, lawfull, &amp; right effect, it proceeded from a true, lawfull &amp; right cause. Then thus; But such as were formerly the immediate cause of the effect of our Reformed Ministers Ordination, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cause of our first reforming Fore-fathers Baptisme, were such as lived before them in Popery; Ergo, in time of Popery there was a true, lawfull, and right cause of the effect of Ordination and Baptism. Then further; The Bishops and Priests in time of Popery were not true, lawfull, and right in the superstitions of Oy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, Chrisme, Unction, Spittle and other Rites and Ceremonies, which against the word of God they had added to Ordination and Baptisme.

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61677:22"/>I answer that Antichrist hath been working these many years by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and although in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> he wrought more than in any Councel ever before; Yet still he may (if God will permit him to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he should prevail with all dissenting parties to yield to his supremacy, and to his Arbitrary power and Command; and worser yet, if he should deny that Jesus Christ is come in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lesh or if he should deny the words and Gospel to be from Christ, and to be a means for the working of Faith; or if he should ruine all substantials, from which as yet he hath not wholy apostatized. Secondly, If now there be no Church in <hi>Rome quoad substantiam,</hi> or in any substantials, since the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent,</hi> I demand then of Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> whether if ever he converted any Papist to his Church, he did baptize him again, or no? Or, whether in case he should convert any such, he would baptize him again, or no? If he say, he would baptize him again; I say that others far more learned and wiser than he, whom in these latter dayes, long since the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> have converted from Popery more Souls than ever he hath converted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor have baptized such again.

               </gap>all from God to the Reformed Church of <hi>England.</hi> But if Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> do say with the wiser and more learned, that he would not baptize such an one again; I demand then of Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> why he is baptized already, or not baptized. If not baptized, he ought to baptize him again; if baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; then his baptism is a true effect of some true cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e. But this cause was no true cause in the use of superstitious Oyls, Unctions, and other unlawfull Ceremonies; Ergo, he was a true cause of the effect of that mans bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But fourthly. Yet in <hi>Rome</hi> the name of Christ and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ergo, in a substantial acknowledgement of Christ they are true; Or, <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> in respect of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> they are good and true. Or else surely the Title of Learned Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> his book, called <hi>The holy War, and the holy State,</hi> is false; wherein he treats of the Christians Wars against the <hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61677:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against the enemies of Christ, that the name of Christ might be propagated and confessed, where it was most hated and blasphemed; and this work by all Writers is called a <hi>holy work.</hi> Then I infer; that where such holy indeavours are for Christs name, and the propagation of it, there Christ in substantials is acknowledged; and to confess and acknowledge Christ is some part and Character of a people and Church of God. Ergo, They are a Church in some part, and in some substantials of a Church.</p>
            <p>But fifthly, I answer that this my opinion is no such strange Doctrine, as Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> and some others would judge it to be.

This is a sad thing, and surely, if rightly apprehended, must sit sadly upon the spirits of some. Now when our Churches are coming up out of the wilderness, now that they begin

to boyl out their scum! now that they begin to be more refined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, now to forsake them! truly this is no small aggravation to this desertion. For Mariners at sea to forsake their ship, when she is ready to sinke (though it may be an errour, possibly an over-sight in them so to do) yet it is pardonable. But if the ship shall begin to rise and float again, so as they see apparent hopes that with a little pumping she may be saved, now to leave her (much more to cut holes in her sides) their owners will give there little thanks for it. Some years since the Church of God amongst us seemed to be in a sinking condition, then to leave her might be pardonable; but now that through the mercy of God she begins to be somewhat float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and boyant, so as a little industry &amp; paines in the pumping and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may free her and save her, now to desert her, or (which is worse) to cut holes in her Surely, surely never was separation from a Church so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable. Can our separation from <hi>Rome</hi> so warrantable (it being from a Church growing worse and worse, more and more corrupt) be a president to separate from a Church reforming, growing better and better?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Object.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> replies and Objects that we are mixed with many wicked and corrupt livers, we exclude none from our communions; therefore he and his people cannot sit down with us; for <hi>what concord hath</hi> Christ <hi>with Belial?</hi> Though otherwise the Doctrine be good and sound, and much corruption have been purged out, yet we cannot joyn with the wicked.</p>

            <p>But to all such I answer, first acknowledging that indeed it was never my practise or judgment freely without any discretion to admit to the Communion of the Lords supper any scandalous person, or notoriously wicked liver in a Parish; but have always judged it fit for a time to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend such an one till some amendment be observed, some reformation publickly seen in his life &amp; conversation.

Of such <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that under the colour of faith, they break in sunder the bond of fellowship.

               </gap>; for that they cut in sunder the unity of the Church by this their departing. And in the same place he absolutely affirms, that neither difference in doctrine, vices of the Mininisters, lewd life of them that live in the Church, the coming of all sorts hand over head to the Supper of the Lord, and further proves all these to be no lawfull causes to forsake the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> And least any should Object the want of Ecclesiastical Discipline in a Church to be a sufficient cause to make a separation, in page 224. he he saith, Though Princes and Magistrates will not let Ecclesiastical Discipline to be restored into the Churches under them, yet may we forsake that Church for that cause. Thus in the judgement of learned Divines I have delivered my judgement, and answer to our Separatists Objections; and do further add, that if the corruptions of some of our Members affright them from our Churches, I wonder the same corruptions drive them not from all civil commerce with such corrupt men, and from eating and drinking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing familiarly with them, least their Souls by them be indangered, which may as soon happen to them out of the Church meetings and societi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From all these places you may evidently perceive the truth of the first part of my proposition, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were as bad, and in some things worse than our Parishes, <hi>Ergo, verum est posterius,</hi> what follows is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that if they for all these corruptions among them were a Church and called Saints; we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what do I instance in <hi>Corinth</hi> onely, to prove a truth so clear? In all the Churches through <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles I may easily instance the like.

So may Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> and his separate Congregation, when they have gone through many Churches to finde out one without corruptions and corrupt persons return to our Godly Ministers and Parishes again. I confess, I know not what disparity may be given, nor what can truely be answered to this Argument to make it of no force, unless Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> will invent somewhat of his own phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and say again, that God was unwilling and loath to cast off the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and all those Churches to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote; but as for us he careth not for us, which would be absurd.

               </gap>ll prove by these strong reasons and following Arguments out of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Argument.</hi> Apostolical constitution is a true constitution. But such an one is ours. Ergo, The Minor I prove thus:</p>
            <p>First, The people of this Nation was converted to Christ, as true Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do witness, by either Apostles, or Apostolical men; neither is it to be doubted, but that in their dayes the Gospel was far spread, as may appear by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. and <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because we hold and maintain the same things Apostolical, whereby we and other Churches were made Christians, and Christian As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, to wit, the word, external profession of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus Christ,</hi> and the holy Sacraments, by which and for which the people in the Apostles dayes were accounted Christians. As for the word, who doubts of the excellency of it, and what an excellent people it fashioneth, where preached and received, as I shall in these places shew. In the 2 <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iohn, vers.</hi> 9. 10. we have this commendation of the word and Doctrine, and of them that receive it, <hi>He that abideth in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not into your house, neither bid him, God speed.</hi> Secondly, The word is said to make Disciples to Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. Thirdly, The word it is that reconciles men to God; so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. Fourthly, By this word the Apostles wrought and converted many, as may appear from <hi>Peter</hi> standing up and lifting up his voice and saying to the people, <hi>Hearken to my words, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. compared with <hi>verses</hi> 37, 38. and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> by the word converted the Jaylour and his Family, as is clear in these words, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y speak unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house; and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he and all his straightway,</hi> Act. 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 32, 33. Fifthly, This word given to a people is Gods covenanting with them; for so his Declaration of his will by his word is called his Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. compared with the 12. <hi>verse.</hi> And the people receiving this word, and professing their Faith to God, is their taking of God to be their God, and covenanting with him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>He loved the people; all his Saints are in thine hand; and they sate down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words, Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. Of such hath he received a reconciliation, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 24. Sixthly, Such professours the Apostles admitted into the Church, as those that had covenanted with God, and were not to be denied the Seal of the Covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. compared with the 37, 38. <hi>verses.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61677:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And as for the Sacraments, they combine and knit us together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. Therefore unless Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> deny all this unto us, he cannot deny us Apostolical constitution. Oh then we having the Father and the Son by the Doctrine and word of Christ, we being discipled by the word, we being reconciled by the word to God, we finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayly upon our Souls a powerfull working of the word of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, God having covenanted with us to be our God, and we by this word having taken him for our God, shall the Seals of this Covenant be denied unto us, which the Apostles denied to none t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at professed the word, no not to <hi>Simon Magus? Act.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and though strongly knit and united together in Christ, and made one body and partakers of that one bread, shall we be unchurched, unreconciled, uncovenanted, unknit and separated from Christ, as Babylonish? Surely this Assertion of M. <hi>Nichols</hi> will seem to the World not onely uncharitable, but most absurd and Antichristian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting so much of Scripture as it doth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> Those that profess the Name of Christ without supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious inventions of man are a true Church. But a Parochial people, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gathering together here in <hi>England</hi> for the true worship of Christ, profess the Name of Christ without superstitious inventions of man; Ergo, They are a true Church. The Major is proved thus; for Churches planted by others are onely thus described by their terms, <hi>where Christ was named,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>So have I strived to preach t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Gospel, not where Christ was named, least I should build upon another man's foundation,</hi> which words Learned Mr. <hi>Iohn Diodati</hi> expoundeth thus: that it was the Apostles meaning to make it his onely glory to plant new Churches, not standing to manure those which were already planted by the Ministery of others. Which cannot be understood well to be the sense of the Apostle, if by these terms, <hi>where Christ is named,</hi> he understand not true Churches planted and erected. So it appears, that where Christs name is named, called upon and professed (and that without superstitious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man) there is a true Church. But our Parochial meeting and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together is to name the Name of Christ, to call upon it, and profess it; Ergo, Our Parochial people here in <hi>England,</hi> so meeting and gathering together, are true Churches, and not Babylonish.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> We be either the Church of Christ, and so a true Church, or the Church of Antichrist. But we are not the Church of Antichrist; Ergo, we are the Church of Christ, and so not Babylonish, but a true Church. The Minor is clear; we have forsaken <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, his Sacraments; Yea, every year upon the Friday before <hi>Easter day</hi> we are excommunicated by the Pope with this Ceremony, which my self have seen, and was present at it, <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1640. The Pope standing in a high Balcony in <hi>Peters</hi> Palace before thousands of people gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in an open, wide, and capacious place, takes in his hand a lighted Torch, declaring that light to represent the light and brightness of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61677:28"/>
true Militant Church, and the light and glorie of the Triumphant Church above; and then one of his Chaplains putting out the light, The Pope casteth the Torch out of his hand from on high down to the ground, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by that Ceremony that so he excommunicates and deprives of all light of mercy, favour, comfort in the Militant Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch, and also excludes from the light of glory in the Triumphant Church, all Hereticks in <hi>England</hi> (as such he looks upon us) who acknowledge him no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>

Thus are we disowned, cast out, anathematized, and for ever cursed by the Pope; and shall we yet be said by Mr. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hols</hi> to be Babylonish, to be his, or any wayes to belong to him? No, surely we may rather say as our Saviour said of the World and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but because ye are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you,</hi> John 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. So if we were of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> would love us as her own; but because we are not of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Lord hath chosen us out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> therefore she hates us, and her <hi>Triple Crowned Head</hi> and Governour bids us depart, casteth us out and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us. So it appears that we are no Church nor people of Antichrist; Ergo, we are a Church of Christ. And if there be any further doubt of this in Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> I must tell him plainly that the difference is between him and the <hi>Pope.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> saith, we are no Church of Christ, because not belonging to him; Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> saith, we are no Church of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are Babylonish, and so belonging to the Pope and to Antichrist. As <hi>Paul</hi> set the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> at variance to help himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7. So I shall leave the Pope and Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> to reason this case, whilest I step forth to my fourth Argument thus:</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Argument.</hi> A company having no false nor Babylonish head, but having <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for their true head, can be no false nor Babylonish Church, or body. But we are a company having no false nor Babylonish head, but having <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for our true head. Ergo, we can be no false, nor Babylonish Church, or body. The Minor is clear thus; because we do all profess him, which is a token of Faith in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi> And the Apostles judged such worthy to be of the Church in their time, and thereupon did admit men, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 31, 32. Yea, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> thereupon was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. though otherwise a dissembling Hypocrite, whose example is a sufficient answer to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Objection, saying, <hi>she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>here the Apostles admitted wicked men into their Churches as you do</hi>; To
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61677:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which with this example of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> we answer, as also with <hi>Demas, Hymenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> that they admitted wicked dissembling Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as we may do some, not <hi>qua,</hi> and <hi>as wicked and dissemblers,</hi> but <hi>qua,</hi> and <hi>as Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thirdly, the confession of his name is a part of our praise, so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>By him let us offer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name,</hi> Hebr. 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. Thus we hold Christ for our head, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and confess him and his name. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Argument.</hi> A company having <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for their Mediatour and Advocate, are a true Church; But we are a company having <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for our Mediatour and Advocate; Ergo, we are a true Church. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved thus; First by our prayers which are onely made to God, and in the name of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> onely. Secondly, in that we do condemne the Papists, for making the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> Saints and Angels Mediatours to God, and we do reject it as idola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rous. Thirdly, because we do partake of the Covenant made unto us by God through <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; which I thus make good. First, because many of us both in Church and Common-wealth, of both higher and lower degree, have true knowledge of Gods word, which is one part of the promise and Covenant, as you may read in these words of <hi>Ieremiah, This shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>saith the Lord. I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> And further, <hi>They shall all know me, from the lowest of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord,</hi> Jerem. 31. <hi>vers.</hi> 33, 34. and the like, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and Chap. 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. Secondly, the fear of God possesseth the hearts of many, which is another part thereof, as the same Prophet write<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me,</hi> Jerem. 32.40. Thirdly, God hath brought us out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage of that <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist, which is another part, <hi>I have heard the groaning of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>whom the</hi> Egyptians <hi>kept in bondage, and I have remembred my Covenant,</hi> Exod. 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. Fourthly, because we have the book of the Covenant, which is read to us as formerly by <hi>Moses</hi> to the people, <hi>who took the book of the Covenant, and read in the audience of all the people; and they said, All that the Lord hath said, will we do and be obedient,</hi> Exod. 24. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. We have the holy Commandments and the Gospel, the words of the Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>vers.</hi> 28. And it is a special prerogative to Gods people to have the word of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> observes in the <hi>Iews</hi> prerogative

               </gap>ue consideration, will make it to appear unto the world, that surely Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Assertion is most erroneous and false, affirming as much as this, that a people offering their prayers to God in the name of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> taking the same <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> onely for their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Advocate, condemning as Babylonish the Mediation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of all Saints and Angels, partaking of the Covenant made by God to his people through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> having true knowledge of Gods word, and his Law written in their inward parts, having the fear of God possessing their hearts, having been brought out of Babylonish and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian bondage, having the book of the Covenant read unto them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the holy commandments, the Gospel, the words of the Covenant, and acknowledging obedience due unto them, and enjoying that peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and prerogative of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in the word; Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these particulars and sure truths out of Scripture; that such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is no true Church, but Babylonish and Antichristian? Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> may say so; but I am sure the Scriptures say the contrary, which must be yours and my guide; to the which I beseech you to lean, as you tender your Souls. For my part I am so convinced out of the word of the contrary to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Assertion, that I hope I shall never be so seduced nor blinded, as to incline to so gross and false an opinion. And I hope my good God, my true guide, my Prophet and onely Teacher will not hereafter judge, or condemne me for the ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which in this particular point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie I am resolved till death to follow.</p>
            <p>All these Arguments upon the day of dispute should have been objected against Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> had he answered like a Schollar Categorically to every Proposition, and not so much indeavoured with Speeches and Orations to stop the stream of them. Many more I could propound unto you, were it not that I have already found the work to increase like the Widows Oyl much in my hands, and nothing yet spoken of the second Proposition, which I know you expect to have it further cleared unto you, than it was the other day by a few Objections against it. But before I come unto it, I must briefly answer the scruple of one, or two of the Clergy, my fellow-labourers, whose impatient mutterings against Parochial Churches (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they serve, and can willingly enjoy the milk of such flocks) were taken notice off by some; who seem not to deny Parochial Churches in Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> his sense, counselling, or Preaching a separation from them; but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sense (Presbyterial they would fain call it, but unjustly) as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Classical way, and with Provincial Churches; which one of them told me, were to be called onely Churches, and Parishes not truely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61677:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churches, but onely integral parts of such <hi>Classical,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Churches.</hi> So that the whole County being divided into <hi>Classes,</hi> the Parishes also are to be divided so, as that a competent number are to belong to such and such a <hi>Classes,</hi> as formerly to such and such a Cathedral, and all that number of Parishes to make up but one Church, to be ruled by Officers and Elders according to the word, but singly every Parish taken by it self not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Church. Which Opinion being but a Cavil (as I suppose) against my self by the party insisting on it, I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll wave as unwilling to disturb, and as willing to submit for peace and quietness sake; especially in this, which well understood doth not cross my Opinion and judgement of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parish Societies to be true Churches, nor my Opinion cross the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned and Reverend Divines of the Presbyterial way, who affirm the Presbyterial Government, by Preaching, and Ruling Presbyters, in <hi>Congregational, Classical,</hi> and <hi>Synodal Assemblies,</hi> to lay the truest claim to a Divine Right according to the Scriptures; with whose own Doctrine I shall confirm this truth, that Parochial Congregations are to be called true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Churches. The aforesaid Divines in their book of the Divine right of Church-Government take notice of the whole Church, the whole Body of Christ, and of larger particular Members of that Body of Christ, and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of smaller single Congregations. Which threefold distinction of Churches is truely grounded upon the Scripture. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> calls the whole Body of Christ, <hi>Church, Now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.

In which places there were no doubt, many single Churches and Congregations, as appears plainly in <hi>Corinth,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> taught, <hi>Apollo</hi> taught, and <hi>Cephas</hi> taught, and in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> reckoneth up above three-score several Churches and Congregations, all which in Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one Church.

               </gap>t single Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes to be true Churches; and herein I hope I dissent not from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Presbyters, whose Zeal in these troublous dayes I admire, whose God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and profund Learning I cordially acknowledge and with reverence

respect. But secondly, what from the word, <hi>Angel,</hi> I observe, is, that not many Angels are written unto in so many single Congregations, but one onely <hi>Angel</hi> is named, to one onely <hi>Angel</hi> the writing was directed, though in several Churches of that Citie according to the number of them, there were several Pastours also; from whence I gather that the Discipline in that Citie was so Presbyterial, that over all the single Congregations there was some one over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But thirdly, the holy Spirit of Christ is pleased to stile also single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, Churches (which my Caviller seems to deny) as you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in these places, <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 34. where note that several single meetings, Societies and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions making up one Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> are called Churches; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mention is made of the Church that is in such, or such a House, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Philem. vers.</hi> 2. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be interpreted of the Church made up onely of the Members of that Family; or of the Church that ordinarily did meet in such houses with a particular Teacher in that place, it implies however a single Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, to my purpose, such a single Congregation is called Church; which it seems is the main point that my Caviller stumbles at, who further told me that I could not maintain <hi>Parishes</hi> to be <hi>Churches,</hi> nor any single Congregations to be Churches, but in an <hi>Independent</hi> way; the contrary whereof I shall prove thus briefly in a Presbyterial way. The Presbytery grants that many single Congregations, as parts, make up one Classis, or one Provincial Church; Ergo, Those many single Congregations are true Churches; which thus I prove. If any thing oppose their true being of Churches, it must be (according to my Caviller) because they are but parts of a Church, or body made up by them. But their being parts of a Church, or body made up by them; doth not oppose their true being of <hi>Churches</hi>; Ergo, single Congregations are true Churches. The Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I prove thus. They are such parts of the whole Church, or body, made up by them, as do partake the nature of the whole. But the whole body made up by them is a true Church; Ergo, The parts and single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, making up that whole body, are also true Churches. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, or first Proposition I prove thus. They are not <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> parts, but <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts, making up the whole, partake the nature of the whole. Ergo, They are such parts of the whole, as do partake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole. And then; But the whole is a true Church. Ergo, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes and single Congregations, as <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts, partaking of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole (which is a true Church) are also true Churches.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61677:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Which (beloved) that you may the better understand, I shall clear it with an instance of <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> and <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts. First, In mans body the parts making up a compleat body of man are the Head, the Shoulders, the Arms, Hands, Leggs, and the like. Of these parts we cannot say, The head is truely the body, the Arm is the body, the Legg is the body, because they are <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> parts of several natures, not partaking the nature of the whole nor of the body. But secondly, in the Sea, or Ocean, the parts making up the whole Sea, or Ocean are many drops of water, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts, parting the nature of the whole, whose nature is water, and every drop of water is as true water as the whole Ocean, and of every part, or drop it may be said, <hi>It is water,</hi> as of the whole it may be said, <hi>It is water</hi>; For <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts are parts of the same kinde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But such parts are single Congregations, or single Churches and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, making up a <hi>Classis,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Church</hi>; for it cannot be said of many of them, that the one is a part as the Head, the other as the Arm, the other as the Hand, or Legg making up that body, as <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> parts of several and distinct natures; Ergo, They are <hi>Homogeneal</hi> parts; and as the nature of the whole is to be a Church, so likewise the true being and nature of these is to be Churches. But further; This whole Church, or <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> body made up of many single Congregations is Predicable of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, it being as <hi>Generical,</hi> or <hi>Specifical</hi> in respect of many particulars. But such <hi>Generical,</hi> or <hi>Specifical Predicates</hi> are predicable of inferiours of their own kinde; Ergo, The inferiour and subordinate Congregations to to this <hi>Provincial</hi> body, are of the same kinde and nature of the whole, and of the superiour; which being a true Church, the inferiours are also true Churches; As <hi>Man Specificable</hi> is Predicable of this <hi>Individual,</hi> of that <hi>Individual</hi> Man, and the other <hi>Individual</hi>; all which <hi>Individuals</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inferiours agree with the Superiour and common <hi>Species</hi> in the kinde, nature and self-same being of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having answered this scruple, and having fully laid down my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his first erroneous Assertion, That <hi>Parochial Churches are Babylonish,</hi> and having proved that they are neither Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish in their <hi>Constitution,</hi> as <hi>Parishes,</hi> nor in the end of their <hi>Constitution,</hi> or division into <hi>Parishes,</hi> nor in their <hi>mixture</hi> of good and bad; nor to be denied to be true Churches as subordinate to higher <hi>Classes,</hi> I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after commit to the Press, and publick vieu of the World this my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment delivered here unto you, as not ashamed of the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> nor of any truth belonging unto it. And I shall desire Mr <hi>Nichols,</hi> if in case he shall reply, that he will answer positively first to my grounds and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>form,</hi> as I have here laid them down by <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> granting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, distinguishing, taking notice of the Authority of the Scriptures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding them (if he can) better than my self have done; and then to make use of his fair Speeches and Orations, by adding what he can to disprove my judgement, and to clear his own better, than upon the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61677:31"/>
day of our Dispute he did; otherwise to expect no second reply from me.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I shall pass on to his second Assertion, in the which he affirms that <hi>his Congregation is the house of God.</hi> First I shall lay down and repeat unto you my Arguments (as upon the day of Dispute they were Objected against him) with his answers to them; and then I shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inlarge my discourse to prove his Congregation to be no true Church, nor house of God, but to practise things Babylonish, Antichristian, and against the word of God.</p>
            <p>You may (beloved) call to minde, that after his first Proposition had been awhile canvassed, and, as I complained (which to many seemed Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in me) little satisfaction given by his answers, why he should term our Parochial Churches Babylonish, I told him, it was time to come to his house, he having been so long in ours; and I desired him to hear me an Argument, or two against his pretended Church; which at first he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to grant, unless he might first argue against this <hi>Parish of Deal</hi> in particular, which neither my Moderatour nor my self would yield unto; First, because it was not a Proposition stated nor agreed upon to be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Secondly, to avoid tumults and quarrels that might have been caused, in case, before your faces and upon your own ground, his Arguments should tend to the affronting of any of you in particular, particularizing any particular misdemeanour, miscarriage, or sin of any, or making use of <hi>Nick-name,</hi> or aspersion unjustly laid upon you, as he seemed to intimate he would do, saying, he would speak of you but as you were <hi>characterized</hi> abroad. But being stopt from casting any affront in particular upon you, with much unwillingness he yielded at last t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at I should Object somewhat against his second Proposition. And having against his first Assertion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun my Argument from the description, or definition of a Babylonish, Romish Parochial Church, I thought it would prove my best way of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting against his second Proposition also, to begin with a true definition, or description of the true house of God; which I performed thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Argument.</hi> The house of God is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. But your Congregation is not the Church of the living God, nor the pillar and ground of the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h; Ergo your Congregation is not the house of God. The Major being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Minor denied, I proved it thus:</p>
            <p>Where many things are practized against the truth, there is not the Church of the living God, nor the pillar and ground of the truth. But in your Congregation many things are practized against the truth; Ergo, your Congregation is not the Church of the living God, nor the pillar and ground of the truth. The Major was granted and the Minor denied; which I proved thus. The truth of the Word ordereth to a true Church a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour. But in your Church and Congregation there is no true Pastour. Ergo, In your Congregation things are practized against the truth. The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61677:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Minor, or second Proposition being denied, I proceeded thus: In your Church and Congregation there is no known Pastour but your self. But you are no true Pastour. Ergo, In your Church and Congregation there is no true Pastour. The Minor still I proved. A true Pastour comes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o his flock by the true door of Christ and his word. But you came not in to your flock by the true door of Christ and his word; E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>go, you are no true Pastour. The Minor I cleared thus. The true door of Christ and his word for a Pastour to come in to his flock is by true Ordination. But you came not in to your flock by true Ordination. Ergo, you came n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in to your flock by the true door of Christ and his word. The Minor appeared thus. True Ordination according to Christs word is by imposition of hands by the Presbytery. But your Ordination is not by imposition of hands by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; Ergo, you came not in to your flock by true Ordination.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> denying the Major, <hi>that true Ordination, according to Christs word, is by Imposition of hands by the Presbytery,</hi> said, that he came in to his flock by the Election of the people; which he said was true Ordination according to Christs word. Against which answer I framed thus my second Argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> That which is most warrantable for Ordination from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e word of God, is truest Ordination. But Ordination by Imposition of hands by the Presbytery is more warrantable for true Ordination, than the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people; Ergo, Imposition of hands by the Presbytery is truer Ordination, than the Election of the people. The Major he could not deny, but the Minor he denied, which I thus proved. Ordination by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands by the Presbytery is clear and warrantable from the word of God in these eight places of Scripture at the least, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>

            <p>Here the light of Scripture dazled Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his eyes, the Authority of so many places wrapped up in one Proposition startled him so, that fain he would have ridded himself of so much Scripture against him; And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cavil and to question me, how I knew that he was not ordained by Imposition of hands by the Presbytery, having through some trouble of minde forgot that he had granted it before unto me, and confessed his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by the Election of the people, as I told him, I knew his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his own confession. Then fain would he ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of order, form, and Syllogisme, know how and where I was ordained. A thing (beloved) not very pertinent to the force of my Argument against him; neither needed I to have given him in publick such an account of my self, till some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him against me had questioned my Ordination, as mine did his;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61677:32"/>
yet to ease his minde I told him by whom I had been lawfully Ordained; and forcing him on again to my Argument, he began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o say somewhat; First, that indeed he acknowledged that Imposition of hands by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery was used in the Apostles time, as a Ceremony, which now might be left off, and so was now by many Godly men omitted. To which slight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer I replied thus:</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> That which is a Principle of the Doctrine of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> ought never by any Churches to the end of the World be omitted, or laid aside. But Imposition of hands by the Presbytery is a Principle of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Ergo, Imposition of hands by the Presbytery in Ordination ought never by any Churches to the end of the World be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or laid aside.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> shewed himself yet more troubled, and quite to have forgotten the Scriptures, or else he would not have granted my Major and have denied my Minor, which immediately I proved thus from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Argument.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. Chap. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. sets down with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> to be a <hi>Principle</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ught never by any Churches to be omitted to the end of the World. Ergo, Imposition of hands by the Presbytery in Ordination also, ought never by any Churches to be omitted to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> began to perceive his errour, and want of knowledge in the Scriptures, when he denied the Minor, and that Imposition of hands by the Presbytery was a Doctrine of the Principles of Christ; which being made clear unto him, he could give no answer to it; and so my Syllogisme was in the discretion and sound judgement unanswerable and unanswered. But Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Moderatour perceiving the unresistible force of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and seeing his friends mouth almost shut up, spoke a word to this purpose, that it was doubted by some Authours, whether that place of <hi>Paul, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> insisted on, I should soon have shewed him his errour, and such a second trouble to have befallen him, as the Poet speaketh off, saying, <hi>Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdin,</hi> and as the <hi>Iews</hi> spake to <hi>Pilate, So the last errour shall be worse than the first, Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>vers.</hi> 64. This (beloved) I do mention, but to call you to minde to remember it, that you may take notice how with the strength, yea, evidence of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which truely to me is undeniable) Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> was put to his shifts. And so indeed after a while he betook himself to another shift, saying, that Imposition of hands by the Presbytery in Ordination, had been so abused and corrupted by the Bishops and by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that now by the Godly it was thought fit to be omitted and laid aside. Ah (beloved) and can this answer perswade any sound Conscience to slight a Principle of the Doctrine of Christ? Must Bishops, or Romes corruptions make us more corrupt? Must their corruptions make us deny our Principles? Might not Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> as well have answered, that because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath corrupted baptisme with Rites and Superstitious Ceremonies, therefore we ought utterly to forsake, to forget, slight and omit baptism, which also is a Principle of the Doctrine of Christ? Surely, for all this his answer you will be unwilling to deprive your Children of baptisme so purely and rightly administred in <hi>England,</hi> because in <hi>Rome</hi> it is corrupted. And so shall I, for all this poor shift of Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> be as unwilling to deny Imposition of hands by the Presbytery in Ordination, as a Principle of the Doctrine of Christ, because in <hi>Rome</hi> it is corrupted with anointing with Oyl the thumbs and fore-fingers of the Priests, and with other foolish, superstitious, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Rites and Ceremonies never practised by the Apostles. But yet to shew Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his folly in this answer, I demanded of him, why then, if he made such scruple of us Ministers, who had been ordained by Bishops formerly with their Presbyters, and of those Reverend Presbyters who in some places of this Land did still ordain without Bishops, why then had he not the Imposition of hands by some Ministers nearer in judgement unto himself, who had been beyond the Seas in <hi>Holland,</hi> and doubtless there were ordained by some purer Presbyters who never succeeded Bishops? These at least might better have ordained him, than the people who have no power to ordain, nor any power of the Keyes? But this last Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> denying, and affirming the power of the Keyes to be in the people, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied against it thus:</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Argument.</hi> The power of the Keyes, wheresoever it is, must be in that Subject, which Christ hath ordained. But Christ ordained not the people to be the Subject of the Keyes; Ergo, The people are not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the power of the Keyes. The Major Proposition he granted, and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61677:33"/>
Minor without any distinction at all he denied. To which I replied. If Christ ordained the people to be the subject of the power of the Keyes, then the people must needs be the proper subject of the power of the Keyes; But the people are not the proper subject of the power of the Keyes; Ergo, Christ ordained not the people to be the subject of the power of the Keyes. The Major was granted, and the Minor was yet denied; to the which I replied with another Syllogisme. If the people are the proper subject of the power of the Keyes, than they are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> first subject of the power of the Keyes. But the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re not the first subject of the power of the Keyes; Ergo, The people are not the proper subject of the power of the Keyes. This Minor also he denied, <hi>that the people were not the first subject of the power of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Keyes,</hi> till a friend whispering him in the ear made him to see and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>flect upon his oversight, and better to consider what he had denied. But I forthwith replied against him thus; If the people were the first subject of the power of the Keyes, then the power of the Keyes was in them first, and before it was in the Apostles converting and baptizing them. But the power of the Keyes was not in the people first, and before it was in the Apostles converting and baptizing them, Ergo, The people are not the first subject of the power of the Keyes. Here (beloved) Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> finding himself by this Syllogisme quite cast upon his back, followed his whispering friends (as is supposed) good counsel, and, though too late in the judgement of the most Judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors (who took special notice of it) retracted what he had before said; and whereas he had denied that the people were not the first subject of the power of the Keyes, now he granted it, that they were not the first subject. And so being wearied with my Arguments, that had so by degrees stole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to his disadvantage, he would needs fall to reasons to shew that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination consisted chiefly in the Election of the people; But I said to Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> Sir, give me no reasons, but shew me Scripture for what you say, as I have shewed you. I am sure, for the peoples Election to be true Ordination, you can shew me but three places, which I will name unto you; the first is, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. the second is, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. the third is, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. and these do speak but darkly for your purpose; but I have shewed you eight places for Ordination by Imposition of hands by the Presbytery, which are more in number and far more clear. But yet Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> presuming to make somewhat of it, or to please somebody at the latter end of our dispute, waving the two first places offered to him by my self for his advantage, made choice of the third place, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>vers</hi> 23. where from the Greek word he presumed the people are said to stretch out their hands, whilest the Apostles ordained them Elders in every Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was no Imposition of hands, but (if spoken of the people) an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing onely of, and a consenting to what the Apostles did; which I told him was a common action in people to lift up their hands by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and hereupon I told him he should finde that I had the consent of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61677:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the people of <hi>Deal</hi> to be their Minister, which I desired you to shew by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up your hands, which I thank you, you did cheerfully and unanimously perform. But observe (I beseech you beloved) this place of <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 23. whereon Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> would so fain build popular Election, as the essential part of Ordination. In that place you may observe, that it is plainly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Paul</hi> and of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two Apostles ordaining Elders with prayer and fasting, which commonly accompanied the Act of Ordination by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, as you may see <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. Now if this place tells us that the two Apostles ordained, what can Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> prove from hence for his popular Election? But he saith from the Greek word, that the people stretched out their hands; Ergo, They ordained.</p>
            <p>I answer first, that the peoples action here (if he will have it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the people, which I absolutely deny) is expressed onely by this word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies a stretching out the hands, but it is not said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a laying on of the hands, used in many more places than this, as I have shewed him from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>

               </gap>. in all which places laying on of hands is expressed, and not stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of hands. And therefore if from this place he will conclude any thing for the people, he must not from hence prove a popular and people, fancying Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, making this place to preponderate more, and weigh down Imposition of hands by the Presbytery, because (as much as he can make of this place, though I understand it not so, as I shall shew presently) here the people joyed in, allowed off, consented to those Elders ordained by the Apostles, by the action of stretching out their hands. Upon which place Reverend Mr. <hi>Diodati</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> speaketh thus: <hi>When they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> reads, <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssential part to ordination r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery, till which be done, the peoples consent and approbation conferreth nothing. And so Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> can truely glory of no Orders with his poor peoples consent, till he bow his neck to this Principle of the Doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But secondly, Having given to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> (though as I said before, it is not my judgement upon the place) as much as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this place of the 14. of <hi>Acts</hi> can allow him for a popular consent, which neither in <hi>England</hi> is denied, for commonly Ministers, before they be first ordained, have the consent of the people for su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, or such a Parish. I must now further let Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> know from this place, that the best Divines do not understand the word here in the Greek to belong to the people, but to the Apostle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, whose laying on of hands is expressed by a word more commonly signifying, a stretching out of the hands. I may well stretch out my hands, and yet not lay them upon any bodies head; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay my hands upon any bodies head, without I stretch them out. So the Apostles, whilest they laid their hands upon those whom they ordained, did truely stretch out their hands; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifieth, <hi>extensio manuum</hi> not <hi>elevatio manuum,</hi> a lifting up of the hands, which is the common action used to express a peoples free consent. But it is plain from the whole context, that the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was no Act of the people at all, who did not in that place so much as lift up their hands for consent. The whole context is of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> They <hi>strengthened the Souls of the Disciples,</hi> vers. 22. They <hi>ordained, they prayed, they commended the people to the Lord,</hi> vers. 23. Besides had it been any Act of the people, the Text would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What comfort then can Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> have from this place, especially (if he understand Greek and the whole context) and from those many more produced by me and unanswered by him, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his conscience, when thus by Scripture he is fully convinced to be no lawfully ordained Minister of <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> Which was the first thing I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Argument against his Church, or Congregation, that it was not the house of God, not being the pillar and ground of the Truth, where the Truth of Ordination, according to the word of Christ, and the practise of the Apostles, so much faileth and is by him opposed.</p>
            <p>Thus far (beloved) my Arguments reached upon the day of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his second Proposition; And seeing we are come to this main point of the controversie of these times concerning popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Ordination, and popular Government in the Church, which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular men (too much affecting popularity for their ends to draw away our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61677:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people from our Churches) have devised, and of late stirred up; I shall yet a little more inlarge my Judgement and Discourse for the better resolving a doubt so necessary in these times to be unfolded. This Monstrous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can plead no Scripture, except those three places by me above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles. To that whereon Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> leans, I have answered; as also to that of <hi>Act.</hi> 6. Chap. where although the people <hi>look out honest men</hi> for Deacons, yet the Apostles appoint them over that business, and to that ordain them by Imposition of hands, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more than a meer looking out for them; and approving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or allowing of them. The third place is out of <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. <hi>They appointed two,</hi> Joseph <hi>called</hi> Barsabas, <hi>who was surnamed</hi> Justus, <hi>and</hi> Mathias. From whence some of the separation will settle Ordination upon the people, because in this peculiar work the people were joyned with the Apostles. But observe first from this place, that there the Electours were eleven Apostles to guide the other. But Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> will allow those to chuse him, who have no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to guide them, amongst whom no doubt but there are very many weak persons. Secondly, It was very easie to chose one of these two, <hi>Ioseph,</hi> or <hi>Mathias,</hi> who had <hi>accompanied with the Apostles all the time that</hi> Jesus <hi>went in and out among them,</hi> vers. 21. This was easie to know. But to chose a man fit for a Pastour requires more skill than so. Thirdly, In this Election God was peculiarly seen, the Apostles not knowing who it should be. Fourthly, in <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>They gave forth their lots, and their lots fell upon Mathias.</hi> They that will make any thing of this place, may as well make <hi>casting of Lots</hi> an Essential to Ordination, as give this power to the people, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver constituted, appointed, or ordained by Christ to be either the proper, first, or immediate subject of the power of the Keyes; which I shall indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to clear thus unto you.</p>
            <p>That which is the first subject is the proper subject. No doubt of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the proper subject is <hi>reciprocated</hi> and <hi>convertible</hi> with his Accident; As for example, A living Creature is the proper subject of <hi>sense and feeling</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A man is the proper subject of <hi>laughing, or laughter.</hi> And from hence we say <hi>reciprocally, Every man is Risible,</hi> and, <hi>Every thing that is Risible is a man. Every living Creature hath sense and feeling</hi>; and so likewise, <hi>Every thing that hath sense and feeling is a living Creature.</hi> This is called <hi>Axioma</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But every <hi>Axiome,</hi> that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth include in it the Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where the Predicate is true of the subject in all place, and at all time; This is true of a <hi>living Creature,</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi>; of a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Risibility.</hi> And so if the people, or the Fraternity be the proper subject of the power of the Keyes, It must be true that they are and have been the proper Subject of the power of the Keyes <hi>omni tempore &amp; omni loco,</hi> in all places and at all times. But if we finde the power of the Keyes exercised in time before there was a Christian Fraternity, then certainly there was some other subject of the power of the Keyes, in whom this power was, as in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he preached <hi>Authoritative,</hi> and with

But the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is the effect of the power of the Keyes: It was so in all the Churches which the Apostles gathered, and is indeed to this day. So that, which is <hi>primum Subjectum,</hi> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st subject, is <hi>Immediatum Subjectum,</hi> the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate subject. But how can the Fraternity be the immediate subject of the power of the Keyes, since then <hi>mediantibus Apostolis,</hi> by means of the Apostles, and now <hi>mediantibus Ministris,</hi> by means of the Ministers the Fraternity is made up. I but the Elector is before the Elected. It is true of Christ, who Elected the Apostles, and gave to them the Keyes, from whom by a continued succession of Ministers still the Fraternity was made; But had not the power of the Keyes had some effect, there had not been a Fraternity to chose an officer, though they are now in time before him, whom they now Elect; Yet they were not before him, or them (<hi>qua Fratres</hi>) who by the power of the Keyes in the Ministery made them capable to chose an Officer; Therefore the power of the Keyes was in some subject before them. Besides Election is no power of the Keyes; Therefore to argue, The people Elect, ergo, They are the first subject of the power of the Keyes, is <hi>fallacia non causae pro causa.</hi> But if what hath been spoken, will not convince Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols,</hi> that the people, or Fraternity having no true power to Ordain, he is no true and lawfull Minister; Let him answer these Arguments from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Scripture, and the best Divines that have written upon this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Argument.</hi> Whosoever are the first subject, or immediate Receptacle of the power of the Keyes from Christ, they have Divine Warrant actually to exercise and put in execution the said power; as, if a man be the first and immediate subject and Receptacle of <hi>Risibility,</hi> or power of laughing, he hath a faculty in him to exercise and put in execution his <hi>Risibility,</hi> and so actually to laugh. But the Multitude, or Community of the Faithfull have no Divine Warrant actually to exercise and put in execution the power of the Keyes; Ergo, The Community of the faithfull are not the first subject, or immediate Receptacle of the power of the Keyes from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> The Major Proposition must of necessity be yielded; because first, power of the Keyes contains both Authority and exercise; power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to that end that it may be exercised for the benefit of the Church;

But Christ neither promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, nor giveth a spirit of Ministery, nor necessary gifts for Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the Community of the faithfull; Ergo, Christ makes not the Community of the faithfull the first subject of the power of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The Major is clearly proved; For first, As there are diversity of Ecclesiastical Administrations (which is the foundation of diversity of Officers) and diversity of miraculous operations, and both for the profit of the Church; So there are conveyed from the Spirit of Christ diversi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of gifts, free endowments enabling and qualifying for the actual discharge of those Administrations and operations, as you may see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> Secondly, what instance can be given in the whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any persons, whom Christ made the Receptacle of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but withall he gifted them, and made his promises to them, to inable them to such Government?

It cannot stand with his exact wisdom and fidelity to commit the grand affairs of his Church Government to such as are not duely gifted, and sufficiently qualified by himself to the due discharge thereof. Thus you have the Major cleared; and the Minor will as easily appear evident thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61677:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>First, The Scriptures teach that gifts for Ministery and Government are promised and bestowed not on all, but on some particular persons onely in the visible body of Christ. To one is given by the Spirit the word of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to another the word of knowledge, &amp;c. not to all, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 8.9. <hi>&amp; seq. If a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Church of God</hi>? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> insinuates, that all men have not gifts and skill rightly to rule their own houses, much less to govern the Church. Secondly, Experience tells us, that the multitude of the people are generally destitute of such knowledge, wisdom, prudence, learning and other necessary qualifications, for the right carrying on of Church Government. Ergo, Christ makes not the Community of the faithfull the first subject of the power of Church Government.</p>
            <p>But this truth will yet more clearly appear by answering the Arguments and Objections of those, who stand so much for Popular power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Object.</hi> First, They Object thus; To whom Christ gave all power, to them it chiefly and primarily belongs. But Christ gave all power to the body of the Church, which is the Community of the faithfull. Ergo, To the Community of the faithfull, all power belongs chiefly and primarily. The Minor they prove from the Apostle, <hi>Whither</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. from whence they conclude that <hi>Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> and their successours in the Ministery belong to them, and are under their power and Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, that Christ gave all power to the body of the Church, <hi>finaliter &amp; objective,</hi> finally and objectively, that is for their use and benefit, for their service and salvation. So that if the Ministers preach, administer the Sacrament, exercise the power of the Keyes, it is all for the good, and benefit of the faithfull Community, they are the Object, they are the end the Ministers aim at in the work of the Ministery. But we are not theirs so, as to be of their making and Authorizing. Church power is first seated in Christ the head and Apostle of our profession, and from him committed to his Apostles, and from them to the Presbytery and Ministers. They commit the same to others which themselves had first received. (But (according to that known rule) <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> No man can give to another, that which himself hath not first received. Therefore the people, which never received Orders, nor power to administer the word, Sacraments and Keyes, how can they bestow it on others? This is besides all Scripture and reason.</p>

               <hi>Christs</hi> Church. But <hi>Christs</hi> Ministerial power is given to <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples; Ergo, <hi>Christs</hi> Ministerial power is given to his Church. Proved from <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 13.20.</p>

If in the second sense, and the word <hi>Disciples,</hi> taken for the whole Church, then I grant all; for I confess the powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted with the <hi>Indian</hi> tongues may be ordained, and sent to preach to the <hi>Indians</hi> before any Election; for how shall they Elect, who are not yet baptized?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ans.</hi> Thirdly I answer, that Election gives the Essence, as he is <hi>their</hi> Minister; but Ordination gives the essence, as he is <hi>a</hi> Minister; For Ordination doth invest a Minister with power to act beyond those, who have called and chosen him, giving him an habitual power <hi>in actu primo,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and perform the acts belonging to his office elsewhere upon a call and choice, as the <hi>Canon</hi> saith, <hi>Semel expositus, semper expositus,</hi> so likewise <hi>semel Ordinatus, semper Ordinatus,</hi> Once set apart to preach, and ordained, alwayes set apart to preach, and alwayes ordained. Yea, I may say, a Minister beareth an habitual relation to the whole Church visible. So that a Pastour preacheth not onely as a Pastour to those who Elected him, and to other Churches as a gifted brother; I dare boldly affirm that in the Apostles times, and in the purest ages next them this notion was never heard. So <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Paul</hi> was ordained as a Pastour to preach any where, and not appropriated by Election to any particular place. In the 68. <hi>Can. Apost.</hi> one Presbyter once ordained lawfully, is forbidden to be ordained again, which shews that he was ordained as a Pastour, and Officer to the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Object.</hi> What the Ministers are to the people now under the Gospel, the <hi>Levites</hi> were formerly to the <hi>Iews.</hi> But then the people ordained the <hi>Levites</hi> and put their hands upon them, as appeareth <hi>Num.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Ergo, Now the people also may ordain the Ministers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ans.</hi> First I answer, If we must stand to the old Policy, why may not we as well say, that the Civil Magistrate may also ordain, as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Aaron?</hi> Levit. 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ans.</hi> Secondly, I answer with what is noted in the 11. verse of the 8. of <hi>Numbers</hi> quoted, <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>shall offer the</hi> Levites <hi>before the Lord, that they may execute the service of the Lord. Aaron</hi> was to <hi>wave</hi> those <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> before the Lord, so that they were not compleated to execute the service, till the Priest had done his Act. So the peoples <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there, did but answer to the peoples <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or stretching out their hands in the new Testament, &amp; <hi>Aarons waving</hi> them did answer to our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or laying on of hands. Thus (beloved) I have answered some of the chief Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Popular power in the Keyes, and by strong Arguments shewed that this power is not in them, but in the Ministers &amp; Successours of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to whom the Keys were delivered first by Christ. I shall add but one reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or two more to confirm this my Opinion, and so conclude with this first errour practized in Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Church, or pretended house of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> If the Election of the people doth give the essentials to an Officer, then may a man elected execute all Official power without ordination, and that commonly. But no man may execute Official power, and that commonly, without ordination. Ergo, Election doth not give the essentials. By essentials here I mean the <hi>formal</hi> cause; for as for the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61677:38"/>
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>use they cannot give that; and we have but two causes that do <hi>dare essentiam,</hi> though all four do <hi>dare esse.</hi> The consequence is clear, that they may execute all Official power without ordination, for <hi>forma dat operari</hi>; But Election gives the form (say the Separa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ists) and ordination at most with them is but an <hi>Adjunct</hi>; effects do not depend upon <hi>Adjuncts</hi>; For operation the <hi>form</hi> gives that. The Minor, That they may not execute all official power without ordination, is clear. For, the contrary is cross to Scripture presidents, and we see, if it were but a Deacon, yet he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 6. Then surely Election of the people doth not give the essentials to an Officer.</p>
            <p>And that ordination is no <hi>Adjunct,</hi> two remarkable places of Scripture do shew it clearly. The first is from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commend thou to faithfull men, who shall be able to teach others also.</hi> The 2. place is this from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins; keep thy self pure.</hi> From whence I reason thus: <hi>Timothy</hi> is a Church Officer; here is a charge given him to take heed, who comes into the Ministery; yea, he may be partaker of other mens sins, if he have not a special care, whom he admitteth into the Ministry. Now these Texts do not belong to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but to Ministers and to Officers, such as was <hi>Timothy</hi>; which makes me think, that what the Ministers do in examining, trying, ordaining, is more than the peoples Election. Where do we finde such things spoken to the people? Now then, where the greatest blame lies for unworthy mens coming into the Ministery, there surely must ly the greatest power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting men into the Ministery, else the blame is not just. But we see the blame is here laid upon the Ministers. <hi>Paul</hi> no where writes to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>To commit the things they have heard</hi>; nor doth he charge them <hi>not to lay on hands suddenly.</hi> At most they are bid indeed to look out men for Deacons; but that doth not answer these Texts. But if the great stroak, the formal cause lie in the popular Election, the Ministers may well say, we do but ordain, we give but an <hi>Adjunct,</hi> the people did the main Act, they give the <hi>essence</hi>; The <hi>essence</hi> being given, we give the <hi>Adjunct</hi>; So that there will be no blame left for the Ministers. I would be glad to see some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> either by private writing, or publickly in print to these reasons and Arguments; which till I see them answered; I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to continue still in this judgement, to blow my Trumpet lowder and lowder, to cry down more and more this practise in Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, not onely as erroneous, but as Babylonish and Antichristian, it being expresly against the word of God in many places of Scripture. And thus whilest he seems to affect <hi>Popularity,</hi> giving to the people more than to the Ministery for his ordination, for his examining, for his trying, and for the judging of his gifts and calling, he plainly crosseth that esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which God in Scripture alloweth to Ministers and their approbation, which he hath setled in his word by several examples for the better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61677:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and judging of mens gifts, lights and callings, as I shall shew in these remarkable and undeniable place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the holy writ.</p>
            <p>The first is from the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. Chap. where we read, that, <hi>Samuel</hi> being yet young, and not as yet acquainted with any light, or Revelation from Heaven, and sleeping near unto his Master <hi>Eli,</hi> in the night God gave him a call, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. which young <hi>Samuel</hi> understanding to have been from <hi>Eli,</hi> he ran unto him and said, <hi>Here am I,</hi> vers. 5. To whom the Priest replying, <hi>I called thee not, ly down again; Samuel</hi> had no sooner returned to his rest, and shut his eyes, but God gives him a second call, <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>arose again, and went to</hi> Eli, <hi>and said, Here am I, for thou didst call me; And he answered, I called not my Son, ly down again,</hi> vers. 6. The third time he went to his rest, and it is observed in the 7. <hi>verse,</hi> that <hi>Samuel</hi> did not know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him. But in the 8. verse, <hi>The Lord called</hi> Samuel <hi>again the third time; and he arose and went to</hi> Eli, <hi>and said, Here am I, for thou didst call me. And</hi> Eli <hi>perceived that the Lord had called the Childe.</hi> And then <hi>Eli</hi> instructed him what he should do, saying, <hi>Go, ly down, and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, speak Lord, for thy servant heareth,</hi> vers. 9. And so he did the fourth time that the Lord called him, then he knew his call to be from Heaven, and answered unto the Lord as the Priest had instructed him. Now what from hence I observe, is, that God might the first time have spoken and revealed unto <hi>Samuel</hi> what he did after, without three several returnings to the Priest, telling him at the first, It is not <hi>Eli,</hi> that calleth thee, but I; but he would not (as ancient Writers observe) because God would have <hi>Samuel</hi> go the right way to work, being young, and not yet acquainted with lights and Revelations, he would have him go to the Priest, that he might instruct him what to do, and that the Priest might judge of his light and calling. A good example in Scripture for men in these times, to know that if any must try and judge their lights, their Revelations, their calls and gifts, they must not be the people, but the Ministers. And therefore Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> surely is much deceived in giving to the people, and slighting in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that which God would have <hi>Samuel</hi> acknowledge fitter for <hi>Eli,</hi> (to try and judge his call from Heaven) than for the people. But least it should be answered that this was the old Policy, but the New Testament allows no such Doctrine, nor respect, or duty to Ministers, more than to the Community of the faithfull, I shall with the new Policy under the Gospel prove the like.</p>
            <p>In the 8. of <hi>Acts, Luke</hi> tells us what happened to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who riding in his Chariot read that part of the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a Lamb dumb before the shearers, so opened he not his mouth.</hi> In the mean while, <hi>The Angel of the Lord spake unto</hi> Philip, <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Arise, and go towards the South unto the way that goeth down from</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem <hi>unto</hi> Gaza, <hi>vers.</hi> 26.

And he desired</hi> Philip <hi>that he would come up and sit with him,</hi> vers. 29, 30, 31. <hi>Philip</hi> answered his desire, and went up to the Chariot, and taking occasion of the Prophecy he was reading, instructed him so far i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, Christ would remit him to his Officer in his Church, to shew that this is the ordinary way of Government by himself left to his Church, that not the people, but his Ministers by virtue of the power of the Keyes shall try and examine gifts and callings, and such, as they finde true by the Touch stone of the word, to allow, and admit such into the Church, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

by Church Officers and Ministers I cannot safely judge Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> a true Pastour of a Church, while preferring the people before the Ministers, and taking orders from them, he slights the ordinary way of Christ for Church Government, and those Officers whom God hath shewed us to be respected.</p>

Which how contrary it is to the truth of the word and the example of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> when first he instituted that Sacrament under the Elements of Bread and Wine, I shall leave you to judge from what St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates of the last Supper in these words, saying, <hi>He took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave unto them,</hi> Luke 22. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> saying, <hi>when he had given thanks, he brake it,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 24. from which places I gather, that though Christ had present about him his Apostles, Brethren (though then weak) more able and gifted than are any of Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> his Congregation, yet Christ suffered none of them at that time to pray, or give thanks, but himself did it.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Errour.</hi> A fourth errour practized by him, is the unsetled place of his Church, contrary to the Constitution of the first Primitive Churches, which were known and named by the places, as the Church at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the like, to which <hi>Paul</hi> directed his Epistles by the names of the <hi>place</hi>; but were he to write to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Church, he could not call it by any one <hi>place,</hi> (as the Church at <hi>Adisham,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> lives) there being more of his Church many miles off in other places flying about on the Sabbath dayes, or Trouping about on Hors-back on those dayes to hear him, than there are present with him at <hi>Adisham.</hi> But the Letters must be directed to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his scattered Church at <hi>Adisham,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or to the flying and wandring, or Trouping Church from one place to another (which is most proper to it) or <hi>to the church in</hi> Kent, <hi>sometimes here and sometimes there</hi>; all which is against the Constitution of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches setled in, and named by some one certain and determinate place. This practise is taken from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (and therefore is Babylonish) where, in my time beyond the Seas, I observed people for their pretended devotions much flying and wandring about, either to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> or upon the Sabbath dayes travelling five, or six miles from their Parishes to such, or such a <hi>Chappel,</hi> to such, or such a <hi>Cloister</hi> of Friars, or <hi>Colledge</hi> of Jesuites under a pretence of gaining Indulgences by hearing Mass, or Sermon in such a <hi>place,</hi> and of such a <hi>Father</hi>; And this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61677:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath been the Common practise of the Jesuites, to draw the people there from the Parish Priests, to perswade them that their Doctrine is soundest, their lives purest, whereas the Friars and the Parish Priests (say they) are of lewd and wicked Conversations, and their Doctrine unprofitable; and to this purpose they press to the people many Indulgences, which they have obtained from the Pope for all such as shall hear their Doctrine, and shall resort to their <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> which now is more particularly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized by the Jesuites at <hi>Paris.</hi> By whsch policy the Parish Churches there are very much deserted, few people resort unto them, and the Parish Priests are left to preach to the bare Walls, and to some few old silly Women. This policy (if not under a pretence of Mass and Indulgences) at least under a pretence of more pure Doctrine, I have found to be much in Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> whose people it seems have learned to run after him many miles upon the Sabbath dayes, forsaking their Parish meetings, as unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them, and judging the day ill spent, their Souls unedified, except they hear him and no other. And therefore his Church may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a flying, a wandring Church, limited to no particular <hi>place,</hi> as are our Parish Churches, and were the Churches in the Primitive times. But if he say, his Church is not to be called by his <hi>Name,</hi> but by the <hi>place,</hi> and so will call it the Church at <hi>Adisham</hi>; and where in any other place some of his Members live, they are to be called <hi>Limbs</hi> to his Church at <hi>Adisham,</hi> and <hi>single congregations</hi> belonging to that Church. I answer two things; First that he must know, whither a better and abler Pastour that lives at <hi>Adisham,</hi> and the people, or his Church will allow that the Church at <hi>Adisham</hi> shall be known and named by two, or three, or four at most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> and not by the Major part pertaining to the chief Parish Pastour. But secondly, I answer, if Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Church be thus built up with several <hi>single Congregations</hi> in divers parts belonging to one chief building at <hi>Adisham,</hi> then Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> will go beyond us, and turn <hi>Episcopal,</hi> and make <hi>Adisham</hi> his <hi>Metropolitan seat,</hi> and other places <hi>Limbs</hi> of it; Or, then Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> will begin to jump with our Ministery, and will I hope in time turn a <hi>Classical</hi> man, making <hi>Adisham</hi> his <hi>Classical,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial</hi> Church, and others of his Congregation in divers places <hi>homogeneal</hi> parts of that his <hi>Classical</hi> Church. Which if he yield not to, I must judge his building and his house to be contrary to the rule and practise of the Apostles, and to savour too much the practise of the Jesuites.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Errour.</hi> A fifth errour in Doctrine taught by him (which is Popish, Jesuitical, Jewish, and Turkish) is, that his people, or Congregation must be bound to hear none other preach but himself, or such as are of his Iudgement. Which errour how gross and Antichristian it is, I leave you to judge, when hereby he limits Gods hand and working to him<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Is not this to be like the Jews limited to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> onely and to the Temple there? Is this <hi>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this practise is not onely the Popes and the Jews in limiting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples spirits to himself and to the <hi>place</hi> where he teacheth; but it is also the Turks policy, who to continue and maintain the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and <hi>Mahom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And lastly, this practise is meer <hi>Iesuitical,</hi> borrowed from the Jesuites, who binde their Ghostly Children from confessing to any Parish Priest, or Friar, and in case they finde that they have confessed any sin to their Parish Priest, they make them renew again to them that Confession, and discover to them that sin, or sins confessed to another, pretending that they cannot guide their lives well, nor direct them the right way to Heaven, unless they know the whole state of their lives, and all their sins in the whole course of their life committed; and for Preaching, they must resort to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and to their Churches, and to no other upon pain of being cast out of their Society, and incurring their curse and heavy displeasure. But what do I weary you (beloved) with longer Histories to condemn these Popish and Jesuitical practises in Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his <hi>house of God</hi>? (as he calls it) I am confident did but Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> know, that though these be his practises, they are borrowed from the Jesuites and the like to be practized by them, he would abhor them, and his people loath them. Ah (beloved) he thinks his Arguments against us are his own, his practise in drawing the people from our Parishes is his own light, his grounds to separate from us are his own; but little thinks he how he pleaseth the Pope and Jesuite in what he doth; little thinks he that all his Arguments against us, and all his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises have come from that subtil Serpentine brood of the Jesuites, who study nothing but to overthrow our Church, to undermine our Discipline, to root up our Nurseries of learning, to bring under contempt our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy, who have alwayes opposed <hi>Rome,</hi> and with their Pens discovered their errours to the World. This the Jesuite considering, and fearing our Unity, our Uniformity, in Church and Church Discipline, least by it we should flourish too much, hath these many years blown the fire of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,

Yet in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by twenties and fourties, Priests and Jesuites, enemies to our Church and Profession, are harboured by Ambassadours; by which policy our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is indangered, divisions are fomented, separation is incouraged, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites Arguments against us are vented and commonly pleaded, and thus those, who cry us down for Babylonish, practise themselves what is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, not knowing by what subtil Serpent they are let on against us, nor who it is that laughs and Triumphs, and cries, <hi>Up</hi> Rome <hi>to the spoil,</hi> while we mourn and sigh and grieve to see our divisions dayly more and more to increase.

            <p>My Method therefore in handling this point shall be this; First, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Arguments of Learned Divines, and by some of my own clearly to shew unto you the contrary to what Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> ignorantly and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affirmeth of us; and secondly, to answer some Objections which may seem to countenance Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his gross errour. I thus therefore p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove that our <hi>Parish Officiating Ministers in</hi> England <hi>are not</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> saith) <hi>Babylonish, Popish,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian,</hi> which in his sense must be all one.</p>

But our Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> are Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to Babylonish Priests, and to the <hi>Shavelins</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Ergo, Our Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> are not Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. The Major need not much clearing, <hi>Contraria contrariis repugnant,</hi> all know that two contraries are repugnant one to the other, and one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the other, fire cannot be water, nor dry moist, nor cold hot, nor white black. The Minor I prove thus; First Babylonish Popish Priests are ordained to Sacrifice. But our Ministers are sent to Preach, and to Preach against <hi>Romes</hi> unbloudy Sacrifice and to pray. Secondly, They teach the Traditions of men. But ours teach the perfect word of God. Thirdly, They mix the Sacraments, and alter both their number and their nature. But ours preserve them in their purity both for number and nature. Fourtthly, They are for Mass. But ours abhor the Mass, as a filthy idol. Fifthly, They are the Popes s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orn Vassals. But ours have witnessed with their bloud against him and his. Sixthly, Those pervert Souls, and draw them from Christ. But ours convert Souls, and bring them to Christ, as Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> and his Congregation can witness; for, let them but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether they did not receive the work of Conversion from sin unto God, which they presume to be wrought in them, first of all in these our publick Assemblies, from which they now separate. It was but lately the Confession of one old woman, whom Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> received into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that upon the preaching of one Mr. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> a Parish Officiating Minister in <hi>Sandwich,</hi> she had been converted; Upon which Confession she was by Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his Congregation judged to be a true Convert, and to have sufficient calling to separate from Mr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> his own wayes of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining publick Parish Assemblies, who had been Gods Instrument for her
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61677:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling and conversion to a holy religious course of life, (though much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in her imbracing Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> his separation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) You see (beloved) how clearly this first Argument sheweth unto you, not onely that we are not Babylonish, but that on the contrary we are Diametrically opposite to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish, Romish and Antichristian Priests. But further against this Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Assertion of Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> I argue thus:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> The Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> are either Christs, or Antichrists. But they are not Antichrists; Ergo, They are Christs, and so cannot be truely called Babylonish, or Antichristian. The Major is clear; For in the new Testament this distinction may comprehend all Ministers, as of, and under one of these two; and those that be Christs Ministers, are true Ministers, and those that be Antichrists, are the false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. The Minor, or second Proposition is also as clear and evident, as I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll prove thus: First, because the Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> are against Antichrist in Doctrine, and by Oath against his supremacy have renounced him, and so do con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inue preaching against him. Their Doctrine from Scripture is their calling from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to witness their departure from him; their O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the best outward trial of truth in man, and their preaching an open publication to all men of their Faith against Antichrist; what can be further required?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because they do shew no obedience unto Antichrist. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is a mark of a servant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 34. Now they be not in bondage unto Antichrist, whose Tyrannous Authority with his Laws, as far as they be judged contrary to Gods Laws, are by our Church abolished.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is apparent, They be none of his, because Antichrist himself disclaimeth them, not onely as none of his, but as no Ministers at all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> forbidding all that belong unto him to hear us; and if he can get us into his Bearish paw, he is by fire and faggot ready to devour us, as l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we were of him, he would love us, for the world doth love her own, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and the Devil is more politick than to be divided against himself, for then could not his Kingdom endure. Therefore I conclude, we being no Ministers of Antichrist, we then are the Ministers of Christ.</p>

But such are, for the most part, Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England.</hi> Ergo, Parish Officiating Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are true Gospel-Ministers, and not to be called Babylonish, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. The Major is undeniable, because it containeth all the causes, that can be required to the compleating a true Gospel-Minister. First, there is the efficient cause, <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, there is the Material cause, <hi>A man sufficiently qualified,</hi> I mean according to <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61677:43"/>
Thridly, there is the formal cause, <hi>Orderly called.</hi> And fourthly, there is the Final cause, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. The end of the Ministery is, <hi>for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> The Minor Proposition we shall finde it to be clear also. First, for the efficient cause, there is no controversie there. Secondly, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cause, that they are sufficiently qualified, who can deny it? their gifts do shew it; and their good parts declare them to have those things, that the Apostle requireth to the making of true Ministers, which I shall shew in these particulars.</p>
            <p>First, He requireth ability to teach others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. Ability to exhort; Ability to convince Gain-sayers of sound truths, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Now these abilities and gifts, for the Major part, have our Parish Officiating Ministers, who by word and writing manifest this before God and man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Apostle requireth a desire in men furnished with gifts, to bestow their talents that way to the Churches good, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and also graces, to adorn their profession, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.7, 8. and 2 <hi>Chap. vers.</hi> 7. And such have we in our Parishes, men who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with desire to bestow the benefit of their gifts upon the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other calling.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the formal cause, <hi>Orderly called</hi>; Who, that is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, or that knows what calling is, can doubt of this, or without cavilling can maintain, that the Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> have no true calling? For, they are called and sent of God; which calling and sending of God is the preparing of men with gifts and graces to be able to execute in some measure the Office whereunto he doth appoint them. Thus <hi>Isaias</hi> sheweth his Commission from God by <hi>the Spirit of the Lord upon him,</hi> that is, the gifts and graces thereof, <hi>Isai</hi> 61. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. Thus the Lord declareth his sending and calling of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> by giving him gifts of his Spirit for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his charge, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. <hi>vers.</hi> 2.3. So our Saviour did call his Apostles and gave them a power, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. to accomplish that which he did charge them to do, <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. In like manner before he sent them upon their universal Commission, he did speak of those things, which concerned the Kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>vers.</hi> 44. then he opened their understandings to understand the Scriptures <hi>vers.</hi> 45. then he promiseth them power from above <hi>vers.</hi> 49. which was the power of the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. for which they were to wait a time, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>vers.</hi> 49. then he blessed them, <hi>vers.</hi> 50. he breathed on them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Ghost, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. which according to his promise came upon them visibly, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. And thus were they furnished, and did proceed on to execute their great charge imposed upon them. Thus you see what is Gods calling; I speak not here of <hi>extraordinary,</hi> though the instance be from the Apostles, as if all should be so furnished now, and in that manner; but the purpose of my speech is to shew hereby that God
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61677:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth send none, but he qualifieth them with gifts, <hi>extraordinary</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts, by <hi>extraordinary</hi> means, or without means; but <hi>ordinary</hi> men with <hi>ordinary</hi> gifts, by common means, giving them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural gifts, by the holy Scriptures, Grace , and by study and Learning; but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ends none, but thus either the one way, or other he doth quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them for their vocation. Now it is manifest to all Christendom, that we have Parish Ministers worthily qualified with gifts, both of Nature, Art, and Grace, and such therefore called and sent of God. Which furnishing with gifts maketh a man fit matter for the Ministery, and Gods Spirit moving him to desire to imploy that way the same gift, is as it were the internal form of a Minister, or Gods ordination by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the hand of his Spirit upon that party for the Ministery, to whom nothing is wanting, but the visible calling of the Church; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our Parish Ministers have, they being outwardly called and sent of Christ his Church, examined, tried, approved, set apart for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery by the Imposition of the hands of Presbyters and Officers of the Church of Christ in <hi>England</hi>; And therefore they are true Ministers, not Babylonish; <hi>Orderly called,</hi> which is the third formal cause, requisite to the making of a true Minister.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> And if it be Objected, that some of our Parish Ministers have not the Election of the people, according to the practise of the Primitive Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Chap. and 6. and 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, These places indeed testifie that such examples of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise were then of Election, but there is no precept for the perpetuity of it. Again, such Elections of the people were ever, when the Apostles were among them and not else, as the very places shew. Thirdly, the people were very Judicious, and were able to make a choice then, whereas it is now far otherwise with many. Fourthly, in all these places we do see in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Election among the people, but the people did not assume it, as a right of themselves, but upon the Apostles exhortation, and a grant unto them, for the time the people made the choice. Indeed I confess a double evil to be in the chosing, when either an ignorant bad people be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to do without wise guides what they list; Or a muck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wormly Patron is suffered, for hope of greedy gain, to Tyrannize over Gods people, to set over them at his wicked pleasure, either an ignorant, or a lewd man, when many of the people being of good understanding do desire a better. But fifthly and lastly, although in these places we read of the peoples Election with the Assistance, help, guidance and direction of the Apostles, yet we read also of some sent to the people before their choice, or Election as <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hicus,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 19, 20. that he will send <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus to them, for the satisfaction he had of him, that he was a fit man to take care of their state</hi>; and in the mean time he sends unto them <hi>Epaphroditus, vers.</hi> 25. and exhorteth them <hi>to receive him in the Lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation,</hi> vers. 29. and this without the peoples Election,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61677:44"/>
judging their after-approbation to be sufficient. Even so for our peoples Election of a Minister, if it be not before the Minister comes to a place, and he be sent by a Patron; yet sometimes the peoples acceptance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation afterwards may supply the want of Election at the first, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> after-consent and acceptance of <hi>Leah</hi> made her to be his wife, though he chose her not at the first.</p>
            <p>Now fourthly, For the final cause requisite for the compleating a true Minister of Christ, it appeareth in many of us by our profit in converting many Souls; Yea, those that have separated from us must confess that they also were at the first awakened by us. We have then Gods ordinary and dayly assistance in our Ministery for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. which is the end of the Ministery, and not Babylonish, or Antichristian. This is clearly seen and proved; for Gods assistance appeareth in his effectual working mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version by the work of the Ministery, for conversion is by the word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>vers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 16. through the Spirit, and not by the word delivered without the Spirit; and it is not in man to move the heart to grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 5.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. But God doth take the power of conversion to himself, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. The means indeed is the word, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. Examples hereof we have throughout the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles. Therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> men be here converted, God doth aid the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and is with them by the power of his Spirit in that work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. by which the Apostle proveth to have the power of the Spirit in his Ministery by the conversion of his hearers. All which considered, and finding the four causes requisite to make up and compleat true Ministers, to be with us; I conclude that the Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> for the most part, are men sufficiently qualified by God, orderly called to the Ministery, and to do that work which Christ appointed his Ministers to do, and consequently that they are not Babylonish, but true and lawfull Ministers of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Argument.</hi> They that have the true properties of true Shepheards, are Christs true Ministers. But the Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> have the true properties of true Shepheards; Ergo, The Parish Officiating Ministers in <hi>England</hi> are Christs true Ministers, and consequently are not Babylonish, or Antichristian. The Minor I prove thus from the 10. of <hi>Iohn</hi>; for first, these go in by the door, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. that is by <hi>Iesus Christ, v.</hi> 7. by his call and the Churches, as I have proved before. Secondly, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter openeth unto them, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. who, <hi>invisibly</hi> letting men into the Church by Christ the door, is Gods spirit, who doth qualifie true Ministers with gifts, and graces, and is forcible by them to win people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>visibly</hi> the Porter is the Authority committed by the Church unto some for admitting men into the house, the Church of God. Thirdly, they lead them forth, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. that is, from pasture to pasture, from milk (the grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) to strong meat, Catechizing, and otherwise interpreting the holy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61677:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scriptures unto them. Which true properties of a Shepheard being found in the Parish Officiating Ministers here in <hi>England,</hi> it appeareth, that they are true Shepheards, and so true Ministers of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and therefore neither Babylonish, nor Antichristian, or Popish. Thus having with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proved unto you, that our Ministers are true Gospel Ministers; for the further clearing this truth, it remains that we answer to what they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against us, who do separate from us, which is chiefly this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Ordination of the Ministers, (who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this time are Parish Officiating Ministers) came from the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue; they also were ordained by Bishops; Ergo, They are not true Ministers; or thus: Those Ministers which stand by a <hi>Romish</hi> Institution, are no true Ministers. But the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> stand by a <hi>Romish</hi> Institution; Ergo, They are no true Ministers, but Babylonish and Antichristian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Minor of this Syllogisme must be denied; for we stand by no <hi>Romish</hi> Institution; for Ordination is none of <hi>Romes</hi> inventions, but instituted by the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> So that, <hi>the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>stand by an Institution of Christ descending to them from the Apostles through the Church of</hi> Rome, must be the meaning of this Argument. To which we answer, that the passing through <hi>Rome</hi> nulls not the Institution of Christ. As we cast not away the Scriptures, Sacraments, and what ever Ordinances we have now, though they have descended to us from the Apostles through <hi>Rome</hi>; Which Argument runs as strong against Baptisme, which, though mingled with <hi>Romish</hi> inventions, is not therefore nulled. The vessels that were once dedicated to God by his own Institution, though they were put into the house of <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Gods, and those that were fit, very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used to drink Wine in, when he praised the Gods, they were not so much as new cast again, but carried to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Ezra 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. Yea, Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> a great man of the <hi>separation,</hi> seeing one that was a Minister in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> afterwards to be chosen a Teacher to a separate Congregation without any new imposing of hands, undertakes to justifie the Action thus in five Propositions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Imposition of hands is of God and not an invention of man. It was not a Post, or a Threshold first brought by Antichrist into the Temple of God, but had therein before ever Antichrist sate there.</item>
               <item>2. Baptisme and Imposition of hands are joyned together among the Principles of the foundation spoken of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. Therefore they ought to be regarded.</item>
               <item>3. Imposition of hands is in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> still given to the Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ce of the Ministery, and in the name of the Lord, as they do also still administer Baptisme.</item>
               <item>4. We finde not either precept, example, or ground in the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e binding to the repetition of it.</item>
               <item>5. The Priests and Levites in <hi>Israel</hi> becoming unclean, when afterward they were cleansed, retained still their places of being Priests and Levites;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61677:45"/>
and the Children of the Priests and Levites, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </list>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> and with him also Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> (though in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both for the <hi>Separation</hi>) opposed <hi>rebaptization,</hi> because baptisme is an Ordinance of God, which was had in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the sell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Apostasie, and hath been there continued ever since the Apostles times, however commingled with many inventions of their own. So likewise Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> defended the Ordination of that Ministery, which he had in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> because Imposition of hands was in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the times of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Apostles, &amp; is there continued to this day, although much mixed with many pollutions of their own. <hi>Obj.</hi> But if those that separate from us will throw away all that comes through <hi>Rome,</hi> what course will they take, when they have denied all the Ordinances. that have been administred for these ninety years in <hi>England</hi>? for if no Ministery, then certainly no Authoritative Preaching, no Sacraments; and thus they have renounced their baptisme, which they had by these Ministers. What Method then will they take in their Reformation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How will they come to be rebaptized? They will tell us peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they will Covenant together, and then Elect, and ordain a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and he shall baptize.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reply</hi> Will they Covenant together (supposing themselves to be Saints first) say they so? Are they Saints by a calling? How came they to be so, What did God call them immediately? No; They must say many (if not all) of them, who have any truth of grace, by the preaching of the word they were called. What, from those Ministers, from whom they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as no Ministers, because of their Ordination? Hath the Lord so far owned his despised Members, as to make them the instruments to bring these to be visible Saints, fit to imbody, or Covenant? And are these now no Ministers? Are these the effect of their Ministerial labours, and they no Ministers?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ans.</hi> But they say, They will Elect and Ordain one Minister, and then he shall rebaptize.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reply.</hi> But since he did renounce his own baptisme also, who shall baptize him first? There must be a Minister to do that; to be sure he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it himself, nor none of them, for they are private persons. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Lords Supper before they be baptized is contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-rules, as <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> defends.</p>
            <p>But how can they Ordain this Minister, not being themselves baptized? Where doth it appear in Scripture that an unbaptized people did ever E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or Ordain a Minister? These absurdities would necessarily follow such a reformation of this whole Land, by denying th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Ministers to be true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and by annulling their Ordination, because it came through the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ans.</hi> But secondly, I answer to the main Objection, of our Ordination passing through <hi>Rome</hi> to us. That the Churches of <hi>England</hi> had not their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61677:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first beginning from <hi>Rome</hi> (as some fondly and ignorantly conceive) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Yea, <hi>Baronius</hi> a great stickler for <hi>Romes</hi> priviledges, yet acknowledgeth the Antiquity of the Church of <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Rome</hi> it self; observing the conversion of <hi>England</hi> to Christianity to have been the five and thirtieth year after the Ascension of Christ, and the Conversion of <hi>Rome</hi> to have been ten years after, in the year 45. So that the Churches of <hi>England</hi> were at first rightly gathered and constituted, the instruments of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering being from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Apostles, or Apostolical men, as is evident from Mr. <hi>Fox.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but that they did Ordain Officers in the Churches; for we read of Ministers and Bishops. The Land falling to the possession of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> about the year 568. the History saith (<hi>p.</hi> 147.) that by them all the Clergy and the Christian Ministers of the <hi>Britains</hi> were then utterly driven out, in so much that the Archbishops of <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>York</hi> went into <hi>Wales.</hi> Thus long then it seems that the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> had no Ordination from <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, It is very observable from Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Speeds</hi> Historie of great <hi>Britain,</hi> that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> the corruptions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have introduced about Ordination of Ministers, and other Ecclesiastical affairs, were withstood and opposed by the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; Nor do we read of any Ministers in <hi>England</hi> that were ordained by any Agents sent from <hi>Rome</hi>; but onely of some idle Ceremonies of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, that were ordained by the <hi>Pall</hi> and the <hi>Ring</hi> brought thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi> So that if the whole be well considered, it will puzzle those of the <hi>Separation</hi> to prove, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was beholding to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for either the first plantation, after Reformation, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Gospel, Church and Ministery therein, from the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning even to this very day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ans.</hi> But thirdly, I answer, that in case it be granted, that our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation have passed through <hi>Rome,</hi> so that it have been formerly corrupted with some Romish Rites &amp; Ceremonies, as <hi>Baptisme</hi> also was; and that stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have been built upon Gold, and upon the true Institution of Christ for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61677:46"/>
the ordaining rightly the Gospel-Ministers; Yet neither this scruple, nor the Objection of Bishops ordaining formerly is sufficient to null our Ordination, and make void the true Ministery of <hi>England,</hi> nor any warrantable Plea to separate from us, and from our Congregations. A stream of water that springs from a clear Fountain may in the first <hi>Reach</hi> run like the Fountain clear, in the second <hi>Reach</hi> by reason of a muddy and soul bottom it may run also muddy, and in the third <hi>Reach</hi> it may come out again clear and run as at the first. And yet none will deny it in the third <hi>Reach</hi> to have streamed from a clear Fountain, neither any loath to drink of it, because immediatly before it ran through a muddy <hi>Reach.</hi> Even so, our ordination hath sprung from a clear Fountain, from Christ our Head, and in the first <hi>Reach</hi> of the Primitive times ran very clear without corruptions, or innovations of sinfull men and Prelates; In the second <hi>Reach</hi> of corrupt and Popish times it ran more muddy, by reason of pollutions and filthy inventions, and Ceremonies Superstitiously added to it by the Popes. But now in the third <hi>Reach</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> from Popery it runs again clear as at the first. And therefore who with conscience can deny it to come from a clear Fountain, and ought to loath it, because more immediatly it passed through the mud of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and corrupt men? The Sun shineth one day bright, the next day is obscured with clouds, and the third day shines bright again. And who, of sound judgement, will the third day deny that light and brightness to be truely the Suns, because the day before it was obscured and hid with clouds? Or, who will refuse the benefit of the Suns light and brightness the third day, because it was the day before clouded and obscured? Or, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the third dayes light truely to be the Suns, because the day before there was not from the Sun so clear a light? The same I say of our Ordination, that indeed it did shine in the Primitive times, and when our Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were first constituted, with a most clear and bright light of Christs own Institution; but afterwards it was obscured, and hid in a cloud of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Popish Rites and Ceremonies, and now again is clear, and bright, and shineth with the light of the true Institution; Who therefore of sound judgement will refuse the benefit of it? Who can deny it to be from the Sun of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> Jesus Christ, because in Popish times it was obscured with clouds of Superstition? Though by the Papists we are unjustly called <hi>Hereticks</hi>; Yet some of them deny not to us what those of the Separation here will not grant us; Some of them do still look upon our Ordination as true, by reason of the Head and Fountain of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> from whom it sprang. <hi>Dominicus Soto, Bellarmine, Gregorius de Valentia</hi> do teach out of <hi>Austin,</hi> grounding on the Scripture, that Heretical Bishops may lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and that it is an Heresie, such as the <hi>Donatists</hi> was, to deny it. To this agrees the judgement of our Saviour, who teacheth that the Scribes and Pharisees have a lawfull Succession (they sit in his Chair, their calling is of God) though a Race of bad men possessed that Chair, and Christ will have them acknowledged for their lawfull Ministers, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. So is our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61677:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling and succession, though it passed through corrupt times. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themselves, Baptisme, and the Articles of our Creed have all passed through the <hi>Papacie</hi> unto us, and yet they cease not to be true Scriptures, nor true baptisme. Much less doth Ordination cease to be true and right, it being an Act of Jurisdiction, which may be legally and lawfully performed by men of corrupt Faith. We must carefully distinguish the Acts of <hi>Office</hi> (which have their form and being from a Root, or Fountain without us) from the <hi>qualities</hi> of the man, that performeth that Office. The man may be naught, yet his Office be good; and Acts done by ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue of his Office may be good, just and allowable, although the man &amp; his religion be naught. As for instance in <hi>Caiphas</hi> and in those Priests to whom our Saviour bad the Lepers go, and shew themselves, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. A Popish Land Lord makes to his Tenant a Lease of a Farm; The Lease is not Antichristian, but good in Law, although, he that demised it, be for his Religion a Papist. A Popish Judge doth pass a sentende in Court, which standeth good in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature; his sentence is not Popish, though he that pronounced it be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. The reason is, because the Legal sentence is not of him, nor from him as a <hi>Papist,</hi> but as a <hi>Iudge,</hi> who doth but deliver that which he hath received from an higher root, the <hi>Law.</hi> So in this case Ordination is an Act of <hi>Office</hi> derived from Christ, and it is not Popish, though executed by a Papist. We do not rebaptize them that were baptized by a Popish Priest, because the power of Gods Ordinance depends not on the Person, that doth execute the same, but upon an higher foundation, the <hi>Institution</hi> of Christ. Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Acts are not vitiated, or made null, though they pass through the hands of bad men, but stand good to all intents and purposes to such as receive them aright by vertue of their <hi>Office</hi> Authoritatively derived from the first Institution.</p>
            <p>Yea, further I say, that if there have been no true Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> or else where, no true Ordinances, nor Churches, but where there hath been no humane mixtures, nor wicked Persons, or Officers, then there have been but few Ministers, Ordinances, or Churches, since there was a Church upon earth; and if there ought to be separation from such Ministers, &amp; Churches, then we should have found before these dayes Separatists enough. How hardly was Superstition kept out in the Church of the <hi>Iews</hi> before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity? Afterwards when Christ came, were they clear? What shall we say of corrupt <hi>Caiphas</hi> then the high Priest, his corrupt entering into, and his continuing in the place for one year? So the Pharisees, a generation corrupt that God never Instituted; their School began, some say, two hundred and fourty years, some say more, before Christ, and for their Superstitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions they were not barren in them. But did Christ so soon as he came to preach, call away the people and bid them separate? No, we finde no such words, but rather we read, that (though here were corrupt Officers) Christ bids the multitude hear them and <hi>observe and do whatsoever they bid them observe and do,</hi> Math. 23. <hi>v.</hi> 3. After Christ, how long did the Churches
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61677:47"/>
continue without Superstitious mixtures? I believe we shall finde, that the Church hath not been long free, but we do not finde separation presently, and nulling of Ministers, as now. Men should do well to give us a precept, or example out of the word, where Ordinances have been dispensed true for the substance, (though some humane mixtures have been joyned to them) that therefore they were itera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ized from the purity of the Gospel and of the Ordinances of Christ to Popery, we shall finde that Ordination for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance died not in them; for before they fall, they were truely and rightly Ordained to preach and pray; and if to preaching and praying they added Mass mumming, that their first corruption did not deprive them of that first power which by true Ordination they received to preach and to pray; for that power was not given them conditionally, so long as they preserved themselves from corruptions, and to be forfeited by corruptions, as I shewed before, that corruptions in an Officer do not null, or make void the Acts of Office, which have their form and being from a root, or foundation without. Ordination therefore in them was not lost by reason of their corruptions; And if not lost in them, then in them it still continued; and if it continued in them, then still in them there was by vertue of their true Ordination for substance <hi>potestas in,</hi> and <hi>potestas ad, a power in,</hi> in themselves to preach and to pray still, and <hi>a power to, or towards,</hi> to, or towards others, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this power, by imposition of hands, to others, to other Ministers and Presbyters; in whom neither could Ordination for subs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Superstitions &amp; corruptions of those that succeeded the first, were in kinde of the same nature and quality with those that were found in the first, and so they could not (being the same in kinde, and nature) do more then the first, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> make void and null that Ordination for <hi>substance,</hi> which the first corruptions in the first Apostates never made void and null. So that in those Presbyters, who succeeded the first back-sliders, there was also <hi>pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas

in,</hi> and <hi>potestas ad, power in themselves,</hi> to preach and to pray, and <hi>power to, or towards others,</hi> to communicate this power by imposition of hands to others. And so in them neither could ordination, for substance still right, die, or decay. And so successively ordination for <hi>substance</hi> continued true, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the corruptions, and evil qualities of Officers, till the glorious light of <hi>Reformation</hi> began again to shine. As in a wall, which on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even so Ordination as a strong wall to the Church of Christ, though at first in the pure and Primitive times it was observed and known by the true white colour of Imposition of hands by the Presbytery with fasting and prayer, &amp; without any <hi>Oyls, or dawbing ointings, and Chrisms,</hi> by praying and preaching onely, without that black corruption, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of <hi>Mass-mumming,</hi> or paintings of an <hi>unbloudy Sacrifice,</hi> yet continues and then continued true for <hi>substance,</hi> and was not quite destroyed, or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the colours of Rites and Superstitious Ceremonies put upon it by corrupt Bishops &amp; Presbyters, who lived in <hi>England</hi> in the height of Pope y and Romish Superstition.

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be Objected and said of them, that they, being Ordained to the <hi>Mass,</hi> as well <hi>as</hi> to <hi>Preaching, Praying,</hi> and <hi>Admistring the Sacraments,</hi> could not Ordain others to Preaching and Praying and Administring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments onely, unless they Ordained them to what themselves had been Ordained, to wit, to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> also, and to the <hi>Mass,</hi> because their power reached to the latter as well as to the former. And so the Ministers succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and yet not truely Ordained to the same full power of <hi>Massing</hi> and <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> to which they that Ordained them, had been themselves Ordained; but being Ordained to one part onely of their power, to wit, to <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Administring the Sacraments,</hi> and not to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and the <hi>Mass,</hi> were not truely Ordained; because the first Reformers had shaken off and renounced their own full power, which themselves had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by abjuring the <hi>Mass</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to which their power reach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To the which Objection I answer with this plain and easie instance of a Justice of the Peace now amongst us; whose former power was onely to Administer Justice, and to act by Law against Delinquents and Offenders, binding them over to the Sessions, or committing them to the Gaol, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

If now a Justice of the Peace should make a scruple of doing this (as some I hear already do) his Conscience telling him that Marriages have for many years in all sorts of Churches, yea in the best Reformed Churches, alwayes belonged to the Ministery, as an Ordinance of God (though not as a Sacrament, as <hi>Rome</hi>

If, I say, upon these grounds (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himself unlearned in the Scriptures unfit for such good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, instruction and Admonition, having not a Spirit of prayer for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) he should renounce that power given unto him, to joyn Man &amp; Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even so the first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyters, Priests, or Bishops, who had received power by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their Ordination to <hi>Preach</hi> and to <hi>Pray,</hi> and to <hi>administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> and also to say <hi>Mass,</hi> and in the Mass to offer up a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; when the true light of the Gospel, and Reformation began to shine upon their Consciences, were by the Spirit moved to renounce some part of their power, as not belonging to them (to wit, the <hi>Mass</hi> and <hi>Sacrifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And who will say that because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unlawfull power, therefore their lawfull power was forfeited and made void and null, either <hi>in themselves</hi> to practise it, or <hi>towards others,</hi> to communicate it to others by right, true and lawfull imposition of hands, as Christ ordained?</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But this Objection against our Ministery and our lawfull succession is much like to that of <hi>Rome</hi> against us, saying, that the Ministers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches had no Commission, or lawfull calling (being under the Pope and Popish Prelates) to reform the Church; and so think, and judge our Separatists, that our Commission being void) and all power to ordain, and to Reform the Church is fallen to the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To whom I answer with <hi>Morneus</hi> his answer to the Papists Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against our Reformers at the first beginning of Reformation; That the calling of our first Ministers, which reformed the Church in these last times, was the same vocation and succession, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ereof they themselves do brag; but the same vocation, which they abused, have our men indeavoured to use well, and to that vain succession, wherewith they decked themselves, they have added the succession of true Doctrine, which they had corrupted; without which all succession is nothing else, but a continuing of abuse and errour. <hi>Wickliff, Ion Hus, Luther, Zwinglius, Oecolampadius, Bucer,</hi> and others of that School (from whence the Ministers, which have gathered Churches from under Antichrist are descended) were Priests (as they call them) and Doctors in Divinity. As Priests and Pastours they had charge to preach the truth unto the people, and to Administer the Sacraments unto them according to the Institution of our Lord. As Doctors, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to expound Divinity in their readings and in their books, and they were bound by the ordinary Oath of all Universities to declare the truth unto the Church, to confute all Doctrines repugnant against the word of God, and with all their might to expell it. Now in their time they sound that the word of God was hid unto the people, that the honour, which was due to God alone, was turned to men and to images, that the bloud of Christ was trodden under foot, that the Sacrament of the Supper was partly turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry, and partly denied unto the poor people; To be short, that all the holy Scripture was prophaned and poysoned with the Popes gloss and Popish interpretations. And when they shewed these things to the Bishops and Metropolitans, according to the order of their Church, they made no reckoning of them, they were the first that persecuted them, because they themselves were the infected part of the Church. I ask therefore, if their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation commanded them not to go farther, to wit, to preach the truth unto the people, and purely to administer the Sacraments? And if they had done otherwise, whither they had not been forsakers of their calling, contemners of their Oath made unto God, and abusers of the people? Both two there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our Popish Adversaries, and our first Ministers had one and the same ordinary and outward calling. But herein is the difference, that, that which ours have followed, the others have forsaken; that which ours have done of duty by reason of their charge, the other have concealed. Ours have led their sheep upon the Mountains of <hi>Israel</hi> into good pastures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. the others have devoured them, or else left them for a prey to the beasts of the field, or else driven them to the Fens &amp; Marishes, where they have starved.

A Magistrate shall be called to the Government of a Common-wealth, where he shall finde the good Laws corrupted by the negligence, or malice of those that went before, his Courts full of injustice, the Officers subject to factions, briberies, and corruptions, and he would reform all this, and bring it to the censure of the Laws. He that will further now ask him, by what right he doth this, should he not make himself a laughing-stock, because he follows step by step his calling? He hath not sworn to maintain abuses, but rather to maintain the Laws, and to provide every way that he can for the good and preservation of the Common-wealth.

Consequently some whole Realms were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; the very Bishops themselves, that there had preached lies, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth in the self-same Church and Pulpit; and they with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Presbyters ordained others to preach and pray, &amp; to Administer the Sacraments according to Christ his word truely revealed to these Pastours and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But secondly, The Bishops, which ordained our Ministers since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, were not Antichristian, or Babylonish, which I prove thus.

We have grieved the holy Spirit, and therefore well may the Spirit refuse to comfort us, who have grieved him. Well may the God of Heaven bathe his Sword in our bloud, and yet bring more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies upon us, and make the Land fat with our Carcasses, for we have forfeited our very Estates and lives; we do not deserve one bit of bread, or drop of water; justly may God feed us with the bread o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh than, Let us humble our selves at the feet of Christ. let us with <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> weep at the feet of Christ for our sins, let us at the feet of Christ break our Alabaster boxes, our hearts I mean, for that we have broken his Laws, and have made great breaches in the Land.</p>
