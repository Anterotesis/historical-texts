            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ilent and calme times, and an equall stream of secular Affairs are more acceptable to men of the present age, because they are times of injoyment; whereas the greater Changes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions of the world do more delight Posterity, or such as survive the trouble of those Changes. For tis a pleasure to behold at such a distance the Risings and Falls of Nations and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, as to see the raging Sea from the secure Land. And it doth not seldome come to passe that an universall Concussion, and the shaking of the pillars of the earth, doth cast it into better frame and settle it on a firme Basis: So that the men of the former Age doe labour,
<pb facs="tcp:56747:3"/>
and those of the later enter into their labours. Even so, tis the Calamity of these Dayes to be engaged in such a Warre and the wofull atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants thereof; yet their felicity to be engaged for the highest interests in this life, which will exalt them, whatsoever the successe be; and if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous, will make the faithfull in the land a perpetuall Excellency, and the joy of many Generations. The Action of these times tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends the Barons Warres, and those tedious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords betweene the Houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> in as much as it is undertaken upon higher Principles, and carried on to a nobler end, and effects more universall. And in this you have acted not the least part for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government to your owne safety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and by a generall acknowledgement not a little to the preservation of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherefore out of abundant respect to my deare native place, having collected some Memorials of its fidelity and Industry, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present them to your view, who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of, and bore a part in those performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I remember my own thoughts when we were in the height of Danger, and ready to fall
<pb facs="tcp:56747:3"/>
into the depth of Misery, That I did seeme to refresh my selfe in the conceipt of the future joyous remembrance thereof, when we should out live those extremities. And you also must needs be abundantly satisfied in reminding those manifold hazards and exegencies which you by patience and perseverance have in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure overcome. For which cause this Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Relation, though it tenders it selfe to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of all serious men, yet unto yours chiefly, that your ioy might be yet more full. Neither ought we to be so iniurious to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to bury or keep secret the influence and working thereof upon the endeavours of a willing people. Hitherto you have runne well, nothing remaines but perseverance, that the concluding part may be blessed and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let your City ever flourish and prosper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the Highest.</p>

               </gap> introduction.</p>
            <p>The Relation therefore brings to remembrance the affaires of a particular Command, which as yet hath not been the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest part of the present warfare, the event wherof all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may expect with admiration and horrour; tis one branch of the History of these times, which happily may be viewed in severall parcells better then in one entire body: for such a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, if it shall duely expresse the rise and progresse of things, must needs be perplexed with multiplicity of interwoven Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, when three Kingdomes are ingaged, and no part in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them stand free as Spectators onely of the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; that the worke must either swell into a bulke mishapen and burdensome, or lye too narrow to comprize the severall parts in their just and perfect measures; but many single Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations doe more exactly delineate, give the truest colours, and put upon things the most unsuspected visage. Generall Histories doe seldome approach the fountaine of action, and their glosse though beautifull, yet more dull cannot hold forth that native grace and lustre. Whereas there appeare in particular branches those lively sparklings and more secret motions of life and heate, which strike upon that fancy and intellect that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and reach them; besides, they that gather up so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Plots (as are now acted) into one modell, are wont to endeavour after a smoother path, a greater harmony, and more exact symmetry of parts; whereas the face of things is consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of more disproportion, sometimes a confusion of businesse, and the severall scenes may easily swerve from the originall plot; but the divided parts drawne in severall are not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and rackt, but come naked and more simple, and shew that the reason of the same Counsells is one in the Senate or Conclave; another in the field, discovers the failing or the crosse-working of contrivances, how in the midst of action the maine Land-markes are waved, and many grand projects ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach their period. Out of all which the comparing faculty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56747:5"/>
of a judicious observer may collect the mis-guidance or defects of Policy; and see how the pearcing subtilties of wit are broken and shattered by the course of things more knotty, rude, and and violent; and this is the life of History, that ought to declare the delinquency of State as well as its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and perfection.</p>
            <p>If the materialls of the Worke be questioned whether fit to be drawne up into one regular and compacted whole, and to make a standing monument, we also know that nothing in this kinde is to be thrust upon the world, since History doth intend to gratifie the future times with the remembrance of those things onely which prudent men desire, and claime from such as pretend an interest and portion in the treasures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it beares therefore before it nothing more then the thing it selfe gives forth, and which may finde acceptance with severer wits; for not onely the remarkable changes of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, the grand periods of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, the chiefe and turning points of State-affaires, but particular Plat-formes, lives, examples, and emergent occasions also, are to be observed and laid up for posterity. More yet, those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, and minute passages are they that come home to mens businesse, approach their experience, and guide their course; but things more grand and lofty seeme to be turned upon the wheeles of Providence; too high for the imitation of men. The worke of a politick or martiall man is to fixe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and then to expect the accomplishment, not by one sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or great atchievement, but by a series of many particles, and through an infinite variety of emergent occasions, and at last the maine turning point falls in by the over-ruling power of the Universall cause; such are properly the workes of men into which they ought to enquire and search. Besides, the chiefe skill is not the generall knowledge of the maine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, but a certaine dexterity in meeting every point, in working through many mazes and windings, since sundry passages of small purport intervene to disturbe or promove it. Experience tells, that many Universall Schollars are the most
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56747:6"/>
uncouth persons to Civill imployment, which so happens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they study Bookes more then the course of businesse, in which they gaze upon high objects, and binde themselves to the riged observance of received Canons; that if they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongst men, upon a slight accident unexpected, they sticke in the mire or runne a wrong course. We dislike not the taking up of well tryed Principles, onely by examples of all sorts must we learne to except and distinguish, and by consequence to use or abate the rigour of Politicall Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes: neither doth it seldome come to passe that inferiour things over-rule, and a circumstance may be predominant. From such a low bottome and meane beginning are great things raised, and as their verticle point come in an instant, so may they be turned upon a weake and slender hinge; yet we meane not those circumstances that are the inseparable attendants of every naturall action, but onely such as are worthy, and have a morall influence; all which shun their understandings who respect onely great, and excelse objects, which peradventure may flourish with ostentation and pompe, but if applyed unto the life of man bring forth an effect like the birth of the Mountaines. And here we tender a naked Comentary and true rehearsall of those things as deserve not wholly to be forgotten; if it be not full of rare changes which may grace the composure, and affect the Reader; yet doth it give the full draught of a Martiall command, and a true Copy of the things it intends to expresse: it hath this advantage it common with others of the like nature, that it can come forth to the censure of the present Age without the guilt and shame of mistakes or flatteries. Authors more Universall could never gaine to be stiled the Writers of unquestionable verities, for they see at a greater distance, and by a more obscure and dus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key light: certainly a nearer approach, and some kind of interest is required of him that desires to shew not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some tarcke and foot-steps, but the expresse image of things, for whatsoever passes from hand to hand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56747:6"/>
though upon the most undubitable Authority, proves at the best but the image of a Picture: for the best wit that takes things though upon the surest trust, must needs fall short of the Copy by which he writes, if not in beauty, yet in the truth and life thereof. The onely danger in such as are intressed is, least they be partiall to their own side, or make the Discourse more lofty then the Stage can reach; which mischiefe the deliberate thoughts of a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man can prevent, and tell him that the unvayling of the defects, and misfortunes of his owne party doth evince the sincerity of the Relation, and graceth it with more variety, then what the continuall streame of the hight of gallantry and successe can yeeld; and which is most of all, doth demonstrate that at some times the designe was laid upon the principles of reason, and prosecuted with industry, whereas continuall victory is attributed to a certaine hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den felicity, and the bounty of providence. Affection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receives a check from that man who is more true to his owne faction and ends, then to transgresse against the honour of that worke he takes in hand.</p>
            <p>As for this Military Government, the power hereof hath rested in one Command, and therefore doth more easily close into a single frame, yet not in a smooth and equall straine, but distinguished by many rises and falls: 'tis a branch almost divided from the maine stocke, and hath been put to live and act of it selfe: neverthelesse a branch still, and enlivened by the Authority of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes soveraigne power, from which it receives an influence both of support and guidance: but its distance from the fountaine of power had derived upon the Trustee a more free command, and made way for the perfect worke of a souldier both counsell and action, which is the surest way to make such commands both active and prosperous.</p>
            <p>The seate hereof lyes in the heart of the enemies Country, like a forlorn hope, and is maintained not so much for its owne sake, or that so much ground might lye under a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56747:7"/>
Power, but to divide the Kings Association, to stop his Recrutes, to scarter his Forces, and continually to distract the designes of that Army. Experience is witnesse of how great concernment it hath been to the safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, not one place in the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> hath so much exhausted the enemies Army, nor hath the like advantage to ruine it: It can paine them at the heart, 'tis a fire kindled in their bowels, that might eate out their strength, had it been the felicity of the State to have sent hither a part of those great supplies, which have been else-where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and done little towards the conclusion of the great worke.</p>
            <p>If this Collection shall present any thing that comes home to a civill life, or the imployment of a Souldier, if it shall bring to minde acceptable services, and cause the people to remember the day of small things, with the power of active and faithfull endeavours, that observe and follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, I shall not faile of my end: and I know that this my adventure is no more then what the action doth deserve, and the world may challenge.</p>
            <p>THe ingagement of the City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> in this common Cause of Religion and Liberty, first began when the Houses of Parliament declared to the Kingdome their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a defensive War: neither were its principall and active men drawne in by inferiour and accidentall motives, but quickened by the same Principles in the maine, that did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven and actuate the Supreme Court, expressing themselves the very motions of a Parliamentary spirit by an absolute and greedâ compliance with every act that breathed towards the perfect health of the State, the severall Remonstrances of both Houses were received with all due respect, whereas no Declaration sent from the other Party, found the courtesie of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56747:7"/>
formall entertainment. It hath beene the honour of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government, never to be guilty of the least act of disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice against that Cause which their hearts wish might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile and prosper. Therefore when the fire kindled and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Jesuited Papists and their adherents, was blowne up into a flame, and the heads of two Parties appeared within this Realme, the City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> determined not to stand Neutrall in action, but to adhere unto one party, with which they resolved to stand or fall, necessity requiring no lesse, which affection improves into vertue. The acknowledgement of its owne advantage in scituation and strength importuned a more timely Declaration, least by it selfe neglected, it should be seized by the Enemy, whose eâe was upon it, and so cast into perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bondage. Also the greatest part of the Country consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and resolved to maintaine their Birth-rights in the defence of the Priviledges and Power of Parliament, against all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of usurpation and tyranny.</p>
            <p>During the Kings preparaetions in the North, they attempted (according to the slendernes of al beginnings) to put themselves into a posture of defence, and exspected the instructions of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. And whereas the Ordinance of <hi>Militia</hi> was the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ground of difference betweene his Majesty and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, (they desiring such Officers in whom the State might confide, and the King refusing to deprive them that by himselfe were intrusted) when the rent was once made, a greater necessity impleaded the execution of that Ordinance: Whereupon the Lord <hi>Say</hi> was by Order of Parliament appointed Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: A Commission was likewise granted unto divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen for Deputy Lieutenants, many whereof drew back and shunned the imployment, that the power for the most part rested in the Members of the House of Commons for this County, by whose countenance many Companies of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers were raised, then called the <hi>Militia</hi> Bands, and led by such Captaines as the Embryo of the Warre could afford. But the first undertaking was more jocund then the progresse; as oft times it comes to passe, that a Military pompe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56747:8"/>
of bravery doth affect and raise up many feeble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who quickly lye flat when they begin to feele the stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cruelty of Warre.</p>
            <p>The Commission of <hi>Array</hi> did not adventure to render it selfe to the people; it was about to be offered to their liking at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Chando's</hi> and some other disaffected Gentlemen, but was stifled in the birth, and crusht by the rude hand of the multitude before it saw the light; the chiefe Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof was like to suffer violence by the meanest of the people, whose fury constrained him to promise, and give under his hand, that he would never more deale in the businesse. But when they saw that this Lord had escaped their hands by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conveyance, they were the more enraged, and waxed cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell against his Accoutrements and Furniture, and whatsoevtr of his was left behind, delighting in a contumelious revenge and rustick triumph. Such were the effects of that fury that tooke hold on the ignoble multitude, in whom not alwaies the deepe sense of their owne interests doth provoke this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie of passion, but peradventure a slighter accident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected turning of the fancy sets them in a hurry, when their insolency becomes intollerable, and they glory to vent their humours, by reason of an usuall restraint and subjection. Neverthelesse they have produced good effects, and oft times a more undescerned guidance of superiour Agents turnes them to the terrour of the Enemy, and an unexplecable selfe-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the common people, which prudent men promote and maintaine, yet no farther then themselves can over-rule and moderate. Hereupon the full streame of the Country runnes for the Ordinance of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and against the Kings Declarations and Commission of Array. But since we are now upon the beginning of action, it will not be from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to declare the grounds of that affection which the Country did expresse, and were common unto them with many parts of the Kingdome, that were devoted to the same Cause, but might appeare in a greater degree, and have a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the present example. Most men therefore did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56747:8"/>
foresee greater hopes of liberty from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the Kings Party; in so much that there appeared in all the States adhearents an inbred propensity to freedome, but a desire of vast Dominion, Dignity, revenge, or rapine in them that tooke to the contrary Faction; by which this Country did seeme well disposed to comply with the Parliaments grand Designe: for there was no excessive number of powerfull Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who for the most part care not to render themselves the slaves of Princes, that they also might rule over their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as Vassalls: But the Inhabitants consisted chiefly of Yeomen, Farmers, petty Free-holders, and such as use Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures that enrich the Country, and passe through the hands of a multitude, a generation of men truely labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, jealous of their Properties, whose principall ayme is Liberty and Plenty, and whilst in an equall ranke with their Neighbours they desire onely not to be oppressed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves extreamely bound to the world, if they may keepe their owne; such therefore continually thwart the intentions of tyrannie unto which they onely are moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who detesting a close, hardy, and industrious way of living doe eate their bread in the sweat of other men, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a secure estate, rejoyce rather in the height of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune though inconstant and dangerous. Such is the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant humour of Gentlemen in a corrupted age. Besides, the Country-man had of his owne, and did not live by the breath of his great Land lord; neither were the poore and needy at the will of the Gentry, but observed those men by whom those Manufactures were maintained that kept them alive. By which meanes it came to passe that neither they of the middle ranke, nor the needy were de voted to the examples of the Gentlemen who turned back, betrayed their trust (and are alwaies more apt to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or mistaken in judging of the common interest) but had learned to reverence their Liberties, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their native happinesse.</p>
            <p>But some higher cause had a greater influence on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56747:9"/>
endeavours of many for a well-bounded Freedome, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priviledges; a knowledge of things pertaining to Divine Worship, according to the maine Principles of the Christian profession. Which Religion is not according to the will of man but grounded upon an unchangeable and eternall Truth, and doth indispensably binde every soule to one Law perpetuall and constant. This therefore doth strongly implead the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of externall priviledges in her Professors, and though it doth not destroy the Kingdomes of the World, nor u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe a greater liberty then humane Lawes will easily grant, yet it will not give away its native right; and it hath more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in its nature an irreconcileable emnity against Arbitrary Government, and will worke its selfe out of bondage when the felicity of the times shall give power and a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full call. And in this kinde of knowledge this City and County was more happy then many other parts of the Kingdome by meanes of a practicall Ministry, which hath not onely its powerfull working in Divine things, but doth also inable vulgar capacities more fitly to apply themselves to such things as cenverne the life of a morall man; and although each Person thus informed reacheth not the depth of the reason, yet he can comprehend the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and jealousie makes him the more quick-sighted. Thus have we found that the common people addicted to the Kings service have come out of blinde <hi>Wales,</hi> and other dark cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Land; but the more knowing are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and question, and will not easily be brought to the bent. For this cause the ambition of the times hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the undermining of true Religion, to promote a blind and irrationall worship, that might bring forth an ignorant and slavish generation of men, which kinde of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage the meanest person that performes a reasonable service cannot but resent and feare.</p>
            <p>Yet something there was that might debase and infeeble their spirits (the plague and mischiefe of the whole Realme) a grosse ignorance, and supine neglect of Military Discipline,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56747:9"/>
there being no ground for the study and exercise of Armes that might keepe the body of the State in health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Nor is it unlikely that extreame vassalage was the end of that long sluggish Peace, when the Nation could not have been more happy, then in some just and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable warre with forraigne parts, though now none more miserable by reason of these civill broyles, that teare the bowels and eate up the strength of the Kingdome. 'Tis no shame in the progresse of time to looke backe upon the beginnings of action. The Trained Bands accounted the maine support of the Realme, and Bulworks against unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected invasions, were effeminate in courage and uncapable of Discipline, because their whole course of life was aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from warlike imployment, in so much that young and active spirits were more perfect by the experience of two daies service. Wherefore these men might easily repine at oppression, and have a will to preserve themselves; yet a small body of desperate Cavalliers might over runne and ruine them at their pleasure. Some professed Souldiers were sent downe from the Parliament to settle these and the Militia bands, who had this onely according to the Rules of warre, to be gathered under severall Captaines, and many of them into the forme of a Regiment, which disposition might fit them for a suddaine service, and the very posture conferre something of a warlike spirit.</p>
            <p>Within the City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> one Company of Volunteers was added to the Trayned Band, and some Peeces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance obtained from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bristoll,</hi> which were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with universall amazement by an Inland people, though not long after they grew familiar with their terrible executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: meane while the City was open on three parts at least, and had no considerable defence, onely capable thereof by advantage of scituation: The Citizens did mainely shew their care and affection in fortifying the Towne, a worke both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive and tedious; being of great compasse, and raised from the ground: During these things the Enemy came not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56747:10"/>
neere our dwellings, we heard of them a farre off, but little thought that the cloud of blood should be blowne from the North and settle over us, upon whom it afterwards brake into so many showres; that this place should become the seate of Warre, and the Stage of action; that then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open to a free commerce with the World, it should be shut up sometimes in strict custody, but still under a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger confinement, and beleagured at a distance in the midst of the Kings head Garrisons.</p>
            <p>At that time the rumours of Warre and first acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility quickly filled the eares and tongues of people, Alarms were then taken at a greater distance, and the first was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the neighbour City of <hi>Worcester,</hi> by five hundred of the Kings Horse, which entred the Towne, and at that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were not the least part of his Majesties forces: His whole strength could not amount to the number of a just Army, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the slender proportion of those times, neither could they march like a set and perfect body, but flasht through the Land as the Lightning that strikes from one quarter of the Heaven to the other. The noyse of a nearer Enemy rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Volunteers of the Country, who marched under the conduct of some Gentlemen towards <hi>Worcester,</hi> expecting to meete Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> with a strength of Horse, but Colonell <hi>Fiennes</hi> had faced the Towne and drawne off before the advance of our Foote, and they also retreated having done nothing, but so meanely prepared for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that they were much bound to the Enemy that they fell not out of the City and cut them in peeces. The same Volunteers came on the second time, and were to joyne once more with Colonell <hi>Fiennes,</hi> who returned with a greater strength of Horse and Dragoones under the Command of Colonell <hi>Sands,</hi> and now also prevented our Foot; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the onset, and approached the Towne with much speed and confidence on the Welch side of Seaverne, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> at hand to assault the other side; but were meerely deluded by a false Message from the Enemy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56747:10"/>
with a signall accordingly given, at which instant of time Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> arrived at <hi>Worcester.</hi> By meanes of this deceit the Horse rush upon an Ambuscado, when through the straightnesse of the passage first over a Bridge, then through a narrow Lane, neither the Reare could be brought up, nor the Van make a Retreat. 'Twas an hot skirmish, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with sufficient gallantry on our part by them that came up, where persons of value were slaine and taken, the rest wholly routed and fled in confusion farre beyond the reach of a persuite. This Victory was of great consequence to the Enemy, because the Omen and first fruits of the warre. Upon this the Kings forces hearing of the approach of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Army immediately quitted the Towne: so they shifted from place to place since their inconsiderable number would scarce allow them to erect any Garrison; yet they encreased by their motion and quick dispatch, gathered the strength of the Countries as they passed along, and withall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the contempt of their small numbers, and by frequent execution gained the repute of a Party not easily to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished. This they acted while the Parliament Army lay still, or marched according to the slow paces of a greater Body. The day after the Skirmish the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Worcester</hi> with his whole Power, and there continued a moneths space, sent forth severall Parties, as the Lord <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to <hi>Hereford</hi> to prevent the Forces of South-wales, whilst the King lay about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and raised himselfe to such an Army as was able to deale with and endanger that maine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer raised by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>After the famous Battaile at Edge-hill, the first large field of bloud in these Civill Warres, though the Kings Army was there much broken, yet his strength increased, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes began to looke towards him, as one at least-wise possible not to be overcome, and in this strange confluence of men His Army seemed like that fabulous generation that sprung out of the teeth of the Cadmean Serpent buried in the earth. The neglected Enemy becomes formidable, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56747:11"/>
Parliament Forces may desire their first advantage, but have sufficiently learned that to give the first blow is not against the Law of a defensive warre; the hopes of a subitaneous service are lost and the Kingdome is made sensible, that their peace and liberty will cost much bloud. Both the Armies begin to take up their winter quarters in the most defensible places, and for the most part are setled according to the affections and ingagements of the people; Colonell <hi>Thomas Essex</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into <hi>Gloucester</hi> with the Command of two Regiments of Foote as Governour of the Towne, but as yet the Deputy Lieutenants had the sole Command of the County. Foure weekes had not passed in this Government but Colonell <hi>Essex</hi> was commanded to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> to secure and settle that City of so great concernment, both by Sea and Land, and at that time much distracted between the well-affected and malignant parties. So it was, that the Kings Cause and Party were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by two extreames in that City; the one the wealthy and powerfull men, the other of the basest and lowest sort, but disgusted by the middle ranke, the true and best Citizens. Thus the present state of things had taught men to distinguish between the true Commons of the Realme and the dreggs of the people; the one the most vehement assertors of Publicke Liberty, but the other the first rise of Tyrannicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the foot-stoole upon which Princes tread when they ascend the height of Monarchy. In that City many of the rich men were dis-affected to reformed Religion, and some more powerfull were conscious of delinquency; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upbrayded themselves with their owne publicke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and therefore did much distaste the waies of the Parliament, and the needy multitude besides their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hatred of good Order were at the devotion of the rich men. These therefore began to raise Commotions, and hearing of the advance of the Forces from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> flocked together after a tumultuary manner, shut up the Gates, but chiefly guarded that Port where they expected an entrance would be made, and planted many Ordnance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56747:11"/>
against the approach of our men, with a full resolution to fire upon them. They were expected in the Evening, but Colonell <hi>Essex</hi> had intelligence of these preparations, and from a Party within was directed that night to march to another Gate (then neglected by the multitude) that should be set open; this was performed accordingly, and betimes in the morning he entred the City with his two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, besides great numbers out of this County, and in an instant surprized the mutineers, and quashed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse without drawing of bloud.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was againe left naked till the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> marched hither with his Regiment of Foot, and two Troopes of Horse from <hi>Hereford,</hi> the Earle himselfe was commanded into the West upon his first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, but his Regiment designed for this City under the command of Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> first as Deputy Governour under the Lord <hi>Stamford,</hi> afterwards with the power in himselfe which for the space of two yeares and sixe moneths continued an uninterupted and happy Government. The providence of God and the felicity of the place so over-ruling, that that Country which should endure the brunt, fustaine so many violent shocks, and beare up under the Kings whole Army should be defended by a Commander, whose experience, fidelity, and valour with indefatigable care and industry might answer the expectation of so great a trust, assisted with that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose very name proved a terrour to the Enemy, and long enjoyed the honour of the most ancient Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Parliament Army, though broken, torne, and worne out with extraordinary duty and service. And because the meere pompe of Military preparations, and the hopes of a sudden Victory being now past, the warre hath put on a blacker visage, and the sad effects thereof come home to these parts; it is meete to expresse what was the state of the Country at that time. The inhabitants of this County had openly engaged themselves in the State
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56747:12"/>
service, nor as yet had they any thought of repenting, though cast into the midst of an inraged Enemy. <hi>Oxford</hi> is the Kings head Garrison, <hi>Herefordshire</hi> possessed by his Forces upon the first removall of the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> into <hi>Gloucester; Worcester</hi> hath already entertained a strength, <hi>Wales</hi> rise on the Kings behalfe by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Lord <hi>Herbert:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> with his Army is drawne towards <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the West have their hands full; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in these parts of the Kingdome onely two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Regiments at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> which was much distracted by intestine divisions, and one Regiment at <hi>Gloucester;</hi> so that the most slender Guard was left upon these parts, where the Enemy resolved their chiefe game for the winter action. And if this Country must be preserved, it must be done by the Volunteers, which were yet as a Cake not turned, a kinde of Souldiers not wholly drawn off from the Plow or domesticke imployments, having neither resolution nor support suitable to the service: But the greatest defect was the want of able and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Officers; neither had they any Commander in chiefe upon whom the hearts of the people might fasten.</p>
            <p>Amidst these things the strength of the County was drawne to <hi>Cirencester</hi> a fronteer Towne towards the Kings head quarters, then made a Garrison to prevent the incursions of the Enemy, as well to preserve the Country from ruine as to advance the Publicke Service; Colonell <hi>Fettiplace</hi> had the Command of this Garrison, under whom some Traine Bands and Volunteers were drawne into a Regiment, and two Companies of the Lord <hi>Stamfords</hi> Regiment were added to incourage the businesse: a few Horse and Dragoones were raised at the free charge of the Country, and the rest of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia were to assist upon all appearance of danger: all things were trans-acted in a more voluntary, but lesse
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56747:12"/>
regular way. The businesse chiefly rested on Sir <hi>Robert Coske,</hi> Sir <hi>John Seamore,</hi> Master <hi>Natbaniel Stephens,</hi> Master <hi>Edward Stephens,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Hodges,</hi> with the rest of the Deputy Lieutenants; and setting aside these men with some gleanings of the Gentry, the Yeomen, Farmers, Cloathiers, and the whole middle ranke of the people were the onely active men. The Gentlemen in generall denyed their concurrence, discerting their Country either by open enmity or detestable neutrality; and from the Major part no better fruite was to be looked for in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Age, when in many of them there appeared an hatred of the Commons, and a strong disposition to the ends of Tyranny. Others there were not wholly averse from the good of the Common-wealth, whose enmity was grounded in Religion, which obtained the most eminent place in the Parliaments Cause. The superstitious adoring of their old way imbittered their spirits against reformed Religion, which to them seemed a peevish affectation of novelty, besides, the hatred and feare of Ecclesiasticall Discipline. But the greatest number neither driven by ambition, nor the spirit of blind zeale, onely resolving to be true to themselves, deserted the State with some inclinations to the contrary Faction, reflecting on their estates invironed with the Kings Country, neare the heart of his strength and farre from Parliamentary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; besides, the violence and quicke dispatch of the Kings Army, with the slow performances of our Country Agents after the space of an ordinary legall course in those extremities, did much deterre them; the Country complained of their principall men for the neglect of Taxes, and the Gentlemen might happily see the grudgings of the Country in the payment of those Taxes (for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are alwaies covetous though well-affected) and forbeare to urge whatsoever might distaste the people, or crosse the Parliaments accustomed moderation. Which slow deliberations did lessen the esteem of the service in the hearts of many.</p>

Whereas by no one thing could it more evidently appeare to be the Cause of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth then by the acknowledgement of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Commons, which is more honest and wise in things of publicke concernement; for though they be very weake one by one, yet brought together they ballance each other, and when no man hath power to impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate much, each man expects onely a proportionable share in the Publicke interest. Neither is their judgement and fore-sight to be undervalued who are apt to discerne any thing that concernes themselves, and being united are not like to faile, for they have the best experience and are neerely affected with the woe or weale of the State, and so may sometimes judge better then those that guide it, as he that useth the house can better judge thereof then the Builder, and the Pilate of the Sterne then the Carpenter. And although they have not the first and most excellent part of knowledge to finde out, and by themselves to understand the rules of Government, yet have they the second part, which is also excellent to judge aright of things proposed, and if not made fit for the yoke by dependence on the Gentry, can discover the fraud that lyes under the fairest pretext; but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by depriving the meaner people of their due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, blemished the reputation of their Families, and crossed the end of their honours and possessions, which in a well ordered State are given for a shelter to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shrubs that some generous spirit neerer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons might keepe off the invasion of Princes, and whose power was most desired in such an exegence, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the scatterings of the people and keepe them united, who for want of this concurrence were of lesse strength and vigour.</p>

Such was the face of this Country now ready to receive the first shocke of the Enemies fury. About the first of <hi>January,</hi> 1642. the maine strength of the Kings Army came before <hi>Cirencester</hi> prepared and resolved to storme it, yet they onely faced the Towne, and after two daies were strangely taken off, either disabled by the extreame cold on the Hills, or some suddaine misfortune, or daunted by the shew of unanimity and resolution in the people, or else clouded in their thoughts by the secret Will of God in the nick of action, that they made not the least attempt, but threatned an afterclap. A few daies after our forces had their designe upon <hi>Sudely</hi> Castle, at that time kept by Captaine <hi>Bridges</hi> in the behalfe of the Lord <hi>Chandos.</hi> Leiutenant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> was intrusted with the manage of this action, who drew from <hi>Gloucester</hi> a Party of three hundred Musketteers, with two Sakres assisted with foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Horse, and foure Companies of Dragoones from <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencester</hi> by order of a Counsell of Warre held there, and consent of the Deputy Lieutenants; there were in the Castle neere threescore Souldiers, with Provision and Ammunition sufficient: Our men drew up before it in the Evening, made severall shots, and the Canon did some Execution; the same night summons was given, the enemy refused to render up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quarter, but craved time till the next day, which in part was granted; Guards were set upon them all night, the next morning our men were drawne out to make an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, Beds and Wooll-packs were fetched out of the Neighbourhood, which they tumbled before, and saved themselves from shot: the Horse and Dragoones came up before the foot approached the wall, and possest themselves of a Garden under the Castle, and got Hay and Straw which they fired, that the smoake driven by the wind smothered the house, in the shadow of which the Ordnance were brought up undiscovered, and planted against the weakest part of the Castle, which when the enemy perceived they sounded a parley, and immediately rendred upon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the conditions were that all might have liberty of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56747:14"/>
person, and passe to their owne houses leaving their Armes behind, and taking an Oath never to serve against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: they compounded also for the goods in the house, for which they were to pay five hundred pounds within sixe daies, or to leave them a free prize to the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Within two daies after Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> faced <hi>Sudely</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure thousand Horse and Foot pretending an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to regaine it, but in the meane time marched his Artilery towards <hi>Cirencester.</hi> Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> made provision to maintaine the Castle by taking in water, and store of Hay and Corne, and having left there Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell <hi>Forbes</hi> with a sufficient Guard, himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Gloucester;</hi> the Prince with his Forces kept the Hills, and after three daies fell before <hi>Cirencester</hi> a stragling and open Towne, neither well fortified nor capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The champaine Country round about was most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Horse, in which the Enemies strength did chiefly consist, and which was then wholly wanting to that Garrison, for their Horse and Dragoones were sent to the taking of <hi>Sudely:</hi> most of their Officers were drawne out upon that service except the Captaines of the Volunteers, and Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Karre</hi> was the onely experienced Souldier left there: their Canoneers were wanting, the common Souldiers quite off the hinges either cowardly or mutinous. The storme rose when least feared by the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable people, who had not ended the joy of their late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from as great a power but strangely diverted; and though they were still in the same danger upon the reverse of the Army, yet were they not capable of the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust, till the storme hovered againe, either supposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves invincible, or by defiance to have bafled a wary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that falls backe and waites his time to returne with greater fury. On the second of <hi>February</hi> the Towne was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted and taken; the first and maine assault was made on a house a flight shot from the Town, which was defended by a hundred Musketeers for an houres space against two Regiments of Foot, and a Regiment of Horse which were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56747:14"/>
led on by the Prince, till at length having drawne up their Musketeers, and by Granadoes fired the Barnes and Ricks and smoothered the Guard, the Enemies Horse drove their Foote before them, entred the streetes by maine force, and possest themselves of the Garrison within two houres, yet it cost them the lives of many, amongst whom the <hi>Welch-men</hi> were reported to suffer the greatest slaughter, who in that Army were a continuall sacrifice to the Sword. Each Guard made resistance according to the Officers valour and experience; the Souldiers of the Earle of <hi>Stamfords</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had acted the best part but that they were most put to the sword when the Towne was entred, except those that by flight had their lives given them for a prey. Some few besides defended their Guards a while, but the passages were many and open, and the enemy soone came upon their backes; as for the Country-men their houre was not yet come, neither had they quitted such imployment as did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble their spirits, nor entred the Schoole of War to study indignation, revenge and bloud, that alone can overcome the terrour of an Army.</p>
            <p>It so fell out that in the midst of the service they were at their wits end, and stood like men amazed, feare bereft them of understanding and memory, begat confusion in the minde within, and the thronging throughts did oppresse and stop the course of action that they were busied in everything but could bring forth nothing; few of ours were slaine in the fight, but many murthered after the taking of the Towne, eleaven hundred taken prisoners and at least two thousand Armes lost, which the Country had there laid up as in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Magazine; the miserable Captives were entertained with all despight and contumely, according to the Enemies accustomed cruelty in the beginning of the warre; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Gentlemen had no better quarter then the common Souldiers, but were all thrust into the Church to be reserved for a triumph, and trampled upon in a base and impotent revenge: whether the first fury of a civill warre, and the jarres of Brethren prove most outragious, or the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56747:15"/>
cause of Religion had blouded their minds. Not a man could be released, though the price of his redemption were paid, till he had first attended the triumph at <hi>Oxford;</hi> that an unfortunate King might view the aspect of such inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Subjects, that should presume to claime those rights wherein they were borne when reason might easily evince that no slight matter could engage such a people in a open warre as were ever willing to deceive themselves into a Supererrogation of Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The whole Country was quickly full of this disaster, and in vaine did thinke to recover what was lost by weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit or errour in the chiefe manage of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; thousands of men armed and unarmed flocked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and resolved to undertake the Enemy under the conduct of a grave and well-minded Patriot; but the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Leader was conscious of the peoples madnesse, and knew well that they made a loude cry a farre off, but if once brought up to the face of the Army they would never abide the fury of the first onset. Wherefore he refused to engage himselfe and them upon a certaine destruction; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse the people bitterly railed against him, and curst him as a Traitor to his Country; neither could the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of these times dispossesse them of that absurd conceite.</p>
            <p>The very next day after the losse of <hi>Cirencester</hi> the City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was demanded by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons found the people extreamely dashed at the strange turning of things, and so much amazed that they could not credit the report of this blow, though confirmed by sundry eye-witnesses; the hearts of many sunke very low and began to lye flat, Zeale and Religion upheld some, all had a kinde of will; but the strong sidelity and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souldier at that time, and in all extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards upheld the Garrison. The Prince therefore received a short answer from Lieuten ant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Officers, that they were resolved with their lives and fortunes to defend the City for the use of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56747:15"/>
and in no wise would surrender at the demand of a forraigne Prince. Another answer was returned from the Mayor of the City (for the Martiall Command was not fully setled) that he was resolved according to his Oath and Allegiance to keepe the City in his Majesties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoose, and would not deliver the same according to this summons. Whereupon a second summons was sent from the Prince, which could not alter the case in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who held the Towne, and seeming withall to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and solicite them out of their Hold, did easily beget an opinion of the Enemies weakenesse and their owne considerable strength, since neither Religion nor modesty could with-hold from bloud that enraged Party, but onely the conscience of a selfe insufficiency; the Souldier there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to acknowledge the remainder of power which did not appeare contemptible with the Kings Army.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the City hath been lodged in the midst of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out Garrisons as the heart in the body, but now it hath enough to doe in its owne safety, and the remote parts must be pared off that a liberall nourishment might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and foster that place which was the seate and fountain of life unto these parts of the Kingdome. <hi>Sudeley Castle</hi> was deserted, the Garrison of <hi>Tewksbury</hi> (which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended onely with such slender Forces as <hi>Gloucester</hi> could spare out of its penury before the Enemy fell on the County) was already surprised with feare; both places could not be maintained when so great a power did urge, and heare downe on every side. Those of <hi>Tewksbury</hi> sent an expresse to the City to informe them of the State of their Towne, and to request more aide; likewise they dispatched Messengers to the Villages round about, to acquaint them with the state of things, and to try whether the Inhabitants would come in person or send in their Armes, but there came neither the one nor the other, and itwas resolved by the Counsell of Warre at <hi>Gloucester</hi> that the Forces, Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Ammunition with all well-affected persons should forth-with repaire thither. In the heate of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56747:16"/>
there came an invitation from <hi>Worcester</hi> by a Letter from Sir <hi>William Russell,</hi> with intimation of conditions of Peace; all which disposed that Towne to complyance with the Enemy. Hereupon a Common Counsell being held, and the Officers present 'twas determined that the <hi>Gloucester</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was to be obeyed. The Towne thus deserted was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to provide for its owne safety, and chused rather to obtaine some reasonable termes of Peace then suffer it selfe to be quite ruined; wherefore they drew up some Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be sent to Sir <hi>William Russell,</hi> yet before the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch they sent to <hi>Gloucester</hi> a second Message by the Minister of the Towne, and an Officer of the Garrison with Sir <hi>William Russells</hi> Letter and their Answer. These promised an early return, but failing some houres of the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the meane while the Propositions were sent to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi> This Message brought a countermand, when there sprung an Alarum that <hi>Cirencester</hi> was regained, and the spoile and prisoners recovered backe, for this cause the Souldiers were detained a while, but when the report was found untrue, of themselves they began to quit the Towne. In the Evening the Messenger returned from <hi>Worcester</hi> with the Propositions granted; the subjection seemed unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and dishonourable in them whose affections were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to this Cause, neither did there appeare a meanes to prevent it for the transmigration of the whole Towne was impossible, nor as yet did the condition of the warre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any such thing from one particular place; for the Parliaments adherents, as also the Malignant Faction did never at once forsake their habitations to be gathered into one body for a suddain conclusion, but were brought peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale unto action, and many lye under covert in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country reserving themselves for future service. Thus the people entertained gladly those conditions, which though performed in part yet were a sufficient bondage, did impoverish their spirits, coole their zeale of Religion, and lessen the former inclination to liberty; after which by frequent changes under many Lords they became so feeble
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56747:16"/>
that they never durst confide in themselves to vindicate the Towne into its former happinesse, but a long time remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned averse to the fairest opportunities, yea necessities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement and desired an everlasting neutrality. The deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Towne encreased the forces of <hi>Gloucester</hi> by two hundred Foot and Dragoones, and tooke off the feare of a greater mischiefe; for though the quitting of the place cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us to resent our great distresse, yet the taking thereof would have confounded our thoughts, and hazarded the maine chance where the whole strength did not lye at stake.</p>
            <p>The enemy breathed out threatnings, many false friends sought cunningly to make us affraid, the Country-men in generall were taken off, who in their jocund beginnings still concluded on the Victory, but never prepared for a blow, that the whole businesse was dashed at one clap, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when <hi>Cirencester</hi> was taken, in which they did repose so much trust. The issue discovered the weaknesse of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceedings in committing the whole fortune of the Country, and the lives of so many men to such a poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and hazarding the maine rest where the strength of the game could not be managed. Besides, the Enemy had this great advantage in over-powring the minds of men; who, since their cause could not lay claime to justice, nor themselves procure love, sought to prevaile by terrour and by their late cruelties became dreadfull: so that such spirits as wanted greatnesse of minde or strong fidelity to persevere, did greedily comply with that Party, supposing themselves secure from this side, at least in respect of a deep personall suffering, which supposals were grounded upon the Parliaments lenity, and unto which peradventure they were bound, that they might gaine affections in a voluntary warre. The more zealous and active had no head under whom they might unite and grow strong; the power of the Deputy Lieutenants was quite fallen, a kind of command suitable onely to the infancy of Military affaires, and the whole businesse was devolved on the Souldier, whom the people then beheld as the professed servants of fortune, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56747:17"/>
trusted not till after manifold experience; so they sunke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden, and gave up themselves to spoile and rapine. The clouds gathered round the City, the Enemy lay strong at <hi>Cirencester</hi> and <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> our men were confined to the Towne walls; the workes not halfe finished, the Souldier within mutinous and desperate: no monies came from the State, and but small supplies out of the Country, that the vilest mutineers were to be dealt with by intreaty, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies to be suffered with patience, who tooke so great advantage by our extremity that their humours had a full vent, and ran forth into incorrigible wickednesse: the City was constrained to free quarter and great disbursements by way of lone, and the Governour to use his skill in keeping together the male-contented Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The Army raised in <hi>Wales</hi> by the power of the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and his Son the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> begins to appeare, is designed for <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and comes on at <hi>Coford</hi> in the Forrest of <hi>Deane</hi> three miles from <hi>Monmouth,</hi> where Colonell <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> Regiment had made a kind of loose Garrison for the defence of the Forrest in an open Towne, and with slender preparations. Here the <hi>Welch</hi> fell on, but their Officers with strange fury drove our party before them, which was borne downe by their multitudes yet with a greater losse on their part; divers Officers were slaine, and with the rest their Commander in chiefe Sir <hi>Richard Lawdy,</hi> Major generall of <hi>South-Wales;</hi> of ours few slaine, but Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Winter,</hi> and some inferiour Officers, with about forty private Souldiers taken Prisoners. All the strength of these parts are now driven into the Walls of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> onely <hi>Barkly Castle</hi> is held still for an entercourse between us and <hi>Bristoll.</hi> This City was accounted one of the chiefe Holds of the Kingdome, and far from the well-spring of succour, yet was there no care of a competent Brigade or Magazine, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defect, by which the State hath received much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; that through the penury of men, Armes, and Ammunition, remote Garrisons are left in dispaire, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the maine Army must be diverted for their relief.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56747:17"/>
Our succours were yet to be raised, or selected out of severall commands and come on slowly; the people were held up by false reports, and to stave off the Enemy the Governour was to put the best face on a bad matter.</p>
            <p>Meane while a great power of the Welch Army advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gloucester</hi> and setled at <hi>Hignham</hi> house within two miles of the City and began to intrench. The Governour pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Guard at the Bishops house to keepe them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Sir <hi>Jerome Brett</hi> their Major Generall had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to demand the Towne, but the summons was received with scorne from a Welch Brigade, and became ridiculous when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had beene twice refused, besides an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred derived by fabulous tradition had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Welch-men and the Citizens of <hi>Gloucester.</hi> Such slight and irrationall passages prevaile much with the common people in whom opinion beares rule. Those Forces were said to expect Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> approach on the other side, else it cannot be imagined to what end they lay five weekes in a stinking nest. They were basely basled, never attempted our out-Guard, never undertooke the least Party that issued forth. Meanewhile the Prince was conceived to waite upon other designes. The <hi>Bristoll</hi> Plot offered it selfe, upon which his person did attend before the Gates of that City. Thence he was drawne off to stop Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> advance for our reliefe, who deceived the Prince by strong reports and night marches, and happily drilled along his small Army to the place of action. The Governour could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing but onely make good the Guard at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops house, and flourish with some slender Sallyes; he had not an hundred Horse, and the Enemies foot were double the number of those in the Garrison; at length an addition of two hundred Horse and Dragoones from <hi>Bristoll</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>John Fiennes</hi> gave some life to the businesse: hereupon severall Parties at sundry times were drawn out, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> never failed to beat the Enemy into their works, kill and take prisoners, although treble the number of our strongest Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that the name of our Blew Regiment became a terrour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56747:18"/>
to those miserable Welch-men, who were partly constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take up Armes, partly allured with the hope of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Certainely they were deceived out of their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try not to fight but to take <hi>Gloucester;</hi> by which meanes they could act an impotent villany and cruelty, but nothing of a Souldiers gallantry.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the taking of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> bent his course towards <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and laid his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe for the surprize of the Welch Army; he gave notice of his advance unto Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections instantly to draw forth both Horse and Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hignham,</hi> and to keepe them in continuall action, that they might not understand his approach. He gave order likewise that those Flat-bottomes which were brought from <hi>London</hi> upon Carriages for service upon the River <hi>Seaverne,</hi> should be sent downe to Frampton passage, sixe miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Gloucester,</hi> where both Horse and Foot were arrived by noone, passed over the River before night, and unawares of the Enemy got between them and home, tooke them in a snare and intercepted their flight. The Governour perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the intention of the Plot, drew forth all the Horse and a Party of five hundred Foot, brought up the Ordnance neere the house, and kept them in the heate of play till the Evening; at night he set Guards round the house, with that straitenesse and confidence that the Enemy durst not stirre, nor a Spy steale out, although they lay fifteene hundred strong. At Sunne rising they had a fresh Alarme by our Ordnance, and were held to it by our Musket shot. This morning their Horse issued out, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to force their way through the Horse Guard, which they did, and put some of our Horse rashly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and upon disadvantage, to a disorderly retreate, but comming up to a Foot Guard received a repulse: and to the reliefe of that Guard which was thought too weake, a Party was drawne from the Artillery, and that againe by this meanes much neglected, in so much that the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant the enemy fell out upon our Ordnance then like to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56747:18"/>
be deserted, but were beaten backe by the gallantry of some few that kept their ground. In this point of action Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> came up and shot his warning-peece on the other side, which dasht the Enemy, and so revived our men that they ran up with fury, stormed a redoubt, and tooke in it two Captaines and above thirty private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which service had a maine influence upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the house; Sir <hi>William</hi> placed his Army to the best advantage for shew, and displaid the Colours of two Foot Regiments reduced to a hundred and fifty men, drew neere the house and made some few shot with his Canon; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his approach not a man of the Enemy was slaine or hurt, yet the common Souldier would doe any thing but fight, when they were well fortified, and had a sufficient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine; they sounded a Parley and sent forth some Officers to treat, which had this result; that they should render the house and themselves as prisoners, and the Officers should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive respect and quarter according to their quality. Upon the returne of these termes some advised to break through, which the common Souldiers utterly refused and neglected the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a dark and rainy night. The persons that treated dealt the second time in a kind of begging way, but at last accepted the former conditions, and gave up the <hi>Welch</hi> Army into the hands of men quite spent with continuall marches and watching. Divers persons of quality were here taken, the most powerfull Gentry of <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> some of those that in scorne were stiled the Nine Worthies, who in the first opening of the great breach affronted the Parliament with a scandalous remonstrance; the next day being the twenty fift of March, neere fifteene hundred were led Captive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> as great a number as Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with the Garrison Forces could rise unto: Thus the first fruites of <hi>Wales</hi> were blasted, the strength of the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer parts almost vanquished, and the effects of this Victory had been more lasting had it been used to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Kings Party had a notable faculty in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Victories by strict imprisonment, and inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56747:19"/>
the rate of their Captives; their usuall fiercenesse did extract great Ransomes or unequall exchanges, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them to detaine their Captives in extreame misery, and to neglect their owne friends in the like thralldome, of which those that were taken at <hi>Cirencester</hi> gave a full testimony: But the Parliament Garrisons knew not how to keepe a correspondence in this case, but groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of miserable prisoners, were prone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or set free upon easie termes. And by this meanes most of the common souldiers then taken within tenne daies were sent backe into their owne Country, with an Oath never to serve against the Parliament; others that tendred themselves were entertained in the service, who for the most part proved Runnegadoes; the Commanders and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came off, some with a Ransome, and Oath which they quickly violated, and the residue were wholly lost at the surrender of <hi>Bristoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole successe of the former action happily complyed with the maine Plot, and extreamly dashed the Kings affaires in these parts. The generall fame did increase and heighten the repute of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and the enemy possessed there with began to draw back on all sides; Sir <hi>Matthew Carew</hi> forthwith quitted the Towne of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> which within twelve houres was repossest by our Forces, Captaine <hi>John Fienes</hi> was commanded thither with a slender strength of Horse and Dragoones, with whom the well-affected of the Town that abode in <hi>Gloucester</hi> began to returne. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was hasty and confused, without the observance of the Enemies motion or distance, or any rationall assurance of defending the place. Our Party had no sooner saluted the Towne but received an Alarme that the former Forces were returned with a greater power. 'Twas a gallant Brigade of Horse commanded by the Lord <hi>Grandeston,</hi> which immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> whereof our men had not the least intelligence; it seemed by the event that the Enemy expected none from <hi>Gloucester;</hi> however there was quicke dispatch on both sides, yet Captaine <hi>Fienes</hi> with his whole Party had bin
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56747:19"/>
surprised had not those Horse been kept off at a miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by a ridiculous accident. It so fell out that they met a man comming alone from the Towne, whom they fell to question whether any Forces were there, of what strength, and by whom commanded; the man intending nothing lesse then the escape of our Party, but supposing them a part of the Parliament Forces, and willing to curry favour begins to talke of a maine strength and vast numbers, with so many Guns and all kind of preparations, and withall defies the Cavalliers with much affected indignation; which words so farre prevailed that they presently held a Counsell of War, and once were about to fall back. This delay gave an houres respit to those within to prepare for a flight, who had no sooner recovered the end of the Towne, but the Enemy had entred, amazed to see themselves so miserably deluded.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had refreshed his men some few daies about the first of Aprill 1643. he advanced towards <hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> at the solicitation of divers Gentlemen of that Country, with a promise of concurrence in reducing those parts to the obedience of King and Parliament. When he came neere the Towne of <hi>Monmouth</hi> where the Lord <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had began to place a Garrison, the Souldiers did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his comming, but all shifted for themselves by flight; Sir <hi>William</hi> entred the naked and open Towne, where he stayed a while and sent many Parties abroad the Country for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of money; thence marched to <hi>Vske,</hi> where he set free some prisoners kept there; but the reducing of the Country came to nothing, for the Gentlemen did not perform, and he found there what usually comes to passe in such cases, that men desirous of alterations invite upon ample promises, but never make good, and feldome appearein the businesse till the Souldier hath done the worke to their hands, or they have gotten some stronge Hold to secure their ingagements. So that the well-affected would not declare themselves, because a running Army could be no lasting support, and they had no strong Hold, nor the stream of the people, which were at the devotion of the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> almost an universall Land-lord in that County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56747:20"/>
Whilst these things are acted Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> enters <hi>Tewks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> with a power of Horse and Foot added to those former under the command of the Lord <hi>Grandeston,</hi> resolving to make after Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and to intercept his return out of <hi>Wales,</hi> for he was gotten into such a nooke of the Land in the Enemies Country, that the Prince might easily drive him to a <hi>Nonultra.</hi> Wherefore a bridge of Boates was made over <hi>Seaverne</hi> at <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> that they might passe to and fro nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the retreat of our Army. Here the Prince marched over with a body of two thousand Horse and Foot, confident of this designe, and therefore too remisse &amp; slow in his advance. Sir <hi>William</hi> was nimble in the retreat, caused his Foot and Artillery to passe over <hi>Seaverne</hi> at <hi>Chepstow,</hi> and himselfe with his Horse and Dragoones passed through the lower part of the Forrest of <hi>Deane</hi> neare the River side, and before the Enemy had notice of his march sent forth two Parties to fall upon two of their maine quarters, which was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med whilst the maine body slipt between both, and a Party was left to face them and make good the retreat, which came off something disorderly, and with the losse of a few private Souldiers. 'Twas an exquisite conveyance, and unexpected felicity that brought them out of the snare through those intricate waies. This Alarme quickly reached <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> drew out three hundred foot and two troops of horse to fetch off our men, but if he found them dis-ingaged, for a further designe. This Party met them within two miles of the Towne, where the Governour made knowne to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> his purpose to set upon <hi>Tewks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and taking the opportunity of the Princes absence, and the Enemies jollity at our supposed totall defeate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly advanced upon them, and by break of day brought up his men before the Towne, one part whereof fell in to the <hi>Ham,</hi> seased upon the Guard left with the bridge of Boats and cut off that bridge, the Horse with the rest of the Foot came up <hi>Gloucester</hi> way, the Forlorne. Hope surprised and slew the Sentinell, climbed over the workes, and cut down the draw-bridge; whereupon both Horse and Foot-rushed in, and the party on the other side of <hi>Avon</hi> ready to enter: there were left
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56747:20"/>
in the Towne neere three hundred men commanded by Sir <hi>Matthew Carew,</hi> whom the triumph of yesterdaies concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Victory laid asleepe, and the sudden Alarme roused up, first into a shuffling fighting posture, and after halfe an houre to a nimble escape. Sir <hi>Matthew Carew</hi> fled, and many esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the hands of our men, who wanted numbers to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Towne, but most of the common Souldiers, and some valuable Officers were taken. <hi>Oxford</hi> was as miserably gulled in these passages, and in a few houres extreamely affected with contrary reports; for the jocund newes of the vanquishing of Sir <hi>Wil. Waller</hi> arrived early in the morning, but before noone an expresse came of the losse of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> which was cast upon the heat of the first report like cold water into a boyling pot.</p>
            <p>The same day a Party of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Horse appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the top of a Hill neere <hi>Tweksbury,</hi> and intimated the approach of his whole Army; whereupon Sir <hi>William VValler</hi> marched thither that Evening, and resolved to breake downe or make good the bridge at <hi>Upton</hi> upon <hi>Seaverne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which there was no passe nearer then <hi>VVorcester;</hi> but the Scouts gave notice that the Prince had recovered the bridge and set a guard upon it. The next morning Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Prince, and found him in <hi>Ripple</hi> Field with his Army drawn up, and divided into three bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the hedges lined with Musketeers. Here our Forces fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Enemy in a large field, and could hardly reach the third part of the Princes strength, brought up their Gunnes, having neither shot prepared nor Cannoneers that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the businesse, nor the assistance of Foot, save only a part of the Governours owne company, besides the wind and Sun were against them, and no retreat if need were, but through a narrow Lane of two miles long; and whereas they might stand upon the top of a rising ground to deceive the Enemy with the semblance of a greater power behind, they descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little on the side of the Hill, and discovered their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a full view. In this posture some perswaded to fight, and began to make some shot with the Ordnance which gave no shew of the least execution; But some other Officers
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56747:21"/>
examined the Cannoneere, and finding neither fit Bullet nor any convenient shot, but all things at randome, earnestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded either to make the onset, or expect the enemy in that place; and advising likewise the tryall, discovered their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscadoes within the hedges. Hereupon Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler</hi> fell back, and entred the narrow Lane commanding a Party of Dragoones to face the Princes Army, and the Musketeeres to stand at the corner of the lane within the hedges to make good the retreat. The enemy fell on, not a man of those Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons would stand to receive the charge, but hurried away, broke over the hedge, fell among and disordered our owne Musketeers, the Enemy clapt in after them, cut down foure or five of the Foot, and tooke as many Prisoners; Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> kept close to his Foot, and instantly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht to <hi>Tewksbury</hi> for a supply, and Sir <hi>Arthur Hazelrigg</hi> prevailed with his owne Troope to charge, and in his owne person performed gallantly; the Foot with those Horse put the Enemy to a stand, and in part tooke off the foulenesse of the retreat through that straite passage. When they came to the next open place our men had the advantage of a ditch to stay the persuit, and in the heat of the chase one Foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier at the command of the Governour turned upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy a gate then cast of the hinges; which barred their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance &amp; enabled our men to draw up for a charge; here for a while they stood in a maze, but on a suddain faced about, ran flock-meale, the Enemy upon their backs, and the close of this action was like to be miserable, but at the entrance a strait passage neere the <hi>Myth</hi> Hill, a supply of Foot from the Town opportunely met them, gauled the Enemy and put them to a stand once more, whilst the Governour charged the leader of the forlorne hope hand to hand, and was res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued by the gallantry of some Officers, when of ours onely a small Party of Horse remained in the field, the rest being got off in great confusion. Yet the escape might equall a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the saving of the Forces passe for cleare gaine. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> did not attempt the regaining of <hi>Tweksbury,</hi> the Government whereof was intrusted to Sir <hi>Robert Cooke,</hi> who had newly raised a Regiment of Foot by Commission from sir <hi>VVilliam VValler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56747:21"/>
At that season the main strength of the Kings Army was drawn from these parts when <hi>Redding</hi> was beleaguerd by the Earle of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi> by which meanes the Parliament forces had a large and free game in this Countrey; went on with a full stream of successe, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a gentle gale of providence, and a kinde of unimitable happinesse, in unbloody victories. The fortune of the former did over-rule the event of the succeeding action, and the name and presence of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> did include more then a thousand men. Neither was he wanting to himselfe, but made the best use of his present fame, and kept it up by constant active endeavours, lest a little intermission might permit the enemy to recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or the reall weaknesse of this Army be discerned. It was therefore suddenly resolved for <hi>Hereford,</hi> whither he advanced with a thousand Horse and Dragoons, assisted by the Governour, with the greatest part of the Lord <hi>Stamfords</hi> Regiment: there were also the beginnings of Colonell <hi>Thomas Stephens</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The maine body of Horse and Foot were drawn up before Bisters gate on the North side of the Town, stood aloof off and shot at random; till the Lievtenant Colonell commanded Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Grey</hi> with a party of musketiers over the River, towards <hi>Wie</hi> Bridge, whose march was secured by a rising bank under the walls. These were ordered to make shew of an assault, and if need were to fall back unto the water side, where seconds were placed for their reliefe. The enemies horse sallied out upon them, whom that party having gallantly kept off, and forced back into the City, with-drew thence and gained a Church within Pistoll shot of St <hi>Owens</hi> gate, whence our Musketiers plaied on the walls, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly terrified those within. But the main rest of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was the name of a conquering army, which Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> improved to the best advantage by all expedition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry: And to help forward, <hi>Massie</hi> drew up two Sakers in a strait line against <hi>Wigmarsh</hi> gate, not without extream hazard by shot from the walls; himselfe gave fire, and the first Canon shot entred the gate, took an Officers head from his shoulders, and slew some few besides, More shots were made, each of which scoured the streets, and so daunted the enemy, that they presently sounded a parley, which was entertained by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and hostages given on both sides; the Parley lasted almost the whole day, whilst
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56747:22"/>
most of the common souldiers ranne over <hi>Wie</hi> bridge into <hi>Wales,</hi> only the Commanders and Gentlemen remained and were repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be held in by the Townsmen, to sweeten the surrender, and obtaine better quarter. Next morning they rendred: the chiefe prisoners here taken were the Lord <hi>Scudamore,</hi> Colonell <hi>Coningsby</hi> Sir <hi>William Crofts,</hi> &amp;c. few horse and private souldiers, but store of Armes and Ammunition. The Town compounded, was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from plunder, and after fourteen dayes deserted. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> obtained many faire victories, but had no power to make them good because his field was too large for that strength; and the State made an inconsiderable number of men the only stay of the remote parts. These could over-run the enemies Countrey, but get no ground, master no strong hold, nor reduce a people na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally malignant, that were dashed at present, but did flourish again in the reverse of the Kings Army. The next attempt was made upon <hi>Worcester,</hi> whither all the horse and the greatest part of the blue Regiment were drawn. They at <hi>Oxford</hi> were said to have yeelded that Town for lost, and to give out that Sir <hi>William</hi> was gone to take possession of his purchase. For at that time Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was the pretended cause of every losse on both sides, especially if weak and unworthy. Both horse and foot came up before the City, where they lay a day and a night, effected nothing, and were drawn off at the noise of the Lord <hi>Capels</hi> advance; at which instant Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was taken off these parts, and ordered to march into the West, with all speed to prevent the joyning of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> forces with the rest of the Kings Army. Sir <hi>Robert Cooks</hi> Regiment was called off from <hi>Tewksbury</hi> for the Western expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that Town once more slighted.</p>
            <p>Hitherto Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> governed the City of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> by deputation from the Earle of <hi>Stanford,</hi> whose returne was not expected; wherefore the thoughts of the Citizens began to enquire after a Governour. They thought well of a man neare home, and cast their eye upon a knowne Patriot. Neverthelesse more intelligent men upon the serious review of the Cities conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall hazard, found that the necessity of this place did require a tried Souldier, and that such a one might possibly be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but a timorous or unskilfull man must needs ruine all. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reflected on <hi>Massie,</hi> whose good services gave them also
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56747:22"/>
a competent assurance of his fidelity; that by the happy choice of the Citizens and the Lord Generals Commission, he was appointed Governour. To enable the City to defend it selfe, a foot Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was raised by Commission from Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> out of the Townsmen, for the major part both Officers and Souldiers, under the Command of Colonell <hi>Henry Stephens.</hi> The first intention of this Regiment was to defend the City only within the walls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the infancy of warre; but the hard service of this place did suddenly require and exact the full duty of Souldiers. At this instant the City was well becalmed, only there hapned one passage of inferiour nature, but full of the fortune of warre. The Governour with a party of an hundred and twenty Horse and Dragoons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards <hi>Stow</hi> in the wold, to beat up the enemies quarters; By break of day he fell into <hi>Slaughter,</hi> took a Lievtenant, twelve Troopers, horse and armes, and thence marched to <hi>Odington</hi> a mile beyond <hi>Stow,</hi> where he surprised a Captaine of a Troop with forty men and horse, and so made homewards, neglecting the residue of the enemy, who drew out of their quarters with all speed. The remainder of their Regiment fell upon the reere of our men, neare unto <hi>Slaughter</hi> with some slight execution, but were beaten back. The Governour being confident he was able to fight with them upon any ground, made no haste to march off, till the enemy had received a supply of Horse from <hi>Sudely</hi> Castle, and again charged him at <hi>Andovers</hi> foord, whom our men received gallantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed without any losse. The Captaine that led the Van was slain by the Governours hand, and the rest wheeled about; whereupon the Governour dismounted the Dragoons, and divided his men into three bodies, the horse to the right and left wing, in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture resolving to march up to the enemy (who would gladly rid their hands of the businesse) but having advanced a little distance, and looking back to bring on his men, saw the greater part in a strange hurry, occasioned by the faceing about of some cowardly spirits, and himselfe with those dismounted men desperately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; for a while he shuffled amongst the enemies Troopes, till observing himself eyed by some, he sprang forth, fired in their faces, and came last off the field upon the maine roade. He offended here, by affecting too much gallantry, and was deceived in his new raised men, who were not hardned by the sight of an enemy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56747:23"/>
no ordinary care was had of securing the prisoners, who were all recovered back. Four of ours were slaine, many wounded; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Stephens,</hi> a Lievtenant, with five and twenty private soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taken prisoners. The springing hopes of Colonell <hi>Stephens</hi> failed unfortunately, when his eager minde, engaged him in the action without order, and against the will of the Commander in chiefe; he had no command in the action, but hasted after as greedy of the service; he was led captive to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a while after breathed his last in that poysonous ayre, where many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were observed in those dayes to expire.</p>
            <p>Amidst these things Sir <hi>Iohn Winter,</hi> a zealous Papist, began to declare himselfe. A subtile wit, that pretended innocency till his houre was come, and had almost perswaded the world that he durst deny himselfe, and commit an unpardonable sinne against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Cause. His house in the Forrest of Deane was at first neglected, when it was in the power of this Garrison to ruine his designe. But under hand he prepared for defence, suddenly clapt in his owne Confidents, and with a little labour made it inaccessible, but with apparent great losse, and maintained his den as the plague of the Forrest, and a goad in the sides of this Garrison. These things were acted about the time of that blow almost fatall to the Parliaments cause, in the vanquishing of Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Army at the <hi>Devices;</hi> which defeat cast these parts of the Kingdome into a miserable plight, when the State had placed the whole game in the successe of this Army, never providing a reserve. The King became master of the field, the Parliament left without an Army that could check the enemy, who came up to our gates, and by threats would seeme to shake the walls of the City. Many began to prepare for flight, whose presence no reall necessity, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples opinion did require. They at <hi>Bristoll</hi> disclosed their feares, and gave no good presages. And when that City was yeelded, <hi>Gloucester</hi> did stand alone without help and hope. The Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Army pined away: Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> at <hi>London</hi> for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit: The Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> shut up within the walls of <hi>Exeter:</hi> The Kings Countrey reached from the utmost <hi>Cornwall</hi> to the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and he was able to divide his Army, one part for <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the other for <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That sudden surrender of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> which was almost beyond our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56747:23"/>
feares, brought forth a dark gloomy day to the City of <hi>Gloucester.</hi> The mindes of people were filled with amazement, and the failing of such a promising Government made most men infidels, or at least to question all things. But here was the greatest mischiefe of all: Many were not wanting to debate upon the maine cause of the Kingdom; malignant spirits took the advantage of our misery, and unstable mindes, who beholding only the surface of things, and led by the common voice of their equals, were flushed in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, now became crest-fallen, and questioned the passages of State, conceiving each miscarriage a fundamentall errour, and accounting their present sufferings not for Religion and Liberty, but some scruples of State policy. The state of things required strong resolution; the usuall posture could not pretend to the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the place. The souldiers therefore acted with mindes more sturdy and vigorous as desperate concerning the enemy, but not in despaire of their owne party. The Commanders reserved no place of retreat, and if causlesse jealousies over-clouded any, they put themselves upon a free Declaration. The old and carefull souldiers who were unlucky in the censures of the people, upon the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall of the sad newes from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> vented themselves in sharp and cutted speeches, which bursting from the fulnesse of the thoughts, did imprint and pierce, were received for good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticks, and repaired likewise that credit, which the presumption of a conceived opinion bore down, and an ordinary good behaviour could hardly raise up, but happily regained by one violent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer passage. The Officers were to give in a full resolve, that no place be left for an after dispute; wherefore they vowed never to see within the gates the face of a conquering enemy. But chiefly the hearts of the people were to be held up, wherefore the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour appeared in publike, rode from place to place with a cheerfull aspect, and bearing before him no change in the sudden alteration of fortune. To them that enquired into his very thoughts, hee gave assurance of safety, concealing the danger, or lessening its esteem. Fear did not beget confusion, but things were transacted in a calm and constant order. The presages of misery were exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely shunned, and the least shew of distraction and weaknesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Money, Plate, valuable goods, or any kinde of riches were not suffered to passe the Gates, but here to rest as in a safe Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56747:24"/>
that the people might resolve upon a happy Deliverance or an utter Destruction. Neverthelesse, whosoever was weak and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, had leave to depart the City. Meane while the enemy dealt underhand, and by the mediation of seeming friends affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately sollicited a Surrender, with terrible information of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold losses abroad, of the rage of the Kings Army, and inevirable desolation; and withall tendred the opportunity of an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation between his Majesty and the Citizens. The mouthes of the viler people were filled with curses against the authours of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. We received strange intimations of dreadfull things concerning the State. The whole Countrey forsook us, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed some to represent their desires and thoughts of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who in the generall had so farre revolted from themselves, as to perswade us to make our peace with the enemy, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool and execrate our perseverance; for they conceived the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> however advantagious to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet miserable for them; because by the falling down of a great Army, they expected a destruction of corn and cattle, and if at last the King should not take in this place, to stoop perpetually under two burthens, and be cast into a remedilesse condition of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and poverty. Whereas if the enemy should prevaile, they were sure to rest in the heart of the Kings Countrey, farre from spoile and plunder, and have as free and ample trade as in times of peace. The Citizens examined their own strength and grounds of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; a Common Councell was held, the Officers being present, their late protestation brought to remembrance, by which they were all obliged never to act or comply with the adverse faction, and upon that pretext joyntly refused the tender of peace. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse a great number of the Inhabitants were only not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, but born up by the zeale of the rest, and the souldiers power; and those stuck most to the businesse, who were held up by the deep sense of Religion or acknowledged a necessity to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a malicious and enraged enemy, whose implacable hatred ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to offend against their own designs, and by horrid threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to make the attempt more desperate. A den of Rebels was the common language: A few dayes respit recovered the City, and reports of a sudden reliefe did reare up the spirits of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. No crosse, show, or doubtfull resolutions did hinder
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56747:24"/>
the businesse; all suspended their private cares, and the women and children acted their parts in making up the defects of the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The strength of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was no more then two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of foot, an hundred horse with the Trained Bands, and a few reformadoes; there were besides about an hundred horse and dragoons from <hi>Berkley</hi> Castle, in the whole about fifteen hundred men: forty single barrels of gunpowder, with a slender artillery. The works of a large compasse, not halfe perfect; From the South-gate eastward almost to the North Port, the City was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with an ancient Wall lined with earth to a reasonable heigth; thence to the North-gate, with a slender work upon a low ground, having the advantage of a stone Barn that commanded severall wayes: Vpon the lower part of the City, from the North to the West-gate, (being a large tract of ground) there was no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient defence, but a small work newly raysed, with the advantage of marish grounds without, and a line drawn within from the inner North gate under the Colledge wall to the Priory of St <hi>Oswálds.</hi> From the West towards the South gate along the River side, no more defence then the River it selfe, and the meadowes beyond le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell with the Town: from the Castle to the Southport, a firme and lofty work to command the high ground in the Suburbs. The ditches narrow, but watered round. In this posture did the City stand when the Kings forces hovoured over the hills, and now and then skirted upon the Town, before a close siege was laid: upon the tenth of <hi>August,</hi> they came down like a torrent full of victory and revenge, with indignation that a forlorne City should stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Neverthelesse they would faine overcome without bloud, and the losse of time, then pretious in their full career of victory. For which end His Majesty came in person before it, that the terror of his presence might prevaile with some, and the person of the King amaze the simple, and seem to alter the case. Thus they began to work, because the Mayor had answered a former summons from Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> that according to his Oath he kept the Town in His Majesties behoof, and some whisperers gave a malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that the Kings presence would sway the people. And it was so, that the Town was held for the use of His Majesty, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense of the houses of Parliament, and the Citizens put no difference between a command in person or deputation.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56747:25"/>
whereupon His Majesty gave this honorable summons by two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds at Armes.</p>

                     <hi>OVt of our tender compassion to our City of Gloucester, and that it may not receive prejudice by our Army, which we cannot prevent if we be compelled to assault it: VVe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally come before it, to require the same, and are gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased to let all the inhabitants of, and all other persons within that City, as well Souldiers as others know, that if they shall immediately submit themselves, and deliver this City to Vs, VVe are contented freely and absolutely to pardon every one of them without exception, and doe assure them in the word of a King, that they nor any of them shall receive the least dammage or prejudice by Our Army in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or estates. But that VVe will appoint such a Governor, and a moderate garrison to reside there as shall be both for the ease and security of that City, and the whole County. But if they shall neglect this offer of grace, and favour, and compell Vs by the power of Our Army to reduce that place (which by the helpe of God We shall easily and shortly be able to doe) they must thanke themselves for all the calamities, and miseries that shall befall them. To this Message We expect a cleare and positive answer, within two houres after the publishing hereof? And by these presents doe give leave to any persons safely to repaire to, and returne from Vs, whom that City shall desire to imploy unto Vs in that businesse, And We do require all the Officers and Souldiers of Our Army, quietly to suffer them to passe accordingly.</hi>

            <p>His Majesty with all mildnesse seemed to receive this answer, onely to wonder at our confidence, and whence wee expected succour, adding these words, <hi>Waller</hi> is extinct, and <hi>Essex</hi> cannot come. The enemy advanced forwards into the Suburbs on the East side, where they lost a Commander in the first skirmish, and the rest were fired out; for upon the returne of the messengers the Suburbs on each part of the City were all in a flame, which did secure and more strongly engage us, and which the enemy beheld as the act of desperate Rebells; for those dreadfull sights doe seeme to higthen and bloud the minds of men. The next day we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that they had begun their entrenchments on the South and East parts, the night before in the shadow and shelter of the houses which the flames had not catched, within Musket-shot of the walls. They in the trenches plyed their worke whilest the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteers played hard on both sides. Yet our men from the walls could doe little to retard their pioners, but by severall sallies with small parties fell into their trenches, beate them out, gained some working-tooles, armes and prisoners, and retreated without losse. Our ordnance likewise from the East gate killed some sew, and among the rest a Lieutenant Colonell, and Captaine of the Queens black Regiment, Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> was then shot in the arme, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56747:26"/>
upon severall approaches we beat of the enemy, killed and wounded many.</p>
            <p>By that time the Welch forces under the command of Sir <hi>Wil. Vavasour,</hi> were advanced to the Bishops house, halfe a mile from the West-gate, one of our outguards by us intended to keep off the approach of the Welch, but now deserted for want of men and that nothing might be lost which we purposed to defend. Here they left a sufficient guard and passed over the River to joyne with the forces that newly arrived from Worcester: who made their leager on the North-west side of the City. Generall <hi>Ruthen</hi> placed his leager behind the Priory of Lanthony on the South-side very neere, but sheltred from our shot by a rising ground. Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> with a strong party quartered in some part of the Suburbs on the East-side. The East and South ports were dammed up, and rammed with a thicknesse of Earth Cannon proofe, and the Walls on that side from port to port were lined to the Battlements, since there wee thought to receive the maine shock.</p>
            <p>Three dayes after the siege laid, an hundred and fifty Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers commanded by Captaine <hi>Gray,</hi> sallied over the workes upon the Worcester forces, with whom the Welch had not yet joyned, fell into their quarters, marched up to their maine guard, killed a Captaine with eight or nine common Souldiers, tooke five pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, divers armes, burnt their guard, and retreated without the losse of any; within a day after upon some suspition and kinde of intelligence that the enemies Ordnance lay undiscovered in some grounds neere the Northgate; Captaine <hi>Mallery</hi> was commanded forth with a hundred and fifty Musketiers to surprise it, but finding none, retreated without losse, having killed some, taken a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners and fired some of their quarters. Vpon the sixteenth of <hi>August</hi> an other party of an hundred and fifty Musketiers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captaine <hi>Crispe</hi> sallied forth at the North-port, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their trenches under the Town wall on the East-side, marched above halfe way through them, performed gallantly, killed above an hundred men as was confessed by some of the enemy, wounded many, beat them out of their workes, and by the helpe of out Musketiers from the wall, retreated without the losse of any, only two wounded after a very hot skirmish, for the space of halfe an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56747:26"/>
houre, the Cannon and Musquets on both sides playing most furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. These executions put those within on a desperate straine, and heated their minds with bloud.</p>
            <p>The Enemy was indefatigable and swift in the entrenchments. The workes from the South and East gates, hasted to meete each other; their preparations seemed more tedious, yet effectuall and certaine and tended withall to save the lives of their men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chused not a sudden storme on the lower and weaker parts of the City, but rather to prepare the assault on the strongest side, yet most easy to their intention. For there only could they rayse the workes without the annoyance of the water-springs, that issued in the lower grounds; there only could they make bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery within Pistoll shot of the walls, that wanted flankers; and when they had once entred a breach there, they were instantly possest of the highest part of the Town. On this side therefore were their Ordnance brought up, and first two Culverin of sixteen pound bullet were planted on the East side, a little out of musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, where they made some store of shot, but did no execution. Next they planted three pieces of Ordnance of foureteene and five and twenty pound bullet upon their battery in a square redoubt, on the South-side, and began to batter the corner point of the wall, and a brick house adjoyning, where one of our men was killed, without more harme. Then they played upon our Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance mounted against their battery point blanck, and made some slight breach, which was quickly stopped up with wooll-packs, and Cannon baskets. By this time they had drawne the trench neer the moate, where they made a kind of mine to drain it, and sunk much of the water: and attempted to cast faggots into the moate, but were beaten off by our musketiers. At severall times they shot large Granadoes out of their Morter-pieces many fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houses and brake, but did no harme, and one that fell in the street had the fuz quenched before it came to ground, was takenup whole and found to weigh three score pound.</p>
            <p>After the Welch and Worcester forces came up, foure peece of Ordnance were drawn a good distance before the place of their leager, and one planted against the Awnegate, and the Sconces thereunto adjoyning. Wherefore a party of about foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Musketiers commanded by Major <hi>Pudsey</hi> and Captaine <hi>Gray</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56747:27"/>
assisted by Captaine <hi>Faulkner,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Massey</hi> sallied forth of the Norrhgate. Meane while a Lieutenant with fifty Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers was sent over the works to give them an Alarm, whilst the greater party got behinde their Cannon and breastworkes, fell upon their maine guard, slew many Officers, two Canoneers with about a hundred common Souldiers mortally wounded, took a Lieutenant with foure more prisoners, nayled their Cannon, and retreated with the losse only of two slaine, and about foure taken prisoners.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having planted three pieces of Ordnance against the Southside, and now three more on the Eastside, and two more neer the Eastgate within Pistoll shot of the Town wall, began a most furious battery upon the corner point, and made above an hundred and fifty great shot against it, whereby the stones were sorely battered, but the Earth workes stood firme. By all this shot only two persons were hurt, for the Battery was so neare, that if the Bullet missed the wall, it flew quite over the Town, or lighted at randome, yet in the intervalls of the great shot after each discharge our musketiers playd hard, and killed foure principall Cannoneers, neither were the people daunted at the noyse of Cannon, which by the slender execution, became so contemptible, that at that very time women and children wrought hard in lining the walls and repairing the breaches. The enemy continued the storme by sending Granadoes which were guided by the hand of providence into by-places, and sometimes falling upon the houses did rend and teare the buildings, when the people within were preserved.</p>
            <p>After ten dayes siege two severall parties were designed for the nayling of the enemes cannon. These were commanded to fall into the trenches and march on till they met each other. The one party of about two hundred Musketiers of the Town Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commanded by Captaine <hi>Stevenson</hi> and Captaine <hi>Moore,</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth at the Northgate, to have fallen into their Trenches at the East Port, but by the mistake of their guide, over a marish ground and full of ditches, were brought round about to Sir <hi>Iacob Ashleys</hi> quarter, where most of them came not up; only fourty Musketiers, encountred with five Colours of the Enemy, slew divers of them, took two Lievtenants prisoners, forced back the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56747:27"/>
rest, and marching a little farther, faced and fired at eight Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours more, and so retreated: In the retreat two Troopes of the Enemies horse came on the Reare, whom our men facing about and charging forced to fall back and made good their own retreat; in this distracted skirmish two of ours were killed, three hurt, and a Sarjeant taken prisoner. The other party of the Lord <hi>Stanfords</hi> Regiment commanded by Captaine <hi>Blunt</hi> and Captaine <hi>White,</hi> sallied by boat down the River on the Southpart of the Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maine Leagre, marched up to a Square redoubt (our Cannon in the mean while playing upon the houses in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs) beat them thence, killed a Major with some common Souldiers, and advanced to meet the other party. But the design failing through the misguidance of the other party, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off, and by the help of our Ordnance made a faire retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losse of any, onely two wounded. The failing of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize crossed a brave exploit and seasible, they might have scoured the Trenches under the shelter of our Walls: Neither did the Enemy take care to prevent them by turning the mouthes of any one piece of Ordnance upon the entry of the entrenchment. Neverthelesse the crosse event did much amaze them, that a small party should runne up to their Head-quarters, force their men, and recover back without a sensible losse. Certainely the care of a higher providence preserved and brought off those many severall parties, when the vanquishing of any one of them must needs run the City upon extream hazard; for our whole strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon the works day and night, except the reserve of a hundred and twenty men at the maine Guard. One rare and slender Rank were to receive the storme without seconds, yet the safety of the whole did require those frequent sallies, a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate remedy to a despairing City: not only to cast back the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies preparations, but to amaze them, that the Souldiers should be held up in such heigth of resolution, and cause them to expect more hot service from within the works: Our men likewise were to be kept in the heat of action to prevent the fainting of the spirits: Their hands also imbrued in bloud did the more enrage them. Nor by safer meanes could they overcome the terrour, which by the reputation of the Kings Army might possesse their minds: The Enemy were kept waking by continuall Alarums to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56747:28"/>
waste and weary them: And twas the care of the Governour to cause a perpetuall noise; that whensoever their Cannon had been silent for a while, one or two of our Guns gave fire to disturbe the calm, and signifie to the Country that we were yet alive; for the besiegers ever and anon scattered reports of the taking of the Town, with a purpose to prevent our reliefe. All things within did presage a deliverance. The sadnesse of the times did not cloud the countenance of the people, they beheld their fortunes with a clear brow, and were deliberate and chearfull in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of safety. No great complainings were heard in our Streets, no discontent seized on the Souldiers, at other times prone to mutiny; men of suspected fidelity did not faile in action; Every valuable person was active in his own place: The usuall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes of women were not then heard, the weakenesse of whose sexe was not overcome by the terrible Engines of warre. And our becalmed spirits did implore divine assistance without consusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Governour personally performed, ready at every turning of affaires, and gracing the businesse with speech and gesture; upon the least intimation of diffidence he pretended rationall hopes of successe, adding withall that our late yeelding could not mollifie the Kings Army, and if in the close we must needs be lost, no suter meanes of safety then by the utmost gallantry to constraine honourable conditions.</p>
            <p>The Enemy still prepared for a generall storm, mean while seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to waste our Magazine, which they knew must needs suddenly fayl, expended their own store, and dayly acted to the terrour of the inhabitants; shooting Granadoes, Fire-bals, and great stones out of their Morter-peeces, and had now planted a Battery on the Southside westward, unto which the lower part of the Town was open. Thence in one night they shot above twenty fiery melting hot iron Bullets, some eighteen pound weight, others two and twenty pound weight, which were seen to fly through the ayre like the shooting of a starre. They passed through stables, and ricks of hay, where the fire by the swiftnesse of the motion did not catch, and falling on the tops of houses, presently melted the leads, and sunk through; but all the skill and industry of the enemy could not set one house on fire.</p>
            <p>They still playd their great shot against the wals, and wrought
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56747:28"/>
hard in filling up the Moat with faggots and earth at the place where they battered, where also they built a Gallery over the head of the Trench, the breadth of foure abreast; in the shelter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had almost workt themselves over the Moat. Then we found that they had sunk a Mine under the East Gate; whereupon the Governour commanded a Counter-mine in two places, but finding the Springs, left off, conceiving for the same reason the endeavour of the enemy to no purpose. To discover or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt this work, a Serjeant with five daring men were put forth at a port hole in the dungeon at the East gate, came close to the mouth of their mine, took off the board that covered it, and for a while viewed the miners. One of these cast in a hand-Granado amongst them, whilst the foure musketiers played upon them as they ran forth, and with the noise of our men from the walls gave the whole leager a strong alarm, and crept in at the port-hole with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out harm. Wherefore discovering that the enemy notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the springs, went on with their mine, we renewed our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; for they had sunk a great depth under the moat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly toyled in drawing up the spring water, till at length they had gotten under the gate that our miners could heare them work under them, and did expect to spoyle them by pouring in water, or stealing out their powder.</p>
            <p>For a remedy to this mischiefe, and withall the enemy having planted store of Canon baskets within half musketshot of the East gate point blank, intending a battery there, upon the springing of their mine; We made a very strong work crosse the street with a large trench before it, and filled it with water, intending to raise it up to the Eaves of the houses, and to plant some Cannon there: we answered their severall approaches by so many counter works. A sconce was built upon a rising ground that looked into their trenches, where we could plant foure piece of Ordnance to cleare within the wals a ground called <hi>the Friars Orchard</hi> southward, and scoure their flank upon their entrance at the East gate, and so northward. Also an inner work was drawn from the south side along the middle of the Orchard, and all passages stopt between that and the East port. And to hinder their gallery we began to undermine for a place to put forth a peece of Ordnance at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the wall, to batter the flank thereof; which was perfected
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56747:29"/>
and a saker there placed. Commanded men were drawn out upon the walls, Granadoes provided, and when the great Gun played upon the gallery, the musketiers sent plenty of shot, and cast divers Granadoes into their trenches; in the mean while (they firing their Ordnance against the top of the wall) we cut off a maine beame of the gallery with our bolt shot. But the same day the enemy had sunk a piece against the port-hole of out mine, and forced us to withdraw the sakre, yet we cast them back three dayes work.</p>
            <p>And because all this side of the Town had no flankers, nothing did more offend the enemy in their entrenchments then an old Barne at a corner point, near the North Port, in which was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Peece that commanded three severall wayes, and obliquely looked into their Trenches, and oft times did good execution upon the pioners. This was the chiefe strength of that side, conceived the weakest part of the Town. Vpon the Key head an halfe moon was raysed, with a breast-work upon <hi>Seavern</hi> side under the Castle, and the river chained, to defend an assault from those high grounds beyond the river, which was ever feared by those within.</p>
            <p>His Majesty constantly residing at a miles distance, would not solemnly invite by publique Summons, lest hee should detract from the honour of his enterprize: Neverthelesse, those about him dealt underhand by sundry advertizements of the Kings displeasure, threatnings, perswasions, and many intimations of possible grace and favour. Some of our neighbours in their own names desired admission to a conference, and perswaded the Surrender of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in regard of the great power and terrible menacings of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with the small hopes and in a manner impossibility of reliefe; adding withall the heavy burthens under which the Countrey groaned. The Governour made answer, that we were sufficiently conscious of our own strength, and the ground of our resolution, and that we did not think our selves obliged to the enemy for the hopes and offers of favour. These manifold perswasions made the besieged more obstinate, and enabled them to understand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as a people worthy of entreaty, a prize worth the purchase, and in no wise lost or desperate, the enemies themselves being Iudges.</p>
            <p>As the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouldiers within were heated with their own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, so the enemy without being wasted in a lingering design
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56747:29"/>
before the houre of service came grew feeble in their own thoughts and to us contemptible. Our common souldiers took to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a liberty to revile, prevented and confounded the enemy with the self-same language in which they were wont to abuse and scorne our party; which contumely, though it begets a more deadly hatred and desire of revenge in generous mindes, at that time did deject exceedingly and debase the spirits of their private souldiers, who had never performed one gallant atchievement, and to whom the sturdinesse of our men was well known. The slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their design in that form of a leaguer, proceeded from the desire of saving their foot, with this presumption, that there was no power to raise the siege; which confidence deceived them, till too late; for their foot, after those many knocks, and the first fury spent, were not so capable of the service, without the help of many tedious preparations. Wherefore besides their mine and battery, they framed great store of those unperfect and troublesome engines to assault the lower parts of the City. Those engines ran upon wheels, with planks musket proof, placed on the Axel-tree, with holes for musketshot, and a bridge before it, the end whereof (the wheels falling into the ditch) was to rest upon our breast works.</p>
            <p>Our reliefe seemed slow, and the straitnesse of the siege debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all intelligence. Only two Spies which we sent out, returned from <hi>Warwick,</hi> and brought newes of the advance of the Lord Generall. The report of his Excellency, who then lay under a cloud, did give no great assurance. The truth is, the sense of the depth of our distresse did not reach us: Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> upon whom the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> cast their favour, had not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of an Army. The Generals Army crumbled away: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants of <hi>London</hi> fomented tumults in the City, and insurrections in <hi>Kent</hi> distracted the businesse. The house of Lords voted a treaty with the King, the house of Commons debated the matter. The resolution of <hi>Gloucester</hi> turned the stream, whose succour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon as the Kingdoms safety. The recruit of the Army was too slow for the service. The London trained Bands or none, must relieve us; but could not agree who should undertake the businesse. <hi>Essex</hi> was not favoured but the more prudent saw that he must be the man. That none might decline the service upon whom the lot fell, the shop windows were commanded to be shut up and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56747:30"/>
trading for a time suspended. The expedition was hasted in every pulpit carried on with continuall fasting and prayer: an Army was framed in an instant, and marched with incredible swiftnesse. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with the greatest part of the Kings horse drew from <hi>Gloucester</hi> to retard their march, but still appearing in the Van did no more then drill them along. The enemy stayed before us till the last houre, judging every particle of time a great advantage not knowing what a moment might bring forth. They within not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the former intelligence, sent out two other Spies with a double signall, first one fire on the side of a hill to signifie their escapes, and two fires on the same place if they heard good newes; which latter was accordingly performed and beheld by us.</p>
            <p>The fifth of <hi>September</hi> was appointed for a publike Fast, to be kept by such as might be spared from labour. This day we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their carriages marching from the leaguer, and their horse and foot marching after; yet we were not confident of the raising of the siege till the men were drawn out of the trenches, and the reer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard fired their huts. We then perceived that God had sent a deliverance, and that in the close of a solemn Fast, as a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of prayer.</p>
            <p>This evening the Lord Generall came to the brow of the hills seven miles from the Town, and fired a warning piece, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the contrary winds the report was not heard, neither did the newes reach us that night. Wherefore we did not venture upon the Reere of the enemy with our slender and wearied forces, but kept as strong and watchfull guards as any time before; presuming that reliefe at hand had raised the enemy, yet suspecting that in point of honour they would attempt something worthy of a Royall Army. But abiding before us to the last extremity, they were driven away with great confusion, after so many vowes of victory and revenge, when their mines, batteries, and engines were in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse. This hurry preserved the Countrey from injury, which by them was devoted to ruine. His Majesty was forced to leave the Town behinde him, and constrained to a tedious march in that tempestuous rainy night; their carriages were not got up the hills till the next morning, which distraction was not known to us: and the Generals Army was tired with long and continuall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The admirable care of providence was beheld in the season
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56747:30"/>
of our reliefe, when all things were prepared by the enemy for a generall storme; our ammunition consumed, but three single bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder left in our magazine, and not so much more else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: in the little harm done by their Cannon, and Morter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, that sent amongst us so many terrible messengers. Our lost men taken or slain, did not amount to the number of fifty, and of these but two Officers were slain. Captain <hi>Harcus</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Ensign; yet we killed of the Enemy (who never ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an assault) above a thousand men, by the lowest confession. The King expended much in Ammunition, Engines, and keeping together the discontented Souldiers, besides the losse of his pretious time in that full tyde of Victory. Here was a bound set to the swelling of those proud waves and the rock that split that Army; when the Queen was sayd to be transported with passion because her counsell was not followed, who advised the King to wave <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> and advance for <hi>London,</hi> whilst the Parliament had no Army in the field, the number of Malignants in the City did equall the rest, began to rayse tumults, and the actions of State were unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. This City diverted the enemies thoughts from that rare opportunity, which not so conscious of the Kingdoms weaknesse, held up beyond reason, and gave a breathing time to the State to effect its own reliefe. Great was the failing of the Kings hopes in this defeat, who by the gaining of this town, would have held an undivided uninterrupted command, and the granary of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the heart of his Country, on the West bounded with the Sea, cleare through the middle of the Land to the Northerne parts, where also the Earl of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Army prevailed, and in breadth reaching from the utmost <hi>Wales</hi> to the <hi>London</hi> Association, and backed with <hi>Ireland,</hi> with whom an Accommodation was then preparing.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse the raising of the siege was but an unperfect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. The successe of the Generals Army with the supply of our wants were to make it compleat. For the enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually lay at our doores, commerce was clean taken away, and we farre distant from the fountaine of future supplies; Wherefore during the stay of his Excellency, parties of horse were continually sent abroad to fetch in provisions out of the Enemies quarters, and Malignants estates. The Granary was quickly filled. The

Generall left three Culverins, forty single barrels of Gunpowder, and set the Garrison in order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>London</hi> Train-Bands and Auxiliaries supposing the work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, and the date of their Commission expired, earnestly contended homewards, yet must they break their way through the Kings Army, and give him some further blow to secure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the reliefe of this Garrison; for so confident were the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their own strength, that many thought his Majesty ill-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised in not fighting with the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> neare <hi>Gloucester:</hi> wherefore the Generall was to secure this retreat, to take heed lest he be penned up in these parts, and with that speed made after the Kings Army (which by this time had gotten some miles in the Van of our Army) that some horse and foot out of the remote quarters marched above thirty miles before they rested. They came up before <hi>Cirencester</hi> where the King had left a strong party. The forlorne hope entred the Town whilst the rest surrounded it, killed the Sentinell sleeping, marched up to the Market Place without opposition (the enemy supposing them Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Forces, that night expected) till they entred the houses and surprized them in bed, took foure hundred men, and thirty Cart-loades of bread, cheese, and other provisions, a great reliefe in a wasted Countrey, and the only support of the Souldiers against the Battle at <hi>Newbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The successe of which Battell did close up with honour, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and gallant undertaking of the Lord Generall, and the Citizens of <hi>London:</hi> As brave a service as these Warres can shew forth, enobled by its wonderfull rise, lively progresse, nimble expedition, admirable fortune and honourable conclusion. Notwithstanding his Excellency had hereby disabled and broken the Kings Army, and secured the Garrison of <hi>Gloucester</hi> from a sudden reverse; yet his own Army was sorely bruised, and retiring to <hi>London,</hi> left but a little burthen upon the Enemy on that side. By which meanes they were free to molest these parts, and this Garrison left to beat the brunt, provide for it selfe, and run the danger though not of an other siege, yet of blocking up and ruine by the spoyle of our Countrey, which that party decreed to destruction; and the Enemy at the doore and the distance of our friends did threaten no lesse. Not a man could be left by the Generall to encrease our strength,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56747:31"/>
nor money to content the Souldier; there was only an assurance of help from the Parliament, when the arreares of Officers and Souldiers were large; the Governour made certaine propositions to the Parliament concerning the support of this place; That since at such a distance he could not expect a constant supply, they would send down at once ten thousand pounds and a thousand men, farre below the places due; according to the termes of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers entertainment, might set things in a thriving way, and enable the Souldier to act of themselves without those continuall cravings and out-cryes against the State. Vpon which termes the active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this Government gave assurance of the framing of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to master the Countrey then enthralled to the enemy, yea, to lie upon the enemies quarters, consume their store, distresse their cheife Garrisons of <hi>Bristoll</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> and endanger the rest as <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> and stop their supply of men and money. Such a strong beginning had been more then halfe way to the end of the work.</p>
            <p>But the State seemed to walk in a frugall course and desire a daily dropping of reliefe, rather then to entrust much, which is not the way of great performance nor can bring to the end of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; when as this rationall adventure might give the encrease of an hundredfold: and upon the failing hereof the greatest mischiefe could bee no more then the losse of that expence. Wherefore they voted a supply and raised men and moneys in a languishing way, that those five hundred listed for <hi>Gloucester</hi> were reduced to a fifty, ere they could reach us, and the greatest part of the money squandred away without a sensible advantage to this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Newbery</hi> fight Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> was sent to <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> with a strong party to raise Forces in those parts with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to command in chiefe in the Countreys of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> and a command from his Majestie to distresse <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> on the Welch side, and to Garrison <hi>Tewkesbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> was not satisfied in keeping his own Garrison, but eager of continuall service, to destroy or disable the enemy, for which no other place in the Kingdome was conceived capable of the like advantage: Wherefore by himselfe urged, he set upon the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56747:32"/>
Parliament with importunate complaints that for lack of strength great opportunities of service to us and disservice to them were lost. And a greater mischiefe did exercise this government, the want of men and money, and ammunition to defend it selfe; upon which, extreme scarsity of provision was like to follow, and in these hopes did the enemy blesse themselves; so that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and honour of maintaining the City against the violence of an Army was like to vanish in the lingring death of the place. And the Governour was about to embrace an other command in the Generalls Army, yet reserving a submission to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleasure who required him to continue his service in this Government. This charge was surrounded with difficulties and each day brought forth some new birth. When the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt us in their Winter quarters, the hopes of our promised suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours were past without the Convoy of an Army. Not one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Countrey durst be seen to assist us, no Member of Parliament did reside here to encourage the businesse. All things rested upon the Governours sole care both to store the Garrison with provisions, and raise money out of that small pittance of the Countrey out of the enemies hands. The discontent of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was now heigthned and ready to cause a disbanding. To make good the place was the Parliaments command: and inevitable necessity was the cheifest law to support it. Wherefore apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more misery then in the late siege, the Governor was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lay some easie taxation on the Countrey to supply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent exigence, whilst the enemies power extended on all sides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the Gates of <hi>Gloucester.</hi> Hereupon daily complaints were brought before him, that the taxes were unequally rated by the Officers of the severall Parishes, that such as were broken by the enemy, were rated as high as if their Estates were entire. The Governour represented these things to the Parliament, earnestly begged their direction in his intended course, which by them was not in one syllable contradicted: Wherefore at a Councell of Warre the condition of the Countrey was debated upon, and an order made that some Officers &amp; Citizens should be intreated as a Committee to hear and rectifie the complaints concerning assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to use that moderation which reason did require. Not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56747:32"/>
long after a petition was presented to the Governour in the name of the Countrey, That one Monthly rate without other charge, might be imposed upon them, likewise that the rate might be made according to equity, and the poore spared; that the money might bee paid in to the common Treasurer, whence it should issue as necessity required, and that a choyce Committee might be appointed to over-see all the money rated, received and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed. The Governour to manifest his desire of the peoples sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and that things might bee carryed in a just and equall way, ordered by the consert of a Councell of Warre, that a Committee of Officers, Citizens, and Countrey Gentlemen, should regulate the assessements of the Countrey according to their desires. Some of which Gentlemen not long after were of the Committee for these Counties by Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this Committee moved at a Councell of Warre for a further power to heare and determine such businesses as by the Governours speciall order should be referred unto them, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon oath, and commit all such persons (Officers and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers only excepted) as should offer contempt; and this they enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with these reasons: 1. Because there was no Committee of Parliament then in being, nor would any adventure such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in an oppressed and distracted Countrey; and the necessities of the Garrison did admit of no delay. 2. That this Committee consisting of Souldiers, Citizens and Countrey Gentlemen, would give satisfaction both to the Countrey men, who payd their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when themselves were acquainted with its necessity and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall; and to the Souldiers, who being privy to the receit of the money and the Countreys indigence, might be contented with a slender entertainment: that at once it seemed to prevent discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Countrey, and mutiny in the Souldier. 3. That the Petitions of the Countrey pressed upon the Governour in such multitudes, that a great part of his time which might be spent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemy to better purpose, was taken up herewith, or many persons must needs be exposed to injury and oppression. 4. Because all course of Law from <hi>Westminster</hi> was then stopped,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56747:33"/>
not a Lawyer left in the Countrey, no Court of Equity to relieve the oppressed, or curb the extremity of the Law, whose present want was not so much in setling estates and determining right, as in providing for the support of the Garrison, then like to be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; of which the Kings partee had as great a confidence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Siege. No Landlord could receive his Rent, no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Trade between man and man, whereby to enable them to pay taxations. And for these reasons such an Order by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Warre was then assented unto.</p>
            <p>In this the people never groaned under the Governours power; their voluntary submission was a witnesse of his moderation. And this authority had more of entreaty then constraint, only the Sword had some influence of feare upon the injurious; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Town-Court not suspended, but sometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to forbeare upon equitable considerations. And when the Governour began to observe some derogation from his intentions, by this Committee, he instantly sent a Prohibition. Twas never his thought to rule by the Sword, but in a desperate case by the same to cut out a way wherein the rules of Law and Iustice might freely passe. He was ever unwilling to take the charge upon him, and by severall Letters requested the Parliament, that the burthen of Government might be layd upon some other; or if that charge must rest upon him, that they would send down a Committee, that might take off the former cares, and permit him to look to the well ordering of his Forces for the safety of this place, and to enlarge his quarters, that the service here might not bee only to keep <hi>Gloucester,</hi> but weaken the Enemy, and beget friends daily to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Such was the face of Government within the City, whilst the Enemy acted his part without, and bore down by force on all sides. From <hi>Hexeford</hi> Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> with about seven hundred horse and foot marched into <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> with a purpose to garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that Town. A wide and open place not easy to be held by us, who had neither competent strength nor time to fortify, the Kings forces continually lying upon us. Sir <hi>William</hi> made shew of setling the Garrison, styled himselfe Governour of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> invited the Countrey with promises of moderation and candor in all his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56747:33"/>
proceedings; yet these Welch Forces had scarce taken up their quarters, but received an Alarum from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> by a party that went up in a Friggot: And the common souldiers partly discontented with their Officers, who had often decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that innocent people, and betrayed them to the Sword; and partly repining for want of pay, fell into a desperate muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, forced their Commanders, chose rather to be kild then to fight, and constrained their flight out of the Town, hasted over <hi>Vpton</hi> Bridge, and did scarce look back, till safe in their own Countrey; and twas to be suspected that many late knocks had beaten out their spirits, but chiefly that they were afraid of this Countrey ayre, in which they could never thrive. By this meanes the excrescence of Sir <hi>William Uavousors</hi> government was pared off, and himself driven to retire into <hi>Hereford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neverthelesse we are cooped up with the enemies garrisons round about, and wholly divided from the rest of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Army. <hi>Sudely</hi> Castle was maintained by the Lord <hi>Chandos,</hi> a great stop to our entercourse with <hi>Warwick,</hi> which was the only way of commerce with <hi>London,</hi> that a Scout could not passe without extream hazard. <hi>Berkley</hi> Castle was held for the King by a Scottish Captain, and subdued the richest part of the County. In the heart of the Forrest Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> strongly fortified and defended his own House: And now the enemy had put a garrison into <hi>Beverstone</hi> Castle, resolving withall not to leave one strong house unguarded, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their own quarters, and to stop our markets and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. Our Governour began to look forth, and first for want of quarters was enforced to send abroad his own Company, which were placed in a defenceable house at <hi>Frampton</hi> upon Severn. These were a stop to the incursions from <hi>Berkley,</hi> and furthered the safety of that side of the Countrey. An hundred and fifty Foot of Colonell <hi>Devereux</hi> his Regiment garrisond a strong house at <hi>Presbury,</hi> within foure miles of <hi>Sudely</hi> Castle. These sorely vexed the enemy in those parts, did a little open the passage towards <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the house proved a good resting place in the repasse. Another guard was set at <hi>Westbury</hi> on the edge of the Forrest, to affront Sir
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56747:34"/>
               <hi>Iohn Winter,</hi> a most active enemy, and one chiefe Agent of the Popish Faction. Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> assisted with the Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> Horse, threatned us out of the Forrest, and had made a passage over <hi>Seavern</hi> at <hi>Newnham,</hi> to afflict those parts beyond the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Notwithstanding all this, our small party by continuall action upheld their repute. Some weeks after the raising of the siege, the Governour marched with his two Troops and two hundred musketiers before <hi>Berkley</hi> Castle. The muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers faced and kept in the enemy, whilst the Horse fell into the Countrey beyond to fetch in the persons of some principall malignants, but in stead of them met with the Lords <hi>Herberts</hi> Troops, and an hundred and fourty Horse besides, which came to relieve the Castle. Our Horse with some few musketiers fell upon them, put them to a retreat, and slew some few with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any losse to our party, who drew off expecting the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a greater strength.</p>
            <p>About this time Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> entred upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Newnham;</hi> whereupon he took the courage to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Villages neare <hi>Gloucester:</hi> his Horse came within three miles of the City, and drove away store of the Countrey cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The Governour receiving intelligence, drew forth his small number of Horse not exceeding seventy, made after and pursued them to the entrance of their new Garrison; where they had already secured their plunder: in the retreat five Troops of the Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> Regiment fell on the reare; our men drew up in a narrow lane ready to receive the charge, fired upon them, and put them to a running retreat. An Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer with twelve Troopers made the pursuit, took one horse colours, and some prisoners, and killed a Cornet, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, which event made Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> for present quit that government with much distraction.</p>
            <p>At that time there was no lofty stage of action, because the present enemy did yeeld no gallant opportunity. Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> was wise for himselfe, nimble in inferiour businesses, delighted rather in petty and cunning contrivance then open gallantry, referred all his industry to his own house, or the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Forrest, vexed his neighbours more then weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56747:34"/>
his enemy, and advanced the Catholike Cause no other way then by the plague and ruine of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the City the enemy was imboldned to erect new Governments at <hi>Tedbury</hi> and <hi>Wotton Underedge.</hi> These did invite the Governours march that way, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all had his eye upon <hi>Beversione</hi> Castle newly garrisond, and commanding the rich Clothiers of <hi>Stroodwater:</hi> hither he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with a party of three hundred foot and foure score horse. These horse sent before were so formidable to the enemy at <hi>Tedbury,</hi> that the Governour <hi>Horatio Cary</hi> with his whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment were put to flight, and dissipated with the losse of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of their men slaine and taken prisoners.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Massey</hi> brought up his men and two Sakers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Beverston</hi> Castle, where having surrounded it, hee planted his Guns within Pistoll shot of the Gate, and gave fire severall times. Fifty Musketiers ran up to the Gate at noone-day and fixed a Petarre, which neverthelesse failed in the execution. Those from within threw Granodoes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our men, but hurt none, who although thereby forced from the Gate, yet they ran up the second time, being open to the full shot of a secure enemy, and brought of the Petarre with much gallantry. The design was not feazible for a quick dispatch; for the Gate was barricado'd within, the night came on, and those remote parts did promise no security to so small a party; likewise the state of the City required them nearer home: wherefore after twelve houres the party was drawn off, and in the retreat advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wotton Underedge,</hi> where the enemy had placed a kind of temporary Garrison with a Regiment of horse; they prepared for the coming of our Forces, drew up on a Hill before the Town to face them, and at night retreated to their Garrison; Where our men arrived somewhat late, and found the enemy all mounted, sell upon them and put them to flight, of whom about six were slaine, and twelve taken prisoners, the rest escaping to <hi>Bristoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day by an over-ruling hand of providence, our party was led back to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> contrary to the hope of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56747:35"/>
Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> and his Complices. These having intelligence of the Governours absence with a <hi>stronge</hi> party, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Garrison thereby weakned, sent to all the quarters of the Forrest, <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> to draw together and advance for the surprisall of <hi>Gloucester.</hi> It was afterwards suspected a complotment, to be managed by the assistance of Malignants in the City. Late at night the Governour had notice of the enemy in the Forrest. Thereupon he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Captain <hi>Crispe</hi> to draw fifty Musketiers from the Guards and march three miles that way, making good a house that stood on the passage. As yet there was no suspition of a Plot, but before our party had passed a mile and halfe, they encountred the enemy who were drawn up Horse and Foot in a broad lane neare <hi>Highnam</hi> House, instantly fired upon them, slew a Captaine, and some foure common souldiers. The enemy were amazed at the sudden and unexpected encounter, forced back with feare, and retreated to <hi>Huntly,</hi> where Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> had secured his own person: But distracted by the strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, marched off in great confusion at the approach of fifteene horse that fell in amongst the whole Brigade, slew seven or eight, and took ten prisoners.</p>
            <p>This discomfited the enemy and dashed the designe; yet the <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Monmouthshiere</hi> Forces kept their randevouz at <hi>Coford</hi> in the Forrest, and still threatned the City. No meanes for the reducing of this place is left unattempted, and at this present treachery was the grand design and over-ruled all their proceedings, and prevented many mischievous acts of open hostility, which might easily have destroid us; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Malignant Gentlemen of this County went about to cast this City into extreme poverty and exigence by the Countreys ruine: Wherefore conceiving the present enemies not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruell, they importuned his Majesty that Colonell <hi>Charles Gerrard</hi> might quarter upon us with his Brigade, to devour, spoyle and burn, besides the expectation of all the mischiefe the Lord <hi>Herbort</hi> and <hi>Vavasour</hi> can doe. But this malitious councell and instigation though most opportune for the Kings
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56747:35"/>
purpose, was afterwards crossed by their own party, waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the successe of a close design.</p>
            <p>About this time was the act of Pacification made by the King with the Irish Rebels, which began to undeceive the world, and wipe of the Varnish of the former Oathes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations. The world could not believe that any command or power could so soone allay and quell those Irish stormes, but that word which raised them up: Then did the effect declare the cause of those rare and slow Proclamations against that bloudy Rebellion, and strange intercepting of reliefe sent from the State to the distressed Protestants. The greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the Kings Declarations could judge no lesse then that those Rebells did better comply with his intentions then the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> since his Majesty having two enemies, is resolved to make peace with one to crush the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he will fall in with that party that carries least contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his maine designe; and this was the Rebell of <hi>Ireland;</hi> whose chiefe aime likewise his Majesty must not abhorre: for there can bee no lasting compliance without a mutuall engagement. Besides, the heads of that Rebellion were brought over not as accessaries, but principals in the Kings warre, and admitted to the secret Councell. And to colour the Pacification, the losse of that Kingdome and all the sufferings of the English Protestants were charged upon the Parliament. The English Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> were possest with the opinion of neglect in the State, and were taken off the persuite of a just revenge upon those cursed Rebels to warre against their native Countrey, and teare the bowels, of the mother that bare them, and therein act a part, and cast in their lot with the Rebels themselves.</p>
            <p>Some of these Irish Forces landed at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and thence fell down upon <hi>Gloucestershire:</hi> Colonell <hi>Min,</hi> and Sir <hi>William St. Leger,</hi> with both their Regiments, making up eight hundred or a thousand Foot, and a hundred Horse, all resolved men, with eight Piece of Ordnance, advanced to <hi>Thornbury.</hi> Colonell <hi>Massey</hi> proclaimed entertainment to all such as would tender their service to the Parliament, and many private souldiers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56747:36"/>
resenting the difference of the cause came over daily. About the twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> a party of two hundred horse and Dragoones commanded by Captaine <hi>Backhouse,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to beat up their quarters at <hi>Wotton,</hi> where they were lately arrived from <hi>Thornbury:</hi> Wherefore the party advancing thither, suddenly fell in among them, and found eight hundred men, charged up to the maine Guard, and for a while were masters of foure Piece of Ordinance, but over-matched and borne down by their numbers, were forced to retreat, yet having first slaine, wounded, and taken many of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the losse of a man. At the same time some of Colonell <hi>Vavasours</hi> Forces undertook to settle at <hi>Upton</hi> upon <hi>Seaverne,</hi> but at the first shew of an approach from <hi>Gloucester</hi> quitted those quarters.</p>
            <p>Once more doe the clouds gather round about, the storm threatned by the enemies fury, and more violently driven by the malice of some Countrey Gentlemen begins to arise; The Malignant Gentlemen of <hi>Cotswold</hi> provide Armes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison strong Houses. Forces from <hi>Oxford</hi> were expected at <hi>Painsewick</hi> and <hi>Stroud;</hi> the Irish were to lie on this side <hi>Berkely,</hi> the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> in the Forrest, the Lord <hi>Chandos</hi> at <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Pie</hi> at <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> so that by them our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is decreed and seemes as a thing done.</p>
            <p>Every corner of the Country is pestered with the enemies Garrisons, as <hi>Newneham, Lidney, Monmouth, Hereford, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Dimmock, Newent, Highleaden, Tainton, Tewkesbury, Sudely, Saperton, Beverston</hi> and <hi>Berkely.</hi> Opposite to these was the Governour constrained to erect petty Garrisons, as many and as neare as possible; for the Kings Forces were againe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced out of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> with a greater strength and well prepared. Sir <hi>William Vavasour,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Pie,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Wroughton</hi> are arrived at <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> and began to fortifie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great power with them till the Town was setled, and made strong; yet still disturbed by continuall Alarums from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> though the Land-flouds hindred our design upon them. The Irish Regiments rose from <hi>Wotton,</hi> and thence made
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56747:36"/>
over the Hills for <hi>Tewkesbury.</hi> And because their march was interrupted by our parties, the Lord <hi>Chandos</hi> horse joyned with them to strengthen and secure their, advance to <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham;</hi> whether they came with foure small Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Our men still flirted upon them. And a Party of Horse and Dragoones commanded by Major <hi>Gray,</hi> fell that night into <hi>Charlton Kings,</hi> and had surprized the Lord <hi>Chandos</hi> in his quarters, had he not made a private escape, where the search after him caused the losse of seven or eight private souldiers; yet they slew some of the enemy, took ten prisoners and some few horse. The next day the Horse and Foot bended their course to <hi>Tewkesbury;</hi> our men waited upon the march, and kept them up close, that those parts of the Countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but little dammage; when these had joyned with the other Regiments, they were supposed to make neare upon two thousand six hundred Horse and Foot.</p>
            <p>After a little stay, a part of these forces were drawn off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> to joyne with the enemy that there waited the intercepting or surprizall of our supplies from <hi>London,</hi> then long and earnestly expected and noised abroad, our powder being welnigh spent, and necessity constrianing us to use a kind of match made of Bast. Sir <hi>Walter Pies</hi> Foot, and Col. <hi>Wroughtons</hi> Horse remained at <hi>Tewksbury</hi> to block up the City on that side, in and about which Town fifteen hundred Horse and Foot were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly quartered; Colonell <hi>Washingtons</hi> Regiment kept Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at <hi>Evesham,</hi> and a Regiment of Horse lay at <hi>Parshore,</hi> besides a considerable strength at <hi>Sudely.</hi> These thought to swallow up our approaching succours, or if they did not come, speedily to compell us to yeeld up the City; for it was reported with the enemy, and believed by many, that we suffered extream penury.</p>
            <p>And though provisions were not much wanting, being in a fat Countrey, yet the reall exigences of the Garrison were great; for lack of pay the discontents of the Souldiers were desperate and endlesse. In most of the Officers a generall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duty, who for the least check would throw up their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56747:37"/>
Commissions, to the Governours great discontent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Many inferiour Officers forsook us, and common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ranne to other places that yielded a large and constant entertainment, and required lesse service; whilst honest and gallant men that did not desert their Colours, were exposed to misery and want; yet could we not want men, who daily offered themselves to the service, had wee moneys to pay them. Neither had wee any power of men to raise moneys for the Garrisons maintenance. Our out-guards as <hi>Presbury, Wesbury, Essington, Frampton, Froster,</hi> set to preserve the Countrey, and keep the Markets open, did eat up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Contribution, and consume our men and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, besides the daily sending out of parties. Twas a kinde of shifting life and wonderfull, that the Officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand should finde the least measure of obedience. Some Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did expend their own meanes to keep their Companies entire; the Governour was necessitated at his own charge to billet above threescore Souldiers, besides the charge of a Troop. The Countrey was impoverished, the Commission of Excise was not setled, and brought in no considerable summe. The Citizens were restrained of Trade, and the wayes of Commerce stopped up; and therefore at present they were quite left to the Garrison. Besides the slownesse and low reports of our succours did exceedingly dis-hearten the people. Many Countrey Gentlemen that were not the Confidents of the contrary Faction, were about to comply with this Government, especially upon the Parliaments De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of pardon; but the notice of those slender supplies, and the thought of the States supposed neglect, turned them off, and made them more violent against us. For this lasting suspense and bondage under two parties did vex them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majesty was again importuned, to destroy and fire the Countrey, if he could not lodge his forces so neare as to block us up.</p>
            <p>The Garrison neverthelesse did not only defend its own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, but made sundry adventures and inrodes upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56747:37"/>
quarters, staved off, and kept them within their bounds. The Governour had built a Friggot for service upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to secure the Countrey near <hi>Gloucester,</hi> on that side <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> because the Enemy commanded greatest part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and landed at their pleasure upon our quarters, from <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> This Friggot was sent down <hi>Seavern</hi> manned with Sea-men and a party of Souldiers, for whatsoever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt sudden opportunity should offer; and arriving at <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,</hi> our musketteers hasted ashore, and entred the Town, where they surprized most of the Officers of Colonell <hi>Oneales</hi> Regiment, raysed under the command of the Lord <hi>Herbert.</hi> These never dreamed of an enemy from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> in that corner of the Land, at such a distance. And this was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the service, that by the surprizall of the Officers, it prevented the raysing of that Regiment of horse which shortly after would have plagued the Countrey. Our men having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their prisoners, and ready to made homewards, another prize fell into their hands, where they took a Vessell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from <hi>Bristoll</hi> with Oyle, Wine, Sugar, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. These little services were answerable to the times, and upheld the esteem of the Garrison in that low ebbe. This Expedition gave an Alarum to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and all <hi>Wales,</hi> who to prevent the like inrode, sent up divers Friggots to guard the River.</p>
            <p>At this time Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> began to appeare from <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and made an attempt upon <hi>Bodington House,</hi> a petty Garrison of ours, only to preserve the Countrey. Hither he came up with five hundred foot and two peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, fired his Gunnes against the House, and engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in an assault. The place was maintayned by them within till a small party drew from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> the report of which (at three miles distance) caused Colonell <hi>Vavasour</hi> to draw of and return back to <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> with the losse of eight or ten men before the House. Neither did <hi>Vavasour</hi> seem to act with that violence, which the out-side of the enemies design did look for: whether retarded by the dulnesse of nature, or the notice of some close contrivance. However, the slownesse
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56747:38"/>
and ill successe of his actions rendred him obnoxious to the jealousies of his own Party; which suspition was easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by the intercourse of civility between him and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Massie,</hi> when the known fidelity and constant indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the one could inable him without offence to his own side to disport with an enemy in such complements, as the other had not the liberty to use. Such neglected passages have a great weight in the ballance of reputation and honour: since the minde is not revealed by it selfe, and wise men as well as fooles oft-times have only the event to guide their judgements.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the Town, we had continuall skirmishes with Colonell <hi>Veale</hi> newly made Governour of <hi>Berkly</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and assisted with the Lord <hi>Inchequeens</hi> Regiment of Horse. This enemy was no way formidable nor mischievous in any thing save the plunder of the Countrey, by whom hee was oft-times beaten back and kept in awe by the assistance of <hi>Frampton</hi> garrison. The Church at <hi>Newnham</hi> was againe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and defended by Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> with a sufficient strength of men, and foure Pieces of Ordnance, whence hee might runne up to the Gates of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> rob the Countrey and take mens persons at pleasure, only we kept a guard at <hi>Arlingham</hi> to hinder his passage over <hi>Seavern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Man</hi> lay strong at <hi>Newent, Highleaden,</hi> and <hi>Tainton:</hi> The Governour could doe little on that side, only he placed a Garrison at <hi>Hartpury</hi> Court, both to preserve <hi>Cosselawne,</hi> and to endeavour the engagement of Colonell <hi>Min.</hi> Our Garrison at <hi>Frampton</hi> was removed to <hi>Slimbridge</hi> within foure miles of <hi>Berkley;</hi> we had other guards likewise at <hi>Essington</hi> and <hi>Froster,</hi> to preserve and enable the people to contribution. Thus was the City pestered on every hand, and fetched its livelihood out of the fire, with continuall hazard, forcing the enemies quarters, and defending its own; parties were daily drawn out by the Governour, who then could not aime at victory, nor expect any great performance, though the common people repined that he did not alwayes conquer, when it was conquest enough to keep the enemy in action, and prevent their extravagances,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56747:38"/>
to beare up the hearts of our friends, and signifie to the world that we were yet alive. Though the Governour was not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad, yet he strove to make opportunities according to the stock of Ammunition that was left him; that councells might spring out of the midst of action. He drew out upon <hi>Tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with two hundred Musketiers, and with a hundred horse faced the house only to keep in or amaze them, but when the horse marched off, some of their Troopes fell on the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and charged the Governour, who re-encountred and charged home some distance before the rest of the Troop, and by the breaking of the curb, his horse carryed him amongst the enemies Troopes, with whom for a while he grappled, and was rescued by the gallantry of a common Trooper, by which time our Musketiers were brought up, and beat them back without losse to us.</p>
            <p>The Governour choosed rather to make work for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to seek him in his own quarters, then lie at home to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the challenge; yet did he play a wary game and though zealous of honour, yet more true to the maine chance and tender of the lives of men: wherefore hee advanced againe with foure hundred Musketiers and fifty horse, came before <hi>Tainton,</hi> and with a small party faced the house, having laid some Ambuscado's with a purpose to allure them into the snare, and cut off their men, as well to encourage the Countrey as weaken the enemy, but they did not adventure out. When we drew thence, our men beheld a faire body of horse at <hi>Highleaden,</hi> whereupon a forlorn hope of our Musketiers with twenty horse advanced upon them, and found their Horse and Foot drawn out of <hi>Highleaden</hi> House: These were to joyn with Colonell <hi>Min,</hi> who at that instant was marched out of <hi>Newent,</hi> with a purpose to fall on <hi>Hartpury</hi> Garrison. Here at the first some few of our horse gave the charge, hurried the enemy and beat up their Ambuscadoes: then they drew out their whole Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison and sell on; Their horse did not stand to it, but with their foot there was an hot skirmish almost an houre: And though our seconds were slow in comming up yet did the forlorn hope drive them from hedge to hedge, and after a while our body
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56747:39"/>
comming on beat them in, and pursued them up to the very house, took some few prisoners, and came off with the losse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two men.</p>
            <p>Such multitudes of the Kings Forces lay upon us to oppresse the Countrey and intercept our reliefe, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely straimed of quarter, and enforced to look forth for live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood. Whereupon two thousand Horse and Foot marched from <hi>Tewkesbury</hi> to <hi>Painsewick</hi> to gather contribution, and rob the Countrey about <hi>Stroudwater:</hi> The Governour drew out two hundred Musketiers with an hundred horse, and marched to the top of <hi>Bruckthrop</hi> Hill expecting the enemy, whom he found divided into three bodies and himselfe born down by their multitude, for whilst two parties faced him the third stole down an hollow lane, and had almost surrounded him unawares by the negligence of the Scouts, so that our whole body was brought into great danger, driven to a sudden and confused retreat, and the Governour himselfe, left deeply enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; yet most of our men got off, being preserved only by the gallartry of a few resolved men that stood in the breach; and of them Captaine <hi>George Massie</hi> striving to retard the pursuit, grappled with three together hand to hand, received a sore wound in the head, and was happily rescued by a Serjeant of the company; of ours, two Lievtenants and sixteen private Souldiers were taken prisoners, the rest in disorder ran down the steep through a rough and narrow lane, and recovered an house at the foot of the Hill, where a party was left to make good the retreat, and the enemy durst not pursue, by which meanes all the bottome was preserved from spoyle; next day they retreated to <hi>Few esbury</hi> laden with plunder.</p>
            <p>Suddenly after this repulse, we lost two small Garrisons at <hi>Westbury</hi> and <hi>Huntly,</hi> by the treachery of Captaine <hi>Thomas Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> who sold them at a rate to Sir <hi>John Winter.</hi> This <hi>Davis</hi> commanded the Guard at <hi>Huntly</hi> where himselfe by night some distance from the house attended the enemies comming, went in before them as friends from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> gave them possession, and having accomplisht that peece of treason, immediately marched to <hi>Wesbury</hi> where he was received for a friend, and led
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56747:39"/>
in his traine of Cavaleers, that both places were surprized in two houres, and above eighty men and armes lost in that great exigence. This Villaine was posted on the Gallowes in <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and the Lord Generall was desired that his name might stand upon the Gibbet in all the Parliament Garrisons</p>
            <p>During these things, a Treason of higher nature was plotted by the Enemy, to a self-delusion in the close, a greater birth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring more time to bring forth. It was first conceived the nineteenth of November, and for near ten weeks had the prime influence on their whole course in these parts; and is now ripe for action. All the force they can make from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Irish are drawn together. The Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> Colonell <hi>Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> lie upon us, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe lying at <hi>Newent,</hi> hoping to effect this great Design. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen colours of horse arrived at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> and five hundred horse and foot advanced to <hi>Saperton</hi> and <hi>Musarden,</hi> within ten miles of this Garrison. There were of the Enemies forces round about, near six or seven thousand.</p>
            <p>The failing of their endeavours and hopes in the late siege, brought forth a despaire of reducing the City by storme, and put them upon the wayes of treachery, who therein illuded themselves, and were over-acted in their own councels. One <hi>Edward Stanford</hi> an Esquire, and a grand Papist, assaulted the fidelity of Captain <hi>Backhouse</hi> once his friend and acquaintance. He presumed that former friendship might make way to admit the plot, and <hi>Backhouses</hi> power and interest in the Governour made it (in his conception) very feasible. Wherefore in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letter he tendred the renewing of ancient love, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the procuring of the Kings pardon, but a greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fortune then the condition of those whom he served, could rayse him to. This might be purchased by the delivering of <hi>Gloucester</hi> into their hands, which was not hard for him to perform considering the nature of his employment And the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the enterprize was grounded on the old proverb, <hi>fallere faltentem non est fraus.</hi> An hasty and abrupt temptation and the tempters irrationall confidence did befool him in the first onset, who knew not either to propose or expect such grounds of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

as the thing did require: but set upon a knowing man, without the knowledge of any imbred inclination to treason or present provocation. Except a strange levity, a minde set on mischief, the conscience of delinquency, or desire of revenge, vain glory, or riches, are the sole aimes of a Traytor, and the hopes of either must appear large and certain; but here an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is made on such a one who neither by feare was compeld to provide for himselfe, nor enraged against his own party, but acknowledged a present felicity in the work in hand: as though it were possible to perswade a man wittingly to contrive his own overthrow.</p>
            <p>The Letters were no sooner received, but communicated to the Governour, who advised to embrace the businesse, and hold a correspondence with that party, practizing that rule by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves propounded, for these reasons: First, twas a delight and glory to take them in the snare which themselves had layd; and the advantage was great. 2. That this treason (already secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) might prevent other conspiracies against the City, so long as they had faire hopes of prevailing by this; lest the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a second should confound the disposition of the first. 3. That the Countrey under the command of this Garrison, which upon the petition of the malignant Gentry was devoted to destruction, might be preserved and spared by the Enemy, in hope to enjoy the benefit thereof themselves; for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of this plot did not draw on the Enemy, but held his hand and suspended the execution of his fury. 4. To spin out the plot, and feed their expectation till the Countrey had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the markets their spare provisions of Corn and Cattle. 5. That the Enemy possest and taken up with the gayning of the City, might give the Parliaments Forces in other parts of the Kingdome a greater freedome to execute their designes. 6. That a flattering promise might allay their fury till the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were past or our reliefe come, and we be able to feed them with harder meat; and that themselves might taste the cursed fruits of Treason, to a selfe-shame and confusion. The Design was communicated to Captain <hi>William Singleton</hi> Alderman, and Captain <hi>Read.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56747:41"/>
For these and the like reasons, <hi>Backhouse</hi> undertook the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and returned an answer in a liberall garb, protesting that he honoured his Majesty with his soule, and was ready to perform all reall service. He seemmed withall to promote the plot by requiring sworn secrecy, and agreeing upon a trusty messenger: and that he might seem more deeply to rellish the matter, catcht hold on the promise of Reward, and required some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable assurance, that he might not play an after: game poorely. Thus the fraud is returned upon them by one that strives to maintayn the repute of integrity, conceiving it no transgression of Military Honour, to deceive them into a snare by verball equivocation, as well as by a doubtfull action, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of the Stratagems of Warre. This confident Reply and the palpable discovery of a sudden change, did not render him suspected, but beyond all reason gave the complotters great contentment, who did not enquire into the conviction and change of his thoughts by due degrees. <hi>Stanford</hi> desired him forthwith to expresse his conditions, propose the way, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend unto the particulars of the service, assented to constant intercourse, and assured him that none but the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> should be privy to the Design. Captain <hi>Backhouse</hi> drew the modell of the plot in this following Letter to Mr <hi>Stanford.</hi>

                     <hi>YOV desire my conceit in proposall of particular Propositions, and of my Reward: To both which I shall thus propose unto you to present to more mature judgements: Whether I may not by drawing out my Troop in an evening (as I can doe at any time) meet with your forces, and bring them in at the gate on the sudden in a moonshine night, and so master the first guard, which may easily be done, and not discerned till too late; my Troop being above three score, who may be all in the reare, and at your mercy, though I my selfe shall lead in the force, which cannot give the alarme in the night so soon as to prevent the designe. Whether if I perswade the Governour with a strong party of Horse and Foot upon some designe to lie out all night eight or ten miles distant from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56747:42"/>
Garrison (as I know I can doe) and I my selfe stay at home, in whose absence you may safely advance in the evening to the Towns side, when I can come out to you, and so bring you in under colour of our owne forces. Whether if I finde out a place stenderly guarded, and somewhat easie to come in at, I may draw off the sentinels upon some pretence, as I can do, being known unto them all, and there direct your entrance. Whether if I send for hay, and give you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the very time of its comming in, which must be in the night, I may not after the Carts bring in some men as Carters, who may have snaphance muskets in the Carts and some Dragoons to fall in in the reare of the Carts, who may master the first guard and possesse the Ordnance there, and so let in both Horse and Dragoons who with such Ordnance may march through all the streets in the Town. These severall wayes I propose for the present, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that those who have been versed in the taking of Towns may make more choice of Propositions, any of which if I apprehend it feazible, I shall gladly undertake, or render a reason of my dislike. As for my reward I am right sensible of how great concernment the businesse is to your side, and although it be utterly against my spirit to indent before hand, especially with such gallant and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages; But the straits I have beene put into for lack of money, (having received no pay for my selfe from those whom I serve) and my estate and charge bids me look to that. I shall expect two thousand pound to bee secured, two or three hundred whereof I shall desire you as my friend to procure in hand, that I may bee enabled to beare up my port and credit, especially among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldiers and Vnder-Officers of the Garrison, to whom I must be open handed, and engage affection, that they may be ready at my call. Secondly, to engage mine owne Troop, and to binde such unto me with a silver cord, as I shall finde fittest for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and withall plentifully to reward the entercoursers between you and me, that they may execute our commands with all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity and trust.

                     <hi>SIR, You having so farre declared your desires to serve His Majesty unto my very good friend Master</hi> Stanford, <hi>I thinke it fit you should now receive some more authentick assurance of His Majesties gracious acceptance thereof, then perhaps you will thinke his bare assurance to be. Therefore I doe here solemnely engage my word unto you both as a minister of State, and a Gentleman, that if you shall performe faithfully what you promise there, you shall punctually receive immediately after, such a pardon as your selfe shall desire, and the summe of two thousand pounds. As for the three hundred you desire in present, such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I will have in your word, that as soon as ever I shall have received your answer to this under your hand, it shall be forthwith paid into whatsoever place you shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, or to what person. As for the particular waies of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our designe, those you propose are very rationall, but the choice, and disposition thereof must be between you, and those that are to execute it, with whom if it were possible you should procure a meeting at some unsuspected place. I doe propose unto you the choyce of severall men, and whom of them you shall like best, and thinke fittest by reason of the place where his command is, to him alone, and to no other the businesse shall be imparted, whether Sir</hi> William Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasour <hi>commander in chiefe of the forces now in Gloucester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, or Colonell</hi> Myn, <hi>Commander of a brigade of the English that come out of Ireland, or Colonell</hi> Washington <hi>who is at Evesham; or lastly, whether the Governour of Berkley-castle.

            <p>Here this degenerate Lord sels his honour and betrayes the esteeme of gallantry, by promoving and engaging himselfe to reward the vilest treason, and to insinnate himselfe into the close workings thereof, when many brave spirits out of their abundant justice have disdained the proffer of so base a service. And herein did hee derogate from the repute of an able Statesman in relying upon the doubtfull expressions of an unknowne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and whose condition could not invite any of the least ground of beliefe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a correspondency was held with the Lord <hi>Digby;</hi> unto whom <hi>Backhouse</hi> made his reply, that his Lordships directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suted with his owne former proposals made unto Master <hi>Stanford,</hi> to wit, that the Commander of the forces to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein must be conscious of the designe; and as touching the choice of a chiefe actor on their part, he conceived Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> the fittest man, because he was neerest the businesse, his men lying at <hi>Ledbury,</hi> when the rest were more remote and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable strength: as also because he had the best advantage to make his approach undiscovered, there being no suburbs nor house neere the City from his quarters, nor any out-guard to give the alarm. And for himselfe, upon a few daies notice he would comply with their expectation, as the actors should agree upon all circumstances.</p>
            <p>Upon this they returned large expressions of reward, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but the present payment of the three hundred pound was waved by <hi>Stanford,</hi> as much as possible, upon pretence of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of mis-fezance in the maine plot. <hi>Backhouse</hi> would not admit the excuse, importuned the payment, as well to have something in hand, as to let them know the great wheele that turned him about, that the palpable shew of corruption might make them more confident. Neither could they well keepe backe the earnest of this guerdon, lest they should render themselves capable of

his dislike jealousie, or seem to suspect his trust, whose adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (if reall) in every line was sufficient to ruine him, and he left to bewaile his owne mis-fortune: wherefore it was resolved that this <hi>Stanford</hi> and Captaine <hi>Backhouse</hi> should debate upon the businesse by word of mouth; they met accordingly in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nts, where <hi>Backhouse</hi> received two hundred pounds in hand, with a promise from <hi>Stanford</hi> to discharge a Bond of fifty pounds, and was not once urged in the whole conference to an asseveration of fidelity by protestation or oath. He received likewise the contrivance of the plot laid by Master <hi>Stanford,</hi> Sir <hi>William Vavasour,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were lately come to Tewkesbury, which ranne thus: That Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> should be drawne out of the Garrison with a strong party towards Berkley-castle, having assurance that the Castle should be rendered, which was really intended by them, that the gaining of Gloucester might be the more facile. In the absence of the Governour Captaine <hi>Backhouse</hi> was to open the gate, and deliver the word. Thus was the plot proposed and approved by <hi>Backhouse,</hi> but with additionall advise, that their forces might with all speed relinquish Tewkesbury, because he should never perswade the Governour to draw forth such a party, whilst they lay so strong upon us. This also was assented unto by the complotters, being secure of their agent, and blinded with extreame desire and confidence. And had not the proposall of the enemy been by themselves deserted, we had possest Barkley-castle, and placed a garrison in Tewkesbury. Yet so farre did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the businesse, that Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> sent to require the Governour of Berkley to draw out his whole garrison (which was refused, without the Kings, or Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) himselfe also commanded a great part of his foot to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>show,</hi> professed his endeavours to march with the residne, and all the horse; but that His Majesties Commissioners were so averse as by no meanes to consent or permit, unlesse they might know and approve the designe, whom he professed to leave unsatisfied, lest he might doe <hi>Backhouse</hi> a disservice, and prevent or disturbe the motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notwithstanding <hi>Backhouse</hi> knew well enough that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Oxford are full of this complement; and so close was the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse carried that the London Mercury had blazoned him for a Traytor. Wherefore upon this pretence they runne backe to one of the former Propositions, to wit, that he would draw forth his owne Troope, with one more, which should be put in the reare of their horse, and himselfe lead the forlorne hope into the Towne. But he exquisitely declined this way pretending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe not a little dashed at the disturbance of the first intention, which in his owne thoughts ranne so feazeble, and alledged the Governours watchfulnesse in observing the garrison of <hi>Tewkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> that he had given private commands to the Officers both of horse and foot to be instantly ready upon the first advance of their forces, and kept abroad night and day good parties of horse to bring intelligence. So that he could not joyne with them, without suspition or discovery: and as he should be glad to confirme their opinion of his reall performance, for whom he did thus hazzard his life and fortune, so should he be infinitely unwilling to put them upon any enterprize which to themselves might prove prejudiciall: he minded them withall that the true frame of the plot was the life of the action. That one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feizance in a businesse of this nature was never to be repaired, but crossed the perfection of such an enterprize, wherein he protested himselfe happy if he might sacrifice himselfe to accomplish the same <hi>according to his desires.</hi> In the close hee gave his opinion, that the Governours absence was the chiefe requisite to prepare the businesse, that his presence was not consistent with the safety of their side, especially if the alarm be taken at the first entrance. Wherefore he was once more confident to urge the relinquishing of <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> and upon the removall promised to possesse the Governour with a private intelligence of the surrender of Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and perswade him to imbrace the supposed opportunity, whilst himselfe should remaine at home with the command of the horse left for scouts, and act the businesse with more ease and safety.</p>
            <p>This motion effected its intended purpose to bring them on at the West Port, to our best advantage against them, and Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> seemed to incline, but craved a little patience till the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56747:44"/>
contribution were brought in to satisfie the Souldiers. Master <hi>Stanford</hi> required a particular information of the state of the garrison, and received an account of the severall Ports, Forts, great Guns, Draw-bridges, Provisions and Ammunition. This was taken for a pregnant testimony of <hi>Backhouse</hi> his fidelity, and made them the more bold to come on, who were gulled with such a slender notice of triviall things, that the meanest boy which passed through the streetes might give as great satisfaction: but whatsoever was of concernment he represented to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the garrison.</p>
            <p>After much variety of entercourse, Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> urged the execution, in regard the Parliaments Army grew so strong, that what they attempted was to be done out of hand. The plot was thus disposed by Captaine <hi>Backhouse,</hi> as well to secure his owne person within the gates, as to render the designe more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. That whereas being Commander of the horse he could require the Keyes of the City for the sending forth of scouts, he proposed this way to their liking; that the very night of their approach he might provide Scouts out of his owne Troope who should not be ready till the businesse were acted. Meane while himselfe would take the Keyes, repaire to the West gate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to stay for their comming, and set the guard which is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally slender to drinke in an Ale-house: In which time they might advance, finde no living soule but himselfe at the gate, or a few drunken men, and pretend withall to be our owne men from <hi>Churcham,</hi> where we had a guard of horse and foot, which if they did not disturbe would continue there awhile, and further the performance.</p>
            <p>Thus the safety of the Countrey, and our small garrisons was still interwoven in each part of the plot: and they deceived with so great a semblance of reason, that they could not suspect, though in every motion hee constantly waved selfe-ingagement, and personall danger. The maine care of the businesse is to draw them on to a selfe-destruction: and the last modell complies with their fancy in each particle, and to their second thoughts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise appeares still more rationall. On the fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the guards are to be drawn off from the further Bridge, and the Sentinells to be taken in. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> is to advance with fifteen hundred horse and foot, and it would be very satisfactory if Captaine <hi>Brickhouse</hi> met them with his own Troop pretending to beat up a horse quarters, but this they urge not it it be found inconvenient. In the evening a Messenger is dispatched, from <hi>Gloucester</hi> to the Enemies quarters, with the watch word for their assurance and some private directions for their march up the Town; while himselfe waited at the Gate, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to set open, if they came by nine of the clock, or within half an houre-after.</p>
            <p>After the messengers dispatch, the ports were shut up round the City, carefull Sentinells set, The Governour called a councell of War, acquainted the Officers with the Plot, gave order that aswell Citizens as Souldiers should continue that night in Armes: drew to the Westgate three peeces of Ordnance, and a strong guard of Musketiers well provided with Granadoes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded foure stout men in a boate under <hi>Ouers</hi> Bridge halfe a mile distant from the gate to lie under the maine. Arch, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that upon the firing of the first Ordnance they should out a cable rope, which being done the Bridge would fall into the River. By which meanes they had all been killed, drowned or taken being cooped up in an Island open to our shot without possible meanes of escape. In this preparation and posture we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all night, watching the time to have delivered our selves from the future mischiefe of such bloud thirsty Enemies, They advanced with their whole body of horse and foot, but before they came within a mile and a halfe of the City it was open day, when having lost the time by the slownesse of their manch, they durst not come on but instantly retreated to <hi>Newent,</hi> from thence Captaine <hi>Backhouse</hi> was informed by letters of the reason of their faylings, which induced us to believe that the Enemy did not yet know that their designe was destroyed. Wherefore we indeavoured secrecy, and the next day suffered no man to passe the ports, desired to salve the matter and bring them on once more, but the whole frame quickly fell asunder, though the languishing enemy gave some cold entertainment to a few patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56747:45"/>
letters, because they were ashamed to acknowledge such a strong delusion.</p>
            <p>As they had all justly perished in their own hellish mischiefe, so are they deservedly branded with notorious folly in the whole mannage: and the chiefe undertakers might have learned not to indulge their hopes of faire conclusion by their own subtilty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, and the shew of a neate contrivance, when nothing beneath a like mutuall engagement, and strong necessity doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve assurance and confidence. Neverthelesse the pregnant hopes of this maginary treason, as it brought forth a lie to the contrivers thereof, so it wrought much good for this garrison, and the common service of the State. The imbracing of the motion held up the desires of the enemy, and made them lesse active elsewhere. It preserved the Country till our succours came which were every day expected. Neither was this plot the cause that the power of the enemy did beare hard on the Countrey (for here was the confluence of their Winter quarters) but since we must beare their burden, it made it the lesse grievious. 'Twas impossible to keep out an Enemy, but all the skill was to allay his fury and hinder the acting of mischiefe: which was carried on with violence by the Malignant Gentry, and that party that were not privy to or disliked the Plot; inso much that Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> was complained of, reviled and cursed: and at once lost the opportunity of action and advancement in the Kings Service.</p>
            <p>The Enemy swarmes in every corner, except the County of the City and <hi>Whitstone</hi> hundred, that each day creates new troubles, and the Governour constrained on one side, or other continually to draw out strong parties, to defend our selves, maintaine our Markets and incourage that part of the Country which is yet clear: All advantages were taken to ingage the people and herein did the Governors industry put forth it selfe in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Country in a posture of defence, when the command of the City did not reach above three miles some wayes, and not above seaven miles on the best side. At severall Randezvouzes published the nationall Covenant and Declaration of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes expressing their mutuall care of repayring our breaches

and perseverance in their maine undertaking, which gave great satisfaction to such as were damnityed in this cause, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto them the vigor and strength of the Parliament. By which meanes the nearer parts became wholly ours, not only yeilding a supply of maintenance, but engaging themselves on their own and our defence. And some of them that did not seem to confide in the State were drawne in being first enraged by the Enemeis cruelty, which discontent and desire of revenge the Governour cherished, and raised to an open Declaration, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares of the multitude put them beyond the hopes of a faire retreate. So that these men observed the Enemy upon every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sent alarms to the City, and in a great part took off the feare of a sudden surprizall.</p>
            <p>Amidst these things the expectation of the <hi>London</hi> supply, and the dayly hopes of money strongly upheld the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by a meere delusion: its delay became a greater advantage, since its reall strength had before bin crumbled to dust. No part of the Kingdome was capable of better service by a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number, yet a meane and slender reliefe did not onely not shake off the burthen, but disgrace the businesse and contract, and sinke the mindes of men when hope doth enlarge and beare up.</p>
            <p>The Governour therefore advised the stay of the Convoy, and was willing to expect such a party as might inable him to beare off the Enemy fifteen miles round about. Want of Ammunition was the greatest exigence, and the preserving thereof; till a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply came was the maine hinderance of all designes? Neverthelesse we had perpetuall Bickerings, that the Enemy might not grow upon us and our dayly nimble performances were unto them as a continuall dropping. Amongst others a party of horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners issued forth as far as <hi>Marshfield,</hi> fell upon a Troope of horse quarters there and brought thence a Lieutenant, Cornet, and Quartermaster, with a few common prisoners, and such horse and Armes as the Troop did yeild. Whilst Colonell <hi>Ueales</hi> foot, and the Lord <hi>Incheequeenes</hi> horse lay in and about <hi>Berkely,</hi> and sorely oppressed the Country, we fell into a horse quarter of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheequeenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Regiment, and took a Major and two Captaines,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56747:47"/>
three Lieutenants, two Cornets with two Colours and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferior Officers and Souldiers, to the number of three and twenty, all this while the strength of the Kings army is lodged between us and Warwick, to intercept our relief and in thought have already divided the spoyle.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> willing to act something in the latter end of the day, to repaire his credit in the Kings Army, desired a greater strength with a sufficient Artillery to distresse and straiten Gloucester, and having obtained two Culverins from Oxford, with a proportion of powder, he advanced with a strong Brigade towards Painswick with unusuall preparations and expectation. Their march afflicted the Country, and indangered our out-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons. The enemy were confident to the last that extremity would compell us to yeild up all to their mercy. Sir <hi>William Vavasour</hi> entred <hi>Painswicke</hi> with as gallant horse and foot as the Kings Army did yeild. Here the Governour had placed a guard in a house neer the Church, into which the Church also was taken in by a Breast work of Earth. The intention of the guard was to command contribution, and keepe off a plundering party: and order was given to the Lieutenant which commanded to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it against a lesser party, but if the maine body and Artillery advanced upon them, to relinquish it and retreate down the Hill to <hi>Bruckthrop</hi> (where the Governour had set a guard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Enemies falling down into the bottome) for which purpose they were assisted with a Troop of horse, to make good such a Retreate if need were. But the Lieutenant more confident of the place, and not understanding the strength of the Army, and not willing to draw off before the last minute, was inforced by the Enemy to engage himselfe, and many willing people of the Neighbourhood in that weak hold, and upon the first onset deserted the house being the stronger part, and betook himselfe to the Church, which wanting flankers the Enemy had quickly gained by firing the doores and casting in hand-Granadoes, some few were slaine in defending the place, and the rest taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. We lost three inferior Officers, seaven and thirty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, and many Country men; At that season the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had commanded to <hi>Stroud,</hi> another guard of fifty Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56747:48"/>
to support and strengthen the place in its own defence. But Ammunition was their only cry, which struck us dead, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained the Governour to withdraw that party to the garrison at <hi>Essington;</hi> For our Magazine did then yeild no more then six single barrells of powder, by which meanes he was wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to encounter the Enemy; Only to preserve the bottome, he drew forth the greatest part of both Regiments with their Colours display'd to flourish at a distance, and summoned the Volunteers of the Country whom himselfe had engaged in a posture of defence. These were to increase the appearance of strength by day, and at night to guard the severall passages. So that the Enemy durst not adventure below the Hills, nor seek us in our advantages, nor was it safe for us, who wanted horse, to set upon them in those large and open places; Either party kept their own ground. They wasted the Hill Countries, whilst we secured the Vale: and the Souldiers sustained hard duty in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro to give the Country satisfaction, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prevailed they plundered to the bare walls, and this was the accomplishment of the great service, so long expected from Sir <hi>William Vavasour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Brigade, upon the defeate of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> Army, by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> at <hi>Charrington</hi> Down, was commanded hence and instantly marched for <hi>Cirencester</hi> and so to <hi>Oxford,</hi> our horse made after them but could not recover the Reare, only they lighted upon some straglers, and in the whole businesse we killed and took near fifty men. This diversion relieved Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester which else had bin blocked up to the Gates, and cast into as great necessity as ever. In this pinch we received twelve horse loade of Ammunition strangely conveyed between the Enemies garisons, only by the Carriers and a foot post, when their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed convoy that set forth a little after and missed them, gave them for lost and returned to <hi>Warwicke;</hi> The residue of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was stolne by parcells through the enemies Quarters, for though their greater body was drawn off, yet were we still vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their garrisons. Not long after there arrived another portion and three Troopes of horse to make up the Governours Regiment. At length came Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Ferrar</hi> that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56747:48"/>
had the command of these succours with a little long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pay for the Garrison. As for the Foote Souldiers that came with him out of <hi>London,</hi> in regard they came severall wayes and at severall times in a lingering march with want of pay, and some taken prisoners, about fifty came to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and of the rest, no good account could be given.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Vavasour</hi> was called off the Enemy revived and grew bold under a more active Leader Colonell <hi>Nicholas Min,</hi> who commanded the Irish Brigade. In the first entrance hee began to lash out, and made assayes of action, cut down the Bridge at <hi>Masemore,</hi> allarmed the City from the Vineyard Hill, and took divers of our men that issued out upon a sally over the River in a boate.</p>
            <p>At this present there came dayly cries for the reliefe of <hi>Bramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Castle in the remote parts of <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> which held out a long time in the midst of the Enemies Country to the expense of much time and bloud. And their succour was the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by the rage of the Enemy, which had lately acted their cruelties upon fourty prisoners of the same command taken by Colonell <hi>Woodhouse</hi> in <hi>Hopton</hi> Castle, which were basely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered after the surrender. Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> had no forces under his command to undertake a march through the midst of the Enemy, when they pressed hard on our own borders, and the Brigade of horse assigned for the Convoy, and commanded by Commissary Generall <hi>Bher</hi> were unwilling to undertake the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Yet while these horse remained here, the Governour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to set them a worke that they might not act only to the spoyle of the Country. Wherefore they joyned with a party of our foot, and made an attempt upon <hi>Newent,</hi> Colonell <hi>Mins</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, but were called off in the midst of the service by a speciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the L. Generall.</p>
            <p>The Enemy have lost the hopes of their Winter action, and this garrison made the best of a bad game in continuall petty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and small parties, yet beyond the strength of the place, not to conquer, but live, nor to destroy the Kings Forces but to stave off or delude them. But to enable Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> to march with a better strength, Colonell <hi>Purefoy</hi> with his Regiment
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56747:49"/>
of horse about the first of <hi>April</hi> 1644, was by the Committeè of both Kingdome, commanded into these parts, and the maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe was to remove or take in the garrisons that lay round the City. These horse having brought but a slender part of the Ammunition, and none of the Armes that were sent from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were remanded to <hi>Warwicke,</hi> for the Convoy of Match and Powder: The Governour resolving not to undertake a march or action of time without a proportion of Powder, both for the field and garrison. Upon their second arrivall these horse with a party of foure hundred foot were drawne out with two small pieces of Ordnance, and advanced into the Enemies quarters, first with a purpose to seeke out Colonell <hi>Min,</hi> who was lodged in the nearer parts. But upon the report of our march he fell back from <hi>Newent</hi> and hastned to <hi>Rosse,</hi> where he began to fortify the Church with his own and Sir <hi>Iohn Winters</hi> Regiments. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour made forwards into <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and kept his head quarters at <hi>Ledbury</hi> to appeare unto the Enemy, and in their own Country provoke them to action, and in the meane while to fetch in monies for the supply of the Souldier, and to ease our Neighbourhood, which till then did beare the whole burden. Our horse that lay neer upon their garrisons had some encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but with no considerable party. From <hi>Hedbury</hi> an hundred and fifty Musketiers with the whole strength of horse were drawn towards <hi>Hereford</hi> to command the Country, and face the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison which feared our approach, and for that cause fired a lone house neer the City, but none did adventure to sally forth or fall on the Reare in our retreat, so we marched through the greatest part of the County, but the grand Malignants were fled with the best of their substance. The Governour resolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the lesser garrisons, but the noyse of our march had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who thereupon was come to <hi>Evesham</hi> with as great a strength of Horse and Dragoones as he could draw together with a purpose to fall over <hi>Upton-</hi>Bridge, and get between Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and our forces, whilst Colonell <hi>Min</hi> and Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> held us in play in these parts. Wherefore being advertised of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces march, and suspecting his intention, he drew back the party as well to refresh and preserve his men as to make the Enemy secure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56747:49"/>
But within foure daies the like number were againe drawne out towards the Forrest side to attempt and act something upon <hi>Myns</hi> forces, and first they came up upon <hi>Westbury,</hi> once our owne garrison, but betrayed into the hands of Sir <hi>John Winter.</hi> Here the enemy held the Church, and a strong house adjoyning. The Governour observing a place not flanked, fell up that way with the Forlorne hope, and secured them from the danger of shot. The men got stooles and ladders to the windowes, where they stood safe, cast in Granadoes and fired them out of the Church. Having gained the Church, he quickly beat them out of their workes and possest himselfe of the house, where he tooke about foure score prisoners, without the losse of a man. The enemy had an other guard at <hi>Little-Deane,</hi> whither the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour commanded a party of horse to give them alarms whilst he fell upon <hi>Westbury.</hi> These horse found the enemy stragling in the Towne, and upon the discovery of their approach shuffling towards the garrison, which the Troopers observing, alighted and ran together with them into the house, where they tooke about twenty men. Neere unto which guard Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Congrave</hi> Governour of <hi>Newnham</hi> and one Captaine <hi>Wigmore</hi> with a few private Souldiers were surrounded in some houses by the residue of our horse. These had accepted quarter, ready to render themselves when one of their company from the house kils a Trooper, which so enraged the rest, that they broke in upon them and put them all to the Sword: in which accident this passage was not to be forgotten that expressed in one place an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame contrariety in the Spirits of men under the stroke of death: <hi>Congrave</hi> died with these words, <hi>Lord receive my soule;</hi> and <hi>Wigmore</hi> cryed nothing but <hi>Dum me more, Dame me more;</hi> desperately requiring the last stroke, as enraged at Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> pursued the successe (whilst his owne men were full of life and hope, that the confidence of the enemy might be dashed by a quicke surprisall.) And the very next day came before <hi>Newnham,</hi> where a strong party of Sir <hi>John Winters</hi> forces kept garrison in the Church, and the Fort adjoyning, of considerable strength, who at that instant where much daunted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56747:50"/>
and distracted by the losse of <hi>Congrave</hi> their Governour. Our men were possest of the Towne without opposition, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the houses by which they got neere the workes. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour commanded a blind of faggots to be made athwart the street, drew up two pieces of Ordnance within Pistoll shot: and observing a place not well flanker'd. where he might lead up his men to the best advantage, himselfe marched before them, and found that part of the worke fortified with double pallisadoes: (the Souldiers being provided with Sawes to cut them down,) and having drawn these close within a dead angle, and secure from their shot, and drawing the rest of his force for a storme, the enemy forthwith desires parley, and to speake with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which he refused, and commanded a sudden surrender. In this interim some of the enemy jumpt over the workes, and so our men broke in upon the rest, who ranne from the out-worke into the Church, hoping to cleare the mount which we had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But our men were too nimble, who had no sooner entred the mount, but rushed upon them before they could reach home, and tumbled into the Church all together. Then they cryed for quarter, when in the very point of victory a disaster was like to befall us, a barrell of Gunpowder was fired in the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of set purpose, and was conceived to be done by one <hi>Tipper</hi> a most virulent Papist, and Sir <hi>John Winters</hi> servant, despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring withall of his redemption being a prisoner before, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving falsified his engagements. This Powder blast blew many out of the Church, and sorely singed a greater number, but killed none. The Souldiers enraged fell upon them, and in the heate of blood, slew neere twenty, and amongst others this <hi>Tipper.</hi> All the rest had quarter for their lives (save one Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> an Irish rebell, who was knocked downe by a common souldier) and an hundred prisoners taken. The service was performed without the losse of a man on our side.</p>
            <p>After this dispatch the Governour marched to Lidney house, with purpose to attempt according to what he should finde meet, and in the first place summoned the same to a surrender, which being refused, and he finding the house exceedingly fortified, and no lesse provided with victuall and force, engaged not upon it:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56747:50"/>
And understanding that Col. <hi>Myn</hi> with a considerable strength of horse and foot, assisted by the Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> forces, and Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> was come as far as <hi>Coford;</hi> he was enforced with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to draw off, for the gaining of the hill towards them, there expecting the enemies advance till towards evening, when he marched off his wearied men to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> first having fired Sir <hi>John Winters</hi> Iron-mils and Furnaces, the maine strength of his estate and garrison.</p>
            <p>After these things many Gentlemen of the County began to looke towards the Parliament, and tender their obedience, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Protections from this government, to secure themselves from spoyle, and the souldiers violence. Neverthelesse as the personall estates of all knowne delinquents within the reach of this command were seized, and the profits of their Lands seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, so these men were not to be ignorant or insensible of the value of their peace. Concerning some the Governour desired the direction of the Houses, yet granted Protections with strict provisoes onely to preserve their persons from the violence, and their estates from the plunder of the common souldier, for the advantage of the publique, till a full conviction, or the pleasure of the Houses were by themselves or their Committee made known. And this he did according to the Parliaments undeniable justice, and the example of other generall Officers. As for the moderate offenders, unlesse the state of things did require or permit their utter destruction, he had no other way but to endeavour to make them our friends and confidents, and since it was resolved they must live amongst us, hee desired by love and gentle dealing to hold the way secure and open, that they might imbrace the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without discontent or feare, and for these protections hee reserved nothing to himselfe but caused the moneys to be paid in to the publique Treasurer for the use of the garrison.</p>
            <p>Neither was he sluggish in the spring of action, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell upon another designe, the surprisall of <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> by an unexpected onset. For the enemy by the number of their men, and the naturall strength of the place, with the workes well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, were sufficiently provided to receive an expected and open storme, and the Governour shun'd all desperate hazzards, because
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56747:51"/>
he did not march with supernumerary forces, but the maine strength of Gloucester. Wherefore to deceive the enemy the foot were drawne forth at the West-gate, bearing the shew of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into Herefordthire, and the Horse kept their Rendezvouz, and looked the same way. But in the evening the horse came backe and marched through Gloucester towards Tewkesbury, having first sent a guard to <hi>Upton-</hi>bridge: while the foot came on beyond Severne. The designe had taken effect, had not the foot by their slow march or mis-guidance passed the houre, which was breake of day, for they came not before the Towne till an houre after Sunne rising, when we were found not sit to assault a waking and prepared enemy. To withdraw neverthelesse, did seeme but a feeble businesse for such a faire body of horse and foot displayed before the Towne, and carried before it the appearance of a baffle: yet the Governour, though naturally jealous of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, could digest such mis-fezance, when the safety of his owne men required, knowing that the opportunity of service would in good time cancell a mis-grounded ignominy, and in his whole course, whensoever the present exigence did not urge a greater hazzard, neglected the hopes of those victories that could not be gained without the weakning of that party on which the maine rest did lie.</p>
            <p>This party was presently sent over the River, and marched toward <hi>Rosse</hi> to prevent the joyning of Colonell <hi>Myn</hi> (now made Commander in chiefe in the roome of Sir <hi>William Vavasour)</hi> with Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> and the Welsh forces, as also to raise moneys for the garrison out of the remoter parts, to enlarge our owne quarters, engage the Countrey with us, or to lie ready for all occasions of service. There our horse and foot arrived, with two pieces of Ordnance, and found <hi>Wilton-</hi>bridge guarded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Cassie,</hi> and thirty Musketiers from <hi>Gudridge-</hi>castle; a party of our horse advanced upon them, forced the River, and got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; after some dispute beat off the guard, wounded and tooke the Captaine, slew many of his men, and tooke the rest in the chase almost up to the Castle. Our forces rested here a few daies, and summoned the Countrey to appeare, it being the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours constant endeavour to adde daily friends unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56747:51"/>
and to put the Countrey into such a posture, that upon all alarms they might gather to an head for their owne defence, and hereupon many came in and declared themselves, by taking the Nationall Covenant. Whilst the engagement of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was thus prosecuted some emergent occasions drew the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> where he found a prisoner Captaine <hi>Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> Governour of <hi>Beverston-</hi>castle, a man rendred odious to the Countrey by strange oppressions and tyranny, and who lost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe basely being taken by some of our Scouts in a private house courting his Mistresse, and when once taken, not so high and sterne before, but now as vile and abject. By which meanes the Governour was made sensible of the weakenesse of the Castle, but much divided in his owne thoughts, whether to leave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that came on so fairely to a selfe-engagement, and neglect the Contribution already levied, but not payd in, or desert the hopes of agallant service: till at last considering the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Castle, that the gaining of it would free the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers of <hi>Stroudwater</hi> from the bondage and terrour of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; might prove a great detriment and annoyance to the enemy, in stopping or disturbing their passage from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,</hi> he turned his thoughts to the businesse, put on and resolved to try for it. Wherefore he drew from <hi>Rosse</hi> without delay, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his foot over <hi>Severne</hi> at <hi>Newnham</hi> passage, whilst the horse marched through <hi>Gloucester:</hi> the next day he came before <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> and demanded the Castle in the name of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant that commanded, at the first returne sent an answer of complyance, farre from the language of a souldier, and without one confident expression. They quickly came to a parley, and rendered upon conditions that both Officers and common Souldiers leaving their Armes, Ammunition, Bagge and Baggage, should freely passe to whatsoever garrison of the Kings themselves desired, onely foure Officers had the priviledge to take each man his horse. So that without losse or danger we were possest of <hi>Beverston-</hi>castle, to the great content and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Countrey round about. 'Twas lost unworthily on the enemies part, who might have held it with ease. Of so
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56747:52"/>
great simplicity was he conscious that commanded the Garrison as to aske the place, whether our forces intend the next march, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his doubts of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and feare of being taken the second time. Neverthelesse they required a conduct thitherward and were guard d along by two Troops of horse, and that very day our forces fell before it.</p>
            <p>Whilst the horse faced the Towne Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> sent in the Summons, but this enemy put on the appearance of bravery fired upon the horse, and Colonell <hi>Henry Howard</hi> Governour of the Garrison sent backe a resolute answer. Thereupon our foot and artillery were brought up from <hi>Tedbury,</hi> and within two houres drawne into the Suburbs and lower part of the Towne. The foot broke their way through the houses till they came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most up to the workes, and the onely place of entrance into the Towne, which is built upon the levell of a rocke. Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> caused a blinde to be made crosse the street to bring up the Ordnance, within Carbine shot: when on the sudden the fancie of an Alarm seized upon our men in the heate of the businesse, that the enemy were sallying out upon them, which was nothing so. This unexpected accident strucke those men that at other times would brave it in the face of an enemy, with such distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and feare, that they all fled, and left their Cannon in the open street. This meere conceit was like to overturne all: but they within observed not. After a while the Souldiers recovered themselves, regained and kept their ground, and the Governour resolved to storme the Towne in three places at once. The seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parties were drawne out to the places of assault, but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe miscarried through the mis-understanding of the signall. The parties returne unto the Governour, who resolved to make the assault at breake of day in one place where himselfe kept the onely passage into the Town, having no draw-bridge at the entrance, but onely a Turn-pike, whereas the other parts were almost inaccessible, guarded by a steepe descent, and double channell round about. The houses within Pistoll shot of the workes were our maine advantage, by which meanes our men were brought safe under the shelter of their workes. And the Governour observing the late effects of a panick feare amongst
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56747:52"/>
his owne men, gave the charge that they should fall on all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a sudden and confused noise, to amaze the enemy, and disturbe the command of the Officers. The forlorne hope advanced, seconded with a good reserve, all put on together, came up to the Turn-pike, and threw in Granadoes, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made many shot at randome, in the disadvantage of a rainy night, and their muskets lying wet on the workes. So that our men came all in a croude to the narrow passage, and thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in, and not a man slaine or wounded in the storme. One onely was killed the night before in helping to make the blinde. Colonell <hi>Howard</hi> was taken at the workes after three shots recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in severall parts of his garment, each of which missed his body. An hundred musketiers were taken prisoners, many having escaped, besides those of <hi>Beverston-</hi>castle, who came hither for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge the day before. This service was performed gallantly by our men, after three daies continuall march. Upon the first entrance Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> preserved the Town from plunder, nor at any time did he suffer his souldiers to ransacke any place that he took by storme, giving this reason, that he could judge no part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an enemies Countrey, nor an English Town capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation by English souldiers. After a little stay to settle the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, and Countrey, and to command in some moneys for the satisfaction of the souldiers, and present supply of the brigade, he returned to <hi>Gloucester;</hi> and the <hi>Warwickeshire</hi> horse were called off into their owne Countrey.</p>
            <p>After few daies the Governour having breathed himselfe and his men, resolved to attempt the taking of <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> a bad neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to our head garrison, and where he had suffered the repulse twice before. He was able to draw forth an hundred and twenty horse, and about thirty dragoones, with three hundred foot. For his strength was no more then the standing forces of the City, a great part of which were now swallowed up by the garrisons lately taken in. The horse and dragoones commanded by Major <hi>Hammond</hi> advanced some few houres before the Foot and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and were to alarm the enemy till the foot came up. They made a hault a mile from the Town, and drew out a pretty strong forlorne-hope, conceiving they might possibly surprize them, if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56747:53"/>
they had not as yet tooke the alarm, and first three men were sent before to espy if the Draw-bridge were down, and six more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind went undiscovered; next unto these marched the forlorne hope, and the maine body in the reare. In this posture they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced up to the Town, where they found the Bridge down, the guards slender; the enemy without intelligence, and supinely negligent. On went the first party, killed the Sentinels, a Pikeman and a Musketier without match, and made good the bridge: the forlorne-hope rushed in, and after them a full body of horse and dragoones, fell upon the guards, came up to the maine-guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the alarm was taken, overturned their Ordnance, and charged through the streets as farre as the bridge <hi>Worcester</hi> way, where they tooke Major <hi>Myn</hi> the Governour of the Towne. The enemy threw down their Armes, many escaped by flight, and many were taken prisoners. Colonell <hi>Godfrey</hi> was slain in the first charge, as also Colonel <hi>Vavasours</hi> Quartermaster-generall, and a Lieutenant, all Papists, besides a Sergeant, with about six common Souldiers. Our Officers and Souldiers supposing themselves wholly victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, dismounted and went into the houses, some in the vanity of their humour, others for plunder, whilst all sleighted their owne guards, and the making good of the bridge at which they entered, and neglected the taking and disarming of the maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, which lay in the heart of the Towne, and cleared every street. Whereupon those at the main-guard observing the horse not seconded with foot, took courage to charge some of our horse now in confusion, and many of the enemy out of the houses ran to the guard, and so strengthned it, that they issued out upon our men, put them to a retreat, beat them out of the Towne, and took some few prisoners. But before they were beaten out they had cut down two Draw-bridges, and secured the Governour Major <hi>Myn,</hi> who was passed over <hi>Severne</hi> with a small party that tooke him beyond the Town. By this time Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> was come up with a few horse halfe a mile in the Van of the foot, which hasted after to make an assault in this instant of time. But the bridge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gloucester</hi> was againe drawn up and the workes manned on that side; here the governour placed his company of dragoones, and gave order to fire upon them, whilst he drew his men round
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56747:53"/>
the Towne, it being now darke night; but before he could reach the farther end, where he entered about midnight the enemy were fled towards <hi>Worcester,</hi> being daunted at the first assault made by the horse, observing withall our foot now brought up, their owne Governour lost, their Officers slaine, and most of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers already runne away. The Townesmen through feare durst not give the least intelligence of what had hapned. By which meanes they were past the recovery of our horse already tyred, besides the night and darke weather hindred the pursuit. Onely we tooke some scattering foot, to the number of foure and twenty, with a Lieutenant. Upon our entrance we found eighteen barrels of Powder, left by their haste, an hundred &amp; twenty skeyns of Match, two hundred new Pikes, foure &amp; thirty large hand-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, good store of Musket-shot, and two brasse Drakes. Most of their Muskets were thrown about in the fields, ditches, and rivers, many of which were afterwards found, but the place it selfe was of greatest consequence, and worthy of the service, being now a strong Frontier-town securing that side of the County, and commanding a good part of <hi>Worcestershire:</hi> and in this nicke of time extreamly crosse to the intentions of the Kings Army. The enemy confest themselves to be neer seven hundred strong, when our whole body could not reach that number. That very day Colonell <hi>Myn</hi> was to march from <hi>Hereford</hi> to ayd this Town: but prevented by our possession.</p>
            <p>These things were acted here while the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> lay neere <hi>Oxford</hi> with both their Armys, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled His Majesty to withdraw himselfe from his strongest hold. The King having shifted between them both by a close and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conveyance, and being on a swift march over <hi>Cotswood</hi> hils had this Town of <hi>Tewkesbury</hi> in his thoughts for his owne passe, and a stop to the pursuing Army, not understanding his losse till within a daies march of the place. The intelligence of this surprisall, and that <hi>Upton-</hi>bridge was made unpassable, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, and turned aside the course of his flight towards <hi>Evesham:</hi> where he quartered for a night, and rose thence in great distraction, and caused all the bridges in those parts to be broken down after him, to hinder Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in the pursuit,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56747:54"/>
whom he expected in the Reare every hower. In such a hurry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and feare did the Enemy run, that a smaller party of horse only with the report of the foot comming after, in a constant and close pursuit might have consumed and dissipated the whole army: which neverthelesse remained a body with life in it selfe, and quickly grew up to the perfection of parts.</p>
            <p>The Governour had reduced these parts into a reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ease, and security, made a convenient passe for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments forces through the heart of the Kings Country, and blocked up the course of the Enemy almost on every side, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the maine Army did march. <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>Beverston-</hi>Castle lie in the Roade from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and inforce the lesser parties to fetch a compasse by <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> thence round about into <hi>Wales,</hi> and at last to passe the River of <hi>Severne</hi> below <hi>Berkely</hi> Castle.</p>
            <p>When the King had winded himselfe out of the snare, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller</hi> could not well follow the chase with his foot and a traine of Artillery, though the horse might performe gallantly to the ruine of those who resolved rather to flie before them then fightupon any tearmes. Wherefore he made some pause by the way with a purpose to march his great Ordnance to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and appointed Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> to meet him before <hi>Sudeley,</hi> where he performed an acceptable service to this Country. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour forth with faced the Castle, beat in the Enemy, and took twenty horses from under the Castle walls, expecting the arrivall of Sir <hi>Wil. Waller:</hi> who came up within few houres with a strong party of Horse.</p>
            <p>The Enemy within discharged their Ordnance, and fired their out-houses like men resolved upon extremities rather then to yeild up or lose the garison. In the evening Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> summoned the Governour of the Castle: and it fell out that the very name of his Army and presence strooke them to the surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that hold that might have expended the lives of many, and much time then pretious in that great advantage on the Kings distressed Army: yet they refused to render at the first summons. The Battery was planted within halfe Musketshot. But the great pieces did little execution upon the soft and yeilding stone, nor could the Castle be taken by battery: but one shot by chance took
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56747:54"/>
off the head of their Cannoneer, and exceedingly daunted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldier: and the Governour Sir <hi>William Morton</hi> did in his owne thoughts incline to a surrender, whether out of a naturall feare or free choice. He was knowne to be active and violent in the Kings service, of an high spirit and bold, bearing before him the semblance of valour and supposed by an high degree of enmity most obnoxious to the justice of the Parliament, one that had the repute of a knowing man, able in the profession of the Law, and versed in the wayes and actions of men. He was likewise more strongly linked unto that cause by the late honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which by the State is held no better then a note of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to stigmatize those persons that have been eminent in the disservice of the common-Wealth. Notwithstanding this, being lost and desperate in the opinion of the Parliament, he gave up that strong hold and himselfe into their hands, having not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the indempnity of his own person: when by his own party, likewise he must needs be branded with treachery or cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize, and so lost on all hands. So that no faction seemes to be assured of its principall confidents, and that no resolved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or judgement can secure the strongest enterprize to a wise and honorable conclusion. After the surrender Sir <hi>William</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thence to seek out the Kings Army, and left the Castle to be kept by the <hi>Gloucester</hi> forces.</p>
            <p>By this time the Enemy had no footing in the County save <hi>Berkely-</hi>Castle and <hi>Lidney</hi> house; And as this government had by maine force gained every step of its command, so no lesse skill and vertue is required to maintaine the victories, we have the possession of <hi>Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Sudely, Newneham, Beverston,</hi> and <hi>Slimbridge,</hi> all to be defended and maintained at so great distances only by two Regiments of foot. For <hi>Malmesbury</hi> was kept by Colonell <hi>Deveraux</hi> his Regiment, who was appointed Governour under the command of Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> unto whom the disposition and settlement of that garrison was intrusted by the Parliament. For want of money the City Regiments were weake and uncertaine in duty and service, and the Souldiers ranne dayly to other garrisons, where they found alwayes constant pay and lesse hardship: But the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56747:55"/>
could find none so rationall as to clap them in Irons, or give them back to his justice. For this cause he was perplexed in each designe, uncertaine of the atchievement, and could not waite for a regular disposition, and traine of circumstances: but nimble in the secret and sudden motions of the time and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and sometrue resolving upon the sole guide of providence, but in this never running a greater hazard then the shame of a non-performanee. These many garrisons having taken up the whole strength; for want of a marching brigade, we were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the fruit of our labours in the supplies of monies to be commanded out of the Enemies quarters, and disabled to relieve the remote parts that were by this time united under the power of this government. So that the first fruits were nipt in the bud, and we remaine miserable after so great enlargements, being inforced to cry to the Parliament for help, which we should have held a disparagement, had we received a stock to improve to a larger support, and livelyhood. Wherefore the house of Commons taking notice of the many good services of Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> made an Order for the recrute of his Regiment of horse and foot in the first place, and to make up a competent Brigade, Colonell <hi>Tho. Stephens</hi> had commission for a Regiment of horse, and Colonell <hi>Edward Harley</hi> for a Regiment of foot. In which businesse the Governour advised, not to raise men and horse at <hi>Londm,</hi> whither the refuse of the Army, runnegadoes, and such as disliked the conditions of their former entertainment were wont to repaire, but only to procure monies to be sent into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where horses might be raysed at a cheaper rate, and able men were easy to be found, and chiefly where we might robbe the Enemy of their maine strength, from whom great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were ready to flow in upon the hopes of entertainment. And before this time since the late siege at least a thousand of the Enemy, that here tendred themselves to the service, went from us for lack of pay. This was a speedy course and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which might carry on the worke whilst we were in a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way.</p>
            <p>At that time the affaires of the garrison were a little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with some passages of the greater Army, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was led into the Northerne parts, in the pursuit of His
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56747:55"/>
Majestie, straining to reach or get beyond him. But the King doubled in the chace, hasted back by <hi>Worcester</hi> towards <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and left Sir <hi>William</hi> a few dayes march in the Rear, who neverthelesse made after with all speed, but was constrained to rest at <hi>Gloucester</hi> to refresh his weary Souldiers. And purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to fall upon the Kings Army, importuned the Governor to lend his assistance, which was extracted out of the extreme penury of these parts, onely for a quick dispatch. Two hundred and seventy Muskettiers with a Company of Dragoons were sent from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and a hundred Muskettiers from <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> which did not a little necessitate the place, and stop the actions of this command which had so many Garrisons to make good, and defend the Countrey from the neighbouring Enemy that began to threaten from every quarter.</p>
            <p>At this time there happened a dispute between the Kings Army and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> at a Bridge neer <hi>Banbury:</hi> where some few were slain, and taken on both sides, but on ours the chief miscarriage was the losse of some Ordnance. After this brush the King marched off into the borders of <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> towards <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to joyn with Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Browne.</hi> Our Countrey is in danger of ruine by the falling down of the Kings Army, whose main body lay for a while about <hi>Breedon</hi> three miles from <hi>Tewkesbury:</hi> where his Majestie being informed of the weaknesse of the place, drew neer with a purpose to storme it, advanced the Ordnance within a mile, and sent out parties to skirmish. Collonel <hi>Massie</hi> upon the first intelligence clapt into the Town two hundred Muskettiers, for an additionall strength, and to incourage those within: Himself in the mean while with a hundred and fifty Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers in <hi>Cos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore he made up the hils, marched
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56747:56"/>
the first day in the view of <hi>Shudely</hi> Castle over the Downes, and came that night to <hi>Cubberly</hi> seven miles from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and from thence marched the next day by <hi>Beverstone</hi> Castle to <hi>Sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> They went on like a flying Army, surprised the Countrey, but they onely touched and away; And our weak troops drove in the stragling plunderers. For the Governor commanded a party of horse to follow the Reare of the Enemy, whilest the rest were imployed in a necessary defence in sundry places. These did seem to give them a gentle convoy over the hill Countrey towards <hi>Bristoll;</hi> and though the Van of their horse were too nimble for us, and drove great store of the garrison cattell, that lay in their way, yet the Countrey-men were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any great matter of losse, and the parties of horse brought into our garison between 50 and 60 prisoners, officers and souldiers; and though they could not retard the march, yet made them passe forward with much watines and fear.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Coll: <hi>Min,</hi> together with Sir <hi>John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> forces take the advantage of our weaknes to spoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy our friends on the Forrest side, Sir <hi>William Russell</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Worcester</hi> make incursions on that side. And the garison oppressed with many out-guards, and multitudes of prisoners within, had much ado to preserve the neighbours from ruine. Collonel <hi>Min</hi> advanced from <hi>Rosse,</hi> where he quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his regiment, within half a mile of the City, drove away the Countrey cattell, and took the persons of many. And the forces of <hi>Berkely</hi> Castle act a sufficient part in the generall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The Governor looks round about him, and though he cannot hope to lay them flat, and subdue their spirits, yet he can check their insolence, &amp; make them stand on their guard. He commanded a party of horse and Dragoons towards <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> who fell upon the guard of the Town, beat them into the Castle, slew eight or ten, took prisoners Captain <hi>Sandys</hi> with a Lieutenant, Ensigne, Sargeant, and seven common Souldiers; whence likewise they brought away fourty or fifty arms, and took from out of the Park under the Castle wall about fiftie horses with other cattell. An other party was commanded within foure miles of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and surprised in their quarters
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56747:56"/>
Sir <hi>Humphrey Tracy,</hi> Lieu: Coll: <hi>Hely,</hi> and Captain <hi>Savage,</hi> and brought them prisoners to <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time an increase is added to the garrison forces by the arrival of Col: <hi>Stephens</hi> with three troops of horse, and two troops of Coll: <hi>Harlyes</hi> Regiment, which did inable the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour once more to appear in the field: and draw out against Collonel <hi>Min,</hi> a serious and active Enemy, and a perpetuall terror to the Countrey, whose ruine was again contrived, and resolved upon. And for this designe strong preparations were made by the Enemy round about. The Governor had some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out of their own quarters, and upon advertisement that some forces out of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> went over the River at <hi>Aust</hi> passage, advanced with his horse towards <hi>Berkly</hi> Castle, and thence to the passage, where they missed not half an houre of the surprisall of the Lord <hi>Herbert.</hi> The notice of the march of our horse into the remote parts of the County hastned <hi>Mins</hi> expedition for <hi>Gloucestershire.</hi> And our intelligence abroad gave a timely advertisement of the work in hand, which a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was fully confirm'd by letters taken out of Collonel <hi>Mins</hi> pocket, to wit, that <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Worcestershire</hi> were to joyn their forces about <hi>Cosselawne,</hi> and with an over-powering Army to march up to the gates of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to the utter devastation of the parts adjacent with fire and plunder, and to burn up the corn on the ground, it being then neer harvest. Hereupon the Governor marched back with his troops to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> from whence he commanded two hundred and twenty Musketiers, and ordered an hundred Muskettiers from <hi>Tewksbury</hi> to meet him on the march, to prevent this great noised Army.</p>
            <p>Whilest the orders for the march were giving forth to the Officers of horse and foot, there fell out a sad accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Major <hi>Gray,</hi> and Major <hi>Hammond,</hi> which was like to dash the whole action. The heat of a quarrell then brake forth by occasion of a verball contestation at a Councell of Warre the same day, when both had orders to march, and were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to their particular charges. Major <hi>Gray</hi> began to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>Hammond</hi> for his hasty language, and to require satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This challenge at the present was refused or sleighted,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56747:57"/>
wherefore impatient of the supposed injury, and full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he smote him on the face with his fist: upon this to swords they went in the street, and after a little clashing, <hi>Gray</hi> received his deaths wound by a thrust in the neck, and expired in the place. This miserable accident was like to beget a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mischief among the Souldiers, who being in Arms, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to advance, came back with full streame of violent reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for the present revenge of <hi>Grays</hi> blood: that the whole City and garrison was not farre from an uproar. It rested on the Governors sole care to allay that violence of the Souldier, who used his best art, and industry to appease them, whilest the Officers indulging their own discontent at the losse of their Major, fell quite off the hinges: After an houres dispute, and intreaty the tumult was in some measure qualified, that the most were perswaded to march, as it was high time, when the Enemy came on within three miles of the City with a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if not to lay waste by fire (as they threatned) yet to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and take away the persons of men, their goods and cattell. The businesse was put forwards, but with little help from the discontented Officers. Late in the afternoon our party began to advance, and at <hi>High leaden</hi> passage got over the brook. The Enemy were quartered in <hi>Hartpury</hi> field, and commanded to lie close. Our men came up to a bridge within a quarter of a mile of them in the dark night, gave them an alarme, and took ten prisoners, and an other party of our horse that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered neer the <hi>Lawne</hi> took divers that were sent that way to plunder. But their main body evaded us, and with great speed marched that night to <hi>Redmarley,</hi> and we after a tedious wandring to find them out came to <hi>Eldersfield</hi> two miles from their quarters, where we rested two or three houres to refresh ourselves and horses.</p>
            <p>At break of day we prepared to advance upon the enemy, when the beating of their Drums minded us of an early march: and by six of the clock we came up to their randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, their horse consisted of an hundred and sixty, and their foot of eight hundred and fifty: and of them six hundred and fourty Muskettiers by their own confession: all drawn up into
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56747:57"/>
battalions, and the hedges lined with Muskettiers. To beat them out of their advantages the Governor divided the Foot into two bodies, and drew out the Horse into single troops, because the frequent inclosures would not make roome for a larger forme (the Enemy in the mean while plying us with small shot) and having disposed of his own troop, with the hundred Muskettiers from <hi>Tewkesbury</hi> newly come in, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Countrey inhabitants armed with Muskets, and good resolutions to one part of the Town, he drew the <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> Muskettiers about an hundred and sixty (for the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at home ready to raise a mutiny for the misfortune of <hi>Grayes</hi> death) and the greatest part of the horse to an other place of best advantage. Himself advanced with this party, and led the Van, which consisted of three troops: these were seconded with three other troops left to the command of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Backhowse.</hi> Some of the Foot were placed in each Flank of the Horse, and one single troop with the rest of the foot brought up the Reare. They were drawn out into this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, marched up to the face of the Enemy, the Governor in the Van, next unto him Collonel <hi>Harley</hi> in the head of his own troop, gallantly, and in good order, gave the charge, beat them from their ambuscadoes, put their horse to flight, and in the instant of time got into the Van of their foot, cut down, and took them prisoners, that few escaped our hands. The Horse and Foot, both Officers and Souldiers, plaid their parts with resolution and gallantry. The Enemy was left to our execution, and their whole body broken and shattered, many wounded and slain, but more taken. Major Generall <hi>Min</hi> was slain on the place with an hundred and seventy. Among the Officers, Leiftenant Collonel <hi>Passy</hi> then mortally wounded, Major <hi>Buller,</hi> seven Captains, foure Leiftenants, five Ensignes, twelve Sergeants, and neer three hundred common Souldiers were taken prisoners. Some troops advanced in the pursuit fiue miles from the place of the sight; but upon the view of a strong party from <hi>Worcester</hi> that came to joyn with Collonel <hi>Min,</hi> they were enforced to leave the pursuit, and prepare for a second encounter. And a strange hand of providence kept
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56747:58"/>
asunder the <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi> forces, whose joyning would have proved unto us an inevitable destruction. For Leiftenant Collonel <hi>Passie,</hi> who commanded this fresh partie of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and fiftie horse and five hundred foot, just upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fight was riding up to <hi>Mins</hi> Brigade to bring news of their arrivall, but happily intercepted, and wounded by our Scouts, and left for dead. So that neither Enemy had the knowledge of each others condition; But the <hi>Worcester</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces advanced within two flight shot of the place, whilest our men were scattered here and there in the chase of a vanquished Enemy, nor did the Governor when the first brunt was over, expect an after-birth.</p>
            <p>The first discovery was made by Collonel <hi>Broughton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Backhowse,</hi> upon whom a blunt fellow charged up from the head of the main body in the entrance of a crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane. Him they surprised in the name of friends, drew him aside from the view of the company, and informed themselves of the strength at hand. Forthwith they make a noise in the Enemies hearing, pretending to fall on with a body of ours ready for a charge, by the sudden out-cry daunted and drove back that strong party, and made way for the Governors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and those with him, which were now dispersed, secure of the victory, and following the chase. Our stragling persuers were gathered together, drew back to the place of the fight, and there expected the charge, choosing rather to make good the victory atchieved upon so great hazard and disadvantage, then venture all by seeking out a fresh and doubtfull Enemy with our few and weary Souldiers. Onely three or foure slain, five or six wounded, amongst whom Collonel <hi>Harley</hi> received a shot in the arme. The successe of this designe cut off the maine strength of the Kings forces in South-wales: and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Countrey from our plundering neighbours on the Welch side. The body of Collonel <hi>Min</hi> was brought to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and vouchsafed an honorable buriall. His death was by his own party much lamented, together with the losse of a brave Regiment that were commanded from <hi>Ireland</hi> to fight here a gainst the justice of that cause, upon which the <hi>Irish</hi> war
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56747:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was held up, and owned by the whole Kingdom. And it hath been observed, that as the <hi>Irish</hi> Pacification was unlucky and reproachfull to the outside of the Kings actions amongst his Protestant party; so the Commanders that came thence were unfortunate in all their designes, and in the end miserable.</p>
            <p>When the Governor had setled his affaires at home in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable security, his desires and aime was to put in for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a more generall service: and pitched upon these two proposals, the one to make a diversion from the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Army then blocked up in the West, the other to keep back Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> stragling forces which then lay between <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi> a little after the great Northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. And these the Prince earnestly desired, that upon this rubbish he might frame an Army for the close of the Summer action.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if possible to endeavour a diversion from the West-parts, the Governor drew towards <hi>Bath</hi> with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse and foot (the Forces lent to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> being in part returned) with a purpose to disturbe the Kings quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and withdraw a part of the maine Army to inable <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll</hi> and <hi>Bath.</hi> On the hils likewise he might expect to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> who fled thither with about three hundred horse presently after the discomsit in the <hi>North.</hi> But within a few dayes upon advertisement of the miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and disaster of the Lord Generals Army, he drew back, and the rather having intelligence that the Prince had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Collonel <hi>Charles Gerrard</hi> out of Wales, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of his own Army to break their way through our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey into the Western parts. These were reported to lie neer <hi>Worcester,</hi> waiting there for a clear passe, and by all means to escape Collonel <hi>Massie.</hi> They were to take their course over <hi>Coltswold</hi> Hils, or by the borders of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> to make into the Forrest of Deaue, and thence over the River at <hi>Aust.</hi> Wherfore the Governors maine businesse was to prevent this this Conjunction, and block up either passage. In his retreat towards <hi>Gloucester,</hi> he fell down before <hi>Berkely</hi> and lodged his men two dayes in the Town, summoned the Castle, and made
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56747:59"/>
shew of an assault; but this was taken up in the way besides the intention of the designe, and though the losse of six or eight men by their own folly gave Collonel <hi>Veale</hi> occasion of boasting, yet for all the pretended great service in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place that was never attempted, he was immediately after cashered that Government by the Princes order. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Collonel <hi>Massie</hi> drew thence, he caused the boats to be fired at <hi>Aust</hi> passage: and intending to passe over <hi>Seaverne</hi> at <hi>Frampton</hi> to meet Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Forces, received an alarme that they were already in <hi>Gosse Lawne,</hi> whereupon our march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brigade hasted to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> where they found that many of those troops under the command of Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> were newly come into <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and that a party of them joyning with Collonel <hi>Lingens</hi> horse had advanced within six miles of the City of spoil and plunder those Parishes that were joyned in one Association to a mutuall defence, and the aid of this Government.</p>
            <p>The Governor persued his designe drew forth towards the <hi>Lawne,</hi> and stopped their course on that side <hi>Seaverne.</hi> Where upon they took their course through <hi>Worcester,</hi> where they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an additionall strength from Collonel <hi>Sandys</hi> his horse, and Sir <hi>William Russels</hi> horse and foot, with all the foot that <hi>Dudly</hi> Castle and those parts could afford them. And now conceiving themselves able both in power and advantage of the march, having (as they supposed) left Collonel <hi>Massie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Seaverne,</hi> and too farre in the Reare to reach them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to break forth, hoping both to passe clear, and relieve <hi>Banbury</hi> in the way. But the Governor being certified of their march, forthwith conveyed his men over <hi>Seaverne</hi> at <hi>Tewkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and recovered the hils as farre as <hi>Stanway,</hi> and got before them, in the meane while gave notice to the Major of the Earle of <hi>Denbighs</hi> horse, that lay neer <hi>Tewkesbury</hi> in <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> who the Jame day brought up two hundred horse to joyn with our party on the hils. Neverthelesse the Governor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing nothing, but that the Enemy was marched to <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford upon Avon,</hi> and so beyond his reach, sent back the Foot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tyred with tedious and continuall marches, and with his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56747:59"/>
horse resolved to joyn with Collonel <hi>Fines</hi> at <hi>Banbury.</hi> But he found at the return of the Scouts, that about five hundred horse neer at that instant got over the River on this fide <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> and made their approach neer his quarters, and that a party of Foot were left at the Bridge to make good the repasse; one half of the Forces in the mean while lying at <hi>Evesham,</hi> and the other neer <hi>Parshowe.</hi> Our men appearing on the hils, the Enemy took the alarme retreated suddenly, and for a while lodged themselves beyond <hi>Worcester.</hi> Their number was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by such as beheld them to be about five and twenty hundred horse, ill armed, and the surviving part of the ruines of the Northern Army. Again to prevent their incursions into the remote parts of the County beyond <hi>Seaverne,</hi> a competent strength of horse and foot were commanded over, and withall to attend the Enemies motion.</p>
            <p>In the midst of this and other designes of consequence at that time depending, the Governor with all the Officers of horse and foot were much distressed for lack of that support, which the necessity of the service did require, and the extreme want of the common Troopers drove them daily away. Every performance in the whole course of this Government was fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much distempers: and though the exigence of the Souldier hath been great in many places, yet the gleanings of other Brigades have been better then our vintage. No Officer had any portion in the Contribution money: no pay for the troops for many moneths together, no allowance for Scout, Spie, or Intelligencer, who observe onely the liberall and open handed, nor the hopes of reward to incourage the Souldiers gallantry: That the indeavours of the Governor in keeping together, and increasing the Forces were nigh lost. Neither was any means allotted to the supply of the necessary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Officers of a marching Brigade. And in the heat of service the nature and terms of the Governors command were disputed, and twas very questionable whether to provide for the attendants of a march: that onely a proportion seemed to be cared for, that might live within the walls of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and nothing to further such action that might restrain, and lessen the strength of the Enemy, preserve the Countrey, and passe

               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56747:61"/>
withall to the relief of remote garrisons. Neverthelesse the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of such a power was required in these parts as might check the Enemy in all his marches and recruits: and this strength far greater then the stint of that constant number which the garrisons took up.</p>
            <p>In this extremity the Governor was constrained to act, and marched on in the pursuit of the Enemy, who kept randevous neer <hi>Hereford</hi> with fourty two troops of horse, resolving to passe the <hi>Severne</hi> at <hi>Aust,</hi> not daring to adventure over the hill Countrey. And to guard the passage, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> sent into the Forrest a commanded party of five hundred horse and foot. These began to fortifie <hi>Beachly</hi> for a lasting guard, a place of extreme difficult approach, being a gut of land running out between <hi>Seaverne</hi> and <hi>Wye,</hi> and the onely commodious passage, from <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and the Western parts, being the maine entercourse of the Kings Army, and a strong reserve for the last exigence. It was high time therefore to crush this designe, and nip the bud of so great hopes. The Governor advanced upon them some foure dayes after they began their fortifications, and had drawn the trench half way from the banks of one River to the other, when the other part was well guarded with an high quick-set hedge (which they lined with Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers) and a ditch within with a fair meadow beyond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had made a re-intrenchment. The strength consisted neer of six hundred horse and foot, which at the first coming on lighted upon a partie of horse from <hi>Chepstow,</hi> took some, and drove the rest into the River: then faced the Enemy within Musket shot that Evening, and so continued the next morning, waiting the opportunitie of an assault, for at high water the place was inaccessible, by reason of their ships which guarded each River with Ordnance, lying levell with the banks, and clearing the face of the approach from <hi>Wye</hi> to <hi>Seaverne.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governor taking the advantage of lowe water drew forth a party for the on-set. These were brought neer the place of entrance, where the Enemy intended a draw-bridge, with order to storme the works which as yet were not finished. Out of the forlorn hope the Governor had selected ten Musketiers to creep along the hedges, and thenceto fall into the very
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56747:61"/>
breach. These gave the first alarme, and caused the Enemy (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the plot) to spend their first shot in vain. And when the first volly was given, ere they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Muskets, the Governor gave the signall by the discharge of a Pistoll: on went the Forlorn-hope, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve following, the Trumpets sounding, and the Drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, run up the Works, rushed in among them, and fell upon the hack, when the whole and each part of the action was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on without interruption, and the Souldiers went up in such a regular march, and so great solemnity, that it seemed more like the pomp of a triumph then the confused face of a fight. Of the Enemy some were killed, and the rest taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, besides some few that recovered the boats, and many of them that took the water were drowned. And to grace the service, it was performed in the full view of a multitude on <hi>Chepstow</hi> side, whilest the great guns plaid from each River which cast beneath the banks by the lowe ebbe did no execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by their noise, and semblance of terror, both raised the Souldier, and conduced to the majesty of the victory.</p>
            <p>This good successe, and the season held forth a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to compasse an other designe at that time in agitation. Some overtures were made by Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Kyrle</hi> of the delivering of <hi>Monmouth</hi> into our hands. Many did urge the present acceptance of the plot, and an hasty performance, and were discontented in that which they called slacknesse in the Governor: when as neither the method of the plot was propounded in the generall (the circumstances being left free) nor the present state of things gave leave to manage the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when the following Army of P: <hi>Rupert</hi> was to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, a work of greater concernment, and more beseeming a publick spirit then this latter: But at that time twas the usuall mistake of particular Associations to confine every enterprise to their own Counties, and divide the Common-wealth into so many petty kingdoms. And in this did Collonel <hi>Massie</hi> deny himself, in spending the latter part of the Summer in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a lesse plausible and appearing service, though of larger concernment. But having now pursued the Princes horse into <hi>Wales,</hi> and destroyed the Enemies project in fortifying <hi>Beachly,</hi>

he quartered with his horse and foot neer <hi>Monmouth</hi> on the Forrest side; and receiving an answer to a message lately sent to Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Kyrle,</hi> propounded unto him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this way. That he would feigne a Post from <hi>Gloucester</hi> side to desire a sudden return with his forces thitherward, to secure that part of the Countrey from the Enemy, which was already fallen out from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and <hi>Berkley:</hi> and this message was to come to his hands at Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> house of <hi>High meadow,</hi> a grand Papist, where it would take wings for its dispatch to <hi>Monmouth,</hi> by which means <hi>Kyrle</hi> commanding the horse might easily draw forth some troop to follow the Rear of our party. Hereupon the Governor feigned a sudden retreat to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and having marched back three miles, lodged his forces in a thicket of the Forrest: &amp; sending his Scouts abroad, prevented the Enemies discovery. In the mean while the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence reaches <hi>Monmouth,</hi> &amp; Leift: Col: <hi>Kyrle</hi> draws out, whom the Governour surprised at midnight in <hi>High meadow house,</hi> with his troop of thirty horse: and with as little noise as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible advanced thence to <hi>Monmouth.</hi> Neverthelesse twas not so deep a silence but the alarme was given by the Cornet of the troop, who escaped the surprisall, and the attempt made the more difficile, if not desperate. The Town took the alarme, stood upon their guard, expecting an Enemy. Notwithstanding this, <hi>Kyrle</hi> with an hundred select horse arrived at the Towns end, confidently came up to the draw-bridge, pretended a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with many prisoners taken, perswaded the guards, and prevailed with Coll: <hi>Holthy</hi> the Governor of the Town by the Officers of the guard, to let down the draw-bridge, which was done but with much jealousie, and a strong guard, &amp; the bridge presently drawn up again: insomuch that the first party were like to be held prisoners in the Town. Our forlorn hope saw that it was time to lay about them, they declare themselves, over-power the guard, and make good the bridge: and in this there wanted not those that kept a strict watch over <hi>Kyrles</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, who acted his part with dexterity and valour. Our body of horse and foot were at hand, had a large entrance, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Town in a moment, and spared the blood of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised Souldiers. But the dark and rainy night fitted the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56747:62"/>
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with the major part of the garrison for an escape over the dry graft. We took one Major, three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and divers inferior Officers, threescore common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, five barrels of powder, and some arms: but the Town it self was the best prize, being the key of <hi>Southwales,</hi> and the onely safe entercourse for the Kings Army between the West, <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Northern parts.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Monmouth</hi> gave a fearful alarme to the whole Countrey, especially to the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> at <hi>Ragland</hi> Castle, who raised the Countrey, and called in Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> horse to their assistance. The <hi>Ragland</hi> Papists made the poore <hi>Welch</hi> believe that we came to put man, woman, &amp; child to the sword, and filled their fancies with as many strange conceits of the Roundheads, as the poore <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of the <hi>English</hi> after their revolt from <hi>Rome,</hi> it being easie to perswade an irrational and stupid people. Forthwith they appear in arms against us. Wherfore two dayes after our entrance, the Governor sent out a small party of Muskettiers, commanded by Capt: <hi>Rochford,</hi> to quash the rising of the Countrey. Our men find out the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous, with a kind of guard defended by Captain <hi>Gainsford,</hi> with his ragged Regiment. These upon the first onset were all put to flight, ran an hundred wayes like a barbarous people, were pursued by our horse, about twenty knocked on the head and sixteen taken prisoners. To revenge this losse, Sir <hi>Will: Blax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with his brigade of horse, joyns with the Countrey Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hands, and the forces from <hi>Ragland,</hi> and <hi>Chepstow,</hi> making (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best relations, five hundred horse, and twelve hundred foot. Of this preparation we were not advertised, till they fell upon one of our horse quarters in a strong house neer <hi>Monmouth,</hi> where we lodged two troops, and by good hap ten Muskettiers to secure the quarters. The house was made good by the resolution of Captain <hi>Bayly,</hi> and Leift: <hi>Page,</hi> till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of the horse had drawn up the troops, &amp; faced the Enemy, whilest the Governor commanded out of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a hundred and fifty Muskettiers. But before our foot could reach the house, their horse drew thence, encountred with a party of ours, &amp; being recharged by Major <hi>Backhowse,</hi> were beaten back to the foot. By thistime our Musketiers were brought up, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56747:63"/>
in the first charge put the Enemy to a confused running retreat, slew seventy, and wounded many, took threescore prisoners. Of the Officers, a Major of horse, and two Captains were slain, one taken, and Sir <hi>William Blaxton</hi> shot in the thigh. But the pursuit had an early stop by a small river which the Enemy passed, &amp; plucked up the bridge: or their foot had been wholly routed and taken. The prisoners that were of the Countrey people the Governor entreated kindly, and after a few dayes sent them home by parcels, and each man with a little note or letter directed to his master, or the severall Parishes, to signifie that the intention of the Parliament, and the present govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not to destroy, or enslave their persons, or take away their livelihoods; but to preserve their lives and fortunes, to open the course of justice, &amp; free them of their heavy burthens under the forces of <hi>Rupert</hi> a <hi>Germane</hi> Prince. At the free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the captives, they began to resent the Governors hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, as before by the slaughter of their men they had felt the force of arms. And the dispersed papers did in part unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the people, and dislodge their fears; our horse marching peaceably, and doing no spoil or violence.</p>
            <p>After the appeasing of the Countrey tumults, the indeavours of the Governor were to reduce that people to a willing, and cordiall obedience. He dispatched many letters of invitation to the gentlemen of the Countrey, and gave assurance to the best affected of his purpose to defend &amp; make good the Town. But all were silent, and not two valuable persons did own the businesse. On the other fide, they did not stir a foot at the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Earl of <hi>Worcester:</hi> and in confidence of the justice of this party they frequented our markets; wheras at our first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they drove away all their cattell, into the remote parts of the county: yet most of the gentlemen fled from their houses. The greatest part of P: <hi>Ruperts</hi> forces lie stil under our arrest in <hi>Wales,</hi> where they decrease and drop away, discontent and burden the Countrey, between whom there arise perpetuall quarrels. And the truth is, even those people whose affections comply with the Kings designe, could never correspond with the Souldier of that faction, with whom there is no dealing for very friends. Insomuch that the generall hatred of the souldier might drive in to the Parliament, a moderate enemy, and such
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56747:63"/>
as breathe a more cool spirit of malignity, when the State shall reach out the hand to clear the way, and make good the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Massie</hi> seems now to have spread the Branches of his government beyond the sap and strength of the root, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme parts grow burdensome to the main body. He had neither horse nor foot to maintain what was gotten, considering the strivings of the Enemy to repossesse themselves of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> For which end the whole power of <hi>Southwales</hi> that is fit for the march under the command of Collonel <hi>Gerrard</hi> are come as far as <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genny, Vske,</hi> and <hi>Ragland.</hi> Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> must bring forth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-peece to the world, and once more assisted with four hundred from <hi>Bristoll,</hi> purchased at a high rate, and added to a hundred of his own men, with all the aid Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> can send, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to fortifie <hi>Beachly.</hi> The noised strength of the Enemy round about did contribute to the designe with all fiercenesse, fince the want of a guard upon this passage did render all <hi>Southwales</hi> of little value. And it highly concerned us to indeavour the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this project, which threatned the ruine of the Forrest, the intercepting of the passage between <hi>Gloucester</hi> and <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and to render that garrison in great part uselesse. The Governor had a hard game to play, alwayes put upon desperate hazards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sufficiencie to accomplish or make good. For the case was questionable whether to desert <hi>Monmouth,</hi> or seek to maintain it, having no competent number for a Town yet unfortified, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally malignant, in an Enemies countrey, at a great distance, and with a difficult passe: but that the wonderfull successe of <hi>Beachly</hi> twice fortunate determined the doubt. The businesse was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deliberation, nothing but a quick dispatch had the shew of safety. <hi>Gerrard</hi> was to be kept from joyning his fortes with these in the Forrest, who when once fortified were not to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out, having all the advantages of Sea and land. And although his Forces hovered about the Countrey, pretending to fall upon <hi>Monmouth,</hi> yet about midnight, <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. one hundred Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were drawn thence with eight troops of our poore horse unto <hi>Clurewall,</hi> expecting there to meet the <hi>Newnham</hi> foot drawn off for this designe, the garrison supplyed in the interim by the Countrey Voluntiers. In the close of the next evening they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached neer the Enemy, where no good presage did favour the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56747:64"/>
busines. The horse failed six houres of the time appointed, whom the constant want of pay, and hands bound up from plunder, made irregular, and disabled the Commander in chief to reward or punish. Himself must manage the designe not by advice onely, but personall action, and act a part in the duty of each inferior Officer. That night we beat up their ambuscades, forced them within their works, and by frequent alarms kept them waking, yet as much as possible from working. The next morning at break of day was the time reserved for a storme: but the foot were all stragling, and could not be gathered up, insomuch that the Governors own troop with no more then fourscore Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers made the onset, and by Gods help performed gallantly. They found the Enemy well prepared, the works followed with dexterity and diligence, with much art and cost on pallisadoes, and breast-works, and the most defective places from <hi>Wye</hi> to <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne</hi> defended with a tall quick-set hedge, &amp; a ditch within, the Pinnaces riding in each River with Ordnance to play upon us, and the line so strongly guarded with hammer Guns, &amp; Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers placed on the Flanks at either end, that it seemed impossible to storme the same by day without apparent great losse; yet was the Governour to wait for lowe water, that the Guns from the ships might not reach us, which happily fell out at the opening of the day; yet were we in the reach of the Ordnance planted on the <hi>Weleh</hi> shore, and equall to our height. He laid holdon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of season, with a small party in a silent march came close to the works; wherupon after the taking of the alarme, when the Enemy had spent many shot, our men forced two or three Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadoes, that some of the foot and the forlorn hope of horse brake in: but finding themselves at a stand between the Pallisadoes and the quick-set hedge lined with Muskettiers, began to face about when there was no looking back, nor passing forwards, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the continuall shot. In this party was the Governor enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who now became the Leader of the Forlorn-hope, and with not a little difficulty forced his own horse over the hedge, fell in among them, was recharged furiously, his head-peece knocked off with the but-end of a Musket, &amp; strangely preserved, till three or foure foot and some horse brake over the hedge after him, then there came up a full body of horse and foot, and by maine force bore down before them a resolved and prepared Enemie,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56747:64"/>
slew thirty, and tooke prisoners a Leiutenant Colonell, one Major, two Captaines, three Leiutenants, three Ensignes, with other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and common Souldiers, to the number of two hundred and twenty. They forced Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> downe the clift into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where a little boate lay to receive him, and convey him thence into the ships, riding within Musket shot of the shore, with many Musqueteers and great shot. Many tooke the water, some whereof were drowned, and others saved themselves by recovering the boates. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> the Patron of this designe, was expected there the next high water, being then upon the river, but extreamely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and crossed in the height of his desire and confidence.</p>
            <p>It was a brave exployte and true victory upon such an eminent disadvantage over a formidable enemy. They were stronger within the Fortifications then sixe times the same number in the open field. The storme that hovered was blowne over, &amp; we calme, and secure in the possession of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> But as for this necke of land so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and famous to the Government of <hi>Gloucester</hi> for two remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable victories: though Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> and the <hi>VVelsh</hi> forces had their eye continually upon it, yet the neglect of the place was no oversight in our Garrison, but caused by the incapacity of the place it selfe, it being impossible to be held by us till we were Masters at Sea, because at every floud the ships on the Seaverne lay levell with the highest ground. Wherefore it was resolved by a Councell of Warre that the buildings should be demolished, and all trees and hedges cut downe. The taking and securing of <hi>Manmouth</hi> was a faire beginning, and almost the possession of halfe <hi>Wales.</hi> But as yet the County became unserviceable to us, and we made loosers by enlarging our bounds.</p>
            <p>The Substance of <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> was expended in maintaining the Garrison foote, and the Horse left wholly unfurnished, yet bounde up from plunder and rapine: neither did we finde that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in the County as was expected and promised: considering which, with our meane forces and slender pay, no progresse could be made in gaining the Countrey, but the time was spent in light skirmishes, and surprizals betweene petty parties on both sides: and we sustained some losse by Colonel <hi>Broughtons</hi> Captaine Leiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant who with fifty souldiers undertooke to garrison a house
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56747:65"/>
neare <hi>Godridge</hi> Castle, neither obvious to releife, nor caring to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify or store the place with victualls. This was done in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours absence without order, disavowed by all, and owned onely by the Captaine himselfe: whose plea was, that he had no support for his men, and was enforced to get his living there. But within a few dayes his house was fired upon him, and he and all his carried prisoners to <hi>Hereford</hi> before releife could reach them.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding our necessitous condition, the Parliament were informed of great multitudes, and a burden of supernumerary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers, and seemed to require out of the superfluity of those parts an assistance more ample then the maine strength of the place. It was hard to take a just and full view at such a distance; and peradventure perpetuall action, and the great things effected here, might multiply the numbers of the Garrison, and represent things in the largest forme. But the voyce of the people gave out that we were kept low by the malice of misinformations: and that the souldiers cry could not be heard, because they were apt to be thought ever craving and querulous. Wherefore at that season there came some particular commands from the Powers above, which did not correspond with the State of our Affaires, or the ground of the <hi>enjoyned</hi> Service. November the tenth Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> received Instructions from the Committee of both Kingdomes to march with all the strength he could make, into the Borders of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi> to prevent the joyning of the <hi>Welsh</hi> forces under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Colonell <hi>Gerrard</hi> with the rest of the Kings Army, or to take advantage of the enemy, or joyne with the Parliaments Army as occasion did offer. This command found him overwhelmed with manifold imployments, and in that instant of time some <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthshire</hi> Gentlemen tendred their assistance to the taking in of <hi>Chepstow</hi> Castle, which the Governour was ready to embrace, (that <hi>Wales</hi> might fall under the power of the Parliament) but with much warinesse, having many irons in the fire. Neverthelesse lying under a greater weight of envie, he resolved to obey the former Orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the progresse and reason of his affaires; wherefore he called off his owne Regiment of horse from about <hi>Monmouth,</hi> where the enemies vigilancie was not little, and the malignity of the towne wondrous great; with the Regiment of horse, he hasted towards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56747:65"/>
               <hi>Eversham,</hi> where the Enemy had arrived before, whose march he could not interrupt or retard since they were eight for one. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this march having drawne a small party out of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> he commanded from <hi>Gloucester</hi> his own company, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the same Regiment to the security of that Garrison, and committed the charge of the Towne in his absence to Major <hi>Throgmorton</hi> then Serjeant Major to Colonell <hi>Harley,</hi> who by Order of Parliament was designed to that Government, but with no Power to command out a Partye upon any designe, having no thought that the forces left there were fit to be imployed upon any service, more then the defence of that place: Besides, he had waved the offers of <hi>Chepstow</hi> till he might gaine an assurance of making good so much ground in an enemies Country; for it was alwayes his desire in ingaging any people to those masters whom he served, to foresee a possibility of continuing that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, least hee might doe them a greater disservice by dashing the resolution of others, who intended the same course, and by grasping beyond his reach take off their inclinations who might be gained in due time. Notwithstanding the Governors expresse Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at the earnest solicitation and promises of some well-affected in the Country, and the vehemencie of others, who thirsted after the glory of some atchievement in the Governors absence, the Major yeelded for the drawing out of a party for <hi>Chepstow,</hi> and stretched his power beyond the knowndiscipline of warre, fearing either the brand of cowardise, or the censure of a man unwilling to doe his Country service, though he declared his judgement against it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advanced towards <hi>Chepstow</hi> with three hundred comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men: having some conceived assurance of gaining the Castle by surrender or onslat.

So remisse were the slender guards, that the Treually was beaten &amp; none tooke the alarme.

Here we had some disputes with the Enemy for two dayes: but those in the Castle having no meanes of a longer subsistence, were inforced to surrender upon quarter, and the freedome of their persons, most of the common souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted,

            <p>The base neglect of the Officers had not the least share in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate losse of <hi>Manmouth,</hi> and daily wants increased the neglect, and weakned the Governours hand in inflicting condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>In the depth of Winter, when each parcell of the Parliaments Army had retired into <hi>London,</hi> or the securer parts of that Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Kings forces were dispersed into the severall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>Cirencester</hi> and the hill Country of <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> was assigned to Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley,</hi> having the Command of three Brigades of foote, and assisted with the Queenes, Prince <hi>Ruperts,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurices,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wilmots</hi> Regiments of Horse with others. His designe was to destroy the Countrey, and live upon the ruines thereof: whose incursions on that side, and the <hi>Bristoll</hi> forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Berkely,</hi> with the <hi>Worcester, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Monmouth</hi> forces on the other side, act something daily to the spoyle of a miserable Countrey, which is left as the Kingdomes forlorne hope, and croucheth daily betweene two burdens. The distressed Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode did seeme to challenge those severall Armyes then in being, which lay rusting in their quarters, to keepe the Associated Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes where no feare was, when they might prevent the ruine of their freinds, and starve the enemy who live upon our fatnesse; when they might hinder the Kings Recruits, disturbe their Winter calmes, and make them fight for the possession and enjoyment of their owne Territoryes. But in the deepe silence of that part of the Kingdome, these parts are borne downe by the maine Bulke of the Kings Army, without the least inablement at present, or the hopes of future releife.</p>
            <p>The enemyes whole burden rests upon this Government. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Massie</hi> placed a Guard at <hi>Lypiat,</hi> commanded a party of Horse and Dragoones to <hi>Strouds</hi> a place most exposed to spoyle: and set Guardes of Horse at severall places of advantage. These Guardes affronted Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> in the stoppe of Contribution
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56747:68"/>
and Plunder, the indignation whereof drew him out of <hi>Cirencester</hi> with foure Regiments of Horse to <hi>Hampton</hi> Roade, where he divided his men, and sent them out three severall wayes to surprze our Horse in their quarters, and plunder the Countrey. Each party fayled of the designe, through the favour of Providence to that well affected people. At each Guardes some few that tooke the Alarme did encounter and stave off the enemyes first violence, till the rest of a few slender troopes were drawne up, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Governours fortunate arrivall from <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> at that instant, charged and overcame a farre greater power, which were also engaged to fight by their heavy plunder, and difficult returne. In the whole about eight or nine slaine, and twenty of the best men of the Queenes and Princes Regiment taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of these one Captaine, and Cornet. The successe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and engage the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Yet after a few dayes Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> marched out of <hi>Cirence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> with a greater power of Horse and Foote, and assaulted the Guard at <hi>Lypiat</hi> in the absence of the Captaine that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there, with instructions from the Governour to draw off, if at any time an Army fell downe. But the House being unforti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed was soone taken, and uncapable of defence, where we lost a Lieutenant, and fifty private Souldiers. At which very time we had lodged three hundred foote within <hi>Muserden</hi> House sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day before, with orders to defend it as a Garrison, who had no knowledge of the enemyes approach till they came within halfe a mile. They remained in the House according to command, but in no defensible posture, neverthelesse expecting the Onset e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment. The surprizall of these men was prevented by a meere accident of the Governours Arrivall, who faced the great Body with no more then sixty Horse, till the Foote were drawne off the Hills.</p>
            <p>That the strength of the Kings Army should lie upon us, was not strange, but that no care was had of a competent provision for a deserving Country, was beyond the conceit of them that beheld our misery. The enemy were strong in horse, and our few divided into so many parcells and swallowed up in the petty guards, that no sooner could we drawe to the rescue of one side, but the forces
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56747:69"/>
on the other hand fell on to the ruine of the poore people. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor knowes no remedy but by daily shifting motions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Ubiquitary: He can attempt no designe, but first in his owne person faceth the Enemy on the contrary side, and fills them with the alarme of his presence; Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> sends Warrants for contributions to the gates of <hi>Gloucester:</hi> The forces from <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> were marched forth to <hi>Canon-Froome</hi> towards <hi>Lidbury;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Governor advanced with a party of horse and foote as farre as <hi>Bosbury</hi> waiting for action, but staied onely for a night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed guards towards <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> in the most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible wayes for the Enemies approach, and fell into one of their quarters, tooke a Captaine and his Cornet, with some common Troopers, and fifteene horses; the Enemy falling downe from <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensester</hi> suddenly fetches home this party.</p>
            <p>Whiles these things happened, the Governour received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Committee of both Kingdoms to attempt <hi>Campden</hi> House, newly Garrisoned by the Kings forces, under Sir <hi>Henry Bard;</hi> and the horse of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> by command of the same Committee were to aide and receive Orders from him in the prosecution of this designe; Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> tooke courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them of the incapacitie of that service for the present, since it could not be done without greater losse to the State then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the action could countervaile; for it was a worke of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance that required our whole strength; and that side of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from which we drew must be given up to destruction, and the Enemy waited no greater advantage then to fasten the Governor upon a tedious enterprize: besides, the intendment was unvailed in all those parts that were required to send aide, and before the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the grand Committee came to his hand, the <hi>London</hi> Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had proclamed it to the world.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> and their Agent, Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> bestirre themselves to patch up the lingring life of the Garrison at <hi>Lidney,</hi> and have procured from Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> at <hi>Worcester</hi> a regement of horse and dragoones, by whose assistance he was confident to have beaten up our small guards in the Forrest, and enlarge his owne quarters; to bring the Forrest once more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his power to the destruction of the people, and the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56747:69"/>
of the Kings Army, and <hi>Bristoll</hi> in speciall, furnishing them with iron, wood &amp; coales. The reminding of so great a mischiefe to the Parliaments Service made the Governour carefull to prevent him, and with an answerable number of horse and foote advanced into the Forrest towards <hi>Lidney,</hi> where Sir <hi>John</hi> and his party got in before him. But after a few small skirmishes, to no valuable losse on either side; the Governour set guards upon all the passages, and imprisoned the Enemy in their own strong hold, and again drew off the maine body in the view of the Garrison. The Enemy observing his march, and supposing the expedition for <hi>Gloucester,</hi> sallied out upon <hi>Sully-</hi>House at a miles distance, and a temporary garrison for the blocking up of <hi>Lidney.</hi> In the instant of time the Governour returnes to this guard, and understanding by the Scouts their neere approach, drew out a forlorne hope, faced and charged them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated alittle, and faced them againe with the exchange of few shot, till the Enemy were brought up so high that they discovered our body. Hereupon they make a sudden retreate, our forlorne hope fall on, and the body followes, turned their horse to flight, who forsooke the foote, and left most of them to our mercy. Here wee tooke one Captaine, with five and twenty common souldiers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving slaine a Captaine, two Leiutenants, and twenty sixe souldiers. The whole action upon those forces from <hi>Worcester</hi> was performed onely with the losse of twenty horses, and a few men sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in their quarters, which neverthelesse cost the Enemy the life of a Major. The passages from <hi>Lidney</hi> are all guarded by our horse to starve those within, and preserve the Forrest from their plunder.</p>
            <p>The Governour having his hands and thoughts filled with these distractions, was yet more perplexed by a fresh and unknowne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of Colonell <hi>Stephans</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire.</hi> It happened that about this time the enemie had garrisoned an old, but repaired Castle at the <hi>Devizes.</hi> And to prevent the spoyle of the Country neere <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Colonell <hi>Deveraux</hi> had erected a garrison at <hi>Rouden</hi> House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Devizes</hi> &amp; <hi>Malmesbury;</hi> and before it was setled or well furnished with Ammunition and Provision, it was set upon, &amp; sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly straightened: Colonell <hi>Stephens</hi> being newly made Governour of <hi>Beverston</hi> Castle, was desired to give aide to the reliefe of the house,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56747:70"/>
and sets upon the service without Colonell <hi>Massies</hi> Order, or knowledge in those his manifold preingagements; wherefore hee advanced to succour the besieged with three Troopes of his owne Regiment, and some <hi>Malmesbury</hi> foote, and though he failed of a parry of horse to be sent from Colonell <hi>Devereux,</hi> undertooke the businesse, broke through the Enemy with much difficulty and hazard, and relieved the house with provision and powder, but fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the concluding part; for when he might with farre lesse diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty have forced the way back through a troubled enemy, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted unwarely and went into the house to refresh himselfe, thereby giving the besiegers time to rally, and to cast up a breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke before the passage, that hee, with the rest, being foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse and foote, were all cooped together, and the poore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged are most desperately straitened by this kinde of reliefe. They without are five hundred strong; the newes runnes to <hi>Gloucester</hi> and calls for helpe, which had not needed, had Colonell <hi>Stephens</hi> imparted the businesse to the Governour, as he ought, and waited to have set the Country in a posture on all sides to face the Enemy, whose inrodes in the meane while were expected from each quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They were already drawne out of <hi>Cirencester, Farfard</hi> and <hi>Leehlade,</hi> and keept their Randevouz on the hills by <hi>Cirencester.</hi> From <hi>Hereford</hi> they stirre with a great strength on that side, and in the Forrest, those that are penned up in <hi>Lidney</hi> strive to breake prison.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this at our first alarme, the Governour sent his owne Captaine Leiutenant, and threescore of the choise horse well appointed, and all that could be spared, unlesse he would ruine the Forrest: and now the worke of releeving this place is made more difficult, the Enemy round about being drawne together with a purpose to swallow them up, or more gladly to fight with Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> at such advantage on the hills and farre from home; yet the best face is put on a bad matter, the threescore horse were to joyne with an hundred horse and dragoones from <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to breake through the Enemy, and these added to the foure hundred and thirty within the house, were conceived able to force a passage through the midst of the first five hundred. But now a greater power are come up to the house, at least three thousand men: Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56747:70"/>
did contribute much to the strength of the besiegers by draining his quarters at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> whom the Governour could not prevent, nor follow, except with the losse of his interest in the Forrest; onely he raised the Country about <hi>Stroudwater,</hi> to face the Garrison of <hi>Cirencester;</hi> our horse advanced up to the first guard, and slew the Sentinell, hoping by this alarme to draw backe the residue from <hi>Rowden</hi> House: And though the weather dispersed and drove backe the Country forces, yet such hopes did revive the businesse, that two rainy nights might be an opportune and active season for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Stephens</hi> to breake through, and then which no greater could be expected. Our second party of horse went on for <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to releeve the besieged at <hi>Rowden,</hi> and by the way releeved <hi>Beverston</hi> Castle with Ammunition, but came too late for the maine designe; for the more potent Enemy had so strongly guarded the passages, that the releefe of the house became desperate, and they within pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently surrendred upon quarter for their lives.</p>
            <p>The Regiments of horse are much broken, and reduced to an inconsiderable number; the Enemy growes strong, and a streame of ill successe flowes in upon us. Colonell <hi>Hopton,</hi> for whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour procured a Commission, upon his promise of raising foure hundred horse and armes at his owne charge, without the helpe of the State or Country, having got together about threescore horse, and forty foote, undertooke with these men to garrison <hi>Castle-dit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> neere <hi>Ledbury</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> having neither order nor directions from the Governour, who conceived the house not to be defended, and required him to desist the enterprize; the order is neglected: But not many dayes after, a party drawne out of <hi>Hereford,</hi> had not lain before it foure and twenty houres, but he, with his forty foot, and twenty horse were taken, and carried prisoners to <hi>Hereford,</hi> ere the Governor could come with releefe, who lighted neverthelesse upon a few straglers in the reare, and tooke thirteene prisoners.</p>
            <p>Meane while Sir <hi>John Winters</hi> releife lyes under the arrest, yet so as we would gladly ridde our hands: for the Guards set round his House to the safety of the Forrest, did alwayes distract our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes. These Horse are impatient of a longer imprisonment, and after a sore distresse breake their way through our quarters into the utmost parts of the Forrest towards <hi>Chepstow,</hi> and joyne with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56747:71"/>
a partie of foote from <hi>Chepstow</hi> landed at <hi>Lancaught,</hi> where they intended to fortify and to make good the Passe over <hi>Wye:</hi> by which meanes they might issue out of <hi>Wales</hi> at their pleasure. The place containes foure hundred acres, having a very straight entrance. Hereupon our severall Guards drew together and summoned the Country to aide and came up to the enemy, who were divided in opinion: one part held it meete to make good the passage, the rest perswaded to draw out into the Field and fight. These latter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and for a while both parties faced each other. Our men drew out a forlorne hope of Foote, the place so requiring, next unto these a forlorne hope of Horse, and the rest were appointed for a reserve. Their Horse violently charged our forlorne hope of Foote, who were ready to give backe when our Horse came in opportunely and played their parts, whereat the foote tooke courage, and fell on all together, and with one charge turned the enemy to flight, that they killed few on the place, but drove them up to the River side, and fell upon the hacke in the pursuite, and so cooped them up that few escaped their hands. About fourescore were slaine, of whom were Colonell <hi>Gamme,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Vangerris;</hi> of the residue some adventured the River to recover the Frigate: many were drowned of whom Colonell <hi>Poore</hi> Governour of <hi>Berkely</hi> Castle; but Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> and his brother with some few besides escaped onely of an hundred men from <hi>Chepstow,</hi> and an hundred and fourescore Horse and Dragoones from <hi>Lidney</hi> House. The remainder fell into our hands, an hundred and twenty taken prisoners, of whom two Leiutenant Colonells, foure Captaines, and divers inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. This was the last blow of three which Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one in the necke of another.</p>
            <p>These things happened about the time of the taking of <hi>Shrewes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which called off the Kings forces from these parts: Sir <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Ashly</hi> marched from <hi>Cirencester,</hi> and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> out of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> to releive his brother <hi>Maurice</hi> neere <hi>Chester.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was imployed in observing the enemyes motion, but with a strength every day more slender, having lost most part of his own troope with some peeces of others by an other miscarriage in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our Armes and Ammunition from <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of some Clothiers Packes of great value, which were taken
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56747:71"/>
betweene <hi>Campden</hi> and <hi>Banbury</hi> through the misguidance of the Officer that commanded.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse he advanced into the neerer parts of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> with two hundred Horse and five hundred foote, to startle the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy or make some diversion, supposing they bent their course to the releife of <hi>Westchester.</hi> Here he found great multitudes of the Countrey people appearing in Armes, but standing on their owne Guard, and declaring themselves for neither side. It was hoped ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse they might be made of good use, and the best affected of them gave Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> that satisfaction as was meete, by whom he understood the condition of their engagements. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Hereford</hi> sending for hay and contribution to his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, was so farre denyed by the Countrey that it came to blowes. The people rising to resist, some few men, and as it was reported women and children were slaine, and some carried prisoners to <hi>Hereford:</hi> also some of the <hi>Hereford</hi> forces were taken by the Countrey men. The next day the Alarum went throughout that side of the County, and some parts of <hi>Worcestershire.</hi> The people gather into a Body, and march to <hi>Hereford.</hi> Here they stayed some dayes with a resolution to have certaine Articles granted by the Governour of that Garrison. The summe of their demaunds were to this effect, that such of theirs as were held prisoners there, should be delivered forthwith; that satisfaction be given to the Country for the losse they sustained by plunder, as also to the wives and children of those that were slaine: that the Countrey might be freed from Contribution and all manner of Payment to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; that since the present forces of <hi>Hereford</hi> were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the County, they forthwith quit the Garrison, and leave it to be kept by the Countrey, who are able to defend the same, and the whole County with lesse charge. These and the like triviall passages did they discover to the world, as it is wont to happen in such popular Commotions. In the meane while severall Posts were dispatched to Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> at <hi>Ledbury,</hi> and letters returned from him to them, and in particular to some Gentlemen, the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and best affected. These letters received by the Country people, tooke well with some; but the generall vote was that they needed not his helpe to gaine <hi>Hereford,</hi> which they conceived; would be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56747:72"/>
delivered up by the Citizens, whom they knew to be of one minde with them. Other messengers came from them with intreaties to march up to <hi>Hereford,</hi> promising concurrence in assaulting the Towne; others would have him fall upon another Garrison at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Froome.</hi> The Governour made answer to the severall Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that he desired to conferre with some of their best intrusted Gentlemen and Yeomen, expecting meete security that either by Protestation or taking the Nationall Covenant they give him an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of their standing with the Parliament, requiring them to cast off the enemy, and receive orders from him, to act nothing of themselves without the consent and approbation of Parliament, without which engagement he could not joyne or act with them. To this they replyed that they held it a thing of evill consequence, and dangerous to declare themselves, and they knew their ability of themselves to performe what they had resolved, intreating him to march backe with his men, giving assurance that they were our friends, but could not declare for either side: this act of theirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a just defence against the unjust proceedings of the Committee and Souldiers of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and to secure the Countrey from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution and quarter. The Governour makes answer to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, That the course they had taken was neither safe nor le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; for it in this confused manner they should gaine <hi>Hereford,</hi> it would doe them little service: unlesse they were able to keepe it from the Kings Army, and be able of themselves to beate them wholly from that side <hi>Seaverne,</hi> that no incursion could be made on their Countrey from any part: that they would distresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without releife, because their illegall way would not be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Parliaments forces: for though they have undertaken the preservation of the Kingdome, yet they can give no protection to any that will not joyne with them in that way which the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Body of the Kingdome thinks fit. For a third party cannot be in <hi>England.</hi> And therefore they have no way of safety or justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this action, but a speedy declaration for the Parliament, from whom they would finde security and protection and after assurance of fidelity, a setling of the Countrey to their owne likings. He gave them likewise to understand, that the charge of the Parliament in maintaining the Souldiers, and of the Countrey in contribution,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56747:72"/>
did thence arise; that the people being disingaged in person might looke to their Husbandry; declaring withall that the disunion of the Country not understanding their interest in the Parliament was the sole cause of the entertayning of Souldiers. For had the whole Kingdome rose in time and expressed themselves of this opinion, that they would stand up as one man against the Popish partie, and enemy of their Countrey: the worke had beene long since done. But their drawing backe put the Parliament upon this way of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Armes upon their stocke and expence, or the Kingdome must needs fall. He minded them likewise that if they lost this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of closing with the Parliament, nothing but destruction would follow; that if they closed with <hi>Hereford,</hi> and composed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, this compliance might last till Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> returne, and then they must looke to pay for this rebellion: but if they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at last to fall in with <hi>Rupert,</hi> it would hasten their bondage, yet givethem no security.</p>
            <p>This kinde of entercourse passed betweene Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> and the Countrey people; meane while he drew backe to <hi>Rosse,</hi> waiting the event of this commotion, but not engaging himselfe amidst a promiscuous and doubtfull multitude. He represented likewise to the Committee of both Kingdomes, what advantage the gaining, and disadvantage the losse of this opportunity might be to the whole worke: that their expressions of their esteeme of himselfe, and his gentle dealing with them were great: that the weaknesse of his forces, cheifely of Horse, was the maine businesse that caused the Major Part to decline his invitation: importuning them if they desired to gaine this partie, as also a leading party to the whole Kingdome, to send a considerable strength of Horse; and if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces saide to be intended, had come to him, when fifteene thousand appeared in Armes before <hi>Hereford,</hi> and of them sixe thousand Musqueteers, and some well mounted, he had gained a full testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of compliance with the Parliament, and drawne them with ease to aide him against Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Army, when they were in the moode, so farre incensed and inraged. And to compleate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, a Recruite for the Regiments of Horse was necessary, and that the Auxiliaries should bring along their meanes of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the sending of strength without money did more wound
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56747:73"/>
then heale us; for the Souldiers challenge their pay or plunder; And as it was hatefull to the Governour, so the State of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey would not permit him to spend his time in gathering contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. But for want of a just and due supply, these men were lost to us and to themselves also, concluding a peace with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and obnoxious and open to the Kings Army.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> marched from <hi>Rosse,</hi> and passed the Seaverne towards <hi>Berkely,</hi> purposing to joyne with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> who was noysed to be come into the Borders of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when the day before some of the <hi>Berkely</hi> forces had issued out towards our Garrison at <hi>Slimbridge:</hi> but ere they could retreate to the Castle, the Garrison forces fell upon them, slewe twelve, wherof one Captain, an <hi>Irish</hi> Rebell, and took twenty five prisoners, whereof two were Captaines and one Leiutenant. The Governour with his party advanced thence towards <hi>Chipping-Sodbury,</hi> where Colonell <hi>Strange</hi> with a party of Horse began to fortify: but upon the notice of our Advance retreated to <hi>Berkely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner had the <hi>Herefordshire</hi> men disbanded, and returned to their owne houses, but Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> falls backe out of <hi>Shropshire,</hi> and comes upon them with his whole Army. The noise of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall doth hasten the Governours returne to <hi>Gloucester:</hi> who drew thence two hundred Horse, and five hundred foote into the Borders of <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> where many of the Countrey people resorted unto him, some with fire weapons, some with others: but the want of strength, especially of Horse, render'd him of little capacity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them. The people having good desires, but daunted with the greatnesse of the enemy, and the slendernesse of our forces, were wholly lost. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was importuned to draw this way, or to send a strong party which might prove of the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Kingdome, when the Princes designe was to lye on that Countrey to recruite his Army with men, horses and money for the Spring action, and the approach of the Parliaments Army; and would not onely bring in the Countrey, and make them firme to their service, but disappoint if not destroy Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Army, at that time the greatest in the Kingdome, being a confluence of the forces of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> Colonell <hi>Gerard,</hi> Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> Lord <hi>Ashly,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale.</hi> These men beare
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56747:73"/>
all before them, take mens Persons, spoyle their Estates, disarme the Countrey, reape the benefit of the late insurrection, and extract mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by force and terrour from the poore people: whose destruction as well as their late rising in Armes is wholly lost to the Parliament, and serve onely to make up the enemies recruite. The Princes impresse men in great abundance in <hi>Hereford, Monmouch, Worcestershire,</hi> raise great summes of money, get good store of Armes: necessity in part casting them upon such ways of violence; and coercive power. And though the prest men were of suspected fidelity, and lesse value, and had often deceived them in the heate of battell: yet they conduced to the sudden forming of an Army when the Kings Affaires grew despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and thrust in with the old Volunteers made up the bulke of a great Body. Thus both the strength and the ruines of the Countrey are left to the enemy, when by the aide of twelve hundred Horse in the beginning of this insurrection, the hopes of the businesse might without vanity promise the Parliament many thousand fighting men of all sorts besides those already in pay.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> the plague of the Forrest once more importuned the releife of <hi>Lidney</hi> House, and obtaines from the Prince about two thousand Horse, and fifteene hundred foot, who breake in to destroy the Countrey and disarme the Inhabitants. The Governour with what strength he can make marched to <hi>Wesbury</hi> and quartered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a mile and a halfe of the enemy, and gave order to the Guards that beset <hi>Lidney,</hi> that the foote be drawne off to the Garrison of <hi>Nast,</hi> and <hi>Highmeadow,</hi> and the Horse repaire to the Randevouze, which was done without losse, when the Forrest was full of the enemy. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served likewise the lower parts neere the river, but for want of horse wherein the enemy did abound, could not without extreame hazard and losse advance to the further parts, where they kept their Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze, and which they laide wast, plundering the houses to the bare walls, driving all the cattell, siezing upon the persons of men, and sending them Captives to <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>Chepstow,</hi> except such as escaped to us by flight, (as many did with their Armes) and some few that saved themselves in Woods and Minepitts. The enemy did not adventure into the lower and neerer places, where our foot lay ready and resolved to undertake theirs if they came on. Our Neighbouring parts of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> runne the like fortune with these in the Forrest, and looke blacke upon this Garrison which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preserve them. The Kings forces returned the second time into
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56747:74"/>
the Forrest; and tooke the gleanings of the former Harvest: yet the neerer parts are still prrserved. The enemy raised themselves to a great power, already reputed sixe thousand horse and foote, and seeme to endeavour Northward, wherefore the Governour intending to helpe the Countrey, by driving up the Reare of their march, or to put in for any service, advanced to <hi>Lidbury</hi> with foure hundred horse and five hundred foot, his whole marching strength, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the addition of two hundred and fifty Horse from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> and <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and with this party attended the enemyes motion. Hither Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> advanced with the best part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of whose approach neither spye nor Scout from the Out-guards made the least discovery, till they came within halfe a mile of the Towne, horse and foote, to surprize or at least to surround us. The Governour instantly commanded the Horse to mount, and drew up the foote, though not in so good order as he might, by reason of the sudden Alarme; and suspecting what he afterwards founde, that the Prince would endeavour to compasse him in, he marched off the foot with all due speed that the enemyes right or left wing might not get before us, which they endeavored by sending one party to the Towns end to keep us in action there, whilst two other parties fetched a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe upon either hand. In the meane while he brought up those few horse, that were not upon the Out-guards to charge the enemy at their first entrance, and placed an Ambuscado of twenty Musqueteeres to make good the retreate. But the businesse was acted so, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in person with the Field Officers and Captaines were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to entertaine the enemy with severall charges, and beare their brunt alone, till the foote had ridde some ground before them. In this part of the skirmish their losse was the greatest for number, of ours only Major <hi>Backehouse</hi> mortally wounded, the Governour, whom the Prince aimed to charge, had his horse wounded under him by two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veroll shots. Our men drew off as was meete, &amp; made good the retreat three or foure miles to the enemyes losse, till they came up to a place of shelter, when hasting to get before the right wing of the enemyes horse, they were put into some confusion. And the Horse having no great desire to fight, neglected the advantage of the place, to stop the pursuit though the Governour endeavoured what he could to engage them. That the enemy fell in among the Reare Guard of the foote, where he lost neare two hundred men taken prisoners: many Country men being taken in to make up the number. This businesse cost them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56747:74"/>
the lives of some gallrnt Officers, and the Prince missed his aime of surprizing Colonell <hi>Massye,</hi> but the Governour supposed the stay of the Princes march an advantage to the Service.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse the Army continued some dayes after, betweene <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi> recruiting dayly, and seeme to put much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Country, whom they cause, not onely to abjure the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but binde over to themselves by solemne oath, swearing in the presence of God; That they beleeve no power of Pope or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can depose the King, and obsolve them from their naturall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Royall Person and Successors, that the two Houses of Parliament without the Kings consent, have no power to make Lawes, or to binde or oblige the subjects by their Ordinances, that they beleeve the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Manchester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saxe,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> together with all such as have already, or shall hereafter take up Armes by Authority, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the members of Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> pretending to fight for King and Parliament, doe thereby become actuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and as such ought with all their adherents and partakers, to be presented and brought to condigne punishment: that they will never beare Armes in their quarrell, but will, if they be thereto called, assist their Soveraine and his Armies in the defence of his Royall Person, Crowne, and Dignity, against all contrary forces to the utmost of their skill and power, and with the hazard of their lives and fortunes; that they will not discover the secresies of his Majesties Army unto the Rebells, nor hold any correspondence with them; and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of theirs against the Kings Army, for the surprizing or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of the Cities of <hi>Hereford</hi> or <hi>Worcester,</hi> or any other of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Forts, they shall truly discover to those whom it shall concern, so soone as it comes to their knowledge. That his Majesties taking up Armes for the causes by himselfe so often declared in Print is justly necessary. That they shall endeavour all they can to hinder popular tumults, risings, randevouzes, meetings, confederacies, and associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, townes, hundreds, and countries, which are not warranted to assemble by his Majesties expresse commission, or by power derived from him by vertue of his Commissions, and in the sense he meanes it, and that they detest from their heart that seditious and traiterous late invented nationall covenant, and protest never to take it. All these particulars they vow and protest sinceerely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve without Equivocation or mentall Reservation. This Pretesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56747:75"/>
was strictly injoyned by the Princes, to be taken by all without exception, in the Counties of <hi>Mounmouth, Glamorgan, Breekno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Princes Army is the maine rest of the Kings Affaires which they strengthen daily by impressing the Countrey, taking in lesser Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, and draining the Garrisons, and a part of <hi>Gorings</hi> Army passed over the Seaverne from <hi>Bristoll</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> and so to <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> After a little stay to perfect the recruite the enemy drew thence, the Infantery and Artillery lay betweene <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Beaudly</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley,</hi> whilest <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> with the horse and some select foote fetch off the King from <hi>Oxford,</hi> assisted also with <hi>Gorings</hi> Horse and Dragoones, who left his Majesty at <hi>Stew</hi> and marched backe over the hills into the West through our Borders.</p>
            <p>The Governour received another dropping by the addition of two Troops from <hi>Newport-Pagnell,</hi> the Auxiliaryes were in all three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty: his owne so few, weake, and ill armed, that he could scarce muster a hundred fighting Horse: and those much disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, observing the rest in good equipage, but themselves in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant action of Souldiers naked and miserable. These are imployed in attending the enemyes march, to preserve the Countrey what they may; yet they disturbe it with frequent Alarmes, and sometims beate up the lesser partyes, and upon sundry attempts tooke one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell, divers Captaines, with inferiour Officers and souldiers.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Winter</hi> despairing of longer subsistance and livelyhoode, deserted and fired his house at <hi>Lidney,</hi> having first spoyled the Forrest and so before hand with revenge. By this time the Counties round about are cleared of the Kings Army, and Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> received a larger supply of Horse from the remainder of Colonell <hi>Bher</hi> and <hi>D'albeirs</hi> Regiments commanded by Major <hi>Buller:</hi> and thereby ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to undertake some important Service. <hi>Evesham</hi> was beheld as the most opportune and of greatest concernment in distressing <hi>Wor cester,</hi> and establishing the Committee by Order of Parliament for that County. Wherefore the Governour drew before it with five hundred foote from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and two hundred from <hi>Warwicke,</hi> who belonged to the <hi>Worcester</hi> Committee, with a strong able Brigade of Horse, and in the name of the King and Parliament summoned Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56747:75"/>
               <hi>Robert Legge</hi> Governour of the towne, to make a speedy surrender of the Garrison with all Persons, Armes, Ammunition and Provision, which he there held against the justice of them both, or upon refusall to expect such justice as fire and sword would inflict. And to this he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a speedy answer. Colenell <hi>Legge</hi> sent backe the Summons with this answer. You are hereby answered in the name of his Majesty, that this garrison which I am intrusted to keep, I will defend so long as I can with the men armes and ammunition therein, being nothing terrified by your summons. I perceave you are a stranger to our strength and resolution, further treaties will be troublesome.</p>
            <p>Upon this returne the Governour prepared the designe, and ordered to each Officer his charge in the storme. The assault was to be made on each part of the towne. The side that lookes towards <hi>Worcester</hi> was to be stormed in five places with one place at the bridge on the other side of the river. The commanded parties of the foote were lead on by the severall Captaines, and seconded by the Horse devided into three Bodies. After the disposition of the designe, and the night spent in Alarmes, the Signall was given a little after breake of day, when both horse and foote fell on together with life and heate in a furious assault, broke up the Pallisadoes, filled the grafts with faggots, and other preparations, made sundry passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, recovered the workes, and stood firme on the Parapet, whilest the Musqueteers from within played furiously. The foot having recovered the shelter of the ditch beate off the enemy, got up by scaling ladders, stood on the breast workes, and some entred but were againe driven up by the Horse to the top of the workes, where they stood firme and fired, but after a while ready to be beaten off by the violent charge of the enemies horse, till a party of our horse on that fide drawing up close, and having a small breach made for their entrance, fell in and beate off the enemy from that bul warke; whilest another party made an entrance neare the Bridge. And now they tumble over the works on all sides: and charge up both horse and foote with equall gallantry, bore downe the enemy and mastered the Garrison. The conflict was hot and difficult for almost an houre, and maintained by the enemy with much resolution. The lives of the Officers and Souldiers were wonderfully preserved in that violent storme, when each man was exposed to the hazard of the most daring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Of the Officers two onely wounded, and ten private souldiers slaine, and twelve of the enemy. The prisoners taken in the garrison were five hundred and fifty on the list, of whom two Colonells one Major, thirteene Captaines, with other Officers and Gentlemen reformadoes to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56747:76"/>
the number of seventy. Many Gentlemen and Officers that charged with the Governour, acted their parts with courage, and spurd on the valour of the souldiers. The reserve of foot devided into three bodies, to second the assaylants performed as became resolved men, and the whole action was compleate according to the Idea &amp; Platforme of the designe. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening before to keep off an approaching enemy from <hi>Worcester,</hi> about a hundred horse were drawne out, and kept guard five miles from <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> faced a party of horse from <hi>Worcester,</hi> whose hasty and distracted retreat gave such an alarme to the whole City, that they fired foure peece of Ordnance before day, and alarmed the Countrey round about, when the Conquest was already secured, and the Parliament Masters of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This performance was the concluding honour of Colonell <hi>Massies</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, after his remove from the present command was resolved by both Houses of Parliament, when the desires of promoving the publike service made him to hazard the fame of his former atchievements by the doubtfull issue of the last action.</p>
            <p>Some dayes before hee had an honourable invitation from the Westerne Gentlemen, and the same day that he entred <hi>Evesham,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Commission from the Lords and Commons to leade an Army in the West: The Parliaments command found the Governour absolutely free in affection and choice, willing to comply with their pleasures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther longing to stay, nor eager of a change, but in any place ready to spend his blood in the Kingdomes Cause, if he might not spend it in vaine. Neverthelesse the City and County of <hi>Gloucester</hi> did much resent it, and something repine that their Governour should be snatched from such a people as had done much, and suffered much in their fidelity and resolution without president (considering the many assaults) that had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their lives and fortunes in preserving this City and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein, that had borne so much in the firing of the Suburbs, in the burning of many houses neere the towne, some by the Enemies malice, and some by themselves for safety, and the pressures of the Country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both Armies. They cast up the consequence and concernment of the place, being the Center, Garden and Granary of the Kingdome, the Blocke-house to the river of <hi>Severne,</hi> and a barre to all passages betweene <hi>Worcester, Bristoll,</hi> and the Sea, the stop of entercourse betweene <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> the Key to open the passage upon the <hi>Welsh</hi> and their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and the locke and barre to keepe-out their incursions: the onely refuge and safety for the Parliament party and friends in that part of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56747:76"/>
Kingdome, and the Enemies sole hinderance from the command of the whole West. Besides, this they had strong desires of retaining their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour having so long experience of his judgement to foresee dangers, and care to prevent them, of his readinesse to issue out for offence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon each incursion, of his indefatigable industry in taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all oportunities to weaken rhe Enemy, and happy successe in all enterprizes, of his disposition and comportment, by which he cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the well-affected, ratisfied and confirmed the indifferent, reduced the very malignant: and by himselfe engaged the Country to armes, and governed the souldiers from mutiny, rapine, and plunder, or other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Garrison or Country. To all which they added an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prejudice against any stranger, though in himselfe able and faithfull, considering the many by-past plots, and the Enemies implacable malice who breath out threatnings daily. Such was the sense of the people uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally. And the Major and Aldermen with the whole City <hi>Nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Contradicente</hi> did so farre honour themselves in vindicating Colonell <hi>Massie,</hi> as to petition both Houses of Parliament for his continuance in the Government, representing in expresse termes his noble disposition, constant and unwearied paines, blest by God with extraordinary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and his maine influence on the hearts of the people in generall, most of them being by him ingaged in armes for the Parlinment, and upon the whole so idiery, who were kept together to serve in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, chiefely by the love and respect they beare to him. And this they acknowledged not with an intention of prescribing rules to the State, but out of their care and zeale to the common Cause. They likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of <hi>London,</hi> upon the mutuall bonds of former engagement, in defending and raising the late Siege of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to represent unto the Parliament the sense of their feares, and the Countries distraction at the removall of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Massie:</hi> complaining of the sinister ends of some few persons who brought in a crosse Petition, with Articles in the name of the County of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which no part of the County did ever acknowledge, and of which no corner thereof was conscious.</p>
            <p>The House of Commons would not accept the charge against Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Massie,</hi> and that they might deale in the businesse without partiality, refused also the Countries Petition. Neverthelesse the Speaker was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the name of the House, by way of answer to their requests, to let them know, that they were very sensible of the dangers that might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an alteration in that kinde, but that the Governour provided to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56747:77"/>
succeed might speedily give such assurance against such dangers, that there will be no cause for them to continue, much lesse to encrease their feares. That the House was confident that their constant readinesse to comply with the publike, would also in this particular of Colonell <hi>Massies</hi> removall make them rest content in the resolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that matter. Though <hi>Gloucester</hi> be a place they prize, and care for as much as any in the Kingdome, yet for the present it was thought of greater necessitie to imploy him in that command of the Westerne Forces and they cannor doubt of the concurrence and submission of those well-affected parts in whatsoever is judged to be of publike ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it was ordered the third of <hi>June,</hi> 1645 by the Lords and Commons, that Master <hi>Luke Nurse</hi> Major of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> Alderman <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Blunt,</hi> or any two of them shall have the command of the Garrison of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and of the Forces and Garrison in <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stershire,</hi> in as ample manner as Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> had till the appointed Governour come downe to his charge there, or the Houses take other order.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Massie</hi> in the meane while labours to disingage the affections of the Countrey, and to take off discontents and mutiny, and beseeches the Parliament to send downe the succeeding Governour that he might seeke to interest him in the hearts of the people, whom he never desired to indeare unto himselfe, but to those Masters whom he served, which was a full testimony of a true Servant to the State, upon the sole termes of Conscience and Honour.</p>
