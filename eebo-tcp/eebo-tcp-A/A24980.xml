            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E arrived here on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>May, Old ſtile,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> His Majeſties Envoy Extraordinary; and Mr. <hi>King,</hi> Commiſſioner for the Inveſtiture. The Elector came hither Poſt on the <hi>Saturday</hi> thereafter, from <hi>Coningsberg.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> following, being the ſecond of <hi>June,</hi> the Commiſſioners had a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; at which they Delivered the Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Letters, and Book of Statutes, after which they put on the Elector the <hi>Ribbon-Garter</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29960:5"/>
and <hi>George.</hi>—They had likewiſe a Private Audience of Her Electoral Highneſs, of the Princeſs Electreſs, and of the <hi>Margraff,</hi> and Two other Princes, the Elector's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This they did for the diſpatch, and that they might have the freedom of going to Court, and ſeeing the adjuſting of the States, and the putting of all other things in Order, againſt the time of the Solemn Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture. But they could not have a Publick Audience, nor could the Ceremony of Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture be performed, till the Elector's Court, and his Coaches and Horſes ſhould arrive; which hapned on <hi>Thurſday</hi> night. In the mean time all other things were made ready, and the next day, being <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed both for the Publick Audience, and the Ceremony of Inveſtiture. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were willing that theſe Two ſhould be joined together, that no time might be loſt, nor the Elector's Journey to the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſtopt ſo much as one moment, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Solemnity.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> morning the Baron of <hi>Shiarm,</hi> the eldeſt Privy-Councellor, or Miniſter of State, (as they ſpeak here) came from Court, accompanied with a great many other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29960:5"/>
Gentlemen, and particularly with Monſieur <hi>Beſcat,</hi> (whoſe Office it was to regulate the Ceremony) all in Rich Cloaths, with Six of the Elector's Coaches, and Six Horſes in each of them, and carried the Commiſſioners and their Retinue to Court; Twenty four <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants,</hi> or Horſe-Guards, walking along all the way, on both ſides of the Coaches: Not to mention a great many of the Elector's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that did alſo attend them. At Court they were received with Double Guards, and Colours diſplayed; Twenty four Trumpets, and two pair of Kettle-Drums ſounding all the while. The Commiſſioners Coach paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Inner-Court of the Caſtle; at the foot of the Stairs the Commiſſioners were received by the Grand Marſhal, with his Silver Staff of Office: At the head of the Stairs they were met by the Elector's Great Chamberlain, the Count of <hi>Denherff,</hi> and ſo were conducted to the Elector's Chamber; all the Rooms, as they paſs'd along, being full of the Nobility and Gentry of the Court, and the <hi>Trebants</hi> making the Guard up the ſtairs, and along the Two firſt Rooms.</p>
            <p>From the Elector's Apartment, they went to an Audience of the Electrice, where were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29960:6"/>
all the Princes and Princeſſes of the Family, and the Ladies of the Court, richly dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Then they were conducted to the Rooms where the Robes of the Order were before placed, where all things being in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, they went to another Room near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining, in which his Electoral Highneſs was, and thence began the Proceſſion to the Great Hall, which is one of the nobleſt Rooms that is to be ſeen any-where, being above 100 foot long, and above 50 foot broad, adorn'd all about with the Marble Statues of the Electors of the Family, and the Roof richly painted. They went in this order: firſt, The Nobility and Officers of the Court in great number; The Grand Marſhal and Marſhal with their Silver Staves of Office, being the laſt of them. Next came two belonging to the Commiſſioners, one of them carrying the King's Commiſſion, and the other the Cap and Feather; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Mr. <hi>Gregory King</hi> in the Mantle of the Kings at Arms, bearing the Habit and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Order on a Velvet Cuſhion. Next came Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> alone; and in the laſt place his Electoral Highneſs, attended by the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Grand Chamberlain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29960:6"/>Thus they went through a long Gallery (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Trabants</hi> on each ſide) into the Hall, and ſo into the Rails which divided the upper end of the Hall, that was raiſed four Steps, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the due Reverences to the Sovereign's State; the Electrice, with the Princeſſes and Princes Ladies, and publick Miniſters, having before taken their places within the Rails.</p>
            <p>The Elector being placed under his State, and the Robes being laid on a Table near his Highneſs, the two Commiſſioners ſeated themſelves in two armed Chairs, and the Trumpets and Muſick ceaſing, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> made a Diſcourſe in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Elector to ſtand, becauſe of an hurt in his Leg, the Expedient fallen upon was this; That inſtead of four Diſcourſes (as the Cuſtom is) two by one of the Commiſſioners, and two by one belonging to the Elector; that one only ſhould be made by Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> in the beginning, and another at the end of the Ceremony by Monſieur <hi>Fulks,</hi> one of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Miniſters of State. And therefore Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> having put his two Diſcourſes into one, and having only told the ſubſtance of them in Engliſh, he preſented a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>High Dutch</hi> to the Elector, which he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29960:7"/>
ordered his Chief Secretary to read; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and the Commiſſioners having ſtood du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pronouncing of the Engliſh, but ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when the Dutch Copy was read. Then they preſented the King's Commiſſion to the Elector, which he gave to a Miniſter of State, who delivered it to the Secretary to be read, the Elector and all others ſtanding up; which being again delivered to the Elector, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave it to Mr. <hi>King;</hi> After which, the Commiſſioners having taken off his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Coat, Sword, Belt, Ribbon-George and Garter, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> inveſted the Elector with the Diamond-Garter, the Surcoat, the Sword and Belt, the great Mantle, the Hood, and at laſt the great Collar and George, in the order as they were delivered to him by Mr. <hi>King;</hi> who pronounced in Latin the uſual Forms of Admonitions upon Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s putting on the Elector each Enſign. Then they preſented to his Electoral Highneſs the Book of Statutes under the Great Seal of the Order, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them Letters certifying his reception of the Order, and containing an Engagement to obſerve the Statutes with the uſual Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe Letters had already his Sign and Seal at them, yet his Electoral Highneſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29960:7"/>
had a Pen given him, and he made a ſhew of writing his Name.</p>
            <p>Next they preſented him with the Cap and Feather, which his Electoral Highneſs had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Diamonds to the value of above <hi>50000l.</hi> one of the Stones coſt above <hi>10000l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>King</hi> did congratulate his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſs, and proclaimed the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns and New-Knights Titles, upon which the Trumpets ſounded, and the Drums beat, and Muſick play'd.</p>
            <p>This being over; Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> did alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Highneſs in a ſhort Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then Monſieur <hi>Fulks</hi> made an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Speech to the praiſe of the Soveraign and the Order. This Speech was in <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> that it might be underſtood by the whole Aſſembly; and a Copy of it being given to Mr. <hi>Stepney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Secretary, he read it publickly, the Elector and Commiſſioners ſitting all the while that Monſieur <hi>Fulks</hi> ſpoke, and that the Copy was read. Then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Stars or Glories, and the Ribbon of the Order; and returning to their Chairs, the Drums beat, the Trumpets ſounded, and the Cannon round the Town was thrice diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Then the Elector and Commiſſioners
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29960:8"/>
returned in proceſſion as they came, and Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Norton</hi>'s Grandſon, had the honour to carry the Elector's Train.</p>
            <p>A little after this, they came back to the Hall again to dinner, where his Electoral Highneſs and the two Commiſſioners only did ſit at the Table, his Highneſs being in the Robes, and the Court attending: The Elector began firſt the King's Health; 2dly, the Queen's; 3dly, the Knights of the Order; 4thly, Proſperity to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; 5thly, Succeſs to the Campaign. Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> began firſt the Elector's Heath; 2dly, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectrices; 3dly, the Electoral Families; the Elector and Commiſſioners ſtood up, and the Guns were diſcharged at every Glaſs. After Dinner the Commiſſioners were carried home in the ſame manner as they were brought in the morning; at night they returned to Court in two Coaches with ſix Horſes, and ſupp'd with the Elector, the Electrice, and the Princeſs, where many of the ſame Healths were drunk again with the ſame Ceremony of firing, and ſtanding up.</p>
            <p>After Supper the Fire-works began, and were much admired by every one, conſidering they had only three days to prepare them:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29960:8"/>
There were many Rockets of all ſorts, and four great Fire-works of 40 or 50 foot high, the chief burnt blew, and was compoſed of the repreſentation of a Garter, having within it theſe four Letters, <hi>V. W. M.

               <p>NOthing excites in men the deſire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo much as ſignal and laſting marks of Honour. For to Noble and Generous Minds, Honour is certainly the greateſt Reward; and ſuch marks are the moſt acceptable parts of it, to wit, a publick acknowledgment that men deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Marks, the moſt eminent have been appropriated to Chevalry. Religion ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Therefore Military Glory, as moſt neceſſary, hath been preſerr'd to all others; beſides, it is acquired with greater danger, and is founded on nobler Paſſions.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all incitements to it, nothing hath proved ſo effectual as the Inſtitution of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Knights Companions and Brethren.</p>
               <p>Such Orders do engage Princes by the ſtricteſt Ties of Honour, to give in their own Perſons an Example of Military Virtue, as alſo the higheſt Incouragement imaginable to follow it: For by theſe Fraternities they deſcend from their Greatneſs, and conſent that brave and gallant Men ſhould be brought into a ſort of Equality with themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:29960:9"/>Amongſt Military Orders, there are none that can diſpute either Antiquity or Dignity with that of the Garter; which may indeed be called the Mother Order; For the other great Orders have ſprung out of this Root, being formed upon the Model of it.</p>
               <p>Such Inſtitutions, like other things of the ſame nature, in their firſt conceptions uſe to be imperfect, and calculated for receiving the Reformations that time only brings: But the Rules of this Order were from the beginning ſo well digeſted, that they have admitted of few or no material Changes.</p>
               <p>To the Antiquity and Wiſdom of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I may add the Chaſtity of the Order: The Knigths have at no time exceeded the firſt foundation of Twenty ſix, contrary to the fate of other Orders; of which none have ſupported their Dignity as this hath done, conſidering jointly the ſmall number, and ſingular eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe that have been of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety ſeven only. And yet amongſt theſe, there have been Eight Emperors (of whom two, <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. went to <hi>England</hi> and received it there, ſo much did they value the Honour of being of it;) Forty five Kings, including thoſe of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:29960:10"/>
and above Sixty Princes, for the moſt part So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns; Not to mention that the others ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſerving to be Princes, were therefore by the Order in a manner made ſuch.</p>
               <p>The Qualities of <hi>Edward</hi> III. who founded this Order, gave a peculiar Luſtre to it; He was the Greateſt and Braveſt Prince of His Time, in the opinion of all others, as well as of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who firſt made Him Vicar-General of the Empire, and afterwards of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Him the Imperial Diadem.</p>
               <p>He claimed the Crown of <hi>France</hi> as his Juſt and Lawful Inheritance, and ſtudied by the Inſtitution of this Order, to engage the moſt Martial Spirits of the Age, in his Quarrel. It was with his Garter that he gave the Signal at the Battel of <hi>Creſſy;</hi> remembring, it ſeems, that which was reported of one of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Iſt,</hi> That he had upon a like occaſion, with great Succeſs, made uſe of a Garter. In this Battel the whole Power of <hi>France</hi> fell before Him; upon which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury he made the Garter the chief ſign of the Order. <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Ist,</hi> is alſo ſaid upon ſuch an account to have had the ſame deſign. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Garter is the Symbol and Badg of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore moſt proper to ſignifie theſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29960:10"/>
Bonds of Amity and Affection into which all the Companions were to reckon themſelves knit.</p>
               <p>He delighted much in Devices, and choſe for the Device of the Order, theſe words, <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y Penſe;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh, May he be aſhamed that thinks ill</hi> (or does not approve) <hi>of it.</hi> That is, either of the Order it ſelf, or of his Title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which gave occaſion to the Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>He made <hi>Blew</hi> the chief Colour, that being the Colour of the Field of the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> which, with the Title he had about that time aſſumed to himſelf, his Succeſſors have ever ſince uſed: Beſides, <hi>Blew</hi> denotes the Sublime and Celeſtial Temper of thoſe who were to be of the Order. The Pilgrims that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> brought over ſuch an account of St. <hi>George</hi> (then the <hi>Chriſtian Mars</hi>) particularly of his Tutelary care of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that War, that according to the Perſuaſions of thoſe Times, he made him the Patron of the Order, as well as of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He wiſely conſidered that other Sovereign Princes might think it a leſſening of them, to come into an Order ſubject to the Laws and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29960:11"/>
Government of <hi>England;</hi> therefore he intirely ſeparated its Concerns, and made it a diſtinct Body with Seals and Officers, and Statutes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it; over which the Seals and Laws of <hi>England</hi> have no ſort of Authority.</p>
               <p>This is the Order, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſo deſervedly famous over all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> theſe Three hundred and forty Years, of which we have now the Honor, in the Name of the King our Maſter, to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Your Electoral Highneſs the Enſigns. The ſame Order which His Highneſs, Your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Father, deſired ſo much, and received as a great Honour done Him, and to which he did great Honour: He wore it in a time of Action, when the Fate not only of the <hi>North,</hi> but of the whole Empire; nay, I may add, of all <hi>Europe,</hi> turned according to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that He took, and which is more, turned often with the approbation of all good men. It was thus that he run His Career, which he finiſhed with an happineſs that might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the obtaining of the Prize,</hi> if that were to be done here; For he being full of Honour and Years, in Peace and quiet, Belov'd and Eſteem'd by the better part of Mankind, died; leaving behind him the only Two Things to be left, a Great and Good Name, and a Glorious Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:29960:11"/>It is alſo the ſame Garter, as well as the ſame Order, with which we are to inveſt your Highneſs. This I ſhould call a happy <hi>Omen,</hi> that the Order is ſtill to receive the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: But your Highneſs hath not left the World to Divination and Conjecture; you have begun your Regence in a way worthy of the Son of ſuch a Father, and already given Mankind real Inſtances of that which they may expect: And now this day you are to put the Order in poſſeſſion of the Honour which you have, as it were, advanced to it, and to which the Order hath a Natural Claim, your Highneſs having acquired the ſame, as the Founder did his, by defeating the ancient Enemies of both Nations. For this Reaſon, I ſuppoſe, the King, my Maſter, as well as for doing your Highneſs greater Honour, hath ſent you a Sword, amongſt the Enſigns of the Order, which hitherto was never done to any other.</p>
               <p>Sir, Nothing is more evident then, that this Society was inſtituted for carrying on a War with <hi>France,</hi> in which War the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the Princes of <hi>Brandenburg, Bavaria, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and many others, were engaged by a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29960:12"/>
Confederacy with the Founder of this Order, as your Highneſs, and others, their Succeſſors, are now with the preſent Soveraign of it. It ſeems in all Ages it hath been the Wiſdom of Great Princes to have no other thing to do with that Crown. Sure that which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Age, doth not alter the Caſe; nay, the preſent Confederacy is a Demonſtration, that it is the Senſe of Mankind, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick quiet can be no longer ſecured by the Faith of Treaties; and therefore, that a firm Peace is only to be obtained by a thorough War: For Men that having enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Violence, are fallen in love with it, will love on till they loſe by it, then it will be ſeaſonable to truſt to Treaties, the incapacity ſuch Men ſhall be in to break them, will be ſurety for their keeping them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> deſigned a Conqueſt, and ſucceeded in it: But there is here place for yet a more Noble Deſign, that of a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Work of an <hi>Hero</hi> is not to mind his own Buſineſs only, much leſs to do hurt, to plunder the World with <hi>Alexander,</hi> or ruine his own Country with <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but to do good chiefly to others; to chain up the Diſturbers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29960:12"/>
of the Publick Peace, to ſet Bounds to Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Power, and the Will of Man; <hi>and ſo to deſerve the Bleſſings of thoſe that were ready to periſh. All this the King, my Maſter, hath done, by redeeming his own Country from Ruine, and other Countries from the danger of it,</hi> in ſuffering them to become his own: <hi>Thus endeavouring every where to ſtem the Inundations of the preſent Times, as his Anceſtors did thoſe of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this, not only the Example of the Soveraign invites thoſe of the Order, but the Order it ſelf, in a particular manner, engages them, <hi>Pugnare pro jure &amp; tuitione oppreſſorum &amp; indigentium,</hi> To fight for the relief of the Poor and the oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>This, Reaſon; Humanity, common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and Intereſt too, requires of all Men, much more of Princes, that are to act as God's Vicegerents, who Glories in nothing oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than in his firm purpoſes to avenge and protect Widows and Orphans, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Innocent, though Unfortunate part of Mankind, to wit, by commanding all thoſe that have power to do it, to puniſh their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:29960:13"/>Thus it is here, That a Capacity to do good, not only gives a Title to it, but makes the doing of it a Duty. It is ſtrange, That among Chriſtians in all Times there ſhould have been ſome who doubted of this, and have had narrower Thoughts of Heroical Enterprizes than either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> had; nay, of whom ſome have believ'd all War to be unlawful, ſince the Deſign of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was to exalt our Natures to a higher and ſublimer pitch of Perfection, and not to ſtifle and undo, with ſpecious pretences, that which is moſt Commendable in them, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Ties we may have to do one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other good.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> of old had ſo Noble an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Performances, that they imputed them to Inſpiration; they thought, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary Aſſiſtances, Men had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goodneſs nor Largeneſs of Soul ſufficient for them.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſeveral among them endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus to defend the Irregularities that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did accompany ſuch Actions, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an expreſs Order from God, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to juſtifie them. Yet Rules and Laws are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29960:13"/>
means for obtaining the ends which they relate to, and in that relation cannot be too well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but they are not the ends themſelves which muſt ſtill be purſued, tho in another way, if the ordinary way fails. No doubt the Letter of the Law, that upon great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons oppoſes it ſelf to the publick Safety, which is intended by all Laws, muſt needs be the Letter that kills. This thoſe high Pretenders came at laſt to underſtand (and to fight even on their <hi>Sabbaths</hi>) tho their Laws were given them by God; and that it was their humour to ſwallow Camels, and ſtrain at Gnats; to let go the Subſtance for the Law, and periſh in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Letter of it. The true ſtanding Character in all Ages and Nations, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Fate too, of Weak, and Warm, and Obſtinate (tho often Well-meaning) Men.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> are much more in the right, who aſcribe great Events more particularly to God, becauſe of that which is ſingular (as well as of his Concern) in them. Thus they would, no doubt, judge of the late Revolution in <hi>Britain,</hi> where we have an Illuſtrious Example of ſuch ſorts of Events. In which the concurrence of great Dangers, of an unexpected Opportunity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29960:14"/>
to be delivered from them; of the Capacity and Circumſtances of the Deliverer, as if they had been given for this End; of the evident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation of thoſe whoſe Intereſt (and in whoſe Power) it was to have prevented it; of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of meer Accidents previous and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to it, which by Humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could neither have been foreſeen nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: In a word, of a Chain and Coincidency of various, and often, in appearance Croſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; yet in effect, ſo well agreeing with the Methods reſolved on, that Divine Goodneſs and Humane Prudence ſeem to have had a Correſpendence. All this, with the ſudden va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Difficulties that had appear'd, in a manner inſuperable, and a Succeſs worthy of the Care of Providence (ſuch as Hiſtory cannot parallel), without Blood, Danger, or Diſorder; So that the Publick Peace and Quiet ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not interrupted than reſtored; as if no change had hapned, except in our Hearts and Thoughts. All this I ſay, does compleat an Event ſo much above the ordinary courſe of things, that whoever believes, that God does at all concern himſelf in Humane Affairs (much more ſuch as believe, that the Hairs of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29960:14"/>
our Heads are numbred), muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this whole buſineſs was (to ſpeak ſo) laid and concerted by him. <hi>Sed praeſtat de Carthagine, ut aiunt, ſilere quam pauca dicere.</hi> And therefore to return to my Subject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> went yet further in doing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Authors of ſuch great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; They thought they could not do too much to encourage Men to venture upon them: And therefore upon ſuch accounts they Deified their <hi>Hero</hi>'s; Men ſeemed to them in the performance ſo like their Gods, that they could not abſtain from Honouring the Copies with the Names of the Originals. The <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> conſidered the Publick Good that was done; for as their <hi>Hero</hi>'s became their Gods for chaſtiſing Oppreſſors, in their Opinion the Enemies of Mankind, ſo others became their <hi>Hero</hi>'s for deſtroying Monſtrous Beaſts of the ſame Temper, if we may not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as no doubt we may, that the Poets, the Hiſtorians of thoſe Times, meant Men (and to them gave the other borrowed Name, as more proper than their own) whoſe Souls, by Succeſs in their Paſſions, were become as Monſtrous as they deſcrib'd the Shapes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29960:15"/>
and Voracity of thoſe Beaſts to have been.</p>
               <p>Sir, How Great and Noble Thoughts would thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> have of the preſent Undertaking in which the King, my Maſter, your Electoral Highneſs, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Princes are engag'd? An Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch as Humane Nature requires, where Honour, and Duty, and Intereſt go hand in hand together: And the moſt neceſſary thing to be done, is the greateſt and beſt thing that can be done.</p>
               <p>In particular, it is an Undertaking that will tranſmit your Highneſs Name Glorious to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: for you firſt gave Life and Motion to it, by ſaving the Town of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and that whole Electorat, by taking <hi>Keiſerſwert, Rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and <hi>Bonn;</hi> by routing the Forces ſent to aſſiſt them, and ſo delivering the <hi>Lower Rhine</hi> from the Chains that in time muſt have prov'd thoſe of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Sir, You have thus out-done the Enemy in Diligence, their moſt Commendable Quality, if it were well imploy'd: You have overcome them where they themſelves, and others too, think them moſt invincible, behind Walls: You
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29960:15"/>
have defeated their Troops, neither by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor Surprize; Advantages are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but it is greater not to ſtand in need of them.</p>
               <p>Thus your Highneſs hath begun the War, where it muſt end with Victory, and taken to your ſelf a ſhare in it ſuitable to the Dignity of your Family, and the Importance of the Conjuncture, which gave your Highneſs the Opportunity to Signalize the beginnings of your Regence by doing the Publick ſuch Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Services; as if Providence, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Integrity of your Intentions, took care, that no ſooner you ſhould be in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to do good, but that the Publick ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and receive the Benefit of it, to ſignifie to your Highneſs, that the Good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ought to be the End of your Greatneſs, and to others, That it is the End, and will be ſo.</p>
               <p>Sir, The great Power that God has put in your hands, can at no Time be better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Without Controverſie, the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of <hi>Europe,</hi> during this Age, depends upon the Succeſs of this War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:29960:16"/>All Laws, Divine and Humane, of Peace and War, the Fences of the Publick Safety are broke thorough; Thoſe Eternal Dictates of Reaſon, the Obligations of Honour, Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Oaths, Promiſes, Religion, as well as the Cuſtoms of Nations, which the Neceſſities of Humane Affairs have rendred inviolable, and without which the great Society of Mankind can no more ſubſiſt, than private Societies can without Rules and Laws: All theſe have been openly and avowedly trampled on.</p>
               <p>Now if the Ambition, and other Paſſions of Men that have done ſuch things, have carried them ſo far, notwithſtanding the juſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which, no doubt, they had of a general reſentment; whither will the ſame Paſſions not carry them, if the preſent Confederacy ſhould happen to be fruſtrated, and there ſhould remain nothing more for them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of.</p>
               <p>But better things, no doubt, are reſerved for this Age. The Chariot Wheels of thoſe that have asked Brick, and forbid Straw, begin already to move heavily. And provided the <hi>Eaſterly</hi> Wind continue to blow ſteady, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little private Intereſts, (ſure little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon),
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29960:16"/>
nor certain Points of Honour (only tolerable when Innocent) diſorder the preſent Harmony, the Event is infallible.</p>
               <p>Sir, Nothing can contribute more to this than the happy Union that is between the King my Maſter, and your Electoral Highneſs, which ſtates His Majeſty, and your Highneſs, in the beſt Circumſtances imaginable for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or removing differences.</p>
               <p>This, among other Reaſons, gives ground to hope, that the Confederacy is not to be broke, ſince the Union I ſpeak of cannot be diſſolved. It is ſtrong, by all that is Sacred amongſt Men, the Ties of Honour, Religion, Blood, Friendſhip, Obligations, Engagements, and I may add of the ſame Intereſts and Deſigns with relation to the Publick.</p>
               <p>To ſo many Ties it may ſeem there needed no addition of a new one. But His Majeſty was reſolved not to loſe any opportunity of giving publick Inſtances of the great Affection and Eſteem that he hath for your Electoral Highneſs: And the Knights Companions were unanimouſly of Opinion, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty could not better diſpoſe of the greateſt Honour that he can give, than by ſending it to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29960:17"/>
your Electoral Highneſs; from whom the Order may expect the greateſt return of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that it can at preſent receive.</p>

But that Honour which is founded only on Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and which proceeds from a true and ſolid conſideration of Worth only, is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above Scepters and Crowns. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of this Noble Order muſt be thus looked upon, ſince it is done by a King who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29960:19"/>
does nothing but with an exact knowledge and mature deliberation. For altho his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not but have always thought it an Honour to have been of this Order, yet he looks upon it as greater ſtill in this, That the Dignity is conferred upon him by his preſent Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Diamonds and Gold which ſhine on the Badges thereof, receive yet a greater luſtre from ſo glorious a Hand, which the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has made choice of to render this Age fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous even for Miracles, to be a terror and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement to Tyrants, to deliver the oppreſſed, raiſe up thoſe that were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29960:19"/>
fallen, reſtore thoſe that are driven out, to ſtabliſh Tottering Crowns, and which having already freed Two Kingdoms, will in all probability glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly recover a Third in a ſhort time. Things that come from ſuch an auguſt hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vertue and Effect. His incomparable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Courage, and the bleſſing of Heaven, have had this great effect, that the moſt Famous Nations in the World, have put <hi>Four Crowns</hi> on his Head, and on that of his Royal Conſort, adorned likewiſe with all the ſame Vertues and Perfections. Which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29960:20"/>
Crowns, inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any Ornament to the Perſons that are poſſeſſed of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more illuſtrious from the heads of thoſe that wear them. His Electoral Highneſs was the firſt of any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince that has received this Noble Token of Favour from His Royal Majeſty. From whence his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That tho His Royal Majeſty, and his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were before near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Related, His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty has thought fit to make ſtill a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Union. 'Tis not to be queſtion'd, but that it proceeds from the Secret Providence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29960:20"/>
of God; That as this Order was inſtituted by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, eſpecially againſt the <hi>French,</hi> who then, as at preſent, began to ſtrive for the Univerſal Monarchy, ſo now is conferr'd by <hi>William</hi> the Third, on <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, at a time when they Two firſt of all diſplayed their Colours for the Freedom of <hi>Europe,</hi> and with U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Forces, oppoſed Themſelves to that monſtrous and dread ful Enemy, rendring the Thing more Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, by the Badge which this Order makes uſe of, <hi>Hony ſoit qui mali penſe.</hi> Let him periſh ſhamefully who dares raſhly deſpiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29960:21"/>
this inſeparable Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, His Royal Majeſty had regard, when He ſent the Sword to His Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs, which otherwiſe relates not to the Badges of the Order, and was never before conferred on any Knight; and with which he would have him girt with ſo great Solemnity, that he might make uſe of it in his Wars, for the aſſerting the Freedom of <hi>Europe.</hi> His Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſigns to do that which His Majeſty intended by conferring this Honour on him, and will always think himſelf ſo ſtrictly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29960:21"/>
to His Majeſty, that no Force nor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice ſhall ever be able to break the Union: But he will eſteem whatever For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, whether bad or good, that attends his Majeſty, to be the ſame as if it happen'd to his Highneſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Concerns and his own, than to give thoſe of his Majeſty the firſt place. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, his Electoral Highneſs will never render himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Honour confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or forget the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Order. And becauſe his Electoral Highneſs is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29960:22"/>
of the Order, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted amongſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote their Intereſt and Glory. Laſtly, His Highneſs thanks the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in that they have been pleaſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the conferring this Noble Preſent on him, and thanks his Royal Majeſty for having choſen them for this Solemnity, to whom his Electoral Highneſs will on all occaſions ſhew all Favour and Eſteem.</p>
