         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But that both theſe courſes may bee held in popular tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, is manifeſt, by the proofes before: and it is manifeſt, <note place="margin">And both expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</note> that if Diuines for the profit of their hearers, would vndertake ſolidly to ſet before the people the whole body of Theologie, and ſhew them at once all the choice things they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue concerning God or Chriſt, or the Creation, or the like, it cannot but in ſome reſpects be much more profitable, then to cleaue onely to the expoſition of whole bookes of Scripture or particular portions: becauſe by the former courſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ſee altogether, that which by the other way they ſhould heare but by peece and at ſeuerall times, onely as the Texts will giue occaſion. I obſerue not this to diſgrace the godly courſe of preaching by Texts, but rather to ſhew that both are needfull: and as I conceiue, it were much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That Diuines euery where would teach the people the whole frame and body of the Doctrine of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in this place ſhewes, that beſides their <note place="margin">The Apoſtles Patterne.</note> courſe of inſtructing the Churches in particular Doctrines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occaſion; they did extract into one body, the Heads of all Religion, which they did in all places carefully vnfolde, and preach vpon vnto the people; and theſe Heads thus gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, as the principall things handled in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Apoſtle calles heere <hi>the patterne of wholeſome words,</hi> and were diuided into two generall Heads or Titles, <hi>Faith and Loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are alſo two waies of handling theſe heads of Religion; the one more plainly and briefly, by way of <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:</hi> the other more largely and exactly, by way of <hi>Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:14246:6"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine:</hi> The one is neceſſarie for young beginners in Religion, and the other needfull to build vp a people in the knowledge begun in them.</p>
               <p>Hauing therefore by Gods gracious aſſiſtance heretofore handled the bodie of Diuinity after the firſt ſorte, in the extract of principles and Doctrine of foundation onely, with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them: I now intend by the like gracious aſſiſtance of God, to goe ouer all the body of ſacred <hi>Theologie,</hi> in a more exact manner, adding thoſe Doctrines that may ſerue to build you vp in the larger knowledge of thoſe glorious Myſteries of true Religion. And long dilating with my ſelfe vpon what Foundation to raiſe this new frame; I at length reſolued vpon the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> where I finde all the Doctrine of Faith collected into one faire body, ready to my hands.</p>
               <p>And in diſcourſeing of theſe glorious Truthes, I intende to <note place="margin">The method in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</note> obſerue a mixt courſe of Teaching, that both ſorts of hearers may finde matter of profit: Heere will be plaine things for the ſimple, and more higher Contemplations for the more Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>Two things I eſpecially intend in handling theſe Articles of Faith; the one is the apparelling of each Article, with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious furniture I finde made fit for it in any parte of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and this is by way of Expoſition. The other is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of the many and ſingular vſes we may put ſuch glorious truths to, in the whole courſe of our liues: and this by way of vſe.</p>
               <p>Now then for an Introduction in generall, this Text giues vs occaſion to conſider of two things,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What the <hi>Creed</hi> is.</item>

                  </note> ſuch ſound abridgements of the chiefeſt Myſteries of Religion are, they are Patternes, formes or frames of wholeſome words; where two things are ſaid:</p>

               <p>They are wholeſome words both by way of oppoſition to doctrines that poyſon and corrupt the mindes of men: and by

way of difference from ſuch truthes as for the preſent and in ſome reſpects are not wholſome to the hearers though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they be wholeſome.</p>
               <p>We may obſerue by diuerſe paſſages in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle, what kinde of Doctrine hee accounts to be in it ſelfe <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>

Further vnwholeſome words, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle accounts all their curioſities and vaine ſpeculations in Philoſophie, as when out of the liking of the writings of olde Philoſophers, they brought in Angell worſhip into the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 8. 19. and ſuch ſtuffe alſo was that which the Apoſtle condemnes vnder the name of traditions of men, that is, ſuperſtitious obſeruations, when the inuentions of men are vrged with opinion of holineſſe or neceſſity, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. 20. of this nature were prophane and olde Wiues fables, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. and ſuch is all that ſtuffe men haunt after that will not bee wiſe to Saluation, but curiouſly ſearch after things not reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Secondly, true Doctrine may be vnwholſome: and ſo wee finde diuerſe inſtances in Scripture: as firſt, when the truth is <note place="margin">

When men in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the truth, ſtudie to ſhew their owne wits, more then the glory of Gods Truth; this is not wholeſome for the hearers, and therefore exclaimed againſt, and proteſted againſt by the Apoſtle in diuerſe places, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 4. Secondly, the time is ſpent in knottie and obſcure places, that are neither eaſie, nor neceſſary to be vnderſtood, and in handling whereof, ſcandalous or dangerous conceits may bee raiſed in mens mindes. Thus the hard places of the Apoſtle <hi>Paules</hi> writings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14246:7"/>
were peruerted as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> complaines, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17.

               <p>Thus as they are wholeſome words. Secondly they are ſaid <note place="margin">
                     <hi>How the</hi> Creed <hi>is a Patterne.</hi>
                  </note> to be Patternes: the Collection of the choiſeſt truthes into one frame or body, is called heere a Patterne: and ſo the <hi>Creed</hi> may be ſaid to be a Patterne of wholſome words, becauſe in the <hi>Creed</hi> there is as it were a ſhort, but liuely reſemblance of all thoſe truthes in a little roome which are at large, and diſperſedly handled throughout all the Bible: and therefore, fitly was the <hi>Creed</hi> called the little Bible. Yea, it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a patterne, becauſe we may compare with it all the truthes we reade of in Scripture, and marke how they agree with, or ſuite to the Articles of our <hi>Creed,</hi> and becauſe we may trie all Doctrine we heare, and free our ſelues from the Intanglement of ſuch controuerſies about opinions that agree not with, or belong not to our <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Decalogue is a patterne of all duties to be done, and <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Lords Prayer a patterne of all requeſts to God, ſo the <hi>Creed</hi> is a patterne of all Doctrine to be belieued.</p>
               <p>Thus of the diſcription of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as the words of the Apoſtle fitly ſerue for it. The more manifeſt deſcription of it will appeare afterwards. The keeping of this patterne followes.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothie</hi> to the keeping of this patterne, he may be vnderſtood to ſpeake to him as a Miniſter, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>What great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we ſhould haue of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contained in the</hi> Creed.</note> or as to a Chriſtian in general. As a Miniſter he is inioyned with all care to endeuour to preſerue the purity of Doctrine, and with great reſpect to teach often, and powerfully thoſe points of Doctrine which were expreſt in the patterne, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall truthes hee ſhould aime at in the courſe of his Miniſterie. He ſhould not through deſire of vaine glory affect Curioſities, or Nouelties, but build vp his Hearers in all the knowledge he could infuſe into them by continual teaching of thoſe doctrines. If hee ſpeake to him as a Chriſtian in generall, then this is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14246:8"/>
point of Doctrine the Apoſtle aimes at, that all Chriſtians bee exceeding carefull to get the diſtinct knowledge of the maine Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and aboue all Doctrines keepe thoſe as a great treaſure. And ſo in particular, ſince we haue in the <hi>Creed</hi> ſuch an excellent frame of the Doctrines of faith, we muſt hence learne that it is our duties to regarde theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines with all reſpect.</p>
               <p>There be twelue Reaſons, why wee ſhould bee in a ſpeciall manner deſirous to heare, learne, and make vſe of the doctrine <note place="margin">12. <hi>Reaſons why we ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Articles of our</hi> Creed. 1. <hi>From the Commandement of God.</hi>
                  </note> of theſe Articles of our faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe wee ſee heere it is the commandement of the Apoſtle, that wee ſhould keepe this patterne of wholeſome words. The Apoſtle ſaw it was a Doctrine of excellent vſe for the Churches, and therefore to be learned and kept as a great treaſure: and the Commandement to keepe them imports, that whatſoeuer we are ignorant of, yet we ſhould not be ignorant of theſe points, and whatſoeuer we forget, yet theſe things we ſhould bee ſure to remember, and whatſoeuer wee wanted affection in, yet in theſe things wee ſhould ſtriue to be greatly affected. It is therefore a ſinne of great vnfaithfulneſſe to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect theſe points, and ſhewes wee are too wiſe in our ſelues, if we haue no minde to learne and keepe ſuch things, as God in his wiſedome hath in ſome ſpeciall manner charged vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the matter heere contained is Doctrine of the higheſt nature, that was euer taught or learned in the world: <note place="margin">3. <hi>From the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect matter.</hi>

The Phiſickes intreats but of the naturall bodie; Aſtronomie but of the heauens; all the Mathematicks, but of ſome particular and inferior ſubiects; and ſo all Artes: onely <hi>Theologie,</hi> and in <hi>Theologie</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> intreates of a number of moſt choiſe Myſteries in diuine things.

ſay little or nothing to: for except it be in the firſt Article, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is altogether ſilent in the reſt. And for this Reaſon wee ſhould bee wonderfully deſirous to bee imployed in theſe knowledges: for to bee taken vp with eaſie things belonges vnto the Vulgar, but to bee informed in things remoued from the ſenſes, belonges to the wiſe onely.</p>

                  <p>The firſt ſort conceiue thus: That the Apoſtles after Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt when they had receiued the holy Ghoſt, met together in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and conſidering that they were to depart one from the other into diuers parts of the world, they agreed vpon the ſubſtance of all that doctrine which they would teach all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the world, and accordingly digeſted it into this forme, that thereby it might appeare that their doctrine euery where <note place="margin">Ruffin. in Simbo.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14246:11"/>
when they ſhould in any place vnder pretence of preaching <hi>Chriſt,</hi> oppoſe or conceale any parte of the neceſſarie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith.

                  <p>But this opinion cannot be true, as may appeare by diuers reaſons, ſome probable, ſome infallible.

Secondly, there are tearmes vſed in the <hi>Creed,</hi> are no where vſed in the writings of the Apoſtles, as the words of deſcending into Hell, and the Catholique Church.

                     <p>To conclude therefore this point concerning the Authors of theſe Articles, the <hi>Creed</hi> is called the Apoſtles <hi>Creed</hi> in two reſpects: firſt, to diſtinguiſh it from all other <hi>Creeds.</hi> There haue bin diuers <hi>Creeds</hi> made in the ſeuerall ages ſince Chriſt, ſome by particular writers, ſome by Councells: of particular writers, <hi>Athanaſius Creed</hi> doth moſt excell, which is the <hi>Creed</hi> ſet downe in the booke of Common Prayer, next before the Letany: and of Councells theſe are the chiefe <hi>Creeds,</hi> the Nicen <hi>Creed,</hi> which you may finde in the booke of Common Prayer, alſo ſet downe in the order of the Communion, as alſo the <hi>Creed</hi> of the Epheſian <hi>Synod,</hi> and the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Calcedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Synod,</hi> reade <hi>Am.

                     <p>Now this <hi>Creed</hi> is called the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> to ſhew that the Churches did hold it to bee of greater authority then any other <hi>Creed,</hi> and that other <hi>Creeds</hi> are but as it were expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>Creed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is called the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> to giue it authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aboue all humane writings, euen thoſe that haue much or moſt excelled. The confeſſion of Nationall Churches haue been worthily had in great requeſt, ſo haue the <hi>Creeds</hi> of the Councells, and ſo haue the Apocripha Scriptures: but yet none of theſe haue attained to the honour of this <hi>Creed.</hi> The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14246:12"/>
of the Canonicall Scriptures in reſpect of the words are humane, though in reſpect of the matter and order they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: and theſe of all humane writings are the beſt, yet not without the defects of the Tranſlators, whereas the originall in both Teſtaments is diuine both for matter, order, and words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Thus of the Authors. The kinde of writing followes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Creede]Symbolum</hi> is the word vſed in the moſt Chriſtian Churches and is plainely agreeable to the originall word, the <hi>Creed</hi> being firſt penned in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue.</p>
                     <p>If the word bee deriued of <hi>Syn</hi> and <hi>bolus,</hi> then it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie two things: firſt, a morſell, or as much as a man may well ſwallow at once: and ſo the whole Scriptures containing but the diuine furniſhing of Gods Table as it were, the <hi>Creed</hi> containes each particular Chriſtians morſell, ſo much as hee may and muſt ſwallow, and receiue downe into his heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leauing any of theſe Articles out: ſecondly, a draught, euen as much as a net can take at once. The ſea is the Word, the fiſherman is the Chriſtian man, the Net is faith, the <hi>Creed</hi> is as much as the faith of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can take at a draught out of the Sea of doctrine contained in the Scriptures.

his comming to Iudgement.

Thus of God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Church, two things are to be noted: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or Priuiledges. Her properties are two, holy and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. The goods or Priuiledges of the Church are either in this world, or in the world to come. In this world there is Communion of Saints and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. In another world faith ſees and wonders at the Reſurrection of the body and the life Euerlaſting.</p>

                  <p>This word <hi>I beleeue,</hi> is not a word onely of a Chriſtian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe to lay hold vpon theſe treaſures contained in the Articles following, but it is the word of a man making anſwer: The queſtion is ſuppreſſed, but the Anſwer is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for as it is true that a true beleeuer is oft queſtioned, ſo 'tis as true, that by his <hi>Creed,</hi> he anſwers all that can be ſaid to him: for heere is contained, that Anſwer of a good conſcience ſpoken of 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This forme of anſwering came firſt in at Baptiſme in the Primitiue Church: for before the partie to be baptized was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto Baptiſme, hee was examined (as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was by <hi>Philip)</hi> and did anſwer by making confeſſion of his faith in this or the like forme.

                  <p>Beliefe or Faith is diuerſly accepted: ſometimes it is taken for fidelity or faithfulneſſe, or aſſent: and this ſenſe it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philoſophers aſwellas among the Diuines that are Chriſtians, but all the other ſenſes following it hath onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtian Diuines. And ſo it is taken ſometimes for the doctrine of faith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. ſometimes for the profeſſion of faith, and ſo <hi>Simon Magus</hi> beleeued: ſometimes for the things beleeued, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Iude</hi> 3. But moſt vſually for the gift by which we beleeue, and ſo it is taken heere.</p>
                  <p>But what is it to beleeue theſe Articles? 'tis not to geſſe at them that they are true, or to conceiue ſome probable hope that they may be iuſtified; nor is it, to ſay them ouer; nor is it onely to liue in ſuch places where ſuch doctrines are taught and defended: but to beleeue, muſt haue theſe ſix things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in it: for to beleeue, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To vnderſtand the meaning and ſenſe of theſe Articles: this is ſo neceſſary as it is impoſſible wee ſhould beleeue, when wee know not what it is we beleeue: yet this is the leaſt thing in faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to aſſent to all this doctrine that it is the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis to eſteeme and like this doctrine aboue all other kindes of doctrine in the world, which is contrary or different from it, and accordingly to ioy in it, and bee much affected with it.</p>

                  <p>So that this beleeuing heere, hath in it all the three faithes ſpoken of by Diuines; for to vnderſtand and aſſent is the worke of Hiſtoricall faith: To eſteeme and profeſſe is the worke of temporarie faith: To reſt vpon this happineſſe by Chriſt, and to ioyne in hearty fellowſhip with the godly, is the worke of iuſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe ſome of theſe things in beleeuing may bee found in reprobates as well as the Elect, and that the heart of man is exceeding deceitfull in the point of faith, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell applied his temptations, with all ſubtilty and power, to deceiue men in their beleeuing, therefore vnto theſe things which are comprehended within the nature of the beleeuing heer mentioned, I adde the diſtinct conſideration of ſuch things as muſt bee found in the manner of our beleeuing: wee muſt looke to it how we beleeue theſe Articles, for we may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies deceiued: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt beleeue them with the heart, and not confeſſe them with the mouth onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. and to beleeue them with our hearts, is to beleeue them in deede, not in ſhew; to beleeue them voluntarily, not vpon compulſion; to beleeue them affectionately, not coldely, or dully: our faith muſt be a liuely faith, not a dead faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt beleeue them perſonally; each one muſt haue his owne faith: 'Tis not inough to ioyne our ſelues to ſuch men as doe beleeue them, but euery one muſt get him a faith of his owne: <hi>The Iuſt muſt liue by his owne ſaith, Hab.</hi> 2. 5. and therefore we ſay <hi>I beleeue,</hi> not they beleeue, or we beleeue: We ſay, <hi>our Father</hi> when we pray, becauſe we may pray one for another; but we ſay not we beleeue, becauſe we cannot beleeue one for another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt beleeue, explicitely, not implicitely: It was one principle in the Kingdome of <hi>Antichrist</hi> to the intent that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14246:15"/>
the people might be kept in blindneſſe, to teach them, that it was inough for them to beleeue, as the Church beleeued, without inquiring into particulars: and therefore they tell a tale to this end, how the diuell tempting a man, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to tell how he beleeued, the man anſwered, as the Church beleeued; and the diuell asking him how the Church beleeued, he anſwered as I doe, and hereupon the diuell ranne away and was vanquiſhed.

To bee ſhort then, we muſt looke to it, that we vnderſtand and beleeue theſe Articles not in the whole lumpe onely, but in the partes; not by truſting to other mens iudgements, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly taking notice of each doctrine of faith our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt beleeue all the Articles of the faith totally, not in ſome parts onely; faith is copulatiue heere: we muſt beleeue all or none. He cannot be ſound in the faith, that is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his iudgement about any theſe Articles: faith, that is, a ſound faith beleeues all that is written.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt beleeue with application. It is not inough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that theſe doctrines are true, or good, but wee muſt beleeue that they belong to each of vs in particular, or elſe we ſhall haue little profit or comfort by them. What can it comfort vs to beleeue that theſe things are, or that others ſhall haue the benefit of them, if they belong not to vs? Thus I muſt beleeue that I haue the benefit of Gods power or prouidence, and of Chriſts Incarnation and Paſſion, and exaltation, and that I am a member of the Church, and haue my parte in his priuiledges. This is a maine thing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; for a reprobate may goe ſo farre, to beleeue that theſe doctrines are true.</p>

6. We muſt beleeue with all Chriſtian ſimplicity: which ſhould haue two things in it: firſt, wee muſt caſt away all truſt in our owne merits: It is a compounded and corrupted faith that beleeues any of theſe things vpon the perſwaſion of his owne merits or deſerts: To beleeue aright, and merit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together: true faith caſteth out merit. For, if they which are of the law inherit any of theſe treaſures, then faith is void, and the promiſe and gift of Gods grace of none effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. ſecondly, we muſt beleeue ſo, as we will giue glory to God, though the things to bee beleeued, bee neuer ſo vnlikely to carnall reaſon, or be things abſent, and not yet giuen, or things aboue our vnderſtanding in the full glory of them, our faith muſt not bee curious or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, to binde God to giue vs a reaſon of his promiſes or actions. Herein we muſt take heede, that the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile vs not, nor ſeduce vs from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt Ieſus, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Yea this is the glory and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of faith, in theſe things without doubting to giue glory to God. Our faith muſt bee the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the demonſtration of things not ſeene. Wee muſt beleeue eternall life, though we muſt die; and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſurrection, though we ſhall be rotten in the graue; and that we are Iuſtified, though ſinne yet dwell in vs; and that we are bleſſed, though yet expoſed to much miſeries, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We muſt beleeue with full aſſurance; wee muſt not wauer or doubt, but bee fully reſolued and eſtabliſhed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of theſe things and our right in them, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 2. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 4. this we ought to labour for, and this may bee had, and therefore we ſhould giue all diligence to get this full aſſurance of faith: I grant that a leſſe degree of faith, may be true faith, as ſhall bee ſhewed afterwards, but yet this is that which we ſhould ſtriue for, that we may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally glorifie God by beleeuing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We muſt beleeue with perſeuerance: we muſt ſo giue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement to theſe ſacred truthes, now, as that wee alſo meane to liue and die in this faith. The faith that is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie will little auaile vs, we muſt ſo prouide that our faith may laſt to the end. And therefore the word is <hi>I do beleeue,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:14246:16"/>
in the preſent time, not I haue beleeued, or I will beleeue, to note, that there muſt be no time wherein a Chriſtian may truely ſay now I beleeue not. Now that we may not be deceiued herein, we muſt looke to three things. Firſt, that we caſt off all carnall ends in our profeſſion of faith: and looke to it that wee take not vp the profeſſion of religion for ſiniſter reſpects, as many haue done, for ſuch ends as theſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> to get credit, and the fauour of men, or to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues capable of the preferment of this world, or to ſhew their gifts; or, which is worſe, to couer ſecret wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or open faults.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we build not our Faith vpon wrong Cauſes or grounds, ſuch as are the reſpect of any mans perſon or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or the intiſing words of mens wiſedome, or the meere colours and probabilities of mens arguments; but be ſure we place our Faith vpon the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we be not deceiued with the ſeeming effects of Faith, but learne to diſtinguiſh betweene the force of the Word vpon our hearts, when we are meerely as it were pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and the force of the Word working a habit or action in vs. I expreſſe my meaning thus: Many a man liues in a place, where the word is taught in the power and glory of it, comes to heare without any care, or purpoſe to regard, or profit by it; yet the truth in the deliuerie of it ſo ſhines in his heart, that he is not only conuinced, but for the time delighted, and heares with great gladneſſe, as feeling his heart to be warmed with the doctrine he heares: yet cares not for it when he is gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor makes any vſe of it at all, as being deſtitute of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gift by which he ſhould receiue or apply the doctrine: ſo that this heat in his heart did not ariſe from any habit in him receiuing the Word and making vſe of it, but onely from the forcible penetration of the doctrine. As a ſtone that is heated by the beames of the Sunne, that neither had heat in it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor keepes heat when the Sunne hath done ſhining, but is a meere patient. Now this hearer hath not ſo much as a temporarie Faith: for he that hath the temporarie Faith, hath a kinde of habit be gotten in him, ſo as he doth receiue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and keepe it after a ſort, and from the force of it ſo kept,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14246:16"/>
doth bring forth ſome fruit; and ſo the ſeede receiued into his heart, is like graſſe vpon the houſe top, or ſeede ſowen in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie places, where there is a little earth mingled withall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that beleeues aright, and ſo will hold out, hath the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtonineſſe of his heart diſſolued by the word, and is ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it for the preſent, that he receiues it ſo as it tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, and growes in him, and he brings forth the ſound fruit of Reformation of life: and his ſeede abideth in him, it cannot vtterly be deſtroyed, but Faith in him is like the tree of life, that will euery yeere bring new fruit: Whereas in Nature the corne that is ſowne, after one harueſt is deſtroyed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that particular graine that was ſowen. Nor may any ſay, that he cannot know whether he ſhall hereafter keepe his Faith; he can iudge of his Faith what it is now: for, if he get a ſound Faith it will keepe, and beſides, he beleeues with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, that doth reſolue for euer to reſt in that Faith, ſimply for the euidence, worth, and vſe of the doctrine beleeued, for he that hath but a temporary faith, as he doth receiue doctrine, but for certaine aduantages, or carnall ends, ſo can he not get his heart at that very time, to a reſolution to cleaue eternally to that doctrine of Gods grace.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is not yet innough to reſolue to keepe the faith, and to preſerue the doctrine, but we muſt looke to it, that we lay it vp in a cleane place, which is a pure Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. and that we keepe it there cleane from the mixtures of mens deuiſes: being curious in the buſineſſes of our faith, to let in no priuate interpretations, but to reſolue to beleeue onely as Gods word doth bid vs beleeue: we muſt take heede, and not admit careleſly any interpretations of the Articles of our faith, that any ſort of men will bring to vs, but we muſt ſtill haue an eye to Gods word, to ſee all expounded by the word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. 19. 16. we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing here, no not in the leaſt part of the apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe truths, which is not agreeable to ſome pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in the booke of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we muſt beleeue theſe Articles, but not all with one kinde of faith: for ſome of theſe things we beleeue in; that is, place our truſt and confidence, and all hope of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14246:17"/>
in them; ſo we beleeue in God, and in Ieſus Chriſt, and in the holy Ghoſt: but other things wee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in, but beleeue, as the properties and priuiledges of the Church, as wee may diſcerne by the difference of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the <hi>Creed.</hi> Wee ſay <hi>I beleeue in God,</hi> but doe not ſay, <hi>I beleeue in the holy Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe may be firſt, for information: we may hence gather that there are but few ſound Chriſtians in any place: there are but few that beleeue their <hi>Creed,</hi> obſeruing all the duties and conditions required in beliefe, and conſequently, but few that receiue the benefit of the Goſpell, or that ſhall be ſaued. This will appeare if a Tryall could bee made euen in the places that are moſt populous, and abound moſt with Chriſtians in name. For, if all the ſorts of men bee caſt out, that haue not a faith agreeable to this doctrine, there will bee but a few left: as for inſtance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Caſt out all ſuch as vnderſtand not their <hi>Creed,</hi> many can ſay the words, who yet neuer were inſtructed concerning the meaning, and haue not any competent meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning the ſenſe of the Articles.

                  <p n="3">3. Caſt out ſuch as know perhaps the meaning, but aſſent not to the doctrine: They cannot tell whether theſe things bee true or no: nor how to approue them; and is there not in all places diuers men, that are of this humour? are there not men that will be of any Religion? That are temporizers?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Caſt out ſuch as beleeue that all the doctrines be true, but it is by ſuch a ſaith as the diuells haue: for the diuells beleeue the doctrines to be true, but ſo, as they hate it, and the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it, and all ſuch as thriue in knowledge and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. Are there not multitudes of people with vs, that diſcouer this kinde of diuelliſh quality? doe they not from their hearts loath preaching? doe they not from their hearts

hate ſuch as are the beſt beleeuers? doe they not readily and ſpitefully ſpeake euill of ſuch as feare God in euery place? theſe cannot be right, that beleeue loathing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Caſt out ſuch as beleeue with a dead faith: that is ſuch as finde no manner of feare, nor vertue, nor operation in theſe doctrines: but can take in a great deale of the literall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe truthes, and yet it hath no power to worke vpon their hearts: Theſe haue not ſo much faith as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells haue; for they beleeue and tremble, that is they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted and extreamely amazed at the thought of the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and accompliſhment of theſe truthes, conſidering their owne miſery. Whereas multitudes of Chriſtians, heare of beliefe, and talke of theſe things, and are not a whit moued either with feare or ſorrowe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Caſt out ſuch as haue but a temporarie faith. And in them conſider: firſt, what they haue in their faith, and then by what things it may be manifeſt that their faith is inſufficient: for the firſt, theſe men are not altogether without faith, they haue knowledge of the meaning of the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they aſſent to it and are aſſured it is the truth and can proue it, and they hate not the doctrine but rather like it and loue it. And beſides, their beliefe of theſe things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much vpon them: for they heare the Word with Ioy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. yea and are moued and perſwaded to reforme their liues, and by it eſcape much filthineſſe which is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and was in themſelues, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. and they do ioyne themſelues to, and keepe company openly with ſuch as feare God, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> did with the Apoſtles: and doe ſpend much time in reading the Scriptures and good books, and may be forward to reproue or puniſh vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in other men as <hi>Iehu</hi> was, and yet all this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their faith is vaine: which will appeare to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences if they conſider theſe things in them:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they beleeue not with application to themſelues: They lay not hold on theſe things by a particular faith. They place not their happineſſe in the perſwaſion of their intereſt in theſe truthes.</p>

And they may finde it by this, that if they fall out with any that are the chiefe for Religion in the places where they liue, they meditate not onely a forſaking of ſuch as they are fallen out withall, but euen a relin qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of their forwardneſſe or care for profeſſion of religion it ſelfe: thoſe that finde ſuch corruption in their hearts, had neede to take heede to their ſtanding leaſt they fall: for though a timely reconciliation with men, reſtore them to their former courſe of profeſſion againe, yet this tryall of their hearts, may tell them, that at length for ſuch or the like occaſions they will fall cleane away, if they get not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter footing in the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That all this profeſſion is vndertaken for carnall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends: as either to get credit with religious perſons, or to auoid the penall Lawes of Princes, or to couer ſome vices they are prone to, or guilty of, or to aduantage their eſtates in worldly things, or out of deſire to excell others in gifts or the like.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the ioy which they feele is but a falſe ioy and vnſound: which appeares both by the cauſes of it, and by the effects. By the cauſes, for they ioy in hearing the Word for theſe or the like reaſons: becauſe the doctrine is new, or becauſe it is handled with vnexpected learning or wit, or becauſe it fits their humors or affections, or becauſe it is doctrine that is generally comfortable, and ſets out the happineſſe of ſuch as are of their Religion, or becauſe the things ſpoken of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14246:18"/>
are admirable in themſelues, or becauſe the doctrine makes againſt ſuch and ſuch as he likes not. And ſuch as are the cauſes, ſuch are the effects. For this ioy makes them more proude, and careleſſe, and conceited, and contemptuous many times of others. Whereas the true ioy ariſeth from the ſolid application of the things heard to himſelfe, and from the perſwaſion of his right vnto theſe comforts by and through <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> And withall this ioy doth ſoften the heart, as the dew from Heauen doth the ground, and makes the true Chriſtian more humble and mortified, and more deſirous to be rid of ſinne, and more to loue God, and goodnes, and godly men.</p>
                  <p>Now if all theſe ſorts bee caſt out, it is eaſie to coniecture, that few will remaine to bee reckoned for true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore that would try whether hee haue a true beliefe or no, muſt in the firſt place try whether none of theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of faith poſſeſſe not his ſoule: for if they doe, it is certaine he hath not faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt carefully ſeparate and diſtinguiſh faith from ſuch things; as haue ſome kinde of likeneſſe, or agreement with it, and yet are not faith: In his Tryall hee muſt take heede, that he take not ſome other thing for faith: ſuch as are, raſh <hi>Credulity,</hi> Hypocriticall profeſſion, <hi>Preſumption,</hi> opinion, humane <hi>Knowledge,</hi> experience, or <hi>Hope.</hi> For the firſt, there is a light kinde of aſſent which men giue vnto doctrines in Religion, without any knowledge of the warrant and proofe of them from Scripture: whatſoeuer effects this <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity</hi> haue, yet is it not faith, becauſe that is euer grounded vpon the Word of God. Nor may hee miſtake an outward hypocriticall profeſſion of the true Religion for faith: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, when it is deſtitute of the loue of God, hatred of ſinne, truſt in Chriſts merits, charity to men, and patience in afflictions, doe no way commend a man to God, much leſſe is it true faith. Thirdly, many Chriſtians enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Preſumption</hi> inſteede of faith: They are reſolued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that God is their Father, and Chriſt died for them, and they are the children of God and true Chriſtians, and all this without any word of God rightly applyed. Fourthly, Opinion in matters of Religion may bee taken by ſome for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14246:19"/>
faith, but yet it is not: for Opinion is naturall, faith ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and giuen of God: Opinion is founded vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimonie, faith vpon diuine: Opinion is doubtfull and wauering, faith is firme and certaine. Fifthly, nor may humane Knowledge be taken for faith; for though they agree in this, that they are both imployed about things true, and ſuch things as ſenſe cannot reach to, yet they differ mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly: faith is Gods gift, and a light ſupernaturall: but knowledge is a habit gotten by vs, through the helpe of the ſparkles of the light of nature, and exerciſe, and teaching: for the comprehending of the things of faith, there is daily neede of the inſpiration and illumination and quickning of Gods ſpirit: But the things of knowledge may be attained by the force of mans owne wit and induſtry: faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the truth and power of God, beſides and aboue the ſtrength of nature, and the iudgement of the whole world: Knowledge is grounded vpon naturall cauſes and principles, to omit other differences. Sixtly, nor muſt that perſwaſion which ariſeth from experience, and the fulfilling of things be taken for true faith, becauſe faith laies hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things before the euent alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Nor laſtly, is faith and hope all one, for faith ſees Chriſt exhibited, and preſent in the Word and Sacrament, Hope lookes for him to be reuealed from Heauen: Faith beleeues what God hath promiſed, and Hope waites for performance, faith is aſſured of eternall life, and Hope expects it to be reuealed: Faith is the foundation of Hope, and Hope is the nurſe of faith. Thus he muſt caſt out things that are onely like vnto faith but are not faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he hath thus caſt out the contraries of faith, and findes himſelfe free from them, and withall hath prouided that he is not deceiued with the things that haue a likeneſſe vnto faith and are not, he muſt then in the third place, looke to it that he take not a wrong faith for the right faith: for there be many kindes of faith, and one onely that is the faith that will iuſtifie vs before God: and ſo the right faith is not,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That politicall faith, which is a vertue imployed about hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">1. <hi>Fides politica.</hi>

then to bee faithfull in promiſes, or to bee truſtie in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to bee iuſt in our dealings, or to keepe our words to men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Among the faithes that are found onely in the Church, it is not the <hi>Symbolicall</hi> faith, that hath nothing in it, but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">2. <hi>Symbolica.</hi>
                     </note> auouching or profeſſing of the true Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor is it contained in that faith called <hi>Historicall,</hi> which hath <note place="margin">3. <hi>Hiſtorica.</hi>
                     </note> nothing but the vnderſtanding and aſſent vnto the word that it is true, but wants application and life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor is it that temporary faith, of which was intreated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but is ſuch a beliefe as containes in it all the ſix things <note place="margin">4. <hi>Temporaria.</hi>
                     </note> before mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nor is it that faith they call a Morall faith, by which a man <note place="margin">5. <hi>Fides moralis, which ſome call Credulitas cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatiua.</hi>
                     </note> beleeues out of charity, that other men are Gods Elect and true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when he hath freed his heart from the miſtakings may ariſe from any of the former, hee muſt then trie himſelfe by the direct ſignes of a compleate and effectuall faith, and theſe things which eſſentially belong to the true beleeuer: and ſo a man may haue comfort that hee is a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he can ſhew the warrant of his faith, from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Gods Word in the Scriptures: A man may then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfe that he is not deceiued in his faith, when hee is able to proue theſe doctrines of faith by the euidence of Gods Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 10. 11.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>Laſtly, the weake in Faith muſt be admoniſhed to looke to their Faith, and to labour for growth: Though God accepts their weake Faith in the beginning of their conuerſion, yet he likes not the neglecting of Faith, and continuing in ignorance and vnbeliefe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. Beſides, ſo long as they continue
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14246:25"/>
in weakeneſſe of Faith, they keepe themſelues without many and ſingular comforts. Though weake Faith bee ſufficient to Saluation, yet it is not ſufficient to conſolation.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the Nature of Faith: The ground of Faith were worthy to be conſidered: for it is not inough to know that we muſt beleeue, or what things are to be beleeued, but vpon what ground or warrant wee doe beleeue it. And ſo heere I might conſider of the Word of God as the ground of Faith or <note place="margin">Principium fidei</note> originall of Faith: for he that will euer proſper in beleeuing theſe Articles, muſt be reſolued of theſe things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the things he beleeueth are warranted to him by the teſtimonie of God himſelfe; for no humane teſtimony of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, or of the whole Church, can be the ground of a mans Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles are the very word of himſelfe, and ſo infallible.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles are euery way perfect and doe containe all things neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in the matter of his Religion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That he can ſee how each Article of his Faith is grounded vpon the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That he will cleaue vnto this Word of God all the daies of his life, as the principall meanes of his direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and of his further increaſe in Faith and knowledge; for his knowledge and Faith comes in but by degrees, and in part, and the truth is oppoſed by his owne reaſon corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by the ſuggeſtions of the diuell, and by almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite varieties of opinions, againſt all which he reſolues to cleaue to the Word of God as his perpetuall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe, this principle concerning the Word of God, is not expreſſed in the <hi>Creed,</hi> I will therefore forbeare, the proofe and explication, and illuſtration of theſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>And I conceiue that this Head of the Word of God was left out in the <hi>Creed</hi> in the firſt Age of the Church, for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The one was, becauſe as then it was not queſtioned ſo much as the reſt of the Articles. But the other Reaſon is the

moſt important, and that is, that theſe doctrines of the <hi>Creed</hi> though they be principles, yet are of another ſort then theſe doctrines that concerne the Original, perfection or authority of the Scriptures: for theſe principles are concluſions framed, out of thoſe principles concerning the Word: and ſo containe a frame of doctrins which are built vpon the granting of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: or thus they are diſtinguiſhed from them: Theſe are parts of Theologie, whereas the Word of God, is not a part, but <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cognoſcendi,</hi> the foundation of <hi>Theologie.</hi> The doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Scriptures are not properly Articles of Faith, but grounds or the foundation of Faith.

                  <p>The firſt thing we are to ſtudie to know and beleeue is God. This is the firſt doctrine of the <hi>Creed:</hi> there are many things ſhould inflame the hearts of Chriſtians to a great deſire after the doctrine concerning God and his nature: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the moſt glorious ſubiect of all others in the world: no doctrine can tell vs of ſuch marueilous things as the doctrine of God doth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the end of our Creation: all other things though made by God, yet they haue no diſcerning of him. Now God made man, and gaue him a reaſonable ſoule, that hee might

ſee God, and the great workes he had done; els in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world, there had bin none to know or praiſe God: Nothing therefore can be more contrary to the end of our Creation, then if wee ſpend our time, and do not labour to know and praiſe God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The whole doctrine of Religion, is called Theologie, which word in the originall, taken a funder, is a ſpeech or doctrine concerning God: to ſignifie, that without the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, there can be no true Religion or right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any thing: God is the principall Subiect of all Religious doctrine.</p>

It is a poore thing to bee pleaſed with the knowledge of other things and bee ignorant of God; and the rather, becauſe what we loue or admire in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are good, are moſt perfectly in God and no where elſe.: beſides, ſhall we bee ignorant of him, from whom we receiue al good things, and from whom al things might make vs happie are to be expected?

Theſe things are ſcarce worthy to be ſaid to be, of which it may bee ſaid either it was not, or it will not bee: then it will follow: that the knowledge men get in other things, is to know nothing; then wee know ſomething when wee know God: finally, a neceſſity lieth vpon vs to bee rightly enformed concerning God: if to ſpeake or thinke vilely of men bee an offence, what is it to conceiue or thinke erroniouſly, or meanely, or baſely concerning God?</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of theſe and ſuch like motiues ſhould ſtir vp in vs a great willingneſſe to be taught concerning God: but before I breake open the particular aſſertions concerning the Nature of our moſt glorious God, there are certaine generall conſiderations that muſt take vp ſome Roome in our hearts, and it is profitable for vs to approach vnto the contemplation of God by degrees; and therefore by way of Preface, I conceiue theſe things are needfull to be thought on:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How hard a thing it is to attaine the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By what meanes the darke heart of man is guided to the vnderſtanding of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How farre forth God may be knowne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What Rules muſt of neceſſity be obſerued by all ſuch as can haue any hope to know God.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: of all knowledges it is the hardeſt to attaine the true knowledge of God, and there are many things that hinder and hide God from vs: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The tranſcendent glory of Gods nature, the brightneſſe of which is ſuch, that the eyes of our mindes are not able to look vpon it, much leſſe can any ſenſes of our bodies attaine him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 29. <hi>Iudges</hi> 13. 18. God is inuiſible, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him: he is ineffable, no words can tell vs what hee is: we may reckon a thouſand things and yet none of them <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> is God, whether we looke about the earth, ſeas, ayre, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, God is that thing which no opinion can reach: Hee is more then words can tell, or thoughts can thinke. God is ſuch a thing, as when we name him, hee cannot bee named; <note place="margin">Hillarie.</note> when we goe about to eſtimate him, he cannot bee eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; when we goe about to compare him, hee cannot bee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14246:27"/>
compared, when we would define him hee increaſeth big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then any definition. He is greater then all words, then <note place="margin">Tert.</note> all ſenſes, it is peculiar to God to exceede knowledge: wee may admire by ſilence, but cannot expreſſe him by words: <note place="margin">Niſſen.</note> and the Reaſon is, that which is finite can hold no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that which is infinite. And therefore hee that would define God had neede to haue Gods Logick, for no mans Logick can reach to it: for though nothing be more preſent euery where then God yet nothing is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible. God is immenſe, and therefore who can tell (as one ſaith) the length of his Eternity, or the breadth <note place="margin">Bern.</note> of his Loue, or the height of his Maieſty, or the depth of his Wiſedom. And though it bee true, that there are diuers names giuen to God, yet thoſe names do not explicate what God is, but onely ſo much of him, as of vs can bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; for that which is ſaid of God is not God, becauſe hee is <note place="margin">Plato. He is Vbique preſens ſed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, vbique to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſed immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</note> ineffable: The Heathen man could ſay, that it is a hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde out the Father of the world, but hauing found him, it was impoſſible to deſcribe him with fit words, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to make the vulgar ſort to conceiue of him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is fitly ſtyled, a light inacceſſible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The defect of meaſures hinders vs. All the things by which <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> we trie and meaſure other things are of no vſe in deſcribing God: for he is good without quality, great without quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, euery where whole without place, euerlaſting without time, he makes all ſorts of mutable things, without mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in himſelfe or ſuffering any thing: hee needs not a body to make him to be, nor a place to make him to be heere, nor <note place="margin">Ioh. de Comb.</note> time, to make him to be now, or hereafter, or heretofore, he needs no ſubiect in which he ſhould ſubſiſt, or to which he ſhould adhere. He is mercifull without paſſion and Lord <note place="margin">Trelcat.</note> of all things, without addition of any thing to his wealth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee want the benefit of ſimilitudes: for Gods nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers infinitely from the natures of all other things, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can be found to liken God to it, without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular iniurie, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God doth not now appeare to vs as hee did to the Fathers in the firſt Ages of the World.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:14246:28"/>
5. We are deſtitute of the helpe of Demonſtration <hi>à priori</hi> as they call it in Schooles. There was no eſſence before him, nor any thing that might leaue the name or nature of a cauſe of his being.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are in and of our ſelues much more vnable to conceiue of God then we were at the firſt in our Creation, by reaſon of our fall from God into ſinne. The light we had being put ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="6">6. God hath reuealed to vs but onely his backe parts, in this life wee cannot ſee him face to face, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The diuells vſe all their methods to keepe men without the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The world diſtracts vs and deuoures vſually the time ſhould be ſpent about the ſtudie of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. God himſelfe, that he may be reuenged on the ingratitude of many men doth hide himſelfe out of the way from them.</p>
                  <p>And it is neceſſary wee ſhould take notice of this difficulty of the knowledge of God, both to humble vs, and to quicken vs to the more diligence and to make vs more thankefull, if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14246:28"/>
God be pleaſed in any meaſure to reueale himſelfe to vs.</p>
                  <p>For the third, though it be thus extreame difficult to know God, yet we muſt not diſpaire of it as of a thing impoſſible: for though the creature of it ſelfe cannot conceiue God, yet God can reueale himſelfe to the creature, according to the the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capacity.</p>
                  <p>God that dwelt in the ſecrets of Eternity, onely knowne and ſeene to himſelfe, ſince the <hi>Creation,</hi> hath bin pleaſed to come out of his ſecret ſeate, and by certaine meanes or degrees to make himſelfe knowne to men: as,</p>

                  <p n="3">3. By the booke of the creature: for by vnfolding before man in an open and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="4">4. When none of theſe were ſufficient to bring man to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of God: nor to ſo much as might ſaue his ſoule, and bring him into happy fellowſhip with God, God was pleaſed in the book of Scripture, to extract out of the infinite depths of knowledges which were in his eternall minde, a frame of deſcriptions, and teſtimonies concerning himſelfe, and his will, and this in his due time by degrees he gaue vnto the Church, and is contained in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>

                  <p>It is true, the vnquiet heart of man is vexed, becauſe God is not viſible to his eyes, as if the knowing of God by colours were the only pleaſing way of ſeeing him: Thy bodily eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee God, what then If thy eyes cannot diſcerne God, is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater thing; then that thy hands or feete cannot diſcerne other thing?

                  <p>But thou wilt ſay, not onely thy eyes, but thy reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach God ſo as to eaſe or pleaſe thy minde?

Now, though Reaſon will not reach heere, yet God hath not left his children deſtitute, but hath giuen them an inſtrument from heauen which is capable of theſe things, and that is, Faith.</p>
                  <p>And yet God hath not altogether abandoned the vſe of ſenſes in his children for the knowledge of him: for they know God by ſight in his creatures, and by hearing in the word, and by truſting in his bleſſings, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3.</p>

That this point may bee yet more clearely vnderſtood, wee muſt conſider the different waies how God is knowne by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall things: firſt, himſelfe knowes himſelfe with infinite perfection of abſolute knowledge, and ſo hee is knowne onely to himſelfe: ſecondly, Chriſt man knowes him by vnion, that is, by vertue of his vnion with the diuine nature, hee doth after a way vnſpeakeable, and vnimitable ſee and vnderſtand the God-head: thirdly, the Angels and Saints in heauen know him by viſion: they ſee God face to face, that is, they haue a perfect knowledge of Gods Nature according to their condition in heauen, and doe behold him in ſome moſt glorious repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his preſence: fourthly, to men on earth hee is knowne by reuelation: and ſo after a different manner to diuers men: As to ſome holy men by Inſpiration, to all godly men by Chriſt, to all men in the Church by the Scriptures, and to all men in the world by the creatures and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The fourth point it remaines to conſider how farre forth God may be knowne, by theſe all or any of them? I anſwer: firſt, more generally, and then more particularly: In generall if we thinke of the full knowledge of God, the Trinity is then onely knowne to God himſelfe and <hi>Chriſt</hi> man: God hath a Name that is ſecret, and wonderfull, this can bee knowne by no creature; by his Name reuealed he may be knowne: ſo as we remember that in this world he appeares to whom he will, and as he will, and not as he is. The moſt men conceiue wonderfull little of Gods Nature.</p>
                  <p>The diuers formes of things in the world are beames, as it were, of the diuinity, but yet they ſhew rather that he is, then what he is, or whence they are rather then what he is.</p>
                  <p>Diſtinctly to conſider of it we muſt note that God is knowne in this life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But in his backe parts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But according to our modell or capacity: God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſo much out of the Ocean of the infinite knowledge which concernes his nature, as may bee taken in by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This that may be attained to, for that part which is ſet out by words, is expreſt not by words that tell what God is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14246:30"/>
directly but by ſuch words, as being in vſe amongſt men, might leade vs to ſome happie manner of diſcerning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The neereſt knowledge wee haue is by effect, as it is either deſcribed in Scripture, or wrought in prouidence: and ſo what God is in himſelfe, himſelfe onely knowes, but what hee is to vs that in ſome meaſure hee makes vs know: his glorious Nature is onely knowne to himſelfe: Wee ſee the Sunne not as it is in it ſelfe, but as it inlightneth: we look not vp vpon the body of the Sunne, but vpon the beames of it that ſhine vpon the hill, or vpon the wall, or the like: ſo is it in the knowledge of God: our natures cannot looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his nature but we diſcerne him, by the ſhining of his working and by the beames of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>The difference alſo of the deſcriptions that haue bin of God are to be thought on: for there hath bin a Philoſophicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God, and a Theologicall. The <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> was had among the Gentiles, by the wiſeſt of them. The <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> hath onely bin had in the Church. The one looked vpon God onely by the light of Nature and experience, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lookes vpon God by the light of Scripture and Faith: But that <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> Light was extreamely deficient and farre ſhort of the Eccleſiaſticall Light: for beſides that the wiſeſt of the Philoſophers had much adoe to ſeperate the true GOD from the many Gods worſhipped by the Nations: they were altogether blinde, in the Myſterie of the Trinity, and ignorant altogether of the higheſt praiſes of God, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his mercies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man in Ieſus Chriſt: yea, there was ſcarce any Attribute of God, that was rightly knowne with any life, without the Pale of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that knowledge that is to be had of God, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered three waies: by Negation, Eminencie, or Cauſation: By Negation, when wee denie vnto God whatſoeuer is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the Creature: and ſo wee denie death, meaſure, Mutation, &amp;c. and ſay that God is Immortall immenſe immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, &amp;c. By eminencie when we giue vnto God in the higheſt degree, what we finde to bee good in the creature, and ſo wee ſay, he is moſt holy, moſt wiſe, moſt iuſt, &amp;c. By Cauſation we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14246:30"/>
may finde out God by reaſoning from the things hee hath done.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing to be conſidered of, is the Rules to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by vs for the attaining of the knowledge of God: for All meanes will be ineffectuall to vs, if we be not rightly prepared and diſpoſed: we neede a Religious minde in all knowledges that concerne our happineſſe, but eſpecially when any thing is ſpoken or thought concerning God: becauſe all words are inſufficient to tell vs eaſily and fully what God is: <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Hee therfore that would reach to the comprehending of the knowledge of God, muſt bee ſure to keepe theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee muſt cleanſe and purge, and ſcoure his heart from the filth and droſſe of falſe opinions and ſtrange and Atheiſticall conceits concerning God: yea, hee muſt wholly empty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of all opinion concerning his owne ſufficiencie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of God, of himſelfe: for if it bee true of other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in Religion, that a man muſt become a foole that he may be wiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. it is much more true in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt then addreſſe himſelfe to Gods Word, and reſolue <note place="margin">

We ſhall neuer learne what hee is, by asking what others ſay of him, but muſt heere what hee ſaith of himſelfe: for God is not knowne without God, as one ſaith, Of God wee muſt learne whatſoeuer of God wee would vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He muſt reſolue to ſpare no paines that is requiſite for this ſtudie: hee muſt imploy himſelfe with great diligence to drinke in his knowledge: for God will appeare onely to ſtudious mindes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A heart full of deſires is requiſite to theſe conceptions: The deſire of the ſoule muſt be after God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 8, 9. He muſt be ſought with a mans whole heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 10. elſe the minde will wander extreamely. And becauſe wee want that admiration, and delight wee ſhould haue in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, therefore wee muſt iudge our ſelues for our deſerts,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14246:31"/>
and labour by prayer to forme theſe deſires in vs: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when in hearing, or reading any thing concerning God, we finde our hearts begin to be affected, we muſt ſtriue to nouriſh and inflame theſe deſires or delights, or Rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for then God is neere: for vſually a fire goeth before him (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh) aſwell when hee comes into our hearts as when he comes into the world.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He muſt be a godly man: <hi>for the pure in heart onely ſee God, Mat.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>and without Holineſſe it is impoſſible to ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12. 14. This knowledge requires holineſſe, elſe of all doctrines it proues the dulleſt: diſcourſe and diſputation doth not comprehend God, but holineſſe as one ſaith: and the Reaſon is, becauſe there muſt bee ſome aſſimilation or likeneſſe betweene our mindes and the knowledge of God: for as no parte of the bodie receiues the light but the eye, and the eye receiues it not but as it is like to the light, ſo it is with the minde of man and the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Aboue all other knowledges in Religion, in the doctrine of God he muſt remember the Apoſtles Rule, to bee wiſe to Sobriety, and take heede of curioſity, and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: firſt, that he deuoutly beleeue what he findes ſaid of God in Scripture, without prying or ſifting of things by the iudgement of his owne Reaſon. God would be beleeued on, <note place="margin">Credi ſe voluit deus non iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, non examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, Naz.</note> not iudged or examined: ſecondly, that he inquire not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, which are not reuealed, but reſt in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God made in his Word. The Sunne muſt bee ſeene, as it can be ſeene, and ſo much light muſt bee taken, as can bee had with looking downewards, leſt if wee looke for more light by gazing on the body of the Sunne, our eyes bee not onely dazeled, but our ſight ſwallowed vp and loſt: ſo is it in the knowledge of God. It ſtrengthens and increaſeth the ſight of the minde, if we looke vpon the beames of the euerlaſting Sunne as they ſhine in his word or workes, but if we will needs be ſearching higher after his Maieſty, take heede leſt wee be ſwallowed vp of his glory, <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 25. 27.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And laſtly, hee muſt looke to it, that his head bee not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14246:31"/>
with worldly cares: this knowledge requires a minde ſeperated from the world, at leaſt from the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and violent, and diſtresfull cares about the world, and things thereof, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31, 32, 35.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the excellencie, difficultie, meanes and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the knowledge of God, together with the Rules to bee obſerued for the attaining of the Knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>Three things remaine to be opened, and throughly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What God is or the praiſes of Gods Nature.</item>
                     <item>2. What it is to beleeue in God.</item>
                     <item>3. The Vſes of all.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the right conceiuing of the glorious frame of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, we may ſafely and muſt carefully proceede in this order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee muſt caſt out of our mindes all likeneſſes of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in heauen or earth: God hath flatly prohibited all Images of God, and all tereſtriall likeneſſes, to be ſet vp of him, in our Churches, houſes or hearts: <hi>Commandement</hi> 2. Wee muſt not therefore conceiue that God is like any thing that ſenſe can ſet before vs in heauen or earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt in the next place take heede that we be not inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the miſconceiuing of certaine relatiue attributes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to God in the Scriptures: Many things are ſaid of God in Scripture, by way of ſigne, not by way of Image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which wee muſt ſo thinke of as to vnderſtand what they ſignifie, but not to faſhion in our hearts the reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the words import: for inſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some things are attributed to God Ironically, not properly, as when the Prophet aſcribes deceit vnto God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 10. He ſpeaketh the words of the falſe Prophets ironically, not his owne words: with indignation alledging what they ſaid, which if it were true, God ſhould deceiue the people?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some things are giuen to God <hi>Metonimically:</hi> as when God is ſaid to be our ſtrength and fortitude, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 2. Our ſtrength and valour is not God, but he is ſaid to bee ſo, by effect, becauſe he worketh it in vs: ſo hee is ſaid to bee our ſong, becauſe he is the ſubiect of our ſong, <hi>Exodus</hi> 15. 2.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14246:32"/>
He is called the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe it is hee in whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to hope, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 8. ſo he is called our life <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19, 20. becauſe he giues, preſerues and prolonges our life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some things are giuen to God <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> when the things ſpoken of, are onely found in the creature, and giuen to God by way of ſignification only, or ſome kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon: ſome of theſe <hi>Metaphores</hi> are borrowed from men, ſome from other creatures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From men, as when the parts, members, ſenſes, affections, actions or adiuncts of man, are aſcribed to God: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, God is ſaid to haue a ſoule, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1, 14. which onely notes his nature in a ſpeciall manner of Conception: ſo members are giuen to God: as his face to ſignifie his fauour; eyes to ſignifie his obſeruing of things; Eares to note his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the prayers of his people; Hands to note his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prouidence or working; Armes to note his power, &amp;c. ſo ſenſes are giuen to him, as memorie, forgetfulneſſe, ſeeing, hearing, &amp;c. which are onely ſpoken for our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: ſo are the affections of Ioy, Anger, Hatred, Sorrow, Repentance, Ielouſie, &amp;c. which onely ſignifie after an high manner ſome glory of Gods nature, which but by ſuch compariſons is inexplicable to vs: ſo are the Actions, of Numbering, ſpeaking, hiding his face, tempting, lifting vp his hands, deſcending, going vp on high, walking with men, ſtriking, ariſing, laughing, viſiting, &amp;c. ſo are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts of greatneſſe, time, clothing, bookes, charrets, &amp;c. which things are not in God in the letter but in the ſenſe and ſignification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From other Creatures, as when wings are attributed to him, as he is ſaid to be the Sunne, Light, a Horne of our Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Buckler, conſuming fire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some things are giuen to God <hi>Synechdochically,</hi> as when the Sonne is called the Father of Eternity, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6. the Father and holy Ghoſt are not excluded. When the holy Ghoſt is called ſeauen ſpirits, being but one ſpirit, onely to note the variety and perfection of his working, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:14246:32"/>
Thus of the two Rules for the diſtinct and ſafe informing of our ſelues concerning God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee muſt take heede alſo that wee bee not deceiued about the formes in which God appeared in the Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: for theſe formes were ſanctified for the preſent to the vſe of the beholders to aſſure the preſence of God, or for ſignification, but when they were withdrawne, they were no longer to be thought on, as any formes of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God, and therefore he forbids all likeneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being auoided, we muſt then approach with feare and reuerence to conſider of ſuch things as are attributed to God in Scripture properly.</p>
                  <p>For the cleere vnderſtanding of the doctrine of Gods Nature as it is properly deſcribed in Scripture, wee muſt conſider both of the properties of his Nature, and of the ſubſtance of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the Properties, becauſe theſe are next vnto vs, as I may ſay, or are eaſieſt to be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>The glorious properties of God may bee caſt into two rankes or heads; for ſome of them are ſuch properties as are ſome way in the creatures by way of Reſemblance, certaine ſparkles or dropps are in vs: vpon which is printed a kinde of Image or likeneſſe of God in thoſe things, ſuch are the life, knowledg, holineſſe, and glory of God: ſome of them are ſuch properties in God, as are not ſo much as by any likeneſſe to bee found in any creature in heauen or earth: ſuch are his infinite greatneſſe, eternitie, Immutabilitie, and allſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Attributes are the eaſieſt, and by reaſon of their either effects daily amongſt vs, or likeneſſe to ſome thing in vs, may be profitably firſt ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the Nature of God excells in foure dreadfull and matchleſſe prayſes: or there be foure things in Gods Nature we ſhould euer thinke on with admiration, and adore with all Reuerence and Deuotion, and ſtudie to conceiue of as fully as we can from the ſingular Vſe they haue in the courſe of our liues.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the Life of God.</p>
                  <p>Life in GOD is admirable, and to bee adored in theſe reſpects:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:14246:33"/>
1. Becauſe the life of all liuing creatures in generall is in him: and ſo God is the life and light of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 4. as he giueth being and life to all things: The whole world had bin a <hi>Chaos</hi> of darkneſſe, if God had not giuen it life, which hee planted in ſeuerall creatures by his admirable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in particular hee is after a wonderfull manner the life of vs men.

                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe his knowledge is moſt perfect, hee not onely knowes all things, but he knowes them moſt perfectly: hee knowes not in part as we doe, but exactly: his knowledge cannot be increaſed or diminiſhed: he learnes nothing, hee forgets nothing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 5. And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his knowledge appeares: firſt, in the cleareneſſe and euidence of it: therefore all things are ſaid to be naked before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. and alſo in the diſtinctneſſe of it: he knowes all things not confuſedly, or generally, or in the maſſe or lump onely, as wee are ſaid to know a man that know not a thouſand things in him: thus God knowes very ſparrowes, and the very haires of our heads and the number of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. And this alſo proues the perfection of Gods knowledge, that his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is immutable, he neuer varies, though things may be ſubiect to infinite alterations, yet Gods Knowledge of them is alwaies the ſame: His Knowledge is infallible: fourthly, the perfection of his Knowledge appeares in this, that hee knowes things holily: hee neither adds, nor detracts, and takes any thing according to the outward ſhew or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but he iudgeth not according to the face or perſon, but according to the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe he knowes the things after a manner incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the creatures: for all things the creatures diſcerne, they diſcerne by one of theſe waies; either by ſenſe, as by the miniſtry of the eye or eare, or taſte, or touching, or ſmelling: or elſe they diſcerne things by opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturing or gheſſing at things by their cauſes or the like, or elſe by Faith, when they know things by the report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Or elſe by knowledge framed by reaſoning, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the benefit of certaine propoſitions, to extract from

But God knowes things by none of theſe waies, as being all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as many Reaſons might ſhew. But he knowes them all by his Eſſence, not by any ſenſe or ſpeciall facultie: And that this may bee vnderſtood wee muſt note: Firſt, that the whole Eſſence of God is as it were wholy an eye, or a mind. Secondly, that God is all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ngs by Eminencie. <hi>Deus est om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Eminenter:</hi> as they ſay in Schooles. Thirdly, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all things in himſelfe, and his Eſſence is the example or patterne of all things, and therefore needs but to looke vpon himſelfe, and then he ſees all things as in a glaſſe: our vnderſtanding is imperfect, and therefore depends vpon the Obiects, by which it is as it were coloured, and ſo while it ſtriueth to know other things is driuen to neglect, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it ſelfe, as the glaſſe which is ſo coloured from other things which ſhine in it, that it doth as it were looſe his owne colour: but God being infinite, and independent, is not bound to the things without him to receiue impreſſions from them, but in himſelfe hath the <hi>Ideas</hi> or formes of them, and are but as it were little ſhadowes or ſlender likeneſſes caſt out from the diuine nature. Hence it is that the Knowledge of God is not lyable to the imperfections that cleaue to the things to be knowne without himſelfe: thus he knowes temporall things after an eternall manner, mutable things immutablie, contingent things infalliblie, future things preſently, dependent things independently, created things after an vncreated manner.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Becauſe hee knowes all things <hi>vno intuitu</hi> with one view, all at once: The eye of man beholds many things at once as with one looke it can ſee the Ants in a Mole-hill, but if it will ſee other things, it muſt remoue the ſight. Now the minde of man can at once take in a larger circuit to looke vpon, as a Cittie or Countrey, yea the whole earth, yea the whole world, but it is onely in the lumpe or ball, or whole
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14246:35"/>
maſſe of it: for if it would take the diſtinct contemplation of things, it muſt remoue from forme to forme, and from thought to thought. Now Gods vnderſtanding takes all at once, moſt ſtedfaſtly, and moſt perfectly, and ſo by a way more excellent then all the creatures in heauen or earth. Gods Knowledge is not a ſucceſſiue knowledge, as ours is, to take in things by comparing, or diſtinguiſhing, or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c. for all things without God are but as a center or little point, which with infinite eaſe he diſcernes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt by the way take notice of it, that when wee reade in Scripture of fore-knowledge of things to come, or remembrance of things paſt, that theſe things are called ſo in reſpect of vs, not in reſpect of God. They are not giuen to God properly, but are tearmes borrowed from our vſe, the more diſtinctly to inform vs of the branches (as it were) of Gods knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Becauſe Gods knowledge of things hath ſuch force in it; that when and where hee will, hee can make the Creature feele the warmth and comfort of the knowledge of him. It is a knowledge that hath influences vpon ſome creatures: It refreſheth and worketh more vpon the ſoule, then the Beames of the Sunne vpon the bodie. Thus when God is ſaid to know the way of the Righteous, or their ſoules in aduerſity, or the like, the knowledge is not a bare taking notice, but an acknowledgement, or making of them to know, that he knowes them, or a powerfull ſetting of the beames of his knowledge ſo vpon them, that they are thereby preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That goodneſſe of Nature that is in God himſelfe, is known onely to himſelfe in the fulneſſe of it: onely two things wee muſt conceiue of by way of glimpſe: The one that he is good by his Eſſence.

The other is, that hee is good in a moſt vnutterable degree: and therefore is called the chiefe good, of all things to be deſired, and without whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can partake of goodneſſe, and in whom is no mixture of any euill. And in reſpect of the goodneſſe in himſelfe, hee is auouched by our Sauiour Chriſt to be onely good. None hath an independent originall goodnes but God.

The ſecond is their enmity, God is prouoked by men that are his profeſſed enemies, and therefore might conceiue iuſt furie againſt them, there being no reaſon why he ſhould pittie or ſpare them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it adds to the prouocation that they are his creatures: the worke of his owne hands; they rebell againſt him that were made by him, and therfore the indignity of the offence is the greater. Fourthly, their impotencie, he needs not feare them, he might blow them away at once as a little duſt of the Ballance: he could deſtroy them with frogges, and lice, and flies: and for the euills by which he is prouoked, what
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14246:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man or Angell can deſcribe the haynouſneſſe of them? what heart of man can conceiue the horror of the ſinnes of the whole world. All the Commandements of God being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by euery man, many of their ſinnes committed with an high hand, crying to heauen for vengeance, Treaſons daily and euery where, and theſe committed before the very face of God, no place ſo ſacred, but wretched men dare offend there, the frame of tranſgreſſion beginning from the womb, and holding on to the graue, and the offendors relapſing by breaking their vowes and couenants, from time to time, and to make vp all, that Trayterous man ſhould yeeld himſelfe to bee wholly gouerned, and led forth againſt God by the diuell the Arch-enimy of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we conſider who God is that endures all this: hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Holineſſe and Iuſtice, infinitely hating ſin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing wrath againſt ſinners, and whoſe Office it is to bee the Iudge of the world, and hath power to Plague all often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at his will, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1. 2. 3.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the Teſtimonie of God is Authenticall. His Word is onely fit to iudge in all controuerſies: God is true, and all men are lyars. It is a moſt blaſphemous impiety, to deny vnto the God of Truth the fulneſſe of ſufficiencie to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie or conclude in the things of his owne glory: what men ſay may bee falſe, but what God ſaith muſt bee true.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning the wofull eſtate of all men that liue in their ſinnes without Repentance: Oh how fearefull is their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, when all the curſes written in Gods Booke, muſt vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidablie bee executed vpon them? God will not repent him of the leaſt word in his Threatnings: Hee is God and not man that he ſhould repent, 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 15. 29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That true Religion will preuaile: It may bee reſiſted and ouerwhelmed for a time, but they ſhal not proſper that hate the Truth. The Truth will get vp againe, and ouercome, becauſe God is Truth, and the power of his Truth is as great as the force of any other his Attributes.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Truth of God: His Righteouſneſſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                  <p>His Righteouſneſſe is to bee conſidered more generally or more ſpecially: in generall the Righteouſneſſe of God is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in Scripture ſix waies:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe in himſelfe hee is moſt pure and holy, without any vice, ſinne, defect or blemiſh; aboue all that Holineſſe can be found in all or any of the creatures, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 2. 1. <hi>Samuel</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in all his dealings he is moſt iuſt, he doth no wrong, there is no iniquity in him, his waies are neuer vnequall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he is Author of all the Holineſſe is in the creatures,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14246:45"/>
they haue nothing, but what they haue receiued, they haue all their Holineſſe by participation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe his Righteouſnes for eminency is like great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and for vnſearchableneſſe is like a great deepe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 7. <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe hee executes Iuſtice in all places and at all times there are yeerely ſprings of iuſtice from God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe his Righteouſneſſe cannot be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>In particular his Iuſtice is to bee conſidered either towards godly men, or towards wicked men: firſt, then of his iuſtice towards godly men.</p>
                  <p>The iuſtice of God towards godly men is deſcribed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either as it is his iuſtice of Anger, or his iuſtice of Grace.</p>
                  <p>The iuſtice of his anger towards the godly: he hath ſhewed two waies,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Towards their ſuretie, Chriſt Ieſus; and how fearefully he was diſpleaſed with ſinne euen in them, may appeare, in that he ſpared not his owne Sonne, but abaſed him to the very condition of a ſeruant, expoſed him to the temptations of the diuels, and the diſgraces and oppoſitions of vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and laid vpon him all the curſes of the Law; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to death, euen the death of the Croſſe, powred out vpon him his fierce wrath when he made his ſoule a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſinne, ſo as for very paine hee ſweat bloud, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>The iuſtice of his Grace is that wonderfull qualification of his wrath by an agreement as it were betweene his grace and his iuſtice, which hee ſhewes vnto them by many admirable conſolations.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it is his Iuſtice, and hee confeſſeth himſelfe to bee bound to them in Iuſtice.</p>

                  <p>The Vſes of this Iuſtice of God towards the godly, may be <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> either for inſtruction or for incouragement: It ſhould teach the godly three things: Firſt, with <hi>Dauid</hi> to meditate of, and to make mention of Gods Righteouſneſſe euen of his onely, there being no Iuſtice in the world like to Gods Iuſtice, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo much diſlike of ſinne, and with ſo much grace too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 15. <hi>vlt.</hi> Secondly, it ſhould breed in them a ſingular feare of offending, ſeeing God is ſo Iuſt, as to purſue ſin euen in his owne.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14246:46"/>
becauſe I haue ſinned againſt him, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 7.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the conſideration of Gods Righteouſneſſe and Iuſtice may be a great incouragement to godly men: for thence it will follow, that he that doth righteouſneſſe is certainely of God, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 29. As they diſcerne righteouſneſſe to grow and increaſe in them, ſo they may aſſure themſelues, that they grow more and more like God, yea, that God himſelfe doth faſhion them for himſelfe: and againe, is God righteous, then he will loue righteouſneſſe, and make much of ſuch as any way reſemble him, in true righteouſneſſe. The righteous Lord loueth righteouſneſſe, and his countenance doth behold the Iuſt ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 11. 7. Laſtly, what can bee more comfortable then that God ſhould acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bound in his Iuſtice to doe ſuch excellent things for vs as is before mentioned: We ſhould therefore ſtudie theſe things, and thinke on them all the day, that our hearts may bee daily refreſhed by them.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Iuſtice of God towards godly men. The Iuſtice of God towards wicked men now followes.</p>
                  <p>Gods Iuſtice towards wicked men is comprehended briefefly in two Heads: The firſt is his Hatred of them: their ſinnes doe ſtirre vp in God an vnmeaſurable loathing of them, ſo as nothing can be ſo loathſome to vs, as euery wicked man is to God. His very ſoule doth abhorre him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 5. The ſecond is the Recompence he will giue him. The vengeance of God ſhall light vpon the head of all the wicked: and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence comprehends no leſſe then all the curſes contained in the booke of God: By the bitterneſſe whereof God will purſue the wicked man in his life, and in his death, and then for euer after torment him with vnſpeakeable Horror in Hell.</p>
                  <p>Now that this doctrine of Gods Iuſtice may bee the more effectuall, in ſtead of prouing it by teſtimonies, I would eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vrge two things: firſt, I would giue certaine Reaſons or demonſtrations which may throughly confirme it, That God will not bee a whit better affected towards the wicked, and that his wrath is fully as great as it is ſaid to be in the Word of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14246:47"/>
God, and rather more then any created words can vtter: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I would take off their obiections. Firſt, I would proue it to bee moſt <hi>Terrible,</hi> and then moſt vnauoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>That God will bee exceeding <hi>Terrible</hi> in Iuſtice againſt wicked men, may appeare to any reaſonable minde by theſe Arguments, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the wrath of Kings bee as the Roaring of Lyons, and as meſſengers of death, how fearefull then is the wrath of the King of Kings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is one of Gods Titles, hee is thus ſtiled: <hi>The terrible God, Nehemiah</hi> 9. 32. 33.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may be gathered from the terror of his rebukes in this life in his word or prouidence: his rebuks are called <hi>furious rebukes, Ezek.</hi> 5. 13. and they are called ſharpe arrowes ſhot into the hearts of the Kings enemies, <hi>Pſal</hi> 45. 5. Now if his rebukes bee ſo terrible, what will the full declaration and execution of his whole diſpleaſure be?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The wonderfull wrath of God againſt ſinners may appeare by his Iudgements abroad in the world whether wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the number of the effects of them: Are there not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and changes of ſorrowes with which the Lord doth vex euery part of the world? And doth not the Lord by common Plagues ſweepe away thouſands of men by Warres, Peſtilence, Famine, &amp;c. and beſides are not ſtrange puniſhments euery day heere and there vpon the workers of iniquity? What heart of man can ſtand before that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wrath of God, when he purſues the ſinnes of the Fathers vpon the children? But aboue all theſe temporall Plagues are thoſe ſpirituall iudgements executed vpon worlds of men, whoſe ſoules are ſmitten with worſe then <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkeneſſe, ſhut out from the viſion or ſenſe of God, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed really by diuells, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If we thinke ſeriouſly vpon the examples of men, that haue felt the bitterneſſe of Gods diſpleaſure: and they that haue felt it, can beſt tell how terrible it is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Looke vpon thoſe wicked men mentioned, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 6. they were Captaines and Princes, and mighty men of the earth,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14246:47"/>
and when they cry out to haue the Mountaines to fall vpon them, onely to hide them from the face of the Lambe: Let Chriſt come in the moſt amiable manner that he can, onely let him tell the wicked of Gods Iuſtice, and the ſtouteſt hearted fall into thoſe fearefull Agonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Looke vpon godly men, that otherwiſe are Gods people, yet when God is angry with them, for a ſeaſon for their ſins, in what grieuous caſe haue they bin in: <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid his meate was aſhes, and hee mingled his teares with his drinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the indignation of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. and if iudgement begin at the houſe of God, &amp; be ſo ſharpe, where ſhall the ſinners and wicked appeare, when the righteous doe not eſcape? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18. reade but the Booke of <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and you ſhall finde that the Church had ſearched all the world ouer to finde out fearefull and grieuous things, to ſhadow out their ſorrowes and diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eſpecially what heart of man can looke vpon Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of Gods Loue, and conſider his grieuous Agonies when he felt the wrath of God: Hee was but a ſuretie for ſinne, had neuer done any thing to offend his Father, and yet when hee feeles Gods wrath it makes him ſweat for paine, yea he ſweates bloud: Oh can it be that men ſhould be ſo ouercome with ſpirituall dotage, as to thinke Gods Iuſtice may be more eaſie towards them, that are the parties offending, then it was towards Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>And as the Iuſtice of God towards the wicked is terrible, ſo it is vnauoidable.</p>
                  <p>If they ſay their riches ſhall ranſome them, they muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that a great ranſome cannot deliuer them: God will not eſteeme their riches, nor their gold, nor all their forces of ſtrength, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 19. Beſides riches can flie away in the day of Gods wrath, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 28. and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, yet God can bring men into ſtraits in the middeſt of their ſufficiencie, and raine vpon them the furie of his wrath euen they are is eating, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 22. 23.</p>
                  <p>Nor will their ſinnes be forgotten, for they are written with a penne of Iron, and with a point of a Diamond yea, they are grauen vpon their owne Hearts: and rather then God would
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14246:48"/>
want witneſſes, the heauens ſhould declare their wickedneſſe, and the earth ſhould riſe vp againſt them, <hi>Ieremie</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 27.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it eaſe them, that they ſee that godly men ſuffer the ſame afflictions that they doe: they may not gather from thence that God is no more diſpleaſed with them, then hee is with the moſt Religious: for there is a great deale of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the fire with which God melts his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants as in a Furnace, and the fire of his enemies: for in the one God onely intends to refine and purifie his ſeruants, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee intends to conſume his enemies: hee reſpects the ſtrength of his ſeruants, but reſpects the ſinne of his enemies, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 11. <hi>Ier.</hi> 46. 28.</p>
                  <p>Nor may they ſay there are no Paſſions in God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wrath: for though it be true, that Paſſions are not in God, as they are in man, yet that little helpes them, but rather increaſeth the terror, becauſe wrath is in God after a way agreeable to his nature, farre aboue that wrath can bee in man: Mans anger is mutable and finite, Gods anger is immutable &amp; infinite. And to beate this into the heads of wicked men, God doth aſcribe to himſelfe not onely the words of anger and wrath, but of loathing with his ſoule, iealouſie, furie, ſmiting with the hands, &amp;c. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. 18. 19. and the more to affect men, when God is deſcribed as angry, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire is ſaid to goe before him, and darkeneſſe to bee round about him, the earth trembling vnder him, and the hills melting at the preſence of God, and the heauens remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of their place, &amp;c. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 97. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Eſay</hi> 13. 13.</p>
                  <p>Nor may they thinke to finde meanes to eſcape: for the Lord hath a mighty arme, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 89. 14. and hee hath his ſanctified ones, and his mighty ones, whom he commands for his Anger, <hi>Eſay</hi> 13. 3. and to ſhew that there can be no reſiſting, he is compared to conſuming fire, and to a continuall whirle-winde vpon the head of the wicked, which ſhal not returne till it hath accompliſhed the minde of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>Ieremie</hi> 30. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If they ſay wee haue eſcaped hitherto, I anſwer, that though
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14246:48"/>
his heart be ſet in wickedneſſe, becauſe ſentence is not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, yet he ſhall not prolong his daies; though he doe euill an hundred times, the wrath of the Lord hangs ouer his head and will fall downe at length, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36.</p>
                  <p>Nor will their going to Church, or outward ſeruing of God ſomtimes ſerue their turne: for God wil not accept of thouſands of Rammes nor Riuers of Oyle, nor if they would Sacrifice the Sonnes of their bodies, for the ſinnes of their ſoules, yet it will not auaile them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>If they thinke that God that made them, will pittie them, and not deſtroy them, they are deceiued: for the Lord hath anſwered long ſince that he would not ſpare them; though he made them, yet he would not haue compaſſion on them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 11.</p>
                  <p>If they thinke to eſcape becauſe they are ſuch a multitude, they are therein alſo deceiued: for the viſion is concerning the multitude and wrath is vpon all the multitude <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 12. 13, 14. the glory and pompe, and the multitude ſhall goe downe into hell, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 13, 14. Nations that forget God ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 16.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it eaſe them to thinke how hard a courſe this will be thought to be by all ſorts of men: for God will be iuſtified in his ſayings, and cleare himſelfe though they condemne him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. 4. hee will not reſpect the wiſe in heart, <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 24.</p>
                  <p>Neither may they perſiſt in their wilfull pretending that God is mercifull, and they can ſhew it by diuers Scriptures, that God hath bound himſelfe to ſhew wonderfull mercy to ſinners: for all that mercy belongs to the godly onely: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God hath expreſlely declared himſelfe, that if any man hearing the curſes of Gods Law, ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in his heart, God will not be mercifull to that man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19.</p>
                  <p>Finally they may not be confirmed againſt the feare of Gods Iuſtice, by the teſtimonie of ſuch Miniſters as haue publikely or priuately, incouraged them by promiſing peace and mercy, and contradicting the Doctrine of other Miniſters that haue ſoundly vrged the ſeuerity of Gods Iuſtice: for God by the

Prophet, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth at large threaten that hee will breake downe thoſe walles of vaine confidence which haue bin built in the hearts of wicked men, he will finde a time, when their daubing with vntempered morter ſhall be found by the ſinner himſelfe, to bee vtterly without any foundation of Truth, ſee the place at large, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the portion of the wicked, and this is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage he ſhall haue from the Almighty, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 29.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of Gods Iuſtice toward wicked men may ſerue for wonderfull abaſement and humiliation to men that liue in their ſinnes without repentance. Oh is it poſſible, can thy heart indure to heare all this, or can euer thy hands bee ſtrong when the Lord ſhall haue to doe with thee? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 14. Oh woe to him that ſtriues with his Maker, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Oh but what muſt we doe, is there no remedie for vs, muſt we deſpaire? I anſwer no, but rather feare this dreadfull God, for according to his feare will his anger bee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 11. and with all poſſible ſpeede and earneſtneſſe humble thy ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and inſomuch as by this doctrine thou maiſt ſee what neede thou haſt of a Sauiour to quench all this heate of Anger, flie to Chriſt Ieſus, and neuer ceaſe begging of mercy from him to thy ſoule. The wrath of God is ſuch a fire as all the water in the Sea cannot quench: It is a fire can bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched onely with bloud and teares. No bloud will doe it but the bloud of Chriſt, and no teares but the teares of the offender himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And let men take heede of Procraſtination, for euen the longer men ſtay in ſinne, the fiercer will his fire grow: GOD heapes vp wrath as men heap vp ſinne.

                  <p n="3">3.

Thus God is ſaid to be light and to dwell in the light which no man can approach vnto, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. and thus hee is the King of all Kings.</p>
                  <p>And in this abſolute Glory, God doth excell all the Kings of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe his Glory is aboue all praiſe and bleſſing: ſo is not theirs, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 3.</p>

                  <p>Thus of his abſolute Glory.</p>
                  <p>The Glory of God as it is in relation, is either internall or externall.</p>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:14246:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The internall Glory of God as it is in relation, is the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Glory, and ſo is the Glory either that is proper to each Perſon in the Trinity, or elſe that peculiar Glory of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Trinity, as he is called the brightneſſe of his Fathers Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>The externall Glory is that which comes vnto God from the creatures as hee ſtands in relation to them: and ſo his Glory ſhines:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In his workes, which are therefore called his Glory, and ſo both his works of <hi>Creation, Pſal.</hi> 19. 1. and his workes of Iuſtice vpon the wicked, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 6. 7. and his workes of Mercy in deliuering and ſauing his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 102 15. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 108. 5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 5. and workes of omnipotencie and wonder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4.</p>

                     </hi> 10. 4. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 22, 23. or elſe ſuch as hee giues in heauen in the preſence of his Glory to the Saints, and this was that Glory of God which <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In his word, eſpecially the Goſpel, which is the doctrine of the Glory of the bleſſed God, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In his children <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he calls them his Glory. <hi>Eſay</hi> 46. 13. and ſo are the godly called, becauſe they reſemble God, and in that reſpect excell all other people. All other men haue therefore failed of Gods Glory, becauſe they haue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his Image, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>And in theſe foure waies of relation God is glorious, but it is with a glory which himſelfe hath printed and ſtamped vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of glory which is in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo called Gods glory, and that is the glory which the reaſonable creature giues vnto God: and conſiſts eſpecially in conceiuing gloriouſly of God, and in praiſing of God, and in worſhipping of God, and in obedience, and ſo God is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14246:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
glorious in that he doth continually receiue all ſorts of praiſe and adoration from the creatures both in heauen and earth.</p>
                  <p>And in reſpect of this true glory which is giuen vnto God, God doth excell in glory, all the great Kings and Potentates that euer were in the world. The very <hi>Angels</hi> in heauen doe admire this glory of God on earth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 3. and ſo his glory excells:</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe in all the glory or praiſe giuen to the creatures, the firſt and chiefe glory is due to God: their glory is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it indureth for euer and euer, no end of his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of worſhip, for that is a glory onely due to God: no creature in heauen or earth may take it, or can receiue it without infinite danger, 'tis a glory he will not giue to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of Obedience: and ſo diuers waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the obedience due to God is from all perſons in the world: and ſuch an authority neuer had any mortall man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the obedience the creature owes to God is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall and vnlimited and without exception, whereas the obedience Princes can haue is a limited obedience, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, men muſt obey them ſo as they command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt Gods Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe his kingdome is an euerlaſting kingdome, there ſhall be no end of obeying him: whereas the time wilcome,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14246:51"/>
when no obedience at all ſhall be due to Princes, and that is when <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God the Father, and ſhall no more rule men by the miniſterie of men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the glory of men can bee no way comparable to the glory of God: becauſe all their glory they haue receiued from him: for God is ſaid to be the God of glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2. the King of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 10. the Father of glory, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe ſhould bee firſt for inſtruction: and ſo it ſhould chiefely teach vs to acknowledge this glory of God, to giue glory vnto God, and by all meanes to aſcribe glory to him: It is a ſingular wrong not to giue God his glory. Now wee giue God glory three waies:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In our hearts: and ſo diuerſly: firſt, when wee labour to fill our hearts with the knowledge of Gods glory in all the branches of it: the earth ſhould bee filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God as the waters couer the ſeas, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 14. ſecondly, when our hearts ſtand ſtill and wonder, and admire at the glory of the Lord, our hearts are not rightly affected towards God till they bee inflamed and rauiſhed with the contemplation of his excellencie and bleſſedneſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 12. thirdly, we giue God glory when wee beleeue in him, and from our hearts truſt him in things that bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vnlikely to come to paſſe. Thus <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 20. fourthly, when we mourne and ſorrow for our ſins: for men are ſaid to giue glory to God when they repent of their ſinnes, <hi>Reuelation</hi>

                     </gap>6. 9. fifthly, when we doe from our hearts reioyce at any thing that excells in Gods Word or workes any way, acccounting our ſelues the more happie that God is honoured or glorified any way: ſixthly, when in all ſeruice done to God, we conceiue of him, with the higheſt degree of reuerence and excellency we can: enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him into our hearts as the very King of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In our words: and ſo we giue glory to God diuers waies alſo, as firſt, when men confeſſe ſecret wickedneſſe openly, finding themſelues ſought after, and purſued by God: Thus

                     <hi>Achan</hi> gaue glory to God <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> 7. and thus the ſinner when he feeles the rebukes, or chaſtiſements of God ſhould humble himſelfe and confeſſe his wickedneſſe before the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 15, 16. <hi>Malachie</hi> 2. 2. ſecondly, when men giue him praiſe and thanks for his mercies with all poſſible affection, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 18. So the Samaritane gaue glory to God, when hee gaue thankes for the cure of his Leproſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thirdly, when men acknowledge the hand of God and his prouidence: ſee <hi>Reuel.</hi> 11. 13. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 5. fourthly, when in diſcourſe men talke of the ſingular praiſes of God: and ſo we ſhould make his praiſe glorious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 2. our mouthes ſhould bee filled with his praiſe and with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor all the day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 96. 2, 3, 4. fifthly, when men take away praiſe from the creature, and ſo from themſelues and giue God onely the glory, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 17. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 12. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In our workes we giue glory to God: and ſo firſt by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying his Sonne: by acknowledging and praiſing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of Ieſus Chriſt; and ſubmitting our ſelues to his ordinances, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 4. and ſo alſo when wee honour them that feare God and beare his Image: ſecondly, when men abound in good workes and the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and grow in grace and knowledge, and ſo make the Image of God more and more euident, ſuffering themſelues to be ſo framed by the doctrine of the Goſpell, as to bee changed from glory to glory by the power of the Word, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 10. 11. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 6. thirdly, when men worſhip God in the beauty of holineſſe, not onely putting on their beſt clothes, when they come to ſerue God, but clothing themſelues with their beſt deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and affections, and reuerence, and humble adoration, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 28, 29. fourthly, when men ſubmit themſelues vnto God, and let him doe with them whatſoeuer he will: they that aſcribe dominion to him, aſcribe glory to him, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 10. 11. Laſtly, when men doe all that they doe to the glory of God, ſtudying how God may bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged or praiſed for all they doe, being in all things ſome way to the praiſe of his glory, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:14246:52"/>
Thus we ſhould learne from hence to giue God honour and glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing God is ſo wonderfull glorious, we ſhould be carefull by all meanes to get the knowledge of his glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, that we may throughout our liues be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in the contemplation of his glory: which that we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto, we muſt looke to theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt reſort to, and loue his houſe, for that is the place on earth where his glory dwells, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 63. 3. there he keepes the court of his Maieſty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt pray for the ſpirit of Reuelation, to open the eyes of our vnderſtanding, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt not be without an effectuall faith: for if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue we ſhall ſee his glory, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 40.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt reſt in theſe deſcriptions and praiſes of God and continue in his Word, and be ſure we change not his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into that which is abhomination to him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 106. 20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt be ſure to repent of our ſinnes and be truely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all wicked men muſt needs bee in a wofull eſtate, and that in three reſpects: firſt, becauſe this glory is departed from them: ſince the time ſinne came into their hearts, they haue failed of the glory of God: they haue loſt the glory of God, in that they haue loſt the Image of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe their fooliſh hearts are ſo full of darkeneſſe, that they cannot ſee the glory of God, they want all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and warmth ariſeth from the view and contemplation of the Sunſhine of Gods glory: they cannot get ſo much as the benefit of a good conceit of God, a vaile lyeth vpon their hearts, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 10. thirdly, becauſe the time will come when God will confound their hearts with the terror of his Iuſtice, and the Maieſty of his glory, when hee ſhall fight againſt them to deſtroy them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 10. 19.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this ſhould bee a wonderfull conſolation to Gods children, and that in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this God that is ſo bleſſed, and full of Maieſty, ſo adored by all creatures, this God: I ſay ſo glorious, is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14246:53"/>
their God: they haue his fauour in a high degree, and by couenant hath giuen himſelfe to be theirs for euer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe God hath called them to glory, and will glorifie them with himſelfe in the Kingdome of Heauen, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 4. and in the meane time:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God accounts his people in a manner all the glory he hath in earth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 46. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of glory and of God reſteth vpon them, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God accounts it a part of his glory to helpe them in all their afflictions, and to forgiue them their ſinnes. And in theſe two things affliction and ſinne lyeth all the diſcomfort of life in effect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 9. and his glory ſhall be their Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to guard them from dangers, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 8.</p>

                  <p>Thus of the glory of God, and ſo of the firſt ſort of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes: that is, thoſe Attributes which they call communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which are ſo in God, as ſome print or likeneſſe of them are in the creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Incommunicable Attributes follow, and theſe are in God, as they ſay in Schooles, <hi>à Priori,</hi> the other <hi>à Poſteriori:</hi> onely I haue handled the former firſt, as moſt eaſie for vs to vnderſtand, but leſt the tearmes of communicable Attributes ſhould trouble the ignorant Reader, hee muſt conſider that when we ſay theſe Attributes are communicable, wee doe not meane, that they are communicable in reſpect of eſſence, but in reſpect of Act, effect, or Vſe.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, the goodneſſe of God is not communicated to good Angels or men, but the effect of it, which makes them good. If God ſhould communicate nothing, there would be nothing at all: and if he ſhould communicate his owne eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls, hee ſhould make as many Gods as hee produced things. In ſhort, theſe Attributes are affirmed of God in the Abſtract,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14246:53"/>
but of men or Angels in the Concret, God is Goodnes, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Iuſtice. Men are onely good, wiſe, Iuſt.</p>
                  <p>The incommunicable Attributes are ſo in God, as they can be found in no creature, nor any likeneſſe of them. And theſe are three, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his infinite greatneſſe, his eternity, and his immutability. And theſe three as they are not found in any thing but God, ſo are they as it were ſpread and powred out through all the Attributes of the firſt ſort: for God is Infinite. Eternall, and Immutable, in Wiſedome, Holineſſe, Life and Glory. And ſo theſe Proprieties are as it were the Adiuncts or proprieties of the other Attributes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then of the infinite greatneſſe of God.</p>
                  <p>The infinite greatneſſe of God, is that eſſentiall propriety in God by which hee is ſignified to be, of himſelfe, actually and ſimply beyond all bounds, limits and meaſure: and ſo his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite greatneſſe or immenſiueneſſe comprehends:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. His perfection of Nature.</item>
                     <item>2. His Omnipreſence or Vbiquity.</item>
                     <item>3. His Incomprehenſibleneſſe.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, his perfection of Nature is ſuch, as admits no bounds, nor limits, nor meaſures: becauſe he is without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of partes: and becauſe hee is all hee is in act, not in power or poſſibility: and becauſe his goodneſſe, Iuſtice Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c. is ſo great as nothing can be added to them to make them greater, <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>vlt.</hi> and the conſideration heereof may,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Humble vs: what are we, duſt and aſhes, vile, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creatures, that wee ſhould bee fauoured or accepted of God, who is ſo infinite in the glory and goodneſſe of his Nature: euen the more perfect God is, the more our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections might trouble vs, and at the leaſt make vs ſerue him with more feare and trembling.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Teach vs: we ſhould follow the exacteſt patterne: and none like God, we ſhould therefore bee followers of him, that we may bee perfect, as our heauenly Father is perfect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>vlt.</hi>

                  <p>For the ſecond, the Omnipreſence of God is that vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſſe of his Nature, by which hee is whereſoeuer the creature is, or any place is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 8, 9. <hi>Iſay</hi> 66. 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 24. thus God fills all things and penetrateth into all things cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed or defined with no ſpaces of any places, reaching to whatſoeuer either is or can be thought within or without the world. And which is the more maruellous his whole eſſence is in the whole world, and in euery part of it, whole in this whole world, and whole without the world, ſhut in no where, nor ſhut out any where, containing all things, and contained of nothing. He may be truely ſaid to be euery where, and no where, as he is contained of nothing. Nor is hee thus preſent with all things onely by his power, but by his eſſence, for it muſt needs be a childiſh thing to imagine an infinite power to proceede from a finite eſſence. The cauſe then of his vbiquitie, <note place="margin">Deus eſt Sphaera: cuius centrum eſt vbique. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14246:54"/>
from wicked men or godly men: from wicked men he departs, when he hath not mercy on them, or when hee takes away the meanes of grace and lets them fall into hardneſſe of heart and ſo into perdition, or when he takes away the bleſſings he had giuen them. He departs from godly men either when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes the ſenſe of his grace and fauour from their ſinnes or ſeemes to deny them helpe or deliuerance in their diſtreſſes. He returnes to the godly both inwardly and outwardly: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly when he reſtores the ſenſe of his fauour and the ioy of his Saluation, and when he goeth on to worke Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in them.

                  <p>The conſideration of Gods Omnipreſence and Vbiquity may ſerue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For information: and ſo to ſhew how much we are bound vnto God that will dwell amongſt vs, and keepe houſe in the Sanctuarie. He wants not a place to be in, that fills all places and cannot bee contained in the Heauen of Heauens, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 17. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For inſtruction: and ſo it ſhould teach vs diuers things: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to abuſe Gods preſence in his houſe, ſo as to thinke that place or any other doth containe him; or to commit that Idolatry as to worſhip a God that can be compaſſed about with a Church wall, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To take heede of ſinning, though it bee in ſecret: becauſe God is in euery place, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 23. 24. Yea, to auoid the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hypocriſie of the heart: becauſe he is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and ſees and ſtands by euery offence committed, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 4. 12. and ſees and heares all wee ſay and doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſtriue to bring our ſelues to a continuall remembrance of Gods preſence, and accordingly to walke before him in all vprightneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſerues to ſhew the miſerle and folly of wicked men: they can neuer eſcape or flie from the wrathfull hand of GOD: whitherſoeuer they runne GOD is there, nor can any of

their faults be hid from him, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 1. 2. 3. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhewes the folly of the Papiſts that direct to either hee or ſhee Saint, to bring vs or our ſuits to God: God is not farre from vs, but alwaies preſent with vs, and therefore wee neede none of them to bring vs to God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it ſerues for great conſolation to the godly in all their troubles and dangers, and againſt all the practizes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes of their aduerſaries: nothing can befall them but what God ſees, and they neede not feare, becauſe God is alwaies by them to helpe them, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Eſay</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus of the omnipreſence of God.</p>
                  <p>His incomprehenſibleneſſe, is that dreadfull tranſcendencie of the nature of God, whereby it paſſeth our vnderſtanding, ſo as his eſſence cannot bee fully conceiued of by vs: ſo as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporeall places, nor ſpirituall vnderſtanding can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine God. His omnipreſence makes him bigger then all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his incomprehenſibleneſſe bigger then any created minde, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 3. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>The incomprehenſibleneſſe of God is not without vſe, for it may ſerue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To confute the makers and worſhippers of Images, ſeeing God is aboue all that which any minde can conceiue, and therefore much more then any picture can expreſſe: They ſinne fearefully, therefore in offering to vs a God that can be ſet out by ſo poore a reſemblance. Images therefore are worthily called by the Prophet teachers of Lies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To teach vs to worſhip God with all our mindes, and all our hearts, and all our might, ſtriuing to admire and adore, and daily to bleſſe his vnſearchable greatneſſe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 145. 2, 3. And for our direction in the right conceiuing of God, we ſhould therefore wholy reſt vpon that way, and thoſe deſcriptions he hath made of himſelfe in his word, ſeeing elſe our vnderſtandings would erre altogether in gheſſing at that which it cannot take in.</p>
                  <p>Thus of Gods infinite greatneſſe, his eternity followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:14246:55"/>
If God be conſidered in himſelfe he is infinite: if in reſpect of our vnderſtanding he is incomprehenſible: if in reſpect of our ſenſes he is inuiſible: if in reſpect of our words he is ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: if in reſpect of place he is incircumſcriptible: and if in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of duration or continuance he is eternall.</p>
                  <p>Some things haue both beginning and end, as the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <note place="margin">Aeternus dicitur quaſi extra ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum.</note> and bruit beaſts, and theſe are ſaid to bee temporall. Some things haue beginning and no end, as men and Angels, and theſe are ſaid to bee perpetuall: One thing hath neither beginning nor end which is GOD and he is ſaid to bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
                  <p>A thing is ſaid to be eternall, either improperly or properly: improperly, and ſo two waies: Firſt, when a thing is ſaid to laſt a long while: and ſo the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion were ſaid to endure for euer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. Secondly, when a thing hath no end which yet had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo Angels, diuels, the ſoules of men, Heauen and Hell are eternall But properly God onely is eternall, becauſe he hath neither beginning nor end, or is the beginning without beginning, and the end without end.</p>
                  <p>Or this difference in the continuance of things may be fitly expreſt by the deſcription of eternity made by <hi>Boetius.</hi> Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the interminable, totall, perfect and together pleaſant poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of life: for in this deſcription each word makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene things in their duration: for firſt, ſome things ſo continue that they haue both beginning and end, as the bruit beaſts, theſe are barred out by the word interminable. Againe, ſome things are interminable in reſpect of eſſence, but haue no life as the heauen of the bleſſed: Thirdly, ſome things are interminable, both in reſpect of eſſence and life, but their life is miſerable and painefull, as the ſpirits in hell: and ſo they haue not pleaſant poſſeſſion of life: Fourthly, ſome things haue an interminable pleaſant poſſeſſion of life, but it is not totall: as all the bleſſed in heauen before the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for they haue a pleaſant poſſeſſion of life, but it is in their ſoules, not in their bodies: Fifthly, ſome things haue a totall poſſeſſion of pleaſant life, but it is not together: ſo the Angells before the day of iudgement haue a totall poſſeſſion of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14246:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pleaſant life, becauſe their whole Nature liues bleſſedly, but it is not together, becauſe there is euen in the Angells a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Reuelations and ſo of Ioyes, as things are from time to time diſcouered to them: Sixthly, ſome things ſhall haue a totall poſſeſſion of pleaſant life and together too, but it is not abſolutely perfect, taking perfect heere, for that which needs nothing beſides it ſelf to make it happie: and ſo are the Angels and godly men after the day of Iudgement: becauſe though they ſhall then totally and together enioy a bleſſed life, yet they ſhall euen neede their ſuſtentation and preſeruation from God, without whom they could not be; much leſſe be happie: for though their bleſſedneſſe be perfect in their kinde, yet it is not abſolutely ſo, becauſe it is a bleſſedneſſe they haue not of themſelues, but receiued it of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus of Eternitie.</p>
                  <p>Now the Eternity of God is his eſſentiall propriety, by which is ſignified that God can end in no time, nor can haue any beginning according to time, but being more ancient then all time, and more laſting then any end, is abſolutely, alwaies, totally and together without ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>For the explanation of this deſcription, diuers things are to be noted:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that God is wholy without the meaſures of time: though he be eternall yet he is not temporarie: there is a great <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expers temporis.</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> difference betweene eternity and time: for eternity excludes time: he ſaw that, that ſaid, time was the moueable Image of eternity: and he that ſaid, time was the Idoll or Image of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and ſo he that ſaid, time was the flax of eternity. Now when we ſay that time is remoued from God, we meane from his eſſence, not from his workes: fitly the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, that God inhabits eternity, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 19. God dwells in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity but yet in time hee is pleaſed as it were to come out of thoſe habitations of eternity to ſhew himſelfe abroad in time by his effects or workings: and for the manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <note place="margin">Soecula condit rex Soeculorum.</note> he made times or the worlds, and is called King of Ages, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 12. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you muſt note in the deſcription, that I ſay God is without beginning in reſpect of time: which muſt be noted
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14246:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in regard of the doctrine of the eternall generation of the Son of God: for there is a twofold beginning, the one of order, the other of time. In reſpect of order or originall, the Sonne and <note place="margin">Principium ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis non tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris.</note> the holy Ghoſt had a beginning from the Father, but not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in reſpect of time. The beginning in reſpect of order is not excluded out of eternity, but onely the beginning in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it would be noted that it is faid that Gods eternity is abſolute: for ſo it is differenced from all the euerlaſtingnes of the creatures which is not abſolute, but by gift, and <hi>à Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> or a <hi>Parte poſt</hi> as they ſay in Schooles, that is in reſpect of continuance yet to come: whereas Gods eternity is not by grace, but by Nature, and <hi>à Priori,</hi> or a <hi>Parte antè,</hi> that is in reſpect of euerlaſtingnes without beginning as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is to be noted that God is ſaid to be totally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect eternity is ſaid to be nunc ſemper ſlans, and time to be, nunc ſemper fluens.</note> without ſucceſſion; for properly eternity, hath no ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or intermiſſion, or gappes in it, but is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall without any interruption, or innouation.</p>
                  <p>Now in this abſolute, infinite, interminable eternity, as in a moſt vaſt Ocean, ſwimmes that little flowing drop which we call time.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, what wee haue by looking either forwards or backwards, rowed through the ſmall brookes of time paſt or to come, that which we next come to, is this vaſt ſea of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity where we can neuer behold bancke or end.</p>
                  <p>That God is thus eternall, many Scriptures proue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 91. 8, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 102. 27. 28. <hi>Iſay</hi> 43. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57. 19.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of Gods Eternity ſhould teach vs many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</p>

                  <p>Thus of the Eternity of God: His Immutability fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                  <p>In the Immutability of God two things are wonderfull and to be adored.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That he is altogether and euery way vnchangeable.</item>
                     <item>2. That he onely is Immutable.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, that God is altogether and euery way vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable muſt be proued and explained.</p>
                  <p>The abſolute Immutability of God is proued by theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces euidently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 27. 28. <hi>Mal,</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>For the explanation of this Doctrine: two things are to bee noted, firſt, how God is Immutable, and ſecondly, in how many reſpects.</p>
                  <p>For the manner of his Immutability, we muſt know that he is Immutable by Nature and of himſelfe: and ſo hee differs from ſome creatures that haue a kinde of Immutability. As the heauens after they are renewed ſhall neuer be changed, and ſo the ſoules and bodies of the faithfull after the day of Iudge ment: but theſe are thus immutable, by grace, not by Nature, by the gift of God, not of themſelues: whereas Gods immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability depends vpon no other, but hee is ſo abſolutely, and of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now God is Immutable in foure reſpects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In eſſence or ſubſtance, and ſo he cannot bee changed to a-another eſſence or Nature, he cannot die, as hauing Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality alone, hee is alwaies in act, hee hath not poſſibilities,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14246:58"/>
he is not changed ſo much as by motion, neither in reſpect of place or working: not in reſpect of place, becauſe he fills all things, and is ſimply immenſe and infinite: not in reſpect of working, becauſe he onely hath the glory to worke, and yet be quiet in operation and vnmoueable: nor can he be changed by growth or alteration in ſubſtance, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immenſe, he cannot wax bigger by Augmentation, nor leſſer by Diminution: and finally, he cannot be changed by ſuffering from any other, as being that onely eſſence that is impatible. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith that God is alwaies the ſame. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 28. and that the Lord ſtands vpon in his Title, when hee calls himſelfe, <hi>I am, or I am that I am, Exodus</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In nature or proprieties: for all his proprieties are to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting the ſame: ſo he is alwaies omnipotent, omniſcient, moſt holy, wiſe, glorious, &amp;c. As he cannot die in reſpect of ſubſtance ſo he cannot lie in reſpect of attributes, he cannot denie himſelfe or doe vniuſtly, as diuers Scriptures ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In decrees: as is his eſſence, ſo is his Sentence Immutable, his counſell muſt ſtand, and is for euer vnchangeable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. 18. <hi>Eſay</hi> 46.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In promiſes: all his promiſes hee makes in his word are yea and Amen: Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but no iot or ſillable of his Word ſhall paſſe vnſulfilled, which is alſo true of his Threatnings, and of that platforme of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe giuen in the Law of Nature, and expreſt in Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 35. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. as alſo in his Prophecies, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In his Gifts of grace beſtowed vpon his people: and ſo his gifts and callings are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould obiect that God was changed in Eſſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word became fleſh, and God was made man: I anſwer, that though the word was made fleſh, yet his diuine Nature was vnchanged, for neither was the Deity turned into the Humanity, nor was the proprieties of the Humane Nature deriued vnto the diuine, but remaining what hee was <hi>(viz.)</hi> God, he became what he was not <hi>(viz.)</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:14246:58"/>
If any ſhould obiect That motion from place to place is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God: becauſe God is ſaid to depart from ſome men, and returne to other men: That hath bin anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Doctrine of Gods Immenſitie: for God mooues in reſpect of effect in vs, being vnmoued in himſelfe: As a man that rowes in a Boate, looking vpon the bancke, thinkes the bancke goes from him, or comes neerer him, whereas the bancke is vnmoueable, and the motion is in the boate. If wee reſpect Grammer in theſe Phraſes, God ſeemes indeed to bee moued, but if we reſpect a more high and ſecret Philoſophie, wee then vnderſtand thereby that God is vnmoueable, but is ſaid to moue by returning, when by the working of his ſpirit he makes vs returne to him.</p>
                  <p>If any yet obiect, that the Spirit of God was ſaid to moue vpon the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. The anſwer is, that by that ſaying is ſignified no more then that the holy Ghoſt by his power and mouing did cheriſh and ſuſtaine that indigeſted matter, as an Hen that ſits vpon her Egges, to make them fit to bee hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay that Gods ſuffers mutation in his knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee takes in the Apprehenſion of things preſent or to come, and is turned backe to looke vpon things paſt, I anſwer, that though God be full of all knowledge of things paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come, yet he is not caſt backe to that which is paſt, nor ſtands pondering vpon that which is preſent, nor by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is ſtretched towards that which is to come: becauſe God ſees all things with an eternall and vnchangeable view as hath bin ſhewed in the Doctrine of his Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>If any yet obiect, that God ſuffers becauſe he receiues wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from his children, and is blaſphemed by the wicked, and that therefore God ſhould be paſſible. I anſwer, that Paſſions are of two ſorts, ſome tranſmutatiue, ſome Intentionall. Some Paſſions worke a Reall mutation in the Obiect, as when fire heates water, thus Paſſion is tranſmutatiue. Some Paſſions doe onely determine the Action, as when I looke vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, heauen ſuffers <hi>Terminatiuè, non ſubiectiuè,</hi> as they ſay in Schooles, It ſuffers as the obiect of my ſight, but in it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes no change, and this is Paſſion Intentionall: and ſuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14246:59"/>
onely is the Paſſion in God. He ſuffers no alteration from any action of ours, but is onely the obiect or Terme of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons good or euill.</p>
                  <p>If any obiect that God threatned to deſtroy the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould die, and yet hee did not accompliſh it, and that therefore Gods Word and will is mutable: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that thoſe threatnings or predictions were not abſolute but with condition or reſpect, and therefore no change in Gods will. <hi>Niniueh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, if reſpect bee had to their merits, and vnleſſe they repent: Now God is not bound alwaies to expreſſe the condition of his Threatnings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, all legall threatnings had in perpetuall doctrine of them, the condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of repentance annexed: The condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being performed by the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> God deſtroyes them not, yet without change in his will, it being but a conditionall will. And for <hi>Hezekiah</hi> he muſt die, if we reſpect ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet in reſpect of Gods eternall purpoſe, fifteene yeeres muſt bee added: Now this Threatning of death, being a Threatning of Tryall, and containing true grounds of it in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes, ſhewes neither diſſimulation nor mutation in God.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is manifeſted that God is Immutable. That he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is Immutable, is eaſily proued, for that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 27. ſaith of the creatures that they all periſh and wax old as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God remaining the ſame: and that ſome Angels and men ſhall haue Immutable Natures after the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not by nature but by grace, as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes follow: and ſo Gods immutability may ſerue. <note place="margin">Vſes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Inſtruction, and ſo it ſhould teach vs three things: Firſt, Patience in all the changes of this life: God only is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; wee muſt looke for it to be ſubiect to many alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, the Celebration of Gods glorie here. Wee ſhould praiſe him for euer, that is only Eternall, Immortall, and Immutable; 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. 17.

Such, and ſo we ſhould be in our faith, hope, charitie, promiſes, and good workes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Conſolation; and ſo this doctrine ſhould much refreſh all godly Chriſtians, It ſhould giue them ſtrong Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Apoſtle ſayth, and ſo in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe all Gods promiſes ſhall certainly bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as theſe places expreſly ſhew, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. 18. <hi>Wherein, God willing, more aboundantly to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heires of promiſe, the immutability of his Counſell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an oath: That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might haue a strong Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who haue fledde for refuge, to lay hold vpon the hope ſet before vs.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe when wee come to Heauen, we ſhall by grace be made immutable too, for then the Image of God ſhall be perfect in vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:14246:60"/>
Hitherto of the Immutability of God; and ſo of the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of both ſorts.</p>
                  <p>It remaines that we inquire after the Subſtance or eſſence of God, vnto which all theſe glories are attributed, and ſo two things are to be conſidered about the Eſſence of God.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That it is ſpirituall.</item>
                     <item>2. That it is One.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is Spirituall: ſome eſſences haue being only and not life; as the Heauens, Earth, Seas, &amp;c. and amongſt theſe wee muſt not looke for God. Some eſſences haue life, but it is onely bodily life; as trees, beaſts foules: and among theſe gods Eſſence is not. Some things haue a mixt life, partly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and partly ſpirituall: and ſuch is the eſſence of all men, who conſiſt and liue both in body and ſoule: but to find out God, we muſt looke for him only amongſt minds. There are eſſences that are onely mentall and immateriall, but yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded though not of parts, yet of power and act, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells: For, they are neuer in act that which they are in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they are in poſſibility ſtill for diuers things may befall their Natures, and their poſſibilities are finite too, God is then higher then theſe.</p>
                  <p>God then is a minde or Spirit aboue all Spirits humane or Angelicall, vnto which eſſence of his if we adde the former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, we doe fullie difference him from all Creatures. Thus God is an eternall minde, infinite, immutable in life, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, holineſſe and glory.</p>
                  <p>Is God a Spirit, then theſe Vſes will follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we ſhould conceiue nothing bodily or terrene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Vſes.</note> God; when wee thinke of God wee muſt not imagine of him any bodily forme, for that is to make an Idoll.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee muſt hence learne to checke and curbe that naturall deſire in our corrupt hearts to haue God viſible: we ſhould be aſhamed of that ſecret rebellion of our hearts, that are often after a cloſe manner vnquiet and diſcontented, becauſe we doe not ſee our God we ſerue: for God being a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſubſtance muſt needs be inuiſible, and altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible by any ſenſes: hee could not bee a true
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14246:60"/>
GOD, if ſenſes might perceiue him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Since it is Gods glory to bee a Spirit, wee ſhould heartily praiſe him for our glory, which is our ſoules, for that hee hath made vs mindes alſo, and ſo of more excellent eſſence then meere bodies be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhould therefore learne to ſerue God in Spirit and Truth; It is the ſeruice of Spirits that agrees beſt to Gods Nature, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we ſhould therefore moſt ſeeke ſuch things as ſerue for the vſe of Spirits. The treaſures that are ſpirituall are farre more excellent then bodily and earthly things can be, euen for this reaſon, becauſe they bring vs neerer to God, and more properly commend vs to him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing wee are to know about Gods eſſence is, that it is one, and but one. The <hi>Nicen Creed</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> haue it thus: <hi>I beleeue in one God:</hi> which the Apoſtles <hi>Creed</hi> doth affirme too, though not ſo expreſly: for we ſay, <hi>Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God,</hi> not in Gods, importing thereby that there is but one God.</p>
                  <p>Nor is God one by aggregation, or conſent, or kinde, or ſort, but he is one in number. By aggregation a whole heard of cattell is ſaid to be one, by conſent many friends are one: by kinde men and beaſts are one, for they are liuing creatures. By ſort, all men are one, becauſe they haue all one Nature, and are one ſort of creatures: but God is one, none of theſe waies, but in number. And yet to ſay God is one in number is not enough, vnleſſe we adde abſolutely one: for <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle is one man, though there be many other men, but hee is not a man, ſo as there is none but he; whereas God is not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he is <hi>Vnicus</hi> alſo, he is one and but one.</p>
                  <p>That there is but one God theſe Scriptures ſhew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32. 39. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>Concerning therefore meate ſacrificed vnto Idols, we know that an Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vſes follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heereby is condemned the horrible Idolatry of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in bringing in that <hi>Poluthritis,</hi> or multitude of Gods: <note place="margin">Vſes.</note> for as the former doctrine, that God is a Spirit, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14246:61"/>
Image-mongers that reſemble him, that is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall by outward and bodily ſhapes: ſo doth this of the Vnity of his eſſence ſhew the lamentable Idolatry of the Gentiles, and giues vs all cauſe from our hearts to bleſſe God that hath reſcued our vnderſtandings from thoſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: blaſphemies and miſconceiuings of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,</hi> vnto the onely acknowledgement of one true God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If God be God onely, many Chriſtians that beleeue not many Gods in opinion, are yet in a fearefull caſe for ſetting vp Gods of their owne making: they ſuffer miſerable ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack by daſhing vpon the glory of the one only true God: Thus ſinne they, that make their bellies, or their pleaſures, or their riches their God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould teach vs, with all poſſible reuerence to adore him, whom alone all creatures are bound to ſerue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who hath no partner in his ſupreame ſoueraignty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 9. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If God be alone, it ſhould teach vs to loue him, and truſt in him alone, ſeeing it is he onely that claimes this honour and homage from the creature, and there is none like him in praiſes, or that can helpe vs in miſerie, or bring vs to the beſt good, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. 5. <hi>Marke</hi> 12. 29. 30. <hi>Eſay</hi> 37. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 37. 38. 39. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 2. 3.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3. 6. concludes from hence, that therefore wee ſhould liue in peace one with another, and by no meanes breake the Vnity of ſpirit, becauſe wee haue all but one God.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the doctrine of the Nature of God.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Beleeuing</hi> I entreated before, onely wee muſt know that theſe words <hi>I beleeue</hi> muſt be applied vnto each word and Article of the <hi>Creed:</hi> and ſo we muſt heere conſider what it is in particular to beleeue in God, and what euery Chriſtian ſhould meane when he ſaith, <hi>I beleeue in God.</hi> It is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the way that he doth not ſay I beleeue God, but in God: The ordinary diſtinction of beleeuing is not impertinent: It is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14246:61"/>
one thing to beleeue that God is, <hi>Credere Deum,</hi> or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue God, <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> and another thing to beleeue in God, <hi>Credere in Deum;</hi> for to beleeue in God, is firſt to know God, as hee hath reuealed himſelfe in his Word and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of God according to the former doctrine of his Nature: ſecondly, to bee perſwaded, That that God is my God; and thirdly, to put all my truſt in him, and to reſt vpon him alone for all happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Of the knowledge of Gods Nature before. And of the work of faith in beleeuing God to be my God, before. This belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in God heere expreſt vrgeth principally vpon vs the third thing, and that is that wee muſt imploy our faith in a daily relying vpon God, and confident affiance and truſt in his goodneſſe and mercy towards vs.</p>
                  <p>Now there are diuers Reaſons profitable for vs to thinke much vpon, which may not onely proue the point, but frame in vs a ſpirituall confidence in God. Wee may with all ſafety and confidence reſt vpon God alone, and his fauour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he hath bound himſelfe by his word and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be ſo good to vs, and hath confirmed his promiſe by oath and by ſeale.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he is of ſuch power to doe vs good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he is of ſo good a Nature, and it agrees ſo well to his diſpoſition to performe his promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe God is ſo well pleaſed with our truſt in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

                  <p>Is it required of vs that wee ſhould beliue in God, then theſe vſes will follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſhewes the difference in the relation of our faith, as it lookes vpon men and vpon God. Wee beliue men as the <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and our Teachers; but we doe not belieue in <hi>Paul</hi> or in our Teachers, but in God alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14246:62"/>
2. It ſhewes the follie of wicked men in purſuing the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if there were hope that they might driue them to ſuch exigents, that there ſhould be no helpe for them; for they truſt in God, and therefore can neuer be driuen beyond all refuge. I truſt in God, ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> how ſay ye then that I ſhould flie hence, as a bird beaten from his reſt, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhewes what vſe we ſhould make of our inſufficiencie to conceiue of God fully: when our minds are beaten back from beholding his full glorie, yet our faith will catch hold, ſo as to make vs truſt in him, though we cannot fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him. If we cannot receiue him by contemplation, yet we may by belieuing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In as much as to belieue in God is the verie entrance into the <hi>Creede,</hi> and the foundation of all the reſt: It ſhe wes that many that are Chriſtians in name, are not indeed true Belieuers, becauſe they doe not belieue in God: that is, they doe not truſt in him: For it is manifeſt, that theſe ſorts of Chriſtians that follow, do not belieue in God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as liue in Ignorance, without the meanes or the gift of the knowledge of God; as the Apoſtle ſayth: How ſhould they belieue in him, of whom they haue not heard, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as truſt in their Wealth, Friends, Beauty, Gifts, Skill, Strength, Reuenewes, Hopes, or Sinnes: The miſ-placing of their truſt, ſhewes they belieue not in God.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, all godly men ſhould ſtriue ſo to profeſſe in words, as alſo by their practice to proue it, that they do indeed belieue in God, and reſt vpon him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By reſting in the praiſe and appellation of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By liuing without care, and therein being like little Children, and this we do when we commit our ſoules and

                  <p>It ſhould much trouble vs, if in ſoundneſſe of practice we haue not learned this firſt leſſon of belieuing in God: Wee ſhould be much diſpleaſed with our ſelues, if our hearts be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and any way vnapt to reſt and waite vpon God <hi>Pſal</hi> 42. 12. and we ſhould often beſeech the Lord to helpe our vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Nature of God, and of beleeuing in God: The next thing Faith takes notice of, is the Relations in the God-head: and ſo God is the Father, the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: for this terme God is to bee applied, not onely to the Father (which is the next word) but to the Sonne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt as followeth after in the <hi>Creed:</hi> and therefore wee muſt reade with a Comma after this word God, thus, <hi>I beleeue in God, the Father:</hi> to reade without a Comma, that is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, for if we reade thus, <hi>I beleeue in God the Father,</hi> it would ſound as if the <hi>Creed</hi> ſhould ſay that the Father were God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not leauing the terme God to be carried to the Son and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Before then I come to ſpeake of the Father, I muſt entreate of God as he is three Perſons, both Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: And this is one of the deepeſt and dreadfulleſt Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in all Religion: where I muſt proceed in this order: firſt, to proue the Trinity by Scriptures: ſecondly, to explicate the doctrine: And thirdly, to anſwer certaine obiections might ariſe in mens mindes about it.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe theſe things about the Trinity are moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and aboue the reach of the creatures, we muſt ſeeke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to ground our conſciences in the beliefe of them ſuch as may be firme and euident: It is a difficult thing to bring the heart of men ſolidly to aſſent to ſuch ſecrets as theſe, as are not onely beyond the ſight, but aboue the reaſon of men, and the minde may eaſily vaniſh into wilde ſpeculations, if we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14246:63"/>
be not well grounded with ſure Euidence: nor can wee haue light from the booke of Nature to informe vs; for what any Heathen man hath ſpoken, of an Eternall mind, word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they ſpake by tradition from the Hebrewes, and vttered it perhaps in a falſe and corrupt ſenſe. Tis the booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt only informe our faith herein.</p>
                  <p>The proofes for the Trinity are gathered, both out of the Old and New Teſtament, and ſo they either prooue there were more Perſons then One, or elſe expreſly that there were Three Perſons.</p>
                  <p>That there are more Perſons then One is prooued, by the terme ELOHIM, which is vttered in the plurall number, as if it ſhould ſound Gods: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. In the beginning Gods or ELOHIM created Heauen and Earth: Created is in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, to ſhew the vnitie of the Eſſence, and ELOHIM in the plurall, to ſhewe the Trinitie of the Perſons: ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. Let vs make man in our Likeneſſe, <hi>Let vs,</hi> ſhewes more Perſons, and likenes being in the ſingular number ſhewes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Eſſence. And verſe 2. beſides the Lord there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Spirit of the Lord ſitting vpon the waters <hi>Ioſh. vlt.</hi> 19.

                  <p>Now that there are three Perſons, and no more nor fewer, is proued by places more obſcure or more expreſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Trinitie hath beene obſerued in ſuch places as theſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 3. where the Angells ſay thrice Holy; and ſo where IEHOVAH is three times repeated, <hi>Numbers</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. 22.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt expreſſe places are in the New Teſtament. A manifeſt reuelation of the Trinitie was in the Baptiſme of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14246:63"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Father ſpeaking from heauen, the Sonne ſtanding in the Riuer, the Holy Ghoſt deſcending like a Doue. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 16. 17. and ſo in the Inſtitution of Baptiſme, we are to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. 17. I will aske the Father, and he ſhall giue you another Comforter the Spirit of truth; and the 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 9.

                  <p>In the Explication of the doctrine of the Trinitie, we muſt be wiſe to ſobriety, becauſe it is wholly ſecret, rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, then to be demonſtrated, or deſcribed. It is a doctrine may be apprehended, but neuer comprehended, no not by the light of grace, nor fully and wholly by the light of glorie, as being aboue the reach, not onely of men but of Angells. A myſtery to be adored by humble faith and piety, not to be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, without curious yea furious temerity: For it is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as Reaſon cannot expreſſe it, and ſo ſingular that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample cannot declare it to vs: for the Images or Similitudes borrowed out of the booke of Nature, may rather ſhew that the doctrine of the Trinitie doth not deſtroy Nature, then giue vs any pattern which can ſample out the thing it ſelfe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to erre here, is the moſt dangerous of all errors. For, as nothing is ſought with more difficulty, or found with more profit, ſo nothing can bee miſtaken with more perill. And <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> therefore as a Father ſayd well, ſeeing wee cannot finde out what God is, wee muſt take heed, that wee thinke not that of him which he is not; yet muſt wee not wholly neglect the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe a neceſſitie lyes vpon vs to belieue: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though men and Angels haue cauſe to ſtand and wonder at this ſecret, that God ſhould beget a Sonne, and that from that Father and Sonne ſhould proceed that Spirit the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, yet becauſe God will bee ſo acknowledged of vs, wee muſt make vſe of our faith to belieue, what our reaſon cannot deſcribe to vs.</p>
                  <p>Three things then for our capacities are to be thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. The firſt concernes the Matter of this Myſterie. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the termes by which it is expreſt, and the third, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14246:64"/>
anſwere of certaine Obiections might ariſe in our mindes.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, we are to conſider what a Perſon is, and then how theſe three Perſons do agree one with another, and how they differ one from another.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon is an vnderſtanding ſubſtance, indiuiduall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, which is not ſuſtained in any other, or by any other. It is an vnderſtanding ſubſtance, &amp; ſo it excludes plants and beaſts, which are no perſons though they be ſubſtances, and it is not ſuſtained in any other, and ſo excludes the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, which is therefore not a Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſubſiſts in the Diuine Nature, and it is incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to diſtinguiſh it from the Eſſence, which is communicated to all the Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Foure things are common to each Perſon in the Trinitie. Firſt, Truth, and ſo each Perſon is the true God, hauing all the properties of God, and doing all the actions of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing all the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mutuall Immeation or Immanencie, as they call it, which the Grecians call, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by which none of the Perſons are ſeparate from the Diuine Eſſence, but ſubſiſt in it, and ſo all meet in the Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Perfection, by which each of the Perſons are not a part of the Diuine Eſſence, but the whole Diuine Eſſence is in each Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Diſtinction, ſo as euerie Perſon is diſtinguiſhed from the other Perſons, ſo as the Father is not the Sonne nor Holy Ghoſt, nor the Sonne the Father or Holy Ghoſt, nor the Holy Ghoſt the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe things in common which is Truth, ſo as each Perſon is the true God; It needes not much explanation for the ſenſe: for vnder that Head three things are giuen to each Perſon in common. Firſt, the properties of the God-head, ſo as each Perſon is Eternall, Infinite, Immutable, in life, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, holineſſe and glorie: and ſo Secondly, the Actions of the Deity are common to euery Perſon, according to that Rule in Schoole: <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiuiſa:</hi> The workes of the Trinitie, that iſſue outward, are vndiuided: So the Father creates, the Sonne creates, and the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14246:64"/>
creates: as there is one worke, ſo there is but one worker, which is God in three Perſons. To make man in Gods Image, is common to all three Perſons, Let vs make man, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. ſoe <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 19. what the Father doth, the Sonne doth the ſame; and in many other places. And as they agree in working, ſo doe they in worſhip, all diuine worſhip doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually belong to each Perſon.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, which is the mutuall ſeating or meeting of all the three Perſons in the ſame Eſſence, ſo as they are one in another, diuers Scriptures proue: ſo Chriſt ſaith, I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 10. and this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the eſſence of God is infinite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery perſon poſſeſſing it, it muſt needs follow, that whereſoeuer one is, there the other are alſo, and that one is in another: ſo as there can bee no place, or thing, where one of them is, but there the other are alſo. <hi>Excellent</hi> is that ſaying of that Father, concerning the three Perſons in the Trinity. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula ſunt in Singulis, &amp;c.</hi> Each are in each other, and all in each, and each in all, and all in all, and one all. Hee that ſeeth this in parte, darkely, as in a glaſſe, let him reioyce that hee knowes God, and as God let him honour him and giue him thankes. He that ſeeth it nor, let him tend to ſee it by godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not to calumniate by blindneſſe, for God is one, and yet there is a Trinity, &amp;c. Thus Hee.</p>
                  <p>For the third, the whole Eſſence is in each Perſon. They are all conſubſtantiall not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of like eſſence onely, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, all of the ſame ſubſtance, Coeſſentiall, and Conſubſtantiall.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth, That the Perſons are diſtinguiſhed is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Perſons, how they are diſtinguiſhed, is that which is to bee conſidered in the next place: Diſtinction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Oppoſition: Now there is a threefold oppoſition, The
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14246:65"/>
greateſt oppoſition is amongſt contraries, for theſe fight one againſt another. There is alſo a middle oppoſition which is in things onely diſparate as they call them, as betweene men and beaſts, ſo as a man is not a beaſt. The leaſt oppoſition is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things that are relate, as the Father is not the Sonne, the Subiect is not the Prince, and the like: this oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things in relation, is in things that doe in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects agree, and this diſtinction agrees to the Nature of God and is the leaſt of all diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>The difference of the Perſons, is two waies to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for firſt, they differ from the Eſſence, and then one from another.</p>
                  <p>The Perſons in the Trinity differ from the Eſſence: which that it may bee vnderſtood, wee muſt know that ſome things differ, <hi>Ratione,</hi> not <hi>Re:</hi> that is not in deed, but in reſpect of our conceiuing: as for inſtance, The Attributes of God differ, but how? not in deed nor in themſelues, but onely in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of them: and ſo the power of heating and of drying in the Sunne, differs onely in reſpect of conceiuing, for in the power it ſelfe there is no diſtinction to bee found, it is found onely in our heads. But this is not the difference in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for the Perſons differ one from another really, and would ſo doe if wee neuer thought of them. A reall diſtinction is grounded either vpon the reſpect of the eſſence of things, or in reſpect of the manner of being. A diſtinction in reſpect of eſſence is not in the Trinity, for all the Perſons haue the ſame eſſence; it remaines then that the Perſons in the Trinity differ from the eſſence onely in reſpect of the manner of their being: and ſo (in ſhort) differs from the eſſence, as the manner of a thing differs from the thing it ſelfe. The manner of being in euery thing doth determine it: Now things in reſpect of the manner are three waies to bee conſidered of, for there is the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Modus.</hi> 1. <hi>Eſſendi.</hi> 2. <hi>Se habendi.</hi> 3. <hi>Subſiſtendi.</hi>
                     </note> manner of the eſſence, the manner of hauing that eſſence, or the manner of ſubſiſting. The manner of the Eſſence is ſhewed by Attributes, as when we ſay, It is true, good, Iuſt, &amp;c. The manner of hauing that eſſence, is either with or without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: as in the creature, the manner of their hauing their eſſence is by dependance vpon God: and in the Creator, the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14246:65"/>
eſſence is had of himſelfe without any dependance. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſting, is the furniſhing of a thing with peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, including a Perſon.

                        </gap>. Baſil. Iuſt. Mart. Dam. In Sancta Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate eſt alius &amp; alius non aliud &amp; aliud. In Chriſto eſt aliud &amp; aliud non alius &amp; alius.</note> differ from the Eſſence onely in the manner of ſubſiſting, becauſe the Eſſence ſubſiſts in one manner in the Father, and in another in the Sonne, &amp;c. They doe not differ in Eſſence, (for all of them haue the ſame) but onely in the manner of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Eſſence in each Perſon. In the Trinity there is another, and another, but not another thing: there is another, that is, another Perſon, there is not another thing, that is, not another Eſſence. In Chriſt now, there is another and another thing, for his diuine Nature is one thing, and his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is another thing, and yet there is not <hi>alius,</hi> that is another Perſon. But it is otherwiſe in the Trinity. The being of the Father is the being of the Sonne, and the being of the holy Ghoſt, but to be the Father, is not to be the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Perſons differ from the Eſſence: They differ one from another foure waies. In order, in perſonall proprieties, in number, and in operation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in order they differ: for the Father is the firſt Perſon, the Sonne the Second, and the holy Ghoſt the Third: This Priority muſt not not be miſtaken; for one Perſon is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another in time or in dignity but onely in Nature, or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, ſo as one Perſon depends vpon another: As the Sun is before the beames of the Sun, not in time, but in order of Nature, becauſe the beames are from the Sun: ſo in the Trinity, the Son and holy Ghoſt are after the Father, not in time, but becauſe they receiue the originall of their Perſons from the Father, Relatiues are together in time: onely note that Nature heere ſignifies the manner of ſubſiſting, not of eſſence; for in reſpect of Eſſence there is no priority in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they differ in perſonall Proprieties: As the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Proprietie of the Father is to be of himſelfe in reſpect of his Perſon vnbegotten. The perſonall Proprietie of the Son is Generation, or to bee of the Father by begetting: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Propriety of the holy Ghoſt, is to bee of the Father and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14246:66"/>
the Son by Spiration or proceeding, and thus each Perſon differs from other by incommunicable Characters.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they differ in number: they are the ſame in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in reſpect of the Eſſence, becauſe one God is Father Son, and holy Ghoſt, and yet in reſpect of thoſe Characters in the manner of ſubſiſting, each Perſon hath a ſubſiſting by himſelfe, which in number is not the ſame with the other Perſons: The Father hath one manner of ſubſiſting in number, the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holy Ghoſt another: Note that I ſay each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath his ſubſiſting by himſelfe, not of himſelfe. <note place="margin">Per ſe, not àſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they differ in operation: and ſo both in externall and internall operations. In externall workes though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the things wrought, they are common to all three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet in reſpect of the manner of working, there is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the perſons: for the Father workes by the Son in the holy Ghoſt: The Father worketh from none, the Son from the Father, and the holy Ghoſt from them both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 19. 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 13. There are two principles to be marked for the vnderſtanding of this point. The one is, that the workes of the Deity that are outward are common to all three Perſons. The other is, that looke what order there is of exiſting in the Trinity, the ſame order there is in working: as was ſaid before, the Father worketh by the Son in the holy Ghoſt. Thus <hi>Creation, Adoption, Sanctification,</hi> are the workes of the whole Trinity: as the Scriptures proue, that attribute <hi>Creation</hi> to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Spirit, and ſo of the other workes all three Perſons worke the ſame, <hi>Apoteleſma</hi> or worke, but not all after the ſame manner: as for inſtance, in the worke of our Redemption, the Father workes by ſending the Son, the Son by aſſuming our Nature, the holy Ghoſt by ſanctifying, and forming the bodie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the fleſh of the Virgin, &amp;c. ſo in the <hi>Creation</hi> the Father wils it, the Son by the holy Ghoſt effects it. But this is withal to be noted, that as any outward worke hath more reſemblance in any part of it to any perſon in the Trinity, ſo it is more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially attributed to that Perſon: ſo in the <hi>Creed</hi> and in the Scriptures too, <hi>Creation</hi> is attributed to the Father, who being of himſelfe, fitly giues being to the creatures: <hi>Redemption</hi> is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14246:66"/>
attributed to the Son, who as he reſembles his Fathers Image, is fitteſt to repreſent vnto mankinde, his mercy; and being an eternall Word in the Fathers minde, doth fitly by his Word tell vs his Fathers meaning. <hi>Sanctification</hi> is attributed to the holy Ghoſt, who as he is breathed (as it were) from the Father and the Son, <hi>per modum voluntatis &amp; amoris,</hi> ſo doth hee fitly by breathing or inſpiration inlighten and ſanctifie our wills and affections.</p>
                  <p>And as they differ in externall workes, ſo doe they in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: for the Father onely begets a Sonne, the Father and Son (as it were) breathes forth the holy Ghoſt: And thus of the matter of the Doctrine of the Trinity: the Termes follow to bee conſidered of.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words Perſons and Trinity, Eſſence, &amp;c. were taken vp in the Primitiue Church as the fitteſt words to expreſſe what they conceiued of theſe glorious Myſteries: The ſpeech of man in many things extreamely doth want words. Wee ſay three Perſons, not as if thereby the myſtery were vttered, but <note place="margin">Dictum eſt tres perſonae non vt illud diceretur, ſed ne omnino taceretur. Auguſt. Non quia Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura dicit, ſed quia non contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicit. Auguſt.</note> that it may not be vtterly concealed: for that which is of ſuch ineffable eminencie cannot be expreſſed in ſuch a word: wee ſpeake therefore of theſe things (as the Father ſaid) not as wee ought but as wee can. And againe, the ſame Father ſaith, It hath bin lawfull for vs for diſcourſe and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſake to ſay three perſons, not becauſe the Scripture ſaith ſo, but becauſe it doth not contradict it: and a kinde of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity brought the Ancient Church to inuent the words; for when Heretikes would yeeld to the termes of Scripture, and varied vpon the corrupt ſenſes they put vpon the words, the Ancients were driuen to inuent words which did expreſſe the true ſenſe, that thereby the Heretikes might be tryed whether they hold the right Faith or no: which termes that before were promiſcuouſly vſed in other learning, being in the daies of the firſt Chriſtian Churches made free in the Cittie of God, haue euer ſince enioned their freedome, and may not now be turned out, without ſuſpition of contentiouſneſſe, ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and Schiſme. The ſenſe is in Scriptures, though the words be not there. As the Scripture ſaith, there be three in Heauen, which are one, which the Church adds, the three are Perſons,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14246:67"/>
and the one is eſſence. It adds not to the ſenſe of the Text, but to the words: and yet the Word Perſon is found, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. in <note place="margin">For the originall of theſe termes, reade Chemniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us de tribus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonis diuinitatis.</note> the ſame ſenſe (in a manner) as it is taken heere. To bring in new words, might bring in new errors, and it were a great wrong to caſt out ſuch words as haue done ſuch ſeruice againſt Heretickes, and are ſo fit to reduce the mindes of men, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the right way of beleeuing in theſe high Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>But yet wee muſt bee warned that the termes doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fully expreſſe the thing, eſpecially if wee iudge of the termes about the Trinity, as wee doe of the ſame words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs in other things: As for inſtance, a Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity differs from a perſon among men or Angels; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Peter, Paul and Iohn,</hi> are three perſons, to whom our humane Nature is common: yet theſe three perſons differ one from another: firſt, in Subſtance, becauſe each of them haue their ſubſtance of ſoule and body ſeparate from the other: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in Time, one is younger then another: thirdly, in Will, <hi>Paul</hi> contradicts <hi>Peter:</hi> fourthly, in Power, <hi>Paul</hi> labours more then all the Apoſtles: fifthly, in Operation, <hi>Peter</hi> workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt them of the Circumciſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> But it is not thus in the three Perſons in the Trinity, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are ſeparate wholie one from another: whereas in the Trinity, the Father is in the Sonne, and he in the Father, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 24. They may be farre aſunder in place, but God the Father and the Sonne are neuer aſunder, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 29. and in the Trinity there is in all one will, one power; all three Perſons are Almighty, all eternall, and all worke the ſame worke.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. It ſhould ſtrike vs with amazement and admiration of the glory of God, and remoue the ſenſe of our owne inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and narrowneſſe of heart and vnderſtanding, who are ſo ouercome with glory that our mindes are not able to conceiue of, or behold theſe wonderfull ſecrets in the Diuinity: It ſhould worke in vs an vnſpeakeable feare and Reuerence to thinke of the being of God, that ſo infinitely excells the being of all creatures in heauen and earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſhould compell vpon vs, more care and attendance of ſpirit in worſhipping God, ſo as we be ſure we direct our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to him that is one in Nature and three in Perſons: for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14246:68"/>
worſhip belongs equally to all three Perſons. And herein the Chriſtian fundamentally differs from Pagans, Turkes, and Iewes, and in heart becomes as one of thoſe when he worſhips a God that is not three Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We are bound to take notice as of the common glory of all the Perſons, ſo of that ſpeciall glory is due to each perſon, as we finde it either deſcribed in the Word of God, or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the workes of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We muſt take heede what wee ſpeake of the Trinity in Vnity; for we may fall vpon ſuch formes of ſpeech, as may be extreamely erronious and dangerous: and for the helpe of the ignorant, I will note diuers of the ſpeeches which are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vnſound: as that there are three Gods, three Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, three Almighties, &amp;c. or that the Eſſence is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; that God is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, or that there is a triplicity in God; that God doth beget another God; that the Father is another thing from the Son; that the Sonne and holy Ghoſt haue a beginning of their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; that the Perſon was begotten or did proceede from the Eſſence: by diſcerning where the errour lies in theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences wee may try our skill in the former doctrine of the Trinitie.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Doctrine of the Trinity ſhould be wonderfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vnto the true Chriſtian, becauſe as the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhewes there are three in Heauen, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, which will auouch the happineſſe of the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer: and his comfort may be increaſed, if he conſider what was before taught, that all three Perſons doe ioyne in the work of his Redemption, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is not vnprofitable out of the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſhew how all ſorts of Hereticks haue aſſaulted it, &amp; bin confuted by it, which may be briefely thus ſhewed. We muſt beleeue that in the Trinity there is nothing created as <hi>Dioniſius</hi> would haue it: nothing vnequall, as <hi>Eunomius</hi> and <hi>Aetius:</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before or after or leſſer then other as <hi>Arius</hi> ſaid: nothing forraine or ſeruing to another as <hi>Macedonius</hi> ſaid: nothing inſerted by ſtealth or perſwaſion, as <hi>Manichaeus</hi> ſaid: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing corporeall, or in faſhion of bodies as <hi>Melito, Tertullian</hi>

and <hi>Vadianus</hi> ſaid: nothing inuiſible to themſelues as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid, or viſible to the Creatures as <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſaid: nothing diuers in motion or will as <hi>Marcion</hi> ſaid: nothing taken out of the Eſſence of the Trinity and put into the Nature of the creatures, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid: nothing ſingular in office, or communicable to another as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid: nothing confounded as <hi>Sabellius</hi> ſaid. <hi>Aug.

                     <p>This terme Father is attributed to God both eſſentially and perſonally. Eſſentially, and ſo the terme belongs to each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity, as being a terme that followes the God-head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 9. and thus God is ſaid to bee a Father diuers waies: as, firſt, by Predeſtination, becauſe he inrolls the Elect as Sonnes from all eternity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. ſecondly, by Creation, becauſe he made things to be of nothing by his owne power, thus <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be the Sonne of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 38. and and God is called the Father of ſpirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. thirdly, by temporall redemption, and ſo God is acknowledged for the Father of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe hee made them a people to himſelfe, and brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and gaue them the outward priuiledges of his children, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 16. 11. 12. fourthly, by regeneration, when hee changeth our natures and makes them like his diuine Nature, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and ſo wee are ſonnes ſo ſoone as we beleeue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. and ſo ſoone as he giues vs the Spirit of Sanctification and Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. fifthly, by perſonall vnion, and ſo Chriſt in reſpect of his humane nature is the Sonne of God: becauſe that nature doth ſubſiſt in the diuine Nature, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. Now all theſe waies God is a Father by grace; and in reſpect of Regeneration, the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity is called a Father aſwell as the firſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6. 7. and is ſaid to haue an ofspring and generation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 10. Laſtly, God is ſaid to be a Father by Nature, and by generation, as he begets a Sonne, conſubſtantiall with himſelfe, and ſo the firſt Perſon in the Trinity is called Father onely, as he is the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Father of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Creed</hi> heere Faith beholds God as a Father princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in reſpect of eternall generation, as the firſt Perſon in

Trinity is the Father of the ſecond, but withall, as it extracts vertue out of that high Myſterie, it layes hold vpon the Father of Chriſt, as he is our Father in Chriſt alſo: for Faith is of that Nature, that when it laies hold of any thing, it will not off, till it haue gotten by contemplation and concluſion what may be collected any way from thence.</p>
                     <p>Wee are firſt then to conſider of God as the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and then as our Father.</p>
                     <p>As God is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, theſe things would be proued and opened.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That God doth beget a Sonne.</item>
                        <item>2. That IESVS CHRIST is that Sonne.</item>
                        <item>3. The manner of this Generation.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the firſt, that God hath begotten a Sonne, is a Myſterie beyond the reach and comprehending of all men and Angels, yet is it a truth in many Scriptures charged vpon vs to beleeue, as namely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond, that the Lord IESVS CHRIST is that Sonne of God is apparant by Scripture too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 15. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 5. 20. 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>For the third, how the Father did beget the Sonne, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto vs, It is a ſecret cannot be reuealed to vs eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this mortality, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 4. onely by way of Negation, the Scripture intreating of it ſhewes vs that God doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Sonne as men beget theirs: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Men beget without themſelues, ſo as the Sonne is diuided from the Father: but ſo doth not GOD the Father beget Chriſt his Sonne, hee is diſtinguiſhed from the Father but not diuided, the Father begets in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſubſtance of the Son amongſt vs, may bee like the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it is not the Fathers ſubſtance. But in the Trinity the Father and the Sonne are of the ſame ſubſtance, conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In corporall Generation, the Father deriues vnto the Sonne but a part of his ſubſtance, but GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14246:70"/>
communicates his whole ſubſtance to his Sonne.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The creature begets a Son that is mortall, but God begets a Son that is immortall.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The creature begets in time, but God begets in eternity, which hath three differences in it: for firſt, the time may be named when the creature did beget, the <hi>Creator</hi> begets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 30. ſecondly, the creature ceaſeth begetting, but God the Father begets his Son eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he alwaies begets, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. thirdly, the ſubſtance of the Father was before the ſubſtance of the Sonne but not ſo in this eternall generation; Chriſt is of the Father, but not after the father.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Among the creatures the Son is ſubiect to the father, but in this eternall and diuine generation the Sonne is equall to the father: Subiection is due to God the father from all creatures, but not from the Sonne, or holy Ghoſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Among the creatures, the father and Sonne are two things in number, but in this diuine generation it is not ſo; for the Father and Sonne, and ſo the holy Ghoſt are but one God, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                     <p>The Vſe may bee either for information, or inſtruction, or conſolation, or terror: firſt, ſince GOD is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt by ſuch an vnconceiueable generation, wee may thence learne:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The glory of our Sauiours condition: He was before the world was, he was with the father, brought vp with him, as his eternall delight, more deere to the father then any created nature can conceiue of, the Sonne of his Loue, neuer father loued his ſon, ſo as God the father loues <hi>Christ,</hi> yea, hee was God with the father Conſubſtantiall, Coequall, Coeternall, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 30. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 25. <hi>Philippians</hi> 2. 6 <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Originall of all father-hood: The father of <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> was the firſt father euer was, yea, the <hi>Creed</hi> giues the Title of father to God onely, as if there were no father but he: and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 9. call no man father on earth, for one is your father, which is God: and indeed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14246:70"/>
properly none is a father but God: other fathers that are called ſo haue the name only, becauſe there is in them a kind of Image or ſimilitude of God the father, and yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſo imperfectly in compariſon of God the father, that they reſemble him, rather in that generall that they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, then in the manner of begetting.</p>
                     <p>Thus for Information.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Since God is the father of Ieſus Chriſt wee ſhould bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To acknowledge this Myſtery, and though wee haue cauſe to be abaſed for the defect of our vnderſtanding heerein, in that we cannot tell the fathers name, nor what is the name of his Son, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. yet we ſhould confidently beleeue, as the very foundation of our Religion, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is the Son of the liuing God: vpon the Rock of this confeſſion is the <hi>Church</hi> built, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a glory Chriſt ſtands vpon to be acknowledged in the glory of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. If we acknowledge the Son, wee haue the father, or elſe not, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23. Yea, this is an honour God ſtands vpon to bee glorified with one heart and one mouth of all his ſeruants, euen as the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To be fully eſtabliſhed in the perſwaſion of the ſufficiency and efficacie of the obedience and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt for vs: we may confidently call him the Lord our righteouſnes ſeeing God is called his father: for his obedience, is more then the obedience of a man, yea, of more value then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of worlds of men; and beſides hee is all in all with God the father who ſo loues him, hee can denie him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To rely vpon him for inſtruction. The father loues him and ſhewes him all things that he doth or intends to doe, and in <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 20.</note> him are all treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould heare him alwaies, in any thing hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale to vs: yea, God the father chargeth vs with this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the very vſe he would haue vs make of the knowledge of his eternal generation, as appeares by the voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mentioned, <hi>Mat</hi> 17. 5. <hi>While he yet ſpake, behold a bright</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:14246:71"/>
                        <hi>cloud ſhadowed them, and behold there came a voice out of the cloud ſaying, This is that my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed, heare him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But eſpecially this doctrine ſerues for conſolation, and ſo is frequently vrged in Scripture: for if God be the Father of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> then theſe comforts will manifeſtly follow to the beleeuing Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God is well pleaſed with the ſacrifice of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> for our ſinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Chriſt is able to raiſe vp the dead hearts of men with ſpirituall life, for as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hee hath giuen to the Son to haue life in himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 26.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in <hi>Chriſt</hi> we may haue ſupply for all our wants, wee may receiue of his fulnes all ſorts of graces needfull for vs as is from this doctrine gathered, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. 18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Chriſt is able to giue vs eternall life, and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme euen that great gift at the time appointed to all that beleeue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 2. no beleeuer ſhall periſh.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That whatſoeuer he askes the Father for vs, hee ſhall haue it, yea, that our prayers preſcribed by him ſhall be heard.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That nothing that is good for vs ſhall bee withheld from vs: for if God hath giuen vs his Son, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That God beares a great affection euen to vs: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath beſought the Father that he would loue vs with the Loue he loued him, and that the warmth and comfort of that loue may be euer with vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. 25.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if God be the Father of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Christ,</hi> then vaine are all the conſultations and rebellious proiects of wicked men againſt Chriſt and the meanes of his kingdom: then alſo woe will bee vnto them, for God will make Chriſts enemies his footſtoole: hee will bruiſe them with an iron rod and breake them like a Potters veſſell: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son hath the Father giuen the ends of the earth, and whatſoeuer rebels againſt him ſhall not proſper: as from this doctrine is inferred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 110. 1.</p>
                     <p>Thus God is the Father of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, Faith lookes vpon God as our Father eſpecially in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

                     <p>God is our Father foure waies: firſt, by <hi>Creation,</hi> and ſo principally in reſpect of our ſoules, which he creates of nothing and infuſeth into our bodies: and ſo he is called Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. ſecondly, by Regeneration, becauſe by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power he renewes ſpirituall life into our ſoules that were dead in ſin, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. thirdly, by Adoption, when of his meere grace hee acknowledgeth vs for children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 6. fourthly, by Reſurrection, becauſe he giues a glorious being to our bodies that were rotted and diſſolued in the earth: and ſo as hee was ſaid to beget Chriſt in the day that he raiſed him from the dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. ſo is he ſaid to grant vs the Adoption of ſonnes, when he reſtores our bodies to life out of the graue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. 21.</p>
                     <p>And this terme of Father is giuen to theſe workes of God, not vnfitly for the reſemblance they haue to the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Father and Son in Nature: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God giues vs a ſpirituall being, making vs a ſoule or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſubſtance: for as we call them Fathers, becauſe we haue our bodies from them, ſo God is more fitly called a Father, becauſe we haue our ſpirits from him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God renewes our natures, and begets them to bee like his Nature: for being regenerated we partake of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being made to liue Gods nature in holines and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and he may well be called a Father that begets that which is like to himſelfe: beſides, by Faith we put on <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3. 26. 27.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God giues vs the right and priuiledge of Sons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is fitly called our Father: for firſt hee findes vs foode and rayment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and teaching, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 13. and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance not onely ſetting his Angels to looke to vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. but himſelf alſo carrying and bearing vs in his armes when any thing ayleth vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46. 4.</p>

of the Creation of their ſoules, yet Faith lookes vpon him as a Father in Chriſt, and ſo by Adoption and regeneration, and therefore wee muſt diligently examine our ſelues whether we be ſons and daughters to God by grace in Chriſt or no: for all ſuch as are by grace truely the Children of God haue in themſelues ſuch ſignes as theſe.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. If God be our Father, wee ſhould be quickned vnto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wee ſhould runne to him to make our moane in all our wants: But withall it imports two things we ſhould looke to in prayer: firſt, that we auoide vaine bablings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions and affectation of length of prayer and the like: for wee pray to a Father that needs not vaine and tedious diſcourſes. The words of a childe ſhould bee humble and earneſt and direct to the point, but not tedious as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſhewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7. 8. ſecondly, that wee pray in faith and not wauer, becauſe wee aske of a father: If earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can giue good gifts to their children, what will the heauenly father denie to his children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. 16. Yea, if God himſelfe ſhould fight againſt vs with his terrors, yet we muſt in prayer ſtick faſt to this, that he is our father, and alwaies keepe this in our pleadings to wreſtle with God by this Argument, as the Church did in thoſe ſtraites mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 8. 4.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If God bee our father, wee muſt then patiently beare his corrections, ſeeing we indure correction at the hands of the fathers of our bodies, who many times correct vs for their owne pleaſure, therefore much more ſhould we ſubmit our

ſelues to the father of ſpirits, who neuer corrects vs but for our profit. And to deſire to be without correction, is to be in the condition of baſtards and not of ſonnes: if we would haue God to loue vs we muſt be willing to let him correct vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4. to the 10.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. We haue right to Gods houſe: we may with great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement reſort to all Gods ordinances, becauſe it is our fathers houſe: and if hard times befall vs in reſpect of the meanes of Religion, and that the enemies of the <hi>Church</hi> do inuade the Sanctuarie, we muſt then go to God and pleade our right, ſeeing his houſe belongs to vs and not to them: thus did the godly, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 16. 18. 19.</p>

                     <p>But theſe conſolations will appeare to be much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if we conſider not onely that God is a Father, but ſuch a Father:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is a father in heauen, not an earthly father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is a father almighty, he can doe more for vs then all the fathers in the world.</p>

The ſonne he alwaies abides in the houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 36. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. 21.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That God is Almighty, theſe places of Scripture euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſly proue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 37. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God may be ſaid to be Almighty in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he hath power and authoritie ouer all things: Omnipotent <hi>quia omnium teneat potestatem: Ruffin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe all the might and power in the creatures was from him: all might from him: they haue no power but what they receiued of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he can performe whatſoeuer he ſaith, promiſeth, or threatneth: nothing is too hard for him to do, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 17. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 37. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His Almightineſſe is magnified in Scripture, becauſe he is able to giue to all the men in the world recompence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their workes, ſo as none can reſiſt his power, nor deliuer out of his hands, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 19. <hi>Iſay</hi> 14. 25. 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe he can doe whatſoeuer he will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe he can doe more then hee will: as he could ſend

Chriſt many legions of Angels to deliuer him, but would not. He could raiſe vp children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtones, but he would not. And this Omnipotency is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the abſolute Omnipotence of God, by which he is able to create 1000. worlds if he would. The power to doe what he wils, is called his actuall power.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Becauſe he can doe wonderfull things without helpe or Meanes: as he made the World of nothing, and can effect what he will in heauen and earth without labour, onely by his becke or word, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 28. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Becauſe he can do all things: there is ſimply nothing that can be, but God can doe it: he is omnipotent, becauſe all things are poſſible to him, euen things that are impoſſible to men and Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. Kings may doe many great things, but not all; ſome things they cannot doe. They can make many liuing men dye, but cannot make one dead man liue: which God can doe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Becauſe he is mighty by his Eſſence, by nature of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: His Almightineſſe is his Eſſence, and his whole Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is almighty, and therefore all in God is Mightie; and therefore his Mightineſſe muſt needes be infinite. He is not mighty in reſpect of ſome part or faculty as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Becauſe he is alwaies Mighty: great Princes may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull powerfull, but they may dye, or their power be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; but God is almighty, yeſterday, to day, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>For the third point, Almightineſſe is attributed in the <hi>Creed</hi> to the Father, not to import that the Sonne and holy Ghoſt were not almighty; but becauſe, when the father is ſaid to be almighty, it muſt needs follow that they are almighty alſo; becauſe the father being the fountaine and originall of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne and holy Ghoſt doth communicate to them, his whole Nature, and all the Attributes of the Diuinitie: And the Father being firſt in the order of working, fitly is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working giuen to him in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth point: The things which God cannot doe may be referred to fiue Heads: for firſt, he cannot doe things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14246:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that be falſe or ſinfull: Hee cannot lye, or denie himſelfe, or doe vniuſtly, as diuers Scriptures ſhew. Secondly, he cannot doe things that be contrary to his Nature, he cannot dye or be finite, or be ignorant of any thing, or be corporeall, or the like. Thirdly, he cannot doe things which hee cannot will, or are contrary to his will: Hee can doe many things more then he will; but he cannot doe any thing, which hee cannot will: for his will is as infinite as his power, nor can he doe any thing againſt his will, or contrary to his owne purpoſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Fourthly, he cannot doe contradictories, to make one and the ſelfe ſame thing to be and not to be at the ſame time, to make a Creature finite and infinite, in that wherein he is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Fiftly, he cannot doe things ſimply impoſſible; I ſay ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply impoſſible, for many things are impoſſible to men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which in their owne Nature are not impoſſible: As it is impoſſible for vs to make a Cable to goe through the Eye of a Needle, but it is not ſimply impoſſible in it ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God can doe it: God is therefore called omnipotent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can doe all poſſible things. Neither doe any of theſe <note place="margin">Dicitur omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſaciendo quod vult non patiendo quod non vult, Aug.</note> things argue impotencie, but doe rather eſtabliſh his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie: Gods power is not leſſened becauſe he cannot deceiue or dye, &amp;c. for it were impotency if he could doe theſe.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt, this alſo muſt be added, that God onely is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, this glory belongs onely vnto him: for the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull creatures are finite, and cannot doe a world of things, and they receiued their power from God, and are or may be letted or reſiſted in things they can doe, and their power will ceaſe, if it be not renewed and confirmed by God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of Gods omnipotency may firſt teach vs diuers duties;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſtriue by all meanes to ſet out the praiſe of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull power and workes, that hath done ſuch great things in heauen and earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 89. 11. 12. <hi>&amp;c. Reuel.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To walke before him in all vprightneſſe, carefull in all things to pleaſe him, and to auoid all ſin, conſidering what power he hath to doe vs good if we ſerue him, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14246:75"/>
vs body and ſoule, if we liue in our ſins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould teach vs in all dangers and difficulties, to beleeue in God and reſt vpon him, ſo as when we know his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or promiſe to vs, though we ſee no meanes of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or performance of good things, yet we muſt giue glory to Gods power, and reſt without wauering vpon God, knowing that nothing is hard or impoſſible to him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued God concerning his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. and as <hi>Ieremie</hi> was commanded to truſt God, when God inioyned him to purchaſe a field, at that time when he was to threaten the ineuitable captiuitie, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 17. 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the experience of all our weakneſſes, we ſhould runne to God for power to ſupport vs: All might is in him, and therefore whither ſhould we runne for power but to him: To him ſhould wee lift vp our hearts for ſtrength, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 28.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It ſhould teach vs to be patient in affliction when it is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, and to tremble at his grieuous iudgements when they are vpon other; his dreadfull power when it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhould make vs tremble, and be ſilent, and when his hand toucheth vs, we ſhould not ſtruggle, for it is in vaine; what, can we reſiſt his power? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 10. <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 15. It is the Lord, and therefore be quiet, let him doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The conſideration of his omnipotency ſhould be often thought vpon, when we come to pray vnto God, for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall or temporall things. Our Sauiour Chriſt in the Lords prayer gaue vs three ſtaies, or mighty pillars to hold vp our faith in praying (to wit) Gods kingdome, and Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Gods glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wee muſt hence be warned to take heed of deſpiſing weake Chriſtians, to reiect them as either paſt hope, or void of grace, or not likely to hold out, becauſe of their many frailties, and ignorance, for God can ſtabliſh them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> vrgeth the conſideration of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14246:76"/>
as an argument to perſwade to workes of mercy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is able to inrich vs, and to abound towards vs in all recompence, both in ſpirituall and temporall things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It ſhould teach vs to beleeue the power of God in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, though the outward ſignes may make no great ſhew, yet our faith ſhould be built vpon the inward opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who will doe all that, which either the ſignes ſignifie, or the word promiſeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It ſhould make vs the more wonder at Gods goodneſſe and loue ſhewed to his people, in that ſometimes he layeth chaines as it were vpon his power, onely in fauour to them. As for inſtance, God cannot deſtroy <hi>Sodome</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> be gone; which yet is moſt eaſie for him to doe, but for his loue to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. 22. ſo God loues his people, that many a iudgement would fall vpon wicked men in the places where they liue, yet cannot, becauſe of Gods affection to the godly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this doctrine of Gods omnipotency, reproues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men for ſinning againſt the power of God. Now men tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe againſt the omnipotency of God diuers waies;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as plead his power, for the effecting of what is either contrary to his nature, or will, or ſimply impoſſible; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prophane perſons doe, that will needs beleeue that God can ſaue them, though they liue in their ſinnes, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his word. And as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, beleeuing that <hi>Chriſts</hi> body can be in many places at once, and ſo in the Sacrament to be eaten locally and orally, it being ſimply impoſſible, for a body remaining a body, to be in many places at once, in the ſame manner and reſpect, as it is alſo without word or promiſe of God and Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as will not vſe the lawſull meanes appointed vnto them either for preſeruation or deliuerance, reaſoning moſt fooliſhly, God can keepe me without meat, therefore I will not eat; or can deliuer me without meanes, therefore I will vſe none: neuer conſidering that Gods Almightineſſe is ſhewed by working in the Meanes, as well as without, and

The perſonall workes of God internall, are ſuch as flow from each perſon in the Trinity, according to the <hi>Characteriſticall</hi> propriety of the perſon: ſuch workes were generation of the Sonne, and proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt. The Internall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall workes were the decrees of God which hee made in himſelfe from all eternity, concerning all things in the world, eſpecially concerning men and Angels, theſe workes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all three perſons, as flowing from the eſſence of God.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14246:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now of theſe workes the <hi>Creed</hi> makes no expreſſe mention, becauſe they are ſtrong meat, and aboue the capacity of weake <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The externall workes of God are of foure ſorts: for they are either the workes of <hi>Creation,</hi> by which hee maketh all things to be: or workes of conſeruation, by which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the things hee hath made in their being; or workes of Reparation by which in Chriſt he reſtores what was ruinated by ſinne; or workes of perfection, by which hee brings all things to their appointed end, and eſpecially makes the Church fully bleſſed in a better world.</p>
                  <p>The workes of <hi>Creation</hi> are onely mentioned in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.

Now concerning the making of the world, foure things are to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Who made the world.</item>
                     <item>2 How it was made.</item>
                     <item>3 Why it was made.</item>
                     <item>4 When it was made.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt: the <hi>Creation</hi> was a worke of the whole Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It is attributed here in the <hi>Creed</hi> to the Father, becauſe the Action of the Father was more manifeſt and euident: as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is attributed to the Sonne, and Sanctification to the Holy Ghoſt. But yet it is euident by diuers Scriptures, that each Perſon did worke about the <hi>Creation:</hi> for of the Father there is no queſtion, and of the Sonne it is expreſly affirmed, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and of the Holy Ghoſt ſitting and mouing vpon the firſt water, we reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond: God created all things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 According to the Counſell of his owne will, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. which hath diuers things in it, for thereby is affirmed that he made all things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Moſt freely, without compulſion or inſtigation from any other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 According to the <hi>Idaea</hi> of all things in his owne minde: for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14246:78"/>
as the Carpenter firſt conceiues the frame in his head, and then builds according to that <hi>Idaea</hi> in his minde: ſo did God build the world according to the eternall patterne which was in Gods minde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 According to his owne Decree: there was nothing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which was not decreed, and nothing decreed to bee, which was not created according to the Decree.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Moſt aduiſedly: hauing from all eternity conſulted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and foreſeene all was to be made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, with a word only: he had none to helpe him, nor needed tooles or inſtruments, as men doe to effect their workes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 9. Thirdly, without labour or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 28. Fourthly, of Nothing: men cannot build without Materialls, but God made the world of Nothing, in reſpect of the firſt matter of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. for he made not the world of his owne eſſence, nor of any other preexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting matter: for though it be a ſaying, that of nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made, yet that is true in reſpect of vs, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, and in reſpect of the order of Nature now, not in reſpect of the beginning of Nature in the Creation. And though it be true that ſome creatures were made of preexiſting matter, as mans body was made of the duſt of the earth, yet that preexiſting matter was created of nothing. Fifthly, all good: all things at firſt were made good, not in appearance, but in deed, not in mans iudgement who might bee deceiued, but in Gods: he ſaw that all was good, and ſo all creatures were good, in reſpect of excellence, diſtinction, numbe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and freedome from defects of faculties or power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each creature in his kinde. Sixtly, not all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and at once, but in ſix dayes: and that for diuers reaſons: for God would haue the creation of the firſt matter of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to be manifeſt and diſtinct from the framing and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of bodies out of that matter: beſides, thereby he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power and freedome in producing the creatures: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to be, before any naturall cauſe of them was, as to make light before the Sunne and Moone was: and further, thereby hee ſhewed his goodneſſe and care for the principall creatures, prouiding foode before hee brings in the beaſts,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14246:78"/>
and furniſhing the whole world ſets man to liue in it: and finally, hee warnes vs not to ſlip ouer the meditation of his workes ſuddenly, but with long and continuall deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Hee created the world in many dayes, to intimate, that wee ſhould not thinke a little time enough to wonder at ſo great glory. Seuenthly, he made all things without himſelfe: for though all things are in God, as in their cauſe and Author, in whom they liue, moue, and haue their being, yet are they out of God, in that they are no parts in God; nor the very diuine Eſſence, but haue a nature diſtinct from the Nature of God: they are not ſeparate from God in place, as if they could be any where, where God is not, but are other things then God is, and are not in God as a ſubiect, to which they inhere or are faſtened. Thus of the manner how they were made.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the end why the world was made, was the glory of God, <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4. (that is) that the world might bee a Glaſſe or Theatre of diuine vertues, and a Temple in which God would ſet forth, and teach, and make knowne to man his power, wiſdome and goodneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. not that God by the Creation doth get to himſelfe any glory, ſeeing he abounds in glory himſelfe, ſo vnmeaſurably, as nothing can bee added to it or taken from it: but onely hereby he communicates his glory to the Creature, and gaue the creatures occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and commend his glory: for by the Creation God makes himſelfe viſible as it were to the Creatures that are reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for though the Eſſence of God be inuiſible, yet by the Creation his power or Attributes are ſet out to be ſeene and read in that great Booke of nature: and if any men ſee little of God in this mighty Frame of his Workes, it is not becauſe God hath declared himſelfe therein but obſcurely, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are peruerſe and blockiſh, and full of natiue darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by reaſon of ſinne, and the effects of ſinne in vs.</p>
                  <p>Now, though infinite praiſes of God may be collected from the conſideration of the whole world, yet eſpecially, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, wiſdome and goodneſſe doe ſhine in his workes. His power we may gather two waies: both in that he could make all things of nothing, and that he could make ſuch great things as well and as eaſily as the ſmalleſt things, and things ſo many
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14246:79"/>
and diuerſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 10. The goodnes of God appeares both in this, that he made all things ſo good, and in that he hath ſhewed means ſo fit and conuenient &amp; powerfull to preſerue life and being in euery creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for creatures of diuers natures &amp; appetites, diuers food, remedies, and Armour to preſerue and defend them. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who can expreſſe the goodnes of God ſhewed to men? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. As for Diuels, Serpents, or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Creatures or hurtfull, they were not ſo by <hi>Creation,</hi> but by defection and ſinne, or as puniſhments for ſinne. The wiſdome of God is admirably diſcouered in the <hi>Creation,</hi> in that hee hath made all things in ſuch beautifull order, and hath appointed to euery thing ſuch peculiar vſes and ends, which they obſerue (men only excepted) and that he gouernes them in ſuch a conſtant, certaine, and perpetuall courſe: euery thing hauing not onely his fit and proper place in the Frame, but indewed alſo with ſuch variety of vſes and ſeruices.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the time when the world was made, we muſt know that the world and time were made together: ſo as all things were created in the beginning of time: and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the dayes or yeeres ſince the beginning of the world, hath beene kept carefully in the Church, the reckoning being made by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in the old Teſtament, and ſince kept by the Chriſtian Churches, ſo as now the world is aboue 5600. yeeres old. Before this time there was nothing but God himſelfe: and if any will needes aske What God did before the world was? I may not anſwer as the <hi>Iewes</hi> wickedly did, That he was making many little worlds, which he deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe, and neuer liked any till this Frame was vp: but our anſwer muſt be, That ſecret things belong vnto the Lord, and reueiled things to vs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. or elſe that of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> That God was making Hell for the curious: or elſe, That the Frame of all things was in the minde of God from all eternity, and ſo the world was as preſent to him then, as now.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we may hence be informed and confirmed, that God <note place="margin">Vſes.</note> is onely the true God, becauſe he is Creatour of Heauen and Earth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 6, 7. if any pleade, that he is God, the anſwer is at hand, let him make ſuch a Heauen and Earth, and we will belieue in him, elſe not.</p>

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:14246:79"/>
Secondly, the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World ſhould teach vs many duties:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To meditate of Gods works: and ſtudie the glory of God reuealed in this great booke of Nature: all are required to learne to read here, and if men will not take it well if their skill ſhewed in any cunning piece of work be not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged or regarded, how much more cauſe hath the Lord to be diſpleaſed with vs, for neglecting ſuch a curious and glorious frame, ſo full of admirable variety and skill?

                     </gap>tch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhewes that God ſets out before vs in his works, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 15 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is it inough to meditate of his workes, but wee muſt giue him the glory of them, by praiſing his power and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe ſhewed in them, we muſt ſtriue to get a Language to that end, and ſo bewaile our barrenneſſe of heart and words, as withall to beſeech him, that requires vs to learne his praiſes, to teach vs alſo to profit, and to giue larger hearts and better Language <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4 11. Thus haue the Worthies of the Lord done, <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who haue ſet themſelues in ſpeciall manner to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the praiſes of God in his workes: and of them wee ſhould learne to praiſe him, at leaſt make our ſelues skilfull in their formes of praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea thirdly, this glory of God ſhould ſwallow vp all the glory of men, this very work of making Heauen and Earth ſhould check vs for admiring and eſteeming ſo much of the creature whatſoeuer, ſince we haue ſuch a perpetuall, and ſurpaſſing cauſe of admiration of the Creator, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:14246:80"/>
5. It ſhould teach vs not to ſet our hearts too much vpon the world, for that God that ſet vp this mighty frame of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, can and will pull it all downe againe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſhould breed in vs the feare of God, and care of ſeruing him, and obeying him, that hath not onely ſupreame right vnto vs, being his workemanſhip, but ſoueraignty ouer all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 8, 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 95. 6. all creatures elſe doe his will.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It ſhould teach vs in all ſtraights and neede to flie to God for helpe: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhewes, our helpe ſtandeth in the Name of the Lord, which hath made Heauen and Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 124. 8.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſhould learne hence not to abuſe the <hi>Creatures</hi> of God to ill ends, ſeeing God hath aſſigned his <hi>Creatures</hi> to their right ends for his owne glory: It is abominable to fight againſt God with his owne weapons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Doctrine of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World ought <note place="margin">

And beſides, hence they may know that God can want no meanes to deſtroy them, ſeeing he hath ſuch Armies of his owne creatures in Heauen and Earth, which are all as his mighty ones, and ſanctified ones, for his anger againſt them.

The third part is the Habitation of God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the ſeate of the glory of God and his bleſſed one, where the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> now liues, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 19. and is called the third heauens, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. and this is the Heauen eſpecially meant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. for when there he ſaith, God Created heauen and earth, and the earth was without forme, &amp;c. he notes that God vſed a twofold way of <hi>Creation:</hi> ſome things he made immediately of nothing, as the Heauen of the bleſſed: ſome things he made of matter which was firſt made of nothing: for out of that <hi>Chaos</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. did the Lord extract and forme all this viſible world, both the firmament and light, and the elements and all creatures; only ſpirits, and the Heauen of the bleſſed hee made of no praeexi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Firſt, then we are to intreate of that Heauen where God in his glory, &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his glorious body are: and ſeeing by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is meant al that is contained in it by <hi>Creation,</hi> we are there to conſider of the Angels too, and both that Heauen and the Angels, belong to the inuiſible world, and the reſt to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

The ſubſtance of it: which is conceiued to be of a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excellent nature, farre more perfect and ſubtile then the ſubſtance not onely of the Elements, but of thoſe viſible heauens: which diuers gather thus. As any creature is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the earth, ſo is the ſubſtance of it leſſe groſſe and materiall. As the waters are thinner then the earth, and the Ayre then the waters, and the Element of fire (according to the common opinion of Diuines and Philoſophers) purer then the Ayre: and the Eſſence of the mighty Firmament, yet more pure then the foure Elements, as conſiſting of a fift Eſſence as they ſay in Schooles: and accordingly we ſee creatures fitted to each of theſe places. Fiſhes that cannot liue in the bowells of the earth, liue in the waters: and foules of a more ſpirituall being flie in the Ayre. Now when we are aſcended ſo high, as the higheſt viſible heauens, then do our minds conceiue of that glorious place of the bleſſed, made of a more pure Eſſence then any of theſe: And though Diuines ſay that the ſuſtance of theſe heauens muſt needs be corporeall and bodily which they proue by infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible reaſons, yet are they ſuch a body, as wee may call as it were ſpirituall, next in purity to the ſubſtance of Angels and mens ſoules.</p>

void of all decay, alteration and motion. A place that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from without it ſelfe, any thing of naturall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance or violence, or annoyance. A place aboue all places, large and ample, as containing in the bowells and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it all this viſible world. But if wee inquire after it as conſidered Theologically, we may ſee it in a Mirror, but yet it is but darkely, no tongue of man can vtter the glory of it, noe, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe that was there, yet could not declare what he ſaw, nor can it enter into the mortall heart of man to think what it is; what is reuealed in Scripture in praiſe of it, is inough to rauiſh our hearts with deſire after it, if we were ſuch as we ſhould be.

The Apoſtle ſaith of this light, it was like vnto a ſtone moſt precious, euen like a <hi>Iaſper ſtone,</hi> cleare as <hi>Chriſtall,</hi> that is alwaies flouriſhing, and ſhining without any clouds or darkeneſſe: and how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing God himſelfe and the Lambe is the light of it: there floweth from God, (being the place of his ſpeciall glory) a created light from God himſelfe, I ſay, by which it is after an vnſpeakeable manner inlightned, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. 11. 23. Whence it followes, that it is a place full of all vnſpeakeable refreſhing, pleaſure and delight: If the light of the Sunne at ſome ſeaſons of the yeere can ſo pleaſe, how much more doth this light of the glory of God? What ſhall I ſay? It is a place that hath nothing in it of euill, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in all that may content the glorified nature of the <hi>Creatures.</hi> And how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing there is no ſinne, nor no vncleane perſon there, and it is a place, that hath the glory of the Lord, vpon it, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. 11. which is

as much, as if he ſhould ſay, that the glory of heauen doth differ from all the glory of any place on earth, as God dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Kings and Potentates of the Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his chiefe houſe of Reſidence muſt needs almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely excell theirs. And the more is the glory of heauen, becauſe it is eternall, it cannot fade or euer ceaſe to bee: which is ſignified by thoſe golden and pretious foundations, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. Other Citties wil decay, becauſe they are builded by man and of corruptible matter, but this Cittie can neuer decay, becauſe God was the builder of it immediately and made it incorruptible. To conclude, it muſt needs bee a place of ſurpaſſing glory, ſeeing all the Treaſures of this world are ſearched out, and they can ſerue but to giue a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glimpſe of the meaneſt part of the praiſes of heauen: as the twentie one Chapter of the <hi>Reuelations</hi> ſhewes.</p>

the world, or their cauſes in nature, and the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is made knowne to Angels by the preaching of the Goſpell, which they ſee into with wonderfull abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though men be ſo dull and blockiſh in hearing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Daniel</hi> 8. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 22. adde to all theſe wayes their ſupernaturall knowledge of God, by which they are inabled to ſtand for euer without falling from God.

                     <p n="7">7 By the language in which God hath made them able to treat one with another, or with man or God: for it is cleare, they vſe not any fleſhly or corporall language in as much as they haue not bodies, and ſo no tongues: but they ſpeake one to another by a ſpirituall and heauenly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, without any audible ſound or vocall ſpeech or noife, I ſay after an vnutterable manner angellically, they inſinuate, inſtill, and communicate one to another, or to the vnderſtanding of men, what they will.

                     <p>The conſideration of this Doctrine of the making of the Angels in ſuch a nature, and for ſuch ends as before, ſhould ſerue for diuers vſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It ſhould informe vs concerning the wonderfull loue of God to vs, that hath made ſuch excellent creatures to do vs ſuch admirable ſeruice as to attend vpon vs and keepe vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It ſhould breed in vs a great longing after the world to come, where wee ſhall not onely enioy the knowledge of, and fellowſhip with ſuch glorious Creatures, but ſhall be made our ſelues in glory, as the Angels in Heauen.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It ſhould teach vs diuers things: as firſt, not to worſhip Angels, for they were all created by God: God made the Angels, and therefore worſhip is due to him, and not to them that are but our fellow ſeruants, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. Secondly, we ſhould therfore carry our ſelues orderly in all places, eſpecially in the Church, becauſe of the Angels, who are about vs, and marke what we doe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. Thirdly, we ſhould therefore be patient and of good hope, and full of faith in all afflictions ariſing from the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, or temptations of Satan, as being ſatisfied with this comfort, that they are more that are with vs then can be againſt vs, and if our eyes were opened, wee might ſee ſo much as was ſhewed to the ſeruant of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the Heauen of the bleſſed and the Hoſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Angels, and ſo of the world that is now inuiſible to vs: we next come downe to conſider of this viſible world, this world, I ſay, which is in our view, or may bee ſeene: and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14246:85"/>
before I come to ſpeake of the other two Heauens, I would briefly conſider of Gods glory in the generall in the making of this viſible world, not ſo much for the matter of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or their naturall formes or properties, or their next cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which belongs properly to the Philoſophers, but for ſuch things as concerne their firſt cauſe, which is God; or their end, which is Gods glory; or their vſe, which is rather ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall then corporall, in demonſtrating vnto the ſoule of man the praiſes of God.</p>
                     <p>The maker of this viſible world was GOD, as well as of that inuiſible world, as is manifeſtly proued, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. at large.</p>
                     <p>The end of making a world of bodies, as well as of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits was not the puniſhment of ſpirituall ſubſtances, for their ſinning againſt God, as <hi>Origen</hi> dreamed, but the ſetting out of Gods glory, in ſhewing his wiſdome, goodneſſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and the furniſhing of man for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py being.</p>
                     <p>That our hearts may be affected with wondering at this great world which God hath made: we may profitably conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, either by thinking what it is like, or by ſerious pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what it is indeed.</p>
                     <p>This great world is like a great Garden throughly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, euery creature being as a pleaſant flower exquiſitely ranked in moſt comely order, the onely weedes that grow in this Garden, are wicked men: as it may be likened to a great Booke, in which God hath written glorious things that concerne the praiſe of his goodneſſe, wiſdome and power: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery creature is, as it were, a diſtinct leaſe of that Booke, and the properties and vſes of theſe creatures are, as it were, the ſeuerall lines and letters of that leafe: and the more admirable, becauſe it is a Booke; the writing whereof is indelible, and the vſes whereof are vniuerſall: the Booke ſo opened, that all men in all parts of the world may ſee and read. Againe, this viſible world may be likened to a great and faire houſe, moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely buil, and contriued into ſeuerall roomes, and euery roome richly furniſhed; the Heauens are the Roofe, the Earth the floore, and the Elements the ſeuerall roomes, and the hoſts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14246:86"/>
of creatures in each of them the rich furniture: and this houſe is the more admirable for vs, becauſe it is a houſe that euery man dwels in, out of this houſe no man can be put, &amp; it is kept at the charge of the Land-lord, and the Tenants pay no rent.</p>
                     <p>But to leaue ſimilitudes, there are in the generall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this viſible world diuers things may bee briefly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which we ought to wonder at, and to glorifie God, for his making of things ſo: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The apt diſpoſition of euery creature in his owne place; which place is ſo fit, as a fitter cannot bee inuented: if the Starres were fixed in the Earth, or the Trees in Heauen, how diſproportionable and vncomely would it be?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The exactneſſe of the Cteatures in their working, in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their times and ſeaſons: how punctually doth the Sunne diſpatch his race in 24. houres, and ſo the Moone in her ſeaſons: the Plants keepe their ſeaſons of the yeere for bearing fruit, and the Starres for ſhining, as they haue receiued commandement and order from their great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, which is God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That euery creature ſerues for ſome vſe, and many of the creatures diſpatch exceeding much worke, in the vſes vnto which the Creator hath appointed them: and euery creature hath a kinde of exactneſſe and perfectneſſe in his nature and being.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The ſtrange variety of creatures ſet in this viſible world, with their moſt various proprieties: take any roome of this houſe, who can count the number of plants, trees, beaſts, or men vpon earth? Who can reckon the number of Seas, Riuers, Ponds, Springs, or creatures in them: or count the number of Foules or Flyes in the Ayre, or Starres in Heauen? And this variety is the more wond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rfull, if wee ſtraightly conſider that our God made them all: and that they are all ſtill preſerued in their kindes to this day: and that they are made all in ſuch different formes and portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not onely one kinde from another, but one ſingular creature from another in the ſame kinde.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The maruellous order and relation of the creatures in their kindes and reſpect one to another, in regard whereof
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14246:86"/>
the Pſalmiſt magnifies the wiſdom of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 5. and this order is admirable if we conſider the different degrees of creatures, ſeruing one to another in their kinds: as ſome things God made to haue being only, as the Heauens, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Meteors, and Minerals. Some things haue being and life alſo: as the herbes and trees: ſome things hauing being, life, and ſenſe alſo, as the beaſts &amp; fowles: ſome things haue being, ſenſe, life &amp; reaſon alſo, as men; and theſe degrees ſo connexed, that the latter includes alwaies the former, &amp; the inferior degrees ſerue the higher: as the Heauens and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adorne &amp; feed the Plants, the Plants feed the Beaſts, the Beaſts feede and ſerue men, and men ſerue God. Againe the order is wonderfull in the placing of theſe bodies ſo, as with vnſpeakable neereneſſe, each creature fils his place ſo, as there is no <hi>vacuum</hi> or emptineſſe betweene; and beſides, are ſo ſet, as though they be diuers of them directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another, yet are ſo ſet, as they deſtroy not one another, but preſerue the whole Frame. I omit many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things for breuities ſake.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe generall conſiderations of this viſible world, we may raiſe many vſes for our ſelues: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1 We haue cauſe to admire and wonder at the glory of God, that made ſuch a huge and ſtrong building: wonder, I ſay, at him that giues place for all theſe things to be in, &amp; yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe conteined in no place; that moues all theſe things, and yet is himſelfe vnmoueable; that made all theſe creatures, being himſelfe vncreated, and that ſhewed ſuch skill in the leaſt things as is beyond the art of all men to doe the like.</p>

                     <p n="4">4 We ſhould heartily pray vnto God, to teach vs to reade in this booke of nature &amp; ſince he hath furniſhed vs with ſuch a great and glorious Library, to be pleaſed to teach vs the skill to read and vnderſtand, and the rather becauſe he will iudge vs by the contents of this booke of nature, as well as by the booke of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>

                     <p n="6">6 God himſelfe hath giuen vs certaine Caueats, by way of preuention which we muſt looke to, when we reade in this great Booke.

                     <p>I returne now to the ſecond Heauen, which is the higheſt part of this viſible World, called in Scripture the Firmament: and concerning it we may wonder at theſe things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The maker of theſe Heauens: and ſo the Scriptures doe magnifie the praiſes of God, for diuers diſtinct things: as firſt, that he did ſpread out theſe heauens like a curtaine, and ſtretched them out as a Tent to dwell in, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 22.

                     <p>The more ordinarie Meteors may for order ſake be caſt into three ſorts: ſome fiery, ſome ayrie, ſome watery.</p>
                     <p>The fiery Meteors in Nature are many, which are ſeene in great diuerſity and often: as pillars of fire, the fire we call the falling of the Starres, the fire they call <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or fooles fire, the fire that will hang about mens garments or the ſailes of ſhips, blazing Starres or the Lightning. But the Scripture doth eſpecially ſingle out the Thunder and Lightning, to make obſeruations about it for our vſes.</p>
                     <p>And ſo firſt of Thunder and Lightning both together, the Scripture would haue vs take notice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they are in a ſpeciall manner of Gods making, though the Philoſopher ſay much to tell vs how they are raiſed and framed by nature, yet God challengeth a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar honour in the making of them, aboue what wee can reach too: and therefore they are called his Thunder and his Lightning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 17. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 104. 6. 7. <hi>Iob</hi> 38. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. That they are both Officers vnto God, in a ſpeciall place about him, ſeruing about the Lord, when there is ſpeciall occaſion to ſhew the terror and greatneſſe of his Maieſty: as when the Law was to bee giuen, and the Lord was to come downe vpon Mount <hi>Sinay, Exod</hi> 19. 16. and ſo when the Lord as King would come downe amongſt vs here in the world, the Thunder and Lightning doe not onely giue notice of his comming, but as his high Marſhalls, they make roome for it, and compell people of all ſorts in their places to expect the comming of the Lord, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 97. 1. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, each of them are magnified apart: as,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Thunder is called the voice of God, the ſound that goeth out of his mouth which God directeth vnder the whole Heauen, as a wiſe man directeth his ſpeech to the

                     <p n="2">2. The Lightnings are called Gods Arrowes, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 14. 15. and ſo they are wonderfull, if we conſider, that it is God onely that diuided a way for the Lightning, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. 26. and that God can by theſe Arrowes diſcomfit an Armie of enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 6. and that God can ſhoot ſo farre with them <hi>(viz)</hi> from one end of the Heauen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 27. and that God doth make the Lightnings with the raine at the ſame time, when one would thinke the raine ſhould quench the fire of the Lightning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 7. and this obſeruation of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> twiſe alledgeth Verbatim as a matter of wonder, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 51. 26.</p>

                     <p>What vſe we ſhould make of the Thunder and Lightning we are likewiſe taught in the booke of God: for the Thunder being Gods voice, we are enioyned when God ſpeakes in ſuch Maieſty, to heare him attentiuely, yea, and to ſpeake of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Temple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 9. <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 2. and what the meaning is of his voice he hath told vs in his Word, ſo that as often as we heare the Thunder, wee ſhould know that God by that mighty voice doth tell vs:</p>

                     <p>Concerning the windes, theſe things are noted as admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Scripture.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

It is admirable that ſuch buſtling and vnruly creatures, as the windes ſhould bee made to pace orderly: yet it is ſaid, that God weighs euen the windes and before he ſends them out, he looketh to the ends of the whole earth, and ſeeth exactly vnder the whole Heauens to appoint their Motion and their way, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. 25.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Laſtly, wee vpon whom the ends of the world are come, when wee ſee the Earth tremble, ſhould remember the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the generall iudgement, the Lord by that ſigne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warning vnto men to awake out of ſecurity, and prouide for their accounts, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 7.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the Ayrie Meteors: The watry Meteors follow, and thoſe are Clouds, Snow, Miſt, Deaw, Froſt, Haile, and Raine, and hither I may referre the Rainebow, and theſe are moſt frequently mentioned in Scripture, and though men for the commonneſſe of theſe things doe neglect the ſtudy of Gods glory in them, yet the Lord euen from theſe things doth for our vſe gather many excellent obſeruations to teach vs and to ſhew vs his glory.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are commended in Scripture:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For the wonder of their originall: who can tell who is the Father of the Raine, and who hath begotten the drops of the Deaw, out of whoſe wombe came the Ice, and who hath gendered the hoare Froſt that comes from Heauen? who can ſhew the ſecret of hiding the waters as with a ſtone, and freezing the face of the deepe: who can lift vp his voice to the Clouds, that abundance of waters may come downe? <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 28, 29, 30, 34.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For the wonderfull working of God in the placing and ordering of them: as that God ſhould binde vp the waters in his thicke Cloud, and yet the Cloud not to bee rent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

them, <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 8, 9. and that God ſhould ſhake the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Heauen, and yet Heauen falls not, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. that God can fetch vp and cauſe the vapours to aſcend from the very ends of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 7. that hee weigheth the waters by meaſure, when he maketh a decree for the raine, ſeeing to it and preparing it, and ſearching out all things that concerne the falling of euery drop of the raine, ſo as not any of it falls in vaine, or in a wrong place, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. 25, 26, 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. 12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For the worth and excellency of theſe things: called the bleſſings of Heauen, and the precious things of Heauen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 25.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 For the vſe he puts theſe things to: for</p>
                     <p n="1">1 By theſe, when he pleaſeth he can iudge his enemies: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſhutting vp the Heauens that they fall not, or by opening the windowes of Heauen, as hee did in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the old world, <hi>Iob.</hi> 36. 31. he reſerues theſe againſt the day of battell, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 23. <hi>Eſay</hi> 24. 17, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 At the firſt he made the Clouds to be a garment for the Sea, when it was firſt brought out, and a ſwadling band for it, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 By the Clouds, as in a Chariot, God rides about this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world to viſit it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 He vſeth the Clouds to hold backe the face of his Throne by ſpreading it vpon it, <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 To ſhew his power, he often with his Cloud couereth the Light, and commandeth it not to ſhine by the Cloud that commeth betwixt, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 32.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 God hath made himſelfe a Pauillion to ſit in, with waters and thick Clouds, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 12.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 By theſe God waters our Land as wee doe our Gardens, and by the vertue of them, hee giueth meat in abundance, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 For the intereſt that God hath giuen vs vnto theſe things, and therefore they are called our Heauens, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 28. and therefore no man can be poore that hath ſo great ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>The vſe is eſpecially to ſet vs in an euerlaſting admiration of God, not onely for theſe things which he hath reueiled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14246:93"/>
theſe things, but euen for the intimation, that there are many things we know not, but are aboue our reach: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſaith he, God is great, and wee know him not, if wee ſhould but conſider that one thing that ſeemes the leaſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is too wonderfull for vs, euen Gods making of the drops of raine ſo ſmall, and yet ſo proportionall among themſelues, when God cauſeth them to diſtill vpon man, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 26, 27, 28. We haue great cauſe to ſtand ſtill and wonder: we know not the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge. We cannot order our ſpeech in theſe things by reaſon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If a man ſpeake, he ſhall bee ſwallowed vp with the greatneſſe, and difficulty, and glory of theſe things, <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 14, 16, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Almighty, in theſe things wee cannot finde him out, he is excellent in power and in Iudgement, and in plenty of Iuſtice, euen by theſe things, <hi>Iob</hi> 37. 23. Men ſhould therefore feare him, for as he ſheweth by reaſoning from theſe things in another place, the onely wiſdome of a man, were to feare God, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. 28.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, wee ſhould learne of theſe things how to ſerue God, they keepe their ſeaſons, and they returne not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againe, but doe the worke God ſent them for, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 56. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 We ſhould bee wonderfull thankfull to God euen for theſe bleſſings of Heauen. They were wont in the firſt ages of the world, to thinke they had cauſe to praiſe God for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dew of Heauen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 28, 39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 13, 28. Wee are exhorted to ſing praiſe to God, who couereth the Heauen with Clouds, and prepareth raine for the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 7, 8. Men vſe to giue a great deale of mony to buy a little land, and yet cannot praiſe him that giues them what is more worth then that they buy; for it is God that giueth the dew, and the ſnow, and the raine, and ſo the Graſſe and the Corne, without which the Land were worth nothing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Seeing God hath wrought wonderfully in theſe things, and that they are ſo precious for our vſes, we muſt learne (if at any time God reſtraine theſe bleſſings of Heauen) to ſeeke them by prayer and repentance for our ſinnes, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 18.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14246:93"/>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 27. 28. and if we would haue them continued to vs, we muſt looke to the paying of our Tythes duly, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Wicked men are but in ill taking: for (beſides that by theſe things GOD can plague them, hauing reſerued them for the day of warre as was ſhewed before) the Lord by theſe things hath left them without excuſe, hauing from them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to pleade for him againſt the wicked, as is ſhewed <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 14.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We muſt take heede of doubting Gods prouidence in ſending theſe bleſſings from Heauen: we may reade of a man that was troden to death, for doubting whether God could furniſh mans wants by theſe things, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, we muſt make conſcience of it to learne theſe things and what elſe God teacheth vs by them, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the wonder of Gods printing, that can make his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo great, that a man may ſee and reade ſo farre off, and therefore remember to magnifie his worke, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 24, 25.</p>
                     <p>As for the Raine-bow two things only I will note.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 What we may obſerue by the ſenſe of ſeeing: and that is the ſtrange varieties and perfection of colours, that God by his power gathereth in that manner into the Ayre, which Ayre of it ſelfe is without any colour, raiſed and diſſolued againe after a little time without any remnant of theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours left.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 What we may reade in Scripture of it: and that is both concerning the Author of it, and the end of it. The Author of it is God, who calleth it his Bow; and the end is by Gods owne appointment, to ſecure and aſſure man that the world ſhall neuer be deſtroyed by waters any more; which is the more wonderfull, becauſe the Rainebow in it ſelfe is often a fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>runner of Raine, as experience ſhewes, and by the deſcending of the two hornes of it to the Earth and Seas, doth drinke vp vapours, and carry them into the Ayre to breede Raine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of Heauen, the Earth followes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Earth.]</hi> The terme of Earth here comprehends (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) the dry Land, as alſo the waters of the Sea that lye vpon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14246:94"/>
the Earth: and therefore I would firſt briefly conſider of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Sea, theſe things in Scripture are taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 What it is: and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes the Sea to be the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the waters into a heape, which before did flow ouer all the face of the earth: and this collection of the waters vnder the Firmament, God himſelfe named the Sea, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Originall of theſe waters; and that God claimes as a glory to himſelfe, to haue made the Sea as well as other vaſt Creatures, the Sea is his and hee made it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 5. he is the God that made the Sea and the dry Land, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 9. and for the manner of making it, as it had diuers things common with other creatures, as to be made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and by the Word of God, and ſo the waters in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall are ſaid to haue the Spirit of God to ſit vpon them, as the Hen ſitteth vpon the Chickens, to giue it forme and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The wonder of Gods power in placing and diſpoſing of the Sea, and that in many reſpects: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That he hath made theſe waters to be of ſuch vaſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vnſearchable depth, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 16. <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That he hath founded the world vpon the Seas, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it vpon the Flouds, ſetting the mighty Frame of the vpper world vpon the waters and the earth to hold them vp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That he hath caſt all theſe waters into their ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he keepes them in heapes, as in moſt conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Store-houſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That hee keepes them ſo ſtrangely from drowning the whole Earth without any other Barres or Doores then the word of his owne Power, ſaying to it, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further, and heere ſhall thy proud waues ſtand, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 8, 10, 11. making the very Sands in a plaine to ſtay the raging waues of the Sea, and to bee the bounds thereof, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5. 22. giuing his decree to the waters once for all in the beginning, that they ſhould not paſſe his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14246:94"/>
Commandement, <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. 29. and to that end hee ſets a watch ouer the Sea, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 12.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 That he rules and gouernes the Seas, doing with them whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 6. Hee deuideth the Sea when the waues thereof roare (which hee doth by his authority as the Lord of Hoſts) <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 35. Hee ſo ruleth the raging of the Sea, that when the waues thereof ariſe he ſtilleth them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 9. ſo as in their greateſt tumults, if he but ſpeake to them, they are ſtill preſently at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. and as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, he deuideth the Sea with his power, and by his vnderſtanding hee ſmiteth through the proud, <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 12. He alone treadeth vpon the waues of the Sea, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 8.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 That he hath ordered it ſo, that all Riuers runne into the Sea, and yet the Sea is not full, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ends of creating the Sea, which are partly Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and partly mens vſe; and partly to doe ſpeciall ſeruice to the Sonne of man, the Sauiour of the world.</p>
                     <p>The glory of the Lord appeareth in the Sea in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſiderations, and the Sea by roaring praiſeth God, and is in Scripture called vpon to praiſe, and to ſhew that hee raigneth, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 32.</p>
                     <p>The Sea alſo ſerueth for mans vſe: for men doe their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in theſe great waters, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 107. 23. when they goe downe to the Sea in Ships, &amp; the way of a Ship in the middeſt of the Sea, is one of the foure things which are too wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to reach to, <hi>Prou.</hi> 30, 19. Beſides, there are great treaſures and riches in the Sea, which God hath giuen vnto man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 25. for men come to haue right to the fiſhes of the Sea by grant from God in the beginning of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 2. And beſides, the abundance which men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Seas that way, they are inriched by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures hid in the ſands, ſuch as are either Pearles or precious ſtones, or ſome kindes of creatures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 19. And it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a great iudgement, to take away the Fiſhes of the Sea from man, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 3. And further, when God is angry with man, he can call for the waters of the Sea, and powre them on the face of the earth, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:14246:95"/>
The ſpeciall ſeruice the Sea doth, or is to doe to Chriſt, is by her roaring, to giue warning to the world of his ſecond comming to Iudgement, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p>There are many vſes made in Scripture of this Doctrine concerning Gods workmanſhip about the Sea: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1 This mighty creature thus made and ordered by GOD, ſerues to ſet out the great glory of Gods wiſdome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> with admiration obſerues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 25. and if the Sea be ſo great and mighty, how great and mighty is the Lord, that ſo eaſily rules ſo vaſt a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 3, 4. the very Sea ſhewes that he is GOD alone, <hi>Neh</hi> 9. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Lord himſelfe notes it with indignation, as a foule offence againſt him, that men doe not learne for euer to be afraid of God that hath ſet ſuch bounds to the Sea, that by his owne word ſtayes the Sea from ouerwhelming vs all, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 22. To ſee the waues of the Sea toſſing themſelues, and yet are kept in within the very ſands, that they dare not paſſe ouer them, and though they roare yet cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to get beyond the bound God hath ſet them, ſhould make a mans heart tremble at the power of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Wee that dwell in the Iles of the Sea, and are compaſſed round about with the raging waters ſhould glorifie God, for the wonder of his omnipotency in keeping vs from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing by the waters: we ſhould make his praiſe glorious by dayly admiration and celebration of his Name, <hi>Eſay</hi> 24. 15. Yea, if the waters might haue but their firſt and naturall courſe, all the Inhabitants of the earth would bee drowned, there would be no dry land: and therefore oh that men would praiſe God for his goodneſſe, for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes he doth for the children of men: eſpecially ſuch as goe downe to the Sea in the Ships, theſe ſee the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe, and therefore ſhould in a ſpeciall manner praiſe him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 21, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This mighty Creature ſhewes that wicked men can neuer proſper, for beſides, that God can fight againſt many of them by the waters and deſtroy them, or call for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14246:95"/>
and ouerflow them, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 8. The power of God in ruling the boyſterous waues of the ſea, ſhewes that no man can harden himſelfe againſt God and proſper: hee that tames the ſea can ſubdue them and ſmite through the proud, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 8. and therefore it is a deſperate courſe for men wilfully to rebell againſt God, for no man ſhall bee ſtrong by his owne might, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>But manifeſtly from hence may be gathered, that if God will ſhut vp, or cut off, or gather together, who can hinder him? he knoweth vaine men, and he ſeeth wickedneſſe, and will he not conſider it? <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Theſe contemplations ſhould in generall quicken vs to Gods Seruice, and prouoke vs to worſhip him with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, humility, and holines, as theſe places ſhew, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 93. 3, 4, 5. ſeeing hee is ſo great a King aboue all Kings, and ſo mighty a Commander, wee ſhould bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with all Reuerence, and offer the Sacrifice of righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 19.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Diuers Conſolations may bee gathered from hence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The power of God that can order and ſtill the raging of the Sea, doth aſſure the godly, when they are moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppoſed by their aduerſaries, that yet God can and will preſerue them, in that God is mightier then the Noyſe of many waters, then the mighty waues of the Sea: <hi>Dauid</hi> gathers from hence, that therefore his teſtimonies are ſure, and all that he hath promiſed concerning the preſeruation of his people, ſhall certainely and eaſily be performed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 3. 4. 5. and therefore they are happie that put their truſt in him, for hee will keepe his Mercie and his Truth, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 146. 5. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When men are in vproares, and the World full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and warres, the conſideration of Gods power ouer the raging of the ſea, is an incouragement and comfort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men that waite vpon God, that hee can alſo ſtill the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the people: as the Prophet gathers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such men as haue callings to doe their buſineſſe in the Sea, may hence gather comfort for their ſafetie there, for God is the confidence of them that are a farre off in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14246:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sea: as the ſame Prophet ſhewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 5. We may truſt God for our preſeruation on the ſea aſwell as on the drie land, ſeeing his command is as great in the one as in the other.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, hence the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gathers an vnanſwerable confutation of Atheiſts that thinke all things will continue alike, and that there will be no breaking vp of the world for the laſt iudgement, and that things are carried meerely by a naturall courſe: for that the Earth ſtands out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in the waters, if there were no higher cauſe then nature, the world would preſently bee ouerflowed, if God let goe his hold of the waters, as manifeſtly appeared in the deſtruction of the old world, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5.</p>

power and cauſe which God hath ſet in them which wee ſee not: it muſt needs bee ſtrange to ſee creatures of ſuch bignes ſtirre themſelues with ſuch variety of Motions, and yet nothing from without to lift them. The skillfulleſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the world, though they can make ſtrange and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious formes of things, yet they cannot make them ſtirre, or liue, or ſee, &amp;c.

                     <p n="3">3 The ſtrange prouiſion God hath furniſhed them withall in reſpect of cloathing, defence, and food: No beaſt but hee comes into the world clothed, and hath by nature Armes to defend himſelfe; either hornes or teeth, or hoofes, or pawes, or the like; and beſides, wee ſee that the young ones of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery kinde doe preſently moue themſelues to their food, and can make ſome ſhift for themſelues to liue. Man in theſe things is inferiour to the beaſts, for he comes into the world, naked, infirme, crying, and hath no vſe of his limbs to helpe himſelfe, all bloudy, as if hee had newly eſcaped the hands of Theeues; and beſides, he is bound in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bands, as if he were a Captiue.</p>
                     <p>In the Scriptures theſe things are charged vpon vs to take notice of concerning the beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Their Originall, which they haue from God: for they were made by the Word of the Lord, as the Heauens and the Earth were: for God commanded the Earth to bring forth the liuing creature after his kind, Cattle and creeping things, and the beaſt of the Earth after his kind. It was God that made the Beaſt of the Earth after his kinde, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell after their kinde, and euery thing that creepeth vpon the earth after his kind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 24, 25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The end of their <hi>Creation,</hi> which was partly the illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the glory of God, as they are viſible looking-glaſſes, to ſhew the goodneſſe, wiſdome and power of GOD to man, and therefore man is charged to aske the beaſts of the field, and they ſhall teach him, <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 7, 8. and partly for the vſe of man, both for his body and ſoule: for his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they were created to ſerue him for his clothing, foode, and for the diſpatch of his labours. And for his ſoule, they

ſerue not onely to helpe his knowledge, euery beaſt being a ſeuerall booke for him to reade in, but alſo to reproue and inſtruct him, as will appeare in the vſes afterwards.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The prouidence of God in maintaining them, in which God receiueth praiſe in diuers reſpects: Firſt, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and cares for all the beaſts of the field, euery worke of his hand, as he knoweth them all, ſo he like a Shepherd, tends them and prouides for them: theſe all looke vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 27. Secondly, that hee hath giuen them ſuch large roome in the Earth. He hath made them free in all Deſerts and Wilderneſſes through the world, allowing them theſe places to dwell in and to feede in, <hi>Iob</hi> 39. 5, 6, 7, 8. Thirdly, that he hath ordered it ſo, as they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon him in a manner immediately: and therefore is ſaid to feed them with his owne hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 28. Which appeares the more, becauſe they neither ſow nor reape, nor haue any Barnes to lay vp prouiſion before hand, but are prouided for as they need: The Lyon as oft as hee is hungry ſeeketh his prey of God: God hunts his prey for him, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 39, 40. Fourthly, that God takes notice of the naturall neceſſities of the beaſts, their wants and hunger being as Prayers before him: and therefore they are ſaid to looke vp to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 27. to cry to him, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 41. to ſeeke their meat of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 21, Fiftly, that hee prouides variety of meat for them according to their kinds, hence hee is ſaid to giue them their meat, not meat to them, to note that it is that meate which is is fit for euery kinde, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 27. Sixtly that hee giues it them in due ſeaſon; No <hi>Phyſitian</hi> tending his <hi>Patient,</hi> no <hi>Nurſe</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her <hi>Infant</hi> more carefully then God doth theſe liuing Creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 27. Seuenthly, that when there are worlds of them diſſolued into their duſt, he ſends his Spirit to create a new world of them, perpetuating their ſorts by continuall off-ſprings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 30.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The ſubiection of the Beaſts vnto man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 6, 7. which howſoeuer ſince the fall of man diuers ſorts of Beaſts ſtand out in defiance to man, yet how great a worke of God it is to make theſe Beaſts that are ſubiect, to be ſo, may appeare

euen by theſe Beaſts that will not feare or obey man, for ſuch would the reſt haue beene, if God had not ſubdued them vnto man. The Lord inſtanceth himſelfe in the wild Aſſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 39. 7. and the Vnicorne, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, <hi>&amp; c</hi> and beſides, if we conſider the nature and ſtrength of thoſe Beaſts that doe yeeld to man, it ſhewes a power aboue mans power to make them ſo tame.

                     <p>The Vſes follow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Atheiſt might ſee reaſon to abhor himſelfe, becauſe euery creature proues there is a God. The Beaſts of the field may teach him. Yea, the meaneſt things, the creeping things of the earth proue there is a God: for who made Flyes, Wormes, Lice and other Vermine? He will ſay, the Sunne and putrifaction: but they liue, and moue, and haue ſenſes, they haue eyes feet, wings, did the Sunne and putrifaction make theſe too? Why art thou ſilent now, tell, whence are theſe? Can the Sunne and putrifaction giue that which they haue not themſelues? The Sunne is without life, how can it giue life to other things?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing the Beaſts are Gods creatures, wee muſt make conſcience of it, to ſhew mercy euen to the beaſts wee vſe. A good man is ſaid to be mercifull to his Beaſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Prou.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is matter to humble vs from the very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Beaſts: for firſt, in many things the very beaſts excell man, as the Horſe and the Elephant doe in ſtrength, <hi>Iob</hi> 39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40. and in skill, ſome of the vileſt of them goe beyond man: I will inſtance onely in the Spider, no man can build ſo curiouſly, nor woman weaue ſo ſmall a threed as the Spider doth: and experience ſheweth, that in ſenſes diuers creatures do excell man. Secondly, the more ſorts of creatures there are, the greater is Gods Army to fight againſt vs, if wee prouoke him, and he can doe ſtrange things by weake inſtruments, he conquered a mighty Prince, euen by Frogs, Locuſts, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: and to ſhew his power, God hath giuen ſuch a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Empire to the very ſmall Vermine, as Lice, Wormes, Gnats, that they ineuitably aſſault not onely the poore but

the rich, yea, the Kings of the earth are ſubiect to their aſſaults; which hath a ſecret demonſtration in it of Gods power and Iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, wicked men are bitterly reproued in Scripture by the very conſideration of the Beaſts of the Field, and that two wayes: either becauſe they are in ſome things worſe then the beaſts, or elſe becauſe they make themſelues like the beaſts. They are worſe then the beaſts, for not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. The Aſſe knowes his owner, and the Oxe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Crib, but wicked men doe not know God who yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth dayly for them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 3.

Drunkards and Gluttons ſhall haue the beaſts of the field to riſe vp in iudgement againſt them, becauſe they, if they come to a Riuer, will drinke no more then may ſuffice nature. They are likened to beaſts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for their vncapableneſſe, and want of vnderſtanding in ſpirituall things, and for their ignorance of their owne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or careleſneſſe of their owne ruine to come. Thus men are called brutiſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.</p>
                     <p>And in particular, they are likened to the Horſe or Mule for kicking and wronging ſuch as would dreſſe their ſores, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. To Dogs, for flying vpon thoſe that admoniſh them, and for cauſeleſſe ſnarling at the godly that meddle not with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. And to Gotes, for their vnſauorineſſe and wildneſſe, no bounds will hold them. And to Foxes, for their deceit ſo <hi>Herod</hi> is called a Fox.

And to the Aſpes, for ſtopping their eares, that the Word of God may not charme them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Gods owne ſeruants are ſet to Schoole to learne of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14246:102"/>
the very beaſts of the Field. We muſt learne of ſheep to know the voice of our Shepheard, and to bee ſociable among our ſelues, and to auoid ſociety with the wicked (a ſheepe will not ſort with a Swine) and to be patient vnder wrongs (the ſheepe is ſilent vnder the hands of the Shearer, yea, of the ſlaughterman) and to be profitable, as all about the Sheepe is for vſe. We muſt alſo learne of the Done to bee harmeleſſe, and of the very Serpents to be wiſe, to keepe our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ith ſure as they keepe their heads. Wee muſt learne to affect God and ſpirituall things, as the Hart pants after the Riuers of water, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. Yea, there are little things that reade Lectures of great wiſdome to vs, <hi>Prou.</hi> 30. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Ants, the mountaine Rats (which were a ſort of little creatures vſuall in the Eaſt, whereas Conies doe neither build in the Rocks, nor are ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for their bigneſſe with the other three ſorts of creatures) the Locuſts and the Spider. Of the Ant we ſhould learne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and prouidence, in times of plenty to prouide for dearth, eſpecially in ſpirituall things. Of the Mountaine Rats we ſhould learne vpon the experience of our owne weakneſſe, to prouide by Faith, ſo as we may reſt in the Rock of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty protection. Of the Locuſts we ſhould learne to doe our duties though we be not compelled, and to be carefull to keepe our fellowſhip with the Saints. Of the Spider, that workes euen in Kings Palaces, we ſhould learne to hold forth the light of the Truth, by either Doctrine or good example in all places, and not to be daunted for the preſence of any, or the example of the multitude that are otherwiſe imployed.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto hath beene intreated of the <hi>Creatures</hi> of all ſorts, ſome of them being onely ſpirituall Creatures, as the Angels; ſome of them onely bodily creatures, as all the reſt in Heauen and earth: Now followeth, that we conſider of man, who is a creature both ſpirituall in reſpect of his ſoule, and corporall in reſpect of the outward matter of which he conſiſts. A crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into whom enters the compoſition of all the world; Nature as it is ſpirituall and bodily meeting in man: for man is the Epitomie of all Gods works, and a patterne of the great Vniuerſe: He is the world abridged, or the little world, into whoſe being enters the nature of euery thing without him,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14246:102"/>
being a creature partly terreſtriall, partly celeſtiall, partly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, partly immortall: ſo as what God made a part in other creatures, he makes perfect and ioyntly together in man: He had made ſpirits by themſelues, and bodies by themſelues, and then he makes a Creature that ſhould conſiſt of ſpirit and body ioyned together; and therefore as wee haue read in the great Booke of nature which is the world, ſo now we muſt learne to read in the little Booke of Nature, which is man: elſe it will be a ſhame for vs to know other things, and not know our ſelues: He were a ſenceleſſe man, that did know curiouſly all the roomes in other mens Palaces, and yet knowes not ſo much as a corner of his owne dwelling.</p>
                     <p>The excellency of Gods workmanſhip in creating man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, if we conſider his body apart, or his ſoule apart, or his body and ſoule iointly.</p>
                     <p>About the body of man God hath done many things, more then he did to any other bodily creatures: for</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Whereas all other bodies were created only by ſaying, let them be, &amp; they were ſo, God did take more ſpecial regard of mans body, and therefore doth forme it (as it were with his owne hands) out of the duſt of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The body of man now ſince the <hi>Creation,</hi> is not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the Parents without the wonderfull workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: and therefore all our bodies are ſaid to bee made and faſhioned by God as well as <hi>Adams, Iob</hi> 10. 8. Yea, it was the Spirit of the ſtrong God that made vs, and the breath of the Almighty that put life into vs, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 4. We are creatures now as well as <hi>Adam, Marke</hi> 16. 15. and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, He was fearefully and wonderfully made, it was a maruellous worke, and he was curiouſly wrought in the wombe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 14, 15, 16. Yea, he ſaith there, that God did it by the Booke, hauing written it downe from eternity, how all his members ſhould be faſhioned.

                        </gap>? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 10. And as we know not what is the way of the Spirit, ſo we know not how the bones doe grow in the wombe of her that is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14246:103"/>
with childe: and ſo we may ſay of the reſt, we know not the workes of God who maketh all, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 5. the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eare, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made euen both of them, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 12. It was God onely that clothed vs with skinne, and fenced vs with bones and ſinewes, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 11. and ſo it was God onely that formed the inward parts of mans body: hee formed the heart, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 33. 15. and the workemanſhip within mans body was ſo great, that he reſerues it as a glory onely to himſelfe, to know and ſearch the heart and reines of a man: and this is the more admirable, if we conſider, that no part of the body is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous or idle, but euery part hath his function, and ſome excellent worke to doe, which function it exerciſeth by it ſelfe for the good of the whole body, without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the office of the other members: which is the more wonderfull if we conſider the innumerable parts and parcels of the body of a man. Not the leaſt threed or veine in a mans body but it doth ſome excellent office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 God made the body of man in beauty and faireneſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all other viſible creatures: for both his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is lifted vp to Heauen, and the parts of his body are with more comlineſſe proportioned, and his colour is full of ſweetneſſe and louelineſſe: Thus it was with man in his Creation, and thus and much better it ſhall bee with his body, when hee ſhall ſhine as the Starres in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The body of man had at the firſt no diſpoſition to wearineſſe, or ſickneſſe, or death: which the bodies of all other liuing Creatures were ſubiect to. This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge mans body had not by nature but by the gift of GOD: GOD hauing infuſed into the body a ſoule, that did her worke in the body perfectly, and allowing him ſuch foode as was moſt effectuall for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, and giuing man skill and care to looke to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and if the body in time would haue declined, God would haue preuented that by tranflating man to Heauen, without ſickneſſe and death.</p>

5. Language is an admirable indowment of the body of man onely, who is able to expreſſe himſelfe with infinite variety and diſtinctions of ſound whence flowes all conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and delightfull or profitable ſociety.</p>
                     <p>But the excellencie of Gods power and glory in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans ſoule who can perfectly recount? God hath done wonderfully for man in reſpect of his ſoule aboue all other viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The ſoule was breathed into the body of man by God <note place="margin">A ſoule can no more beget a ſoule, then an Angel can beget an Angel.</note> himſelf, by ſpeciall inſpiration and ſingular Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and neuer was a ſoule in the body of man, but was made of God by his ſpeciall power: our bodies may haue earthly fathers, but our ſpirits haue no Father but God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. It is God onely that creates and frames the ſpirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, <hi>Zacharie</hi> 12. 1. and ſo man is the generation of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſoule is indued with the light of reaſon, and can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne things by reaſoning and inward diſcourſe, ſeeing things by a light that is Immateriall, and with great variety contemplating of things that the ſenſes cannot reach to, and finding out ſtrange things, euen in thoſe things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the ſenſes which no other creature can doe: and this diſcerning would be in the minde, if there were no Sun in the firmament: and aboue all things that the ſoule can know, it is moſt excellent, in that it can know God himſelfe: Man onely of all viſible creatures can ſee God, and his workes, and acknowledge his workemanſhip which none of the other creatures can doe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſoule of man was made in the Image of God: in other things the footſteps of God doe appeare, but in man onely (in this viſible world) did the ſimilitude of God appeare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. Man was not made like the Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or like ſome Angell in Heauen, but like God himſelfe, and ſo eſpecially in his ſoule: for the ſoule of man is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as God is himſelfe, and it is inuiſible, and immateriall like God: and as in the ſubſtance of the ſoule, we reſemble God, ſo in certaine qualities or vertues printed in the ſoule which reſemble the Attributes of God, ſuch as are good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

                     <p n="4">4. The ſoule is immortall: it is a thing within vs, that will neuer be at an end, when worlds of other things bee diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued round about it: and this is an vnſpeakeable indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we could ſeriouſly thinke of it, that God ſhould let vs laſt as long as himſelfe, and all other liuing things die and expire, and come to nothing. A mans ſoule will bee aliue after a thouſand times tenne thouſand yeeres: All the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells in Hell, or Tyrants on earth, cannot kill our ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſoule of a man workes within ſtrange things euen in his very body. It carries the body about, being a thing without body, it ſelfe and giues diuers gifts to diuers parts of the body; It workes ſight in the eyes, hearing in the eares, feeling in all the body, taſting in the Pallate, ſmelling in the Noſtrills, breathing in the Lungs, concoction in the Stomach, operation in the hands, ambulation in the feete, and motion in the whole bodie: yea, it ſo workes by the ſenſes of the body, that it takes in by them all other things to it ſelfe in the ſpecies of them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As it is wonderfull for the things it worketh vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo it is admirable for the worke it can doe, when the body lyeth a ſleepe and ſtirres not. The ſoule then reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles God in the <hi>Creation.</hi> It creates worlds of ſhapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe with ſtrange furniture and variety, which inward <hi>Creation</hi> of infinite frames of things would be like this world which God made, but that the ſoule cannot giue them continuance, life, &amp;c. It was a great gift of God to giue the ſoule power to make theſe things within.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The ſoule doth excell in quickneſſe of motion &amp; working: other creatures are ſwift, ſome in running, ſome in flying, but what can be among them comparable to the ſoule, which can in thought in an inſtant ſuruey the ends of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and many other things, the ſoule of man doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully excell, being ſet in the body of a man, as it were the God of the body, as a little God in the little world: as IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH is the great God in the great world</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Man had the honour to be brought into the world, when all other things were made, and the world furniſhed ready for his vſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God did man a great honour, in the manner of making him: for hee made man with conſultation, but all other things were made by ſaying the word onely, let them be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſoule and body of a man is knit together with ſuch a bond, as is beyond the reach of mortall creatures to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the manner of the Vnion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe God conuerſeth with man onely of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world: our parents did ſee God in Paradiſe, and he reuealeth himſelfe ſtill to the bleſſed ones in heauen: Since the fall, this is for the moſt part loſt, ſaue that with the godly, the Lord conuerſeth by many ſignes of familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the vſe of his ordinances.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe God made ſuch prouiſion for man as hee did for no other creature: as in the firſt Creation, hee ſet man in <hi>Eden,</hi> the garden of vnutterable pleaſure: and when man dies now, if he be redeemed by Chriſt, hee hath prouided that heauen of heauens for him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe God hath made man Lord ouer the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and beſtowed vpon him dominion ouer the beaſtes of the field, and foules of the Ayre, and fiſhes of the ſea, yet the vaſteſt creature aboue, or below, doth miniſter vnto man: and God hath planted a naturall feare of man in other creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">7. Becauſe the body and ſoule of a man is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt to dwell in: ſo it was with the firſt man, and ſo it is ſtill in ſome men euen in this world, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. God dwells in man and walkes in him.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Yea, God hath done that honour to the nature of man, that he hath not done to the nature of Angels, and that is, that he hath ioyned it inſeparably to his diuine nature, in the perſon of his Son Chriſt Ieſus: ſo as man is now as neere to God,

as the body is to the ſoule, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of this Glory of God in the Creation of man, may ſerue for Inſtruction, Humiliation, and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>By way of Inſtruction, it ſhould teach vs many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: as,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We ſhould giue glory to God and acknowledge that it is he onely that made vs, and not we our ſelues: our parents are but inſtruments of the propagation of our bodies, it is God that is the principall efficient, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 3. eſpecially we ſhould with all gladneſſe acknowledge Gods goodneſſe to vs, that made vs ſuch creatures, ſo excellent aboue other workes of his hands, he might haue made vs vile Vermine, or poyſonfull creatures, Toads and Serpents, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 149. 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſhould learne hence ſubmiſſion to God in all things concerning our life or death: hee hath made vs, and therefore hath abſolute power ouer vs as the worke of his hands, to doe with vs whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, and to call for the ſpirit backe againe, and leaue vs to returne to our duſt at his pleaſure, <hi>Ier.</hi> 45. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing all men are the worke of Gods hands, and that our God made them, it ſhould teach Superiours to ſhew due reſpect to their Inferiours, in gifts, eſtate, age or the like: for he that made the rich, made the poore alſo: hee that made the Maſter, made the Seruant alſo: and therefore Inferiours are not to be deſpiſed, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 13. 15. <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. 31. All mankind made of one bloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 26.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ſhould take heede of reaſoning againſt the Iuſtice of God, in diſpoſing of men to conditions of leſſe honour in this life, or in damning of wicked men in hell, for they are all the worke of his hands, and as the clay to the Potter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21, 22, 23.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Originall from the duſt of the Earth, ſhould teach vs to carrie our ſelues humbly towards God and men: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, when we ſpeake to him, we ſhould remember we are but duſt and aſhes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and when we conuerſe and diſcourſe with men, wee ſhould take heede of pride,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14246:105"/>
and vaine glory, and ſay as he did in <hi>Iob,</hi> I alſo am cut out of the clay, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 6. as alſo wee ſhould take heed of exceſſiue cares for the clothing and pampering of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of clay.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Eſpecially we ſhould ſtriue to anſwer the end of our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Man was made and ſet in this viſible world, that God might haue a creature to know him, and what hee had wrought, and to acknowledge him, and ſerue him, and to reſemble him in all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: till this be done by man, he doth nothing that anſwers the end of his being, he diſhonors God that made him: And ſeeing God made both ſoule and body, wee ſhould ſerue the Lord in both: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 10. We are not at our owne diſpoſing, to doe what we liſt, we are his to command that made vs: our very countenances ſet ſo as to looke vpwards, ſhewes that we ſhould not be like the beaſts that ſee and regard nothing but earthly things: let vs pray God that made vs, to direct vs, and enlighten vs, to do his work, and glorifie him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, from the ſerious meditation of the doctrine of our Creation, we may finde many things for Humiliation vnto all men, eſpecially to the wicked. It may humble all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they are but men of duſt, earthly creatures, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47 48. made of myre and clay, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 12. and that they are in continuall danger of dying: They dwell but in houſes of clay, earthly Tabernacles, <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 19. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 'tis as eaſie for God to deſtroy vs as it is for the Potter to breake an earthen veſſell: our breath is in our noſtrills, if our mouthes and noſes be ſtopped, we fall downe as dead carkaſes: eſpecially all men haue cauſe to bee extreamely grieued to thinke how wofully they are fallen from the glory in which they were created, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they look vpon their ſoules impurities and filthines, or the bodies deformity &amp; diſeaſes, or the miſeries inuade iuſtly their outward condition, with all the fearefull loſſes ſpirituall and temporall which haue befallen them for their ſinnes: More eſpecially the wicked haue cauſe of grieuous ſorrowes that remaine ſtill in that wofull eſtate of degeneration, hauing God and all creatures againſt them, and carrying about bodies and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14246:106"/>
ſoules ſo full of ſinne, and lyable to ſuch fearefull danger: Woe to him that ſtriueth with his maker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall the Potſheard ſtriue with the Potter, and be ſafe? <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 9. and the rather they ſhould be afflicted, if they conſider, no part of their wickednes can be hid from God: Hee that made them, knowes euery part about them, there cannot bee a vaine deſire, thought, or luſt but God ſees it, and no darkeneſſe can hide from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there is great conſolation in this doctrine of the Creation vnto godly men, that are reſtored in Chriſt, to the priuiledges of their firſt Creation, for vnto them will God bee for the ſubſtance of true happineſſe all that he was to <hi>Adam:</hi> their right to Gods fauour, and fellowſhip with God, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the creatures is reſtored, they are againe made like to God in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 10. their bodies and ſoules are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt. They need not feare any aduerſaries, for God keepeth all their bones, and the haires of their heads are numbred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 20. and though they haue many frailties bodily and ſpirituall, yet God will pittie them, he knowes the mould they are made of, and that they are but duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. 17. <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 12. and ſeeing God hath made vs, he accounts himſelfe bound to helpe vs, and ſuſtaine vs, and prouide for vs, <hi>Iſay</hi> 43. 7. and will not forget vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 21.</p>

And ſo in the Redeemer, Faith lookes vpon foure things: Firſt, his Titles, Ieſus Chriſt, the onely Sonne of God and our Lord. Secondly, his Incarnation, wondering at both his Conception and Birth. Thirdly, his Humiliation for our ſinnes, as hee ſuffered vnder Pilate, was crucified, &amp;c. Fourthly, his Exaltation, as hee roſe from the dead, and aſcended in Heauen, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to breake open theſe glorious Myſteries, It is conuenient to conſider of three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What neede we haue of a Redeemer, to be thus incarnate or thus humbled, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By what right we can be capable of any intereſt in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:14246:107"/>
For the firſt, there are two things in the condition of euery man by nature, which may ſhew euidently that hee doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely neede ſome courſe to bee taken to free him out of that miſery he is in: the one is his ſinnes, the other is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either is vpon him, or he is liable to.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for ſinne, euery man:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is poſſeſſed by originall ſinne, by which hee is two waies vilely plagued; for he hath loſt all that righteouſneſſe and integrity of nature man had in the Creation: which he may feele, by his want of ſeruent loue to God, awfull feare of God, confident truſt in God, affectionate delight in God, ſhining knowledge of God, &amp;c. and ſo by his ſtrange defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in his diſpoſition toward his neighbour: and beſides, he is poyſoned and infected with corruption in his nature, which is the more grieuous becauſe all men are infected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. all are ſo from the wombe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and this inſection is in the whole nature of man, which he may feele, by the very diſorder of his naturall appetite to foode, ſleepe, procreation, &amp; by the corruption of his very ſenſes, his eyes ready to wander after vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. if they bee not guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and watched, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 1. and ſo his taſte and other ſenſes: &amp; in his vnderſtanding he may feele a ſtrange kinde of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darknes, and diſability to thinke of any good things, &amp; proneneſſe to a world of vanities and euil, &amp; in his affections he may daily perceiue a very vaſſalage to euil concupiſcence, giuing lawes of wickedneſſe to his members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is horriblie infected with actuall ſinnes. In his minde hee may obſerue a world of wickedneſſe, ſwarmes of vile thoughts, the frame of his Imaginations being onely euill continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. His heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue <note place="margin">
                        <hi>None good, no not one.</hi> Pſal. 14. 2.</note> all things, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. Oh what ſtrong luſts and paſſions are found in a mans heart from time to time? how doth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell draw men along ſecretly, as the fiſh is drawne with the baite, and that with ſtrange preuailings: what worlds of wickedneſſe haue paſſed through the tongues of men? <hi>Iames</hi> 3. and in their workes, how fearefully doth man ſinne in all he doth: his workes are all abhominable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14246:107"/>
for beſides that, he corrupts himſelfe in his beſt actions, he is guilty of diuers diſtinct ſinnes, and ſometimes theſe very groſſe and abominable: who can ſtand neere it to thinke of it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 How many ſinnes of other men he is guilty of, which he occaſioned by his euill example, euill counſell, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How innumerable his owne ſinnes are, of omiſſion and commiſſion, of ignorance, of knowledge, in his infancy, or riper age, at home or abroad, in his proſperity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, againſt God, other men, or himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 2.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a mans eſtate by nature hath wonderfull neede of mending and alteration, if we conſider the miſery to which it is expoſed in reſpect of puniſhment, for wee haue all loſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe. 2. And all the creatures about vs are worſe then they were at firſt for our ſakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. 3. God is horribly wroth with all of vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 36. 4.

The Deuill doth in a manner what he will with vs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. 6. Our ſelues are ſenſeleſſe and dead, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. The life of God is a moſt ſtrange thing to vs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. 7. Armies and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſorrowes aſſault vs in our bodies and eſtates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 8. Good things are reſtrained from vs, euen bleſſings of all ſorts, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5. 25. 9. And the good things we haue, they doe not proſper with vs, or they doe vs hurt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 13. 10. Horrible feares either of death or ſhame, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, or God, doe many times cruelly torment vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. 14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 65. 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. Beſides, all that which wee are in danger of: for ſtrange puniſhments may be to the workers of iniquity in this life, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 3. and we may dye miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and who can recount the terror of the laſt Iudgement, and the violent fire may deuoure vs in Hell for euer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. Thus of our need of a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond point, man becomes capable of happineſſe by the Redeemer, by vertue of a new Couenant which God tenders vnto man by the Redeemer. The firſt Couenant was a Couenant of workes, where perfect happineſſe was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14246:108"/>
to man, vpon condition of perfect obedience to the Law, to be performed by man in his owne perſon: This condition (man being fallen through his owne default) was impoſſible to be performed, and ſo the couenant being broken, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was vndone for euer. Now God is pleaſed to alter the firſt agreement, and to offer new Articles in this Couenant of grace, by which man might recouer out of the aforeſaid miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and be ſaued. Now concerning this new agreement we are to conſider.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Who procured it.</item>
                     <item>2 Vpon what termes he obtained it.</item>
                     <item>3 What he hath done to eſtabliſh it.</item>
                     <item>4 What good comes to vs by it.</item>
                     <item>5 What cauſe we haue to bee wonderfully affected and comforted by it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, this agreement and new Couenant was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from God only by the Mediatour, who alone was <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. The Sonne of God, became a ſutor for the ſonnes of men, and obtained of God theſe new Articles, with Gods infinite good liking, through his abundant mercy to man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, God yeelds to his motion for a new Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vpon two conditions. The one, that he ſhould pay all mens debts, and ſo make ſatisfaction to the Iuſtice of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. The other was, that hee ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch an abſolute obedience and righteouſneſſe as might ſerue to iuſtifie the vngodly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6.</p>
                  <p>For the third, what Chriſt hath done to eſtabliſh all this, is reported in theſe Articles of the <hi>Creed,</hi> conteined in the middle part of it, deſcribing both his Incarnation, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Glorification.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth, the good that wee ſhall haue by this new Couenant, is reported in the laſt Articles of the Creed, Holineſſe, Communion of Saints, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>Now we ought greatly to reioyce in this new Couenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe it was vtterly impoſſible for vs to bee any way
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14246:108"/>
happy, or eſcape eternall damnation, if we had continued ſtill vnder the old Couenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe this is a grace vouchſafed to the nature of man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for the Angels are loſt, and for euer forſaken, and haue no grace offered to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe it is a grace vouchſafed only to certaine men, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God out of the whole heape, and giuen to Chriſt, to be deliuered and ſaued by him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Becauſe if a man beleeue aright in <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> he ſhall be accounted as righteous, as if he had perfectly fulfilled the whole Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Becauſe this Couenant is euerlaſting and vnchangeable, there is no forfeiture, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 10. God hath ſworne to keepe this Couenant for euer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Becauſe God hath bound himſelfe to put his Spirit into vs, to make vs keepe the Couenant on our parts, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we ſee how it comes to paſſe that theſe Articles are put into our <hi>Creed,</hi> which had not beene if wee could haue beene ſaued by the firſt Couenant,</p>
                  <p>Now it remaines, that in the third place we conſider of the manner how we muſt beleeue theſe Articles concerning Ieſus Chriſt: where by the way we may obſerue one point that is not vnprofitable; <hi>viz.</hi> that to belieue aright in Chriſt is not a worke of nature, nor a thing that the naturall man in himſelfe is diſpoſed to: and that may appeare diuers wayes; for firſt, thoſe things about <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> are Articles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, which they had not beene, if they had beene ſuch things as the naturall man did know, or was diſpoſed to ſeeke after. 2. The light of Nature hath no principles at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, or that way of redemption by him. 3. Our Sauiour hath made it manifeſt, that the world is ſo farre from beleeuing, that it doth naturally hate ſuch as doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue aright. 4. Becauſe there are many things in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Redemption which are ſcandals to hearts of the wicked: Chriſt is a very Rocke of offence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. We finde by experience, that the naturall heart of man is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dull, and careleſſe of theſe Doctrines aboue all others.

6. This is the condemnation of the world, that they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. Laſtly, it is euidently affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that faith in Chriſt is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>Now this point is fit to be obſerued, partly to diſcouer the eſtates of multitudes of men, that ſpeake faire words of Ieſus Chriſt, when yet by nature it is certaine they loue not the Lord Ieſus, nor take any ſound courſe to belieue in him; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to awaken ſuch as are deſirous to get into the Kingdome of God, that they may not truſt to their naturall hearts or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but rather in a godly iealouſie of the deceitfulneſſe of their owne hearts, to vſe all diligence, by reſiſting the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, and cauils, and deuices of their owne hearts, by the power of God in his ordinances, to ſtriue to make their faith ſure, and fully eſtabliſhed: and thus much for this point.</p>
                  <p>The way how theſe Articles are to be receiued, is by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Ieſus Chriſt: for from the firſt part of the Creed we muſt borrow theſe words, <hi>I beleeue,</hi> and apply them to theſe Articles, thus; I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. That from the coherence and maine drift of all theſe Articles, we muſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall take notice of this point: That as wee beleeue in God, ſo we muſt belieue in Ieſus Chriſt: marke it, we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue him, or beleeue theſe Articles, but wee muſt beleeue in him; This is the Commandement of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that we ſhould doe ſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. and thus our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe requires it, that as wee beleeue in God, ſo wee ſhould beleeue in him alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 1. Yea, this is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all that worke that God requires of a Chriſtian in the new Teſtament, this is to worke the worke of God, euen to belieue in him whom he hath ſent. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 29. for firſt, the Father and the Sonne are one, and therefore we muſt honour the Sonne with the ſame honour we giue the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 30 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the foundation of all our happineſſe ſince the fall lyeth vpon this, he is our ſurety, there being none that would vndertake for vs but he, and it is he onely that makes both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and interceſſion for vs, and takes the charge of vs, and therefore we muſt rely vpon him.</p>
                  <p>Now for the explication of this point, that we may know
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14246:109"/>
what this beleeuing in Chriſt hath in it, I muſt conſider of it two wayes: Firſt, by ſhewing what beleeuing in Chriſt hath not, or what that Faith doth reiect, as vtterly oppoſite or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it: Secondly, what it hath in it diſtinctly both for the matter of beleeuing, and the manner of beleeuing.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the right beleeuing in <hi>Ieſus,</hi> doth caſt out;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 All reſpects of falſe Chriſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 All ſpirits of error and doctrine contrary to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1, 2. For his ſheepe doe heare his voice, with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it from all others, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The marke, or ſigne of reſpect of affection to, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon Antichriſt that beaſt, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 15. 2. and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the ſeruants of the man of ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 All truſt vpon our owne merits, and Iuſtification by the workers of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 All former euill courſes of life: for the Redeemer comes to none but ſuch as turne from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Iacob, Eſay</hi> 59. 20. and therefore repenting is annexed to beleeuing in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The loue of, and truſt in earthly things: for this faith makes vs account all the glory of the world but as droſſe and dunge in compariſon of Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, till we can forſake the world, wee neuer ſoundly ſeeke Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, beleeuing in Ieſus hath in it foure things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Perſwaſion or aſſent to theſe glorious truths that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Ieſus, and mans ſaluation in him, as in particular:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That hee came forth from GOD, with commiſſion to deale in this worke of the redemption of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That he came in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That he is the very ſonne of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 35, 36, 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That he hath power enough to helpe vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 That there is no other name by which wee can bee ſaued, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That all the promiſes of God ſhall be fulfilled in him, this is beleeuing the Goſpell, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. Thus of perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:14246:110"/>
2 It hath in it eſtimation of Chriſt, as that that onely can be precious for vs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It hath in it a relying vpon Chriſt for our Iuſtification, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and for our ſaluation, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. and for our preſeruation in the meane time, liuing by the faith of the Sonne of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. and ſo there is a ſpirituall kind of confidence in the ordinances of Chriſt as they are his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and as hee worketh in them by his power, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4 Yet further, to beleeue in Chriſt is to haue Chriſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him into our ſoules: thus the phraſe of receiuing him, of his liuing in vs, of our hauing of the Sonne is vſed in diuers Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 12. and thus for the matter of beleeuing.</p>
                  <p>Now for the fuller vnderſtanding of this Doctrine of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Chriſt, it is neceſſary to conſider of the manner how we muſt beleeue: for</p>

                  <p n="2">2 That outward confeſſion is not enough: we muſt beleeue from our hearts and with our hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We muſt beleeue in our owne particular: I beleeue, and what we beleeue we muſt apply it to our ſelues, that Chriſt was incarnate, ſuffered and glorified for me in particular.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We muſt beleeue in him and loue him, though wee neuer yet ſaw him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We muſt reſolue to ſticke to our beleeuing, though wee ſuffer for it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 We muſt perſeuere in the Faith, there muſt bee no time, wherein the Chriſtian may not ſay, I doe beleeue in Ieſus.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 This Faith muſt be layed vp in a pure conſcience: we muſt euer after we beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus, make conſcience of all purity, and ſincerity of heart and life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>Since all our happineſſe lieth in this skill of beleeuing in Ieſus, wee muſt vſe all meanes that wee may attaine to this <note place="margin">Vſe.</note>

faith, that when the Sonne of man comes he may not finde vs without faith: Now that we may attaine to this faith, that is able to ſaue vs, and by which only we can haue the benefit of this new Couenant, wee muſt conſcionably practiſe diuers rules, which I will briefly put you in minde of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We muſt confeſſe our vnbeliefe, and pray God to giue vs this Faith: for Faith is the gift of God: It is one ſtep to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, to ſee that we doe not beleeue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Seeing Faith comes by hearing the Word preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. We muſt attend vpon that ordinance of God, and waite for the comming downe of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We muſt ſtriue in hearing with all our might to apply the things we heare, as they may any way fit our caſe, for in application is the very doore of Faith, and that work eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by which we receiue Chriſt and the promiſes of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Wee muſt continually ſtudy the motiues to beleeuing: for there are diuers things which being ſeriouſly thought on, may raiſe vp a wonderfull deſire of Faith, and reſolution to ſeeke it and ſtriue for it, with which deſire, if it be ſincere and conſtant, Faith vſually comes into the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Now there are many things ſhould fire vs to this deſire of faith in Ieſus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That it is the worke of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi>

                     </gap>. 29 It is that aboue all things is required of a Chriſtian: that one thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: the ſumme and ſubſtance of our worke as wee are Chriſtians: yea, that very thing that makes vs Chriſtians, for till we beleeue in Ieſus, we may be Chriſtians in ſhew, and in other mens accounts, but we are not ſo indeed till we be in Chriſt, which we cannot be but by beleeuing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That it is a thing that God aboue all things deſires of vs, which may appeare many waies: 1. Becauſe he commands vs to beleeue 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. 2. Becauſe he ſends his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to vs to inuite vs; yea, &amp; beſeech vs in his name to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, &amp; to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. Becauſe he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe by Couenant to receiue vs if we beleeue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. yea, &amp; confirmes his Couenant not only by ſeales, but by oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. Becauſe in the office of the Couenant God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts againſt no man, but he ought to thinke that all this

grace is offered to him, if he will receiue it: and therfore he ſaith, whoſoeuer beleeueth: and in another place chargeth his Embaſſadors to declare ſo much to euery creature, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is horrible dangerous for a man to liue without this Faith in Ieſus: for without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 6. and beſides ſuch as haue the meanes, and are thus often called vpon, may at length prouoke God ſo far, as that he will deliuer them vp to a Spirit of ſlumber, ſo as they cannot be able to beleeue, but be left to that curſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 39. 40. to haue their eyes blinded, and their hearts hardened, that they ſhould not ſee nor vnderſtand any more: but aboue all things it ſhould fright men, that God hath reſolued they ſhall be damned that beleeue not in Ieſus, yea, though they be worlds of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. If we conſider the wonderfull benefits we haue by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Ieſus Chriſt: for he that beleeueth on him need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be aſhamed of his condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We get preſently out of darkeneſſe, aſſoone as wee ſo beleeue, Chriſt comes as a light into our hearts, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 44. 46.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though we may haue many troubles in the world, yet in him we ſhall haue peace, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Woe ſhall be to them that wrong vs and offend vs: It were better a Mill-ſtone were hanged about their necks and they caſt into the ſea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All our ſinnes are forgiuen vs aſſoone as we beleeue in his name, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We thereby become all one with God the Father, and Ieſus Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt, we are made one with the Trinity after a heauenly manner, this is a dreadfull Myſterie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 20. 21. for as Chriſt is one with the Father, ſo are we one with Chriſt, and ſo in him with the father, as is explained in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We may get as much of all ſorts of bleſſings, as our Faith can aske in his Name: for the Father will denie vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 23. 24. 26. 27. It is the ſhame of beleeuers, that they haue not tryed his promiſe, they haue asked in a

manner nothing of God all this while.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Chriſt will be made maruellous in al them that beleeue at the day of Iudgement: then ſhall our Faith be found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to praiſe, and honour, and glory in that day of the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wee ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life: Wee ſhall be as ſure of it, as if wee had it already, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. 36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 40. 47. Chriſt auoucheth it with an Aſſeueration, wee ſhall not miſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much may ſuffice for this point of beleeuing in Chriſt: if any be deſirous to know whether they doe beleeue or not, let them ſeriouſly examine themſelues by the doctrine of the nature of Faith in Ieſus before handled. Onely I thought good to tell certaine of you that frequent this aſſemblie, that you are not beleeuers in Ieſus, all your ſhewes notwithſtanding: In ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, I meane it of thoſe of you that wilfully perſiſt in your offenſiue, and ſtrange apparell, and faſhioning your ſelues after this world: I proue by two Arguments among many, you are not true beleeuers: firſt, becauſe you receiue honour one from another, and ſeeke not the honour that comes from God. Your continuall care is to feede your humour of greatneſſe, and to be accepted of the great ones, and braue ones, and vaine ones of the Cittie or Countrey: Our Sauiour himſelfe askes you, how you can beleeue, yea, he determines it of ſuch, as ſo affect the honour of men that they cannot beleeue in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 44. ſecondly, you will be reiected at the day of Iudgement as no beleeuers, becauſe our teſtimonie was not receiued, ye are wiſer then any ſeuen of vs, that giue you reaſons againſt your vaine attire: you receiue the Teſtimonie of vaine men againſt our doctrine, though you haue bin often and generally repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our doctrine, though you haue bin often and generally reproued in our publique Miniſteries in the preſence of God, yet by following your fooliſh vanities, you ſtill forſake your owne mercie, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the particular opening of theſe Articles: where firſt, we are to conſider of the Titles giuen to our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which are foure, <hi>Ieſus, Chriſt,</hi> the Sonne of God, and our Lord. The firſt Title is his proper name, the ſecond and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14246:112"/>
laſt expreſſe his Office, and the third expreſſeth his Nature. The Titles are both ſimple and Relatiue: ſimple Titles are <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſhew what he is in himſelfe: the other two are Relatiue, for in Relation to God, hee is his onely begotten Sonne, and in Relation to vs, he is our Lord: but this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt not bee too much preſſed, for it is not very exact, though vſed by ſome Diuines. That <hi>Ieſus</hi> is his proper name is manifeſt, but whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> be his Syrname, as ſome think may iuſtly bee doubted, becauſe it ſeemes rather a Title of Office, as King, Duke, or Earle are amongſt men, which are no Syrnames.</p>

                  <p>COncerning this Title of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> diuers things are to bee conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Etymologie</hi> of it, It comes of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> roote, and ſignifies a Sauiour, and is the ſame name with <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhuah:</hi> and it may well be, that he had an Hebrew name to ſignifie that he was a Sauiour of the Iewes, and hee had a <hi>Greeke</hi> name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſignifie the intereſt the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Gentiles had in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who gaue him this Name: Hee did not aſſume it to himſelfe though knowing the end of his comming, and the fulneſſe of his ſufficiencie he might haue done it, neither was it put vpon him by men, who giue names either caſually without reſpect of ſignification; or elſe when they giue good ſignificant names, there is a contradiction betweene their names and their liues: but an Angell was ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with great ſolemnity to appoint and impoſe his Name before he was borne, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 26. and hee talketh with the Virgin about it: as an euill Angell talked with the woman about our perdition, ſo heere a good Angell talkes with the Virgin about our Saluation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why was he called <hi>Ieſus? Anſwer,</hi> this Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> or a

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe his worke is to ſaue his people, <hi>Matthew</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe there is no other Sauiour but he: hee alone ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them: there is no other Name in Heauen and Earth by which we can be ſaued, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

And to ſaue from ſinne is the greater worke, becauſe it cannot bee done, vnleſſe Gods Iuſtice be ſatisfied, and mans nature recouered, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels conquered, and the world ouercome, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe he can ranſome and redeeme dead men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe he ſaues by ſuch a price; he redeemes, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſhedding his owne bloud, who alſo is more then man: to ſaue vs he deſtroyes himſelfe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9, 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 12.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>Thus of the firſt Title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt.]</hi> His ſecond Title is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Where I conſider, firſt, of the terme, and then of the things ſignified by the terme.</p>
                  <p>About the terme diuers things are to be conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſignification: <hi>Christ</hi> is a Greeke word, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Anointed, and is the ſame in ſenſe with the Hebrew word <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which alſo ſignifies Anointed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why in the New Teſtament, and ſo in our <hi>Creed,</hi> hee is called rather Chriſt by a Greeke terme, then <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was the antient, and Hebrew terme? And that may bee to ſignifie the intereſt of the Gentiles: for as Ieſus an Hebrew name ſhewes the Right of the Iewes: ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Greeke name ſhewes the Right of the Gentiles, both meeting in one Mediator betweene God and all ſorts of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The neceſſity of taking in this Title into our <hi>Creed:</hi> for the Iewes willingly acknowledged this Title of Ieſus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 24. but excommunicated out of their Synagogues any that would openly acknowledge this Title of <hi>Christ, Iohn</hi> 9. and therefore it ſtands vs vpon to hold faſt this Title.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt bee noted, that in the fift Application of this terme, it muſt not onely be annexed to Ieſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 26. 27. but it muſt be vnderſtood, as if it were read the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the terme of Chriſt as Anointed may be giuen to other men, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was <hi>Chriſt</hi> or Anointed, ſo are Kings Gods Anointed, but none was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but Ieſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:14246:114"/>
Thus of the terme <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The thing ſignified is his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, and about the Anointing of <hi>Ieſus</hi> diuers things are to be conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who Anointed him: <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Spirit of the Lord, or the whole Trinity, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What his Anointing comprehends, <hi>(viz)</hi> the ſubſtance of all that which was ſignified by the Oyle in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, eſpecially the Oyle with which the high Prieſt was Anointed: for thereby was ſhadowed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That hee was certainely the perſon was choſen to the Office of a Mediator, for as the powring out of the Oyle did ſhew which was the Man, that was the Prieſt or King: ſo the Anointing of Ieſus did ſhew, that hee was the perſon choſen for this great worke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he had his ordination to his Office from God: for the Oyle in the Law, was preſcribed by God onely, no creature did preſcribe it, or might make the like, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 33. 37.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he was qualified with abundance of grace and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his Office: as that Oyle was compounded of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſpices, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 34. ſo was Chriſt indued with all ſorts of gifts needfull for a Mediator: He was full of grace and truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. and hee had of the Oyle aboue his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, neuer any Anointed with ſuch a meaſure of graces; God gaue not him the Spirit by meaſure, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he did execute the Office of Mediator with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gladneſſe and willingneſſe. Neuer man did worke ſo willingly. It was the Oyle of gladneſſe hee was Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the gifts beſtowed vpon him, were ſuch as were agreeable to his humane nature, for the Oyle conſiſted of earthly ſubſtance, his humane nature was not endowed with the eſſentiall properties of the God-head, but with created qualities.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Ieſus ſhould be acceptable to God and man: he was a ſweet ſmelling ſauour vnto God: and no perfume can ſmell ſo ſweet in the noſtrills of men, as doth <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14246:115"/>
hearts of all beleeuers: nothing ſauours ſo ſweetely.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That our perſons and workes are made acceptable to God by him, As the Oyle did not onely wet <hi>Aarons</hi> head but ranne downe vpon his garments: ſo Chriſt is qualified with thoſe rich graces, not onely to make himſelfe accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, but all his members ſmell of his Oyle in the ſight of God: Wee are (ſaith the Apoſtle) a ſweet ſauour vnto God in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. wee haue receiued of his Anointing, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, to which nature this Anointing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs? For anſwer it belongs to the whole Perſon, and ſo to both Natures. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Mediator, and ſo Anointed in reſpect of his Perſon: for, Anointing comprehending eſpecially ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Office and qualification for it, though in reſpect of the latter, the humane Nature was richly adorned as a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Palace for the diuine nature to dwell in, and the diuine Nature could not need any pouring out of gifts, yet in reſpect of ordination to the worke of Mediator, the diuine Nature is aſſigned of God and choſen thereunto aſwell as the humane.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing is, to what he was Anointed, or to what Office? I anſwer, hee was Anointed to bee all that which the Ceremoniall Anointing did ſignifie. Now three ſorts of men were Anointed, <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> ordinarily, and the Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> extraordinarily; which ſhadowed out, that the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> ſhould be both the Prophet, the Prieſt, and the King of the Church, and to all theſe three was he called: and accordingly qualified with three eſpeciall gifts, Wiſedome, Holineſſe, and Power: Wiſedome fits him for his propheticall Office, and holineſſe for his Prieſtly Office, and Power for his regall Office: and ſo he anſwers to three things in our miſery: The firſt is our ignorance, the ſecond is the corruptions &amp; diſorder of our liues, the third is the guiltineſſe, by which we are lyable to eternall puniſhment: our ignorance hee takes away as a Prophet, our guiltineſſe as a Prieſt, and our corruption and diſorder as a King bringing vs into order.</p>
                  <p>His worke then is threefold, to be a Prophet to the Church, a Prieſt and a King: his work as Prophet is to teach the Church all needfull knowledges: His worke as Prieſt, is to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14246:115"/>
for the ſinnes of the Elect: His worke as a King is to gather and rule the Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, he is Anointed a Prophet to the Church, and his worke is to teach, and about his prophecying or teaching wee haue many things to inquire of: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What he treats of in his teaching: and ſo his worke is to interpret the Law of God, as we may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and to publiſh the Goſpell, or the new Couenant, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. and to foretell things to come, as we may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How he executed his teaching: and that is diuers waies: as, 1. By viſions and dreames, and ſo hee reuealed much doctrine in the Old Teſtament: 2. By Oracle, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering at the mercy Seat, or by Vrim and Thummim. 3. By Types and ceremoniall ſhadowes. 4. By inſpiration qualifying certaine choice men to write the Scriptures. 5. In his owne perſon hee came and preached vnto men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. 6. By the miniſtery of his ſeruants, whom hee ſends to teach the people of God, whether extraordinarily, as Prophets and Apoſtles, or ordinarily, as Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers. Now our Sauiour is ſaid to propheſie in theſe mens miniſteries; Firſt, becauſe it is he that ordaines and ſends them, and calls them to the worke of teaching, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Secondly, becauſe they receiue from him commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what to teach, and muſt teach onely what hee com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mands them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>vlt. Tit.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Thirdly, becauſe hee qualifies them with gifts, and makes them able to teach: they haue nothing but what they receiued: and it is hee that ſpeaketh in their mouthes, they doe all they doe by the power of Chriſt dwelling in them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 11. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe whatſoeuer comfort they promiſe to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his Word, and whatſoeuer threatnings they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt the wicked, hee will accompliſh it, as if it had beene vttered by himſelfe: and therefore is their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery called Prophecying, becauſe deriued out of the Fountaine of Chriſts Propheſies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing is, how he is qualified for the execution of his office in teaching, either in his owne Perſon or by his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14246:116"/>
Meſſengers? And of that the Scripture teſtifieth that all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome and knowledge are in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. Yea, they are in him as the firſt fountaine: for the originall of all knowledge in the myſtery of God and godlineſſe is from him, who is the Word and wiſdome of the Father: No man knowes the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reueile him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 18. Hee onely hath the Originall words of eternall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing is the excellency of his manner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 He teacheth all the Elect of God: they are all taught of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 45. <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 13. Neuer any Teacher had ſo many Schollers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He is a Teacher come from God. Hee commeth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and therefore is aboue all, he ſpeaketh the very words of God: the wiſdome hee teacheth is from aboue, all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and ſpirituall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 31, 34.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He teacheth vs the good way, there is no error, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, no peruerſeneſſe, we may ſafely reſt vpon any thing he teacheth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 66.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 He teacheth by efficacy as well as by Doctrine: other men may deliuer good Doctrine, but they cannot make it effectuall: but he teacheth with power, hee can make the Doctrine worke vpon the deadeſt hearts of men: Hee can make the dead heare his voice, and liue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 25. He tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in wardly as well as outwardly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 He teacheth freely. He giueth all the Elect their teaching: I haue giuen them the words thou gaueſt mee, ſaith hee to his Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 He teacheth with wonderfull compaſſion: Hee knoweth how to haue compaſſion on the ignorant, and ſuch as are out of the way: Hee is in his teaching an euerlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Heb</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Eſay</hi> 19. 6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 11.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 He teacheth men from their youth till their old age, which no other teachers doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 17.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 He teacheth his Schollers all things: other Teachers teach them but in ſome one or few particular kindes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but he inſtructs them in all things needfull for their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14246:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
happineſſe: what he knowes himſelf that may be profitable for them, he teacheth it to them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 15.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 He teacheth with wonderfull euidence and ſhining glory: his teaching rauiſheth the hearts of men aboue all things: at his teaching, we all behold with open face, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Hee teacheth confidently; euery word is faithfull and true, no Doctrine is ſo ſure, and all hee ſaith is deliuered without any doubting, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe of the Doctrine of the Propheſie of Chriſt may be diuers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſeeing Chriſt is giuen as the Prophet and onely Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer of the Church, we may thence be informed of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, of the preſumption of the man of ſin, that brings in a world of traditions to bind mens conſciences in them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God: Wee know no Prophet that hath power to teach otherwiſe then is written. Let that Sonne of perdition ſhew vs his anointing, if he will haue vs beleeue him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1 To make the more account of prophecying, to eſteeme the Miniſters of the Goſpell the more, becauſe Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth by them, and executeth his prophecying by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries: yea, it ſhould make vs loue the houſe of God the more, and long to be going vp to it, and call one vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe the Lord Ieſus Chriſt doth teach vs there, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 3. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. 2.

We muſt reckon of our Teachers as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, but withall, take heede that wee remember to giue the chiefe glory to Chriſt, for they haue nothing but what they haue receiued from him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And chiefly, we muſt conſecrate our ſelues to the hearing of Chriſt, he that hath eares to heare let him heare, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, 19. God the Father hath from Heauen charged vs with this duty as the chiefe thing, that we ſhould heare him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5. but it is not enough barely to heare him, but we muſt labour to bee ſuch, as hee requires his Schollers ſhould bee: for there bee diuers things Chriſt ſtands vpon in his Schollers. He will not teach them, hee doth not account them any part of his charge, vnleſſe they bee ſuch as he deſcribes, and requires them to bee. Thus then is the queſtion, What doth Chriſt require in ſuch as he will vndertake to teach? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Diuers things: as</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They muſt not be conceited of their owne wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and reaſon, but muſt deny themſelues, and become fooles that they may be wiſe. He cannot abide ſuch as are wiſe in their owne conceit, and will teach their Teachers. His Schollers muſt be poore in ſpirit, ſuch as truſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their owne, but will thinke and belieue onely what Chriſt tells them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8.

They muſt be conſtant hearers, not ſuch as will play the Truants, or come to be taught but now and then, but they muſt bee ſuch as will be preſent as often as Chriſt ſhall reade: not like thoſe that heard him and maruelled, and went their way and left him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They muſt be ſuch as are broken in heart, and wounded in Spirit for their ſinnes: for he was ſent to preach the Goſpell to them that are broken in heart: ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their ſinnes, and know no ſorrowes greater then for their ſinnes, theſe are ſuch as Chriſt deſires to teach, and will powerfully inſtruct, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. CHRIST ſends the rich and ſuch as are hard hearted by whole skores empty away, he will not teach them, as we ſee by dayly experience from Sabbath to Sabbath; when multitudes come to Church he doth ſpeake to the hearts but of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, the reſt he turnes away to goe as they came.</p>

4 His Schollers muſt be meeke, that is, they muſt bring him a heart free from paſſions and worldly perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pride; for he ſaith, he will teach the meeke and humble his way: froward, peruerſe, proud perſons get little from Chriſts teaching, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 There muſt bee in his Schollers the contempt of the world ſoundly formed: for he will not ſow among the Thornes. If mens hearts runne after their couetouſneſſe, or pleaſures, or reputation with the world, they are not fit for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 His Schollers muſt receiue his Word with an honeſt and good heart, that is, with a heart that is free from baſe wickedneſſe, and filthy luſts, and groſſe ſinnes, and doth loue and admire goodneſſe and holineſſe for-it ſelfe: and it is a heart that had rather get ſound grace then great credit, ſtriues more to be good, then to ſeeme ſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 15. ſuch as will learne the truth as the truth is in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 He requires of his Schollers that they ſhould receiue his Word with full aſſurance, and put that difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his teaching and all others, as with all confidence to beleeue and reſt vpon what he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 They muſt hearken to doe it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 1.

                  <p n="10">10 He cannot abide ſuch Schollers as will not increaſe in learning, but after they haue come to ſchoole many yeers, yet need to be taught their A. B. C. in religion againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.</p>

Whether we reſpect his Generation as God, or his Incarnation as man, for he was conceiued of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo had no ſinne, and borne of a Virgin, not by the way of propagation as other Kings are borne.

                  <p n="6">6. In the extent of his kingdome, he is a King vniuerſall: He is King of all the Earth. The greateſt King that euer was, was reiected by many Nations, that neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his ſupremacie: there were many parts of this world, which <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> neuer ſaw, much leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: Yea, he is a King ouer ſuch creatures as neuer mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man ruled: for he is Head of principalities and powers: The Angels worſhip him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Coloſ</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. All other Kings hold of him, as being King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He excells all other Kings in his Conqueſts: Hee hath conquered ſuch enemies, as all the Kings of the Earth could not ſubdue, he conquered ſinne and death, and the diuells of Hell: he hath ſpoyled principalities and powers, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 15. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. and accordingly hath had ſuch a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, when he aſcended into Heauen, and led captiuity captiue, as neuer Conquerour had: for neuer Conquerour rid into ſo glorious a place as Heauen, nor ſhewed ſuch captiues as the diuells were, nor performed their victories by their owne power, whereas hee conquered alone, there was no Army, nay, no man to helpe him.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:14246:121"/>
8. He excells them in his hous keeping: He entertaines all Nations, <hi>Eſay</hi> 25. He keepes thouſands of Courts all open at once: And his prouiſions are far more precious then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions of the Kings of the Earth: He feeds his gueſts with the bread of Angels, euen with the bread of life, with ſuch food as whoſoeuer eates of it, ſhall neuer hunger more: and he hath better attendance, for he is waited on by thouſand thouſands of Angels, which are continually about his Throne.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Hee gouernes by better lawes then the kings of Earth doe: and his lawes are better in diuers reſpects: for firſt, they be all of his owne making: they make their lawes by the Aſſiſtance of their Counſell or their Parliaments, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 12. ſecondly, his Lawes are written by himſelfe in the hearts of his Subiects, wheras other Kings can write them no where, but in paper, or parchment, or ſtone at the beſt, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. thirdly, his Lawes are more perfect, there is no defect in them, they are able to make all his Subiects abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to euery good word and worke, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. fourthly, together with his Lawes he giues his ſpirit to make his ſubiects able and willing to keepe them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In the power of his Prerogatiue: for God hath giuen all things into his hands: hee may diſpoſe of the perſons, liues, goods, good names, and poſterities of his Subjects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne will, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 3. which other kings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrible tyrannie cannot doe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. In his diſtributing of Iuſtice: and ſo both towards his owne ſeruants, and towards the rebellious, and his enemies: Towards his owne ſeruants hee can pardon not onely the Puniſhment, but the offence too, and can giue ſuch rewards as earthly kings cannot giue. And towards his enemies or the rebellious, he can inflict puniſhment vpon their hearts and conſciences, which other kings cannot doe; and he can and will iudge all offenders, not ſuch as offend in capitall crimes onely, and iudgeth with more Righteouſneſſe then was euer found in any mortall Tribunall.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In the Nature of his kingdome: His Kingdome is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14246:121"/>
not of this world, but ſpirituall, as hauing authority ouer the ſpirits of men, which other Princes haue not, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning by ſpirituall meanes, and in ſpirituall, and eternall things, the wealth of his Subjects conſiſting in eternall and ſpirituall things.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. He is a King Immortall, he cannot die, hee liues euer to prouide for the wealth of his Subjects, and to reward his ſeruants, which is not true of the beſt kings on earth, who are all mortall, if they were neuer ſo great or glorious. Of his kingdome there is no end, it is euerlaſting, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 33. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe of this may be:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Conſolation, All the children of <hi>Sion</hi> may reioyce in their king, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 2. and that not onely if they conſider his glory in all the former praiſes, but if they conſider their owne happineſſe vnder him; for all the Subiects of this King may dwell ſafely, and inioy a quiet habitation: No Subiects haue ſo much reaſon to thinke themſelues ſafe as his Subiects, <hi>Iſay</hi> 33. 20. 21. 25. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 5. 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 25. and beſides, they trade for better wealth vnder his gouernement then all the Treaſures of the world are worth. And further, there was neuer any King did loue his Subiects ſo affectionately as <hi>Ieſus</hi> doth his people, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. and in his Kingdome poore men may get preferment aſwell as rich men, yea, the higheſt dignities may be obtained by them aſwell as by the greateſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3. Adde to theſe that all his Subiects are Sonnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25. 26. and he makes them all Kings too, they are Royall all the Nation of them, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. they are the Princes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, euen all the people of the God of <hi>Abraham, Pſal.</hi> 47. 9. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 8. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things ſhould much check and reproue that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment is too often found in ſome of Gods children, that fret at the wicked, or are impatient at their owne eſtates; what is there no King in <hi>Sion?</hi> or is it no priuiledge to them that the firſt Dominion is come vnto them, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Inſtruction, and that both to all Chriſtians in generall, and to the Kings and great men of the Earth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:</p>

                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:14246:122"/>
1. All ſorts of true Chriſtians ſhould learne from hence:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To pray that God would open their eyes to ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome, aſwell as we diſcerne the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and glory of earthly Kings: and the rather, becauſe Chriſt doth ſo farre exceed them in glory, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1. 17. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To aſcribe all praiſe and glory to his Kingdome, to talke of the praiſe, and receiue of his greatneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 6. 7. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To pray that his Kingdome may come more and more: eſpecially now that we ſee that the Nations are moued, and he ſeemes to be going about to inlarge his Dominions, and to pull downe the Kingdome of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To endeuour to carrie themſelues as may become their Relation to Chriſt, either as his Subiects, or as made Kings by him; as his Subiects they ſhould conſider that it behoues them:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſtudy the Myſteries of his Kingdome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſend their Lambe to the Ruler of the whole earth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 16. 1. to doe their Homage, and to acknowledge their King.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To bow at the Name of <hi>Ieſus, Phil.</hi> 2. 11. making of legges will not ſerue the turne, they muſt bee ſubiect with all feare, and reuerence, and ſubmit themſelues to his will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſhew themſelues ſenſible of his diſhonor, and not bee ſilent or careleſſe when they heare their King abuſed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To ſhew all meekeneſſe and patience: for their King though he be a great King, yet is meeke and humble, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 5.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To obſerue whatſoeuer he commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>vlt.</hi> prouing themſelues to be his ſubiects by fearing to diſpleaſe him in any thing, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To ſeeke to him in all our neceſſities, ſeeing hee is ſo highly exalted and able to helpe vs, and delights to receiue petitions from his Subiects. And in aſmuch as we partake
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14246:122"/>
of his holy Oyle alſo, and are by him made Kings vnto God, wee ſhould ſhew our ſelues to the world as ſpirituall Kings: and that, firſt, by ſubduing our owne paſſions, luſts, inordinate deſires, carnall reaſon, maintaining continuall warre againſt the remainders of corruption in our natures. He is a King indeed, that can rule ouer his owne perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſecondly, by ſhewing our ſelues reſolute, not to bee brought in bondage by the diuell or the world, by the Baits of profit or pleaſure, or by the inforcements of ſcorne, threatning, or puniſhment; we ſhould let the world know, they ſhould aſſoone conquer the kings of the earth, as win vs from our ſincerity and fidelity to Ieſus Chriſt: thirdly, by our conuerſation in heauen, wee ſhould alwaies order our liues, as if wee were preſently to bee Crowned in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſuch as are Kings, Rulers, or Gouernors ouer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould hence learne with feare and trembling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the glory of Chriſt, and acknowledge that they haue their Scepters, and Authority from Ieſus Chriſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly reckon their kingdomes on earth to be but as places of ſeruice, in which they doe the worke which Ieſus requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the Titles, <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> now followes the third Title, and ſo our Redeemer is called Gods onely Sonne. About which ground of Faith, wee haue theſe things to conſider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Proofes that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God: for to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14246:123"/>
beleeue God hath a Sonne is not inough, we muſt beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is that Sonne of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What kinde of Sonne Chriſt is to God; God hath many Sonnes, ſome by Grace, and one by Nature. The ſorts of ſonnes which God hath by Grace, ſee in the explication of the terme Father, in the firſt Article of the <hi>Creed.</hi> But Chriſt is his naturall Sonne, becauſe God the Father did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him his owne nature, ſo as he is by nature the Son of God: he is the begotten Sonne of God, becauſe he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Fathers Nature by Generation. He is the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of God, ſo called in Scripture, becauſe hee hath the right of the firſt-borne ouer his brethren, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten before the world was: he is the onely begotten Son of God, becauſe by Generation God hath no other Sonnes but he.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In what Nature Chriſt is the onely Sonne of God. It may be conceiued, that he is ſo in reſpect of his humane Nature, for no other Sonnes of God were conceiued of the holy Ghoſt, or borne of a Virgin, but hee onely: but wee muſt vnderſtand, that Chriſt in his Incarnation hath the ſame Nature with vs, it differs onely, in the manner of receiuing it: Now he is called the onely Son, from the nature which hee receiues from the Father, and he onely, and ſo he is the onely Sonne of God, as he is the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and in reſpect of the manner of receiuing his diuine Nature. This is mightily oppoſed by the antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne <hi>Arians,</hi> who ſtriue vehemently to carrie it, that hee is called in Scripture the Sonne of God onely as he is man, and that God hath no Son that was before <hi>Ieſus</hi> was borne, or conceiued. Now to eſtabliſh our Faith againſt their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, we ſhould often thinke of theſe Scriptures, where mention is made of a Sonne of God before <hi>Ieſus</hi> was borne, or was greater then man could be: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. God ſent his Sonne into the world: and God had a Sonne, by whom he made the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 16. God had a Sonne of whom it was ſaid that hee onely reuealed the Father,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14246:123"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. now either he was, before he was incarnate, or elſe the <hi>Church</hi> in the Old Teſtament, knew not God the Father: and vnto the Sonne he ſaith, Thy Throne O God is for euer and euer: then he had a Sonne was God as well as man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. beſides it is cleare, he had many brethren as man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. and therefore as man could not bee the onely Sonne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How he was begotten? To this queſtion a perfect anſwer cannot bee giuen by vs in this mortality, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 4. It is a Myſtery exceeds all mortall capacity. Yet the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let fall certaine ſimilitudes in Scriptures, that giue vs ſome glimpſe of it: as when Chriſt is called the Wiſedome or Word of his Father, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. thereby we gather, that as the ſoule begets reaſon, or the word that is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be vttered, beget I ſay, within it ſelfe without ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with any other creature; ſo doth God as an eternall minde beget his Sonne in himſelfe: ſo when Chriſt is called the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory, it imports, that as ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is begotten of the Sun, ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi> of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. So when Chriſt is called the Character or Image of his Fathers perſon, is imported, that as the print of the ſeale is ſet vpon waxe, and doth reſemble it perfectly, without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any part of the ſeale; ſo doth God communicate his whole Nature to his Sonne, without looſing any thing from himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And as the minde of man begets an Image of what it conceiues, ſo God that eternall minde, when hee conceiued of himſelf, he begat that Image of himſelf, which we call the Sonne of God, perfectly reſembling the Father. See in the Notes vpon that word (Father) in the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the <hi>Creed,</hi> ſeauen things, wherein this eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Gods Son is vnlike to our generation by earthly parents.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Why our Redeemer needed to be the Son of God aſwell as the Son of Man: It was requiſite he ſhould be the Son of God for diuers reaſons: firſt, becauſe there muſt be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene the ſinne of man, and the puniſhment due to his ſinne, and the ſatisfaction made to God for the ſinne and puniſhment due. Now mans ſinne being infinite, as in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14246:124"/>
other reſpects, ſo becauſe it was committed againſt God, who is infinite, his puniſhment muſt be infinite alſo: Now no finite creature, can performe an infinite ſatisfaction in a finite time, and therefore it was requiſite hee ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in perſon that ſuffered, which as man he was not: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the benefits neceſſarie for vs require that the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould be God: for to deliuer man from ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſinne and Sathan, and to reſtore to man the Image of God loſt, to performe by one, a Righteouſneſſe able to iuſtifie many, could not bee done by any one meere man. Nor can any one mans righteouſneſſe deſerue the opening of the Kingdome of Heauen for many men: thirdly, he that muſt mediate betweene God and man, had need to be God, to treat with God in things that concerne him, and man to treat with man in the things that concerne man. And as it was a way moſt neceſſary, ſo, was it moſt comely: who fitter to make vs ſonnes of God by Adoption, then he that was the Sonne of God by Nature: and who fitter to reſtore the Image of God in vs, then hee that was the ſubſtantiall Image of his Father?</p>
                  <p>The Vſes follow: and ſo,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we ſhould make conſcience of it to receiue this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with our whole hearts, with all life of affections: for hereby wee ſhall improue, wee are Chriſtians and not Iewes. They could beleeue Ieſus was a man, but could not indure it, that he ſhould call himſelfe the Sonne of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and the diuell hath mightily alſo laboured to make the Diuinity of Chriſt ſuſpected. As when he came into the world, by making men think of a worldly kingdome, then ſtirring vp the Prieſts and Phariſees to ſeeke to kill him as a blaſphemer, in ſaying he was the Sonne of God. And in the beginning of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, he raiſed vp pernitious Heretickes to denie his Diuinity, and at this day, hath raiſed many in other countries, that write and teach moſt dangerouſly in this point. And therefore we muſt hold faſt this Truth againſt all the power of hell. This confeſſion is the Rocke vpon which the Chriſtian Church is built, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. 17. If we acknowledge the Son, we haue the Father, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:14246:124"/>
Secondly, it ſhould wonderfully quicken and eſtabliſh our Faith in relying vpon him for Saluation, and all happineſſe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him I ſay, that hath vndertaken for vs, and is ſo full of merit and power; his Satisfaction and Righteouſneſſe muſt needs be perfect and ſufficient, that is the Sonne of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6. God cannot but bee infinitely well pleaſed in his ſatisfaction, and hath ſignified ſo much, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. and therefore wee ſhould ſettle our conſciences in all peace and ioy in beleeuing in him. Yea, in all paſſages of our liues wee ſhould make vſe of our Faith in the Sonne of God: whatſoeuer we want for ſoule or body, or the preſeruation of our liues, we may with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence goe to him: for out of his fulneſſe wee may receiue grace for grace, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. 18. And ſeeing God hath giuen vs his Sonne, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Yea, it ſhould much eſtabliſh our Faith againſt the feare of our falling away before wee come to poſſeſſe eternall life: for he is ſtronger then all, and no man, nor diuell can take vs out of his hand, and therefore we ſhall not periſh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 29. 30.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſhould much inflame vs to the Loue of God that hath had ſuch mercy to ſuch miſerable creatures as wee were, as to ſend his owne Son to redeeme vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. Oh it ſhould make vs to loue God aboue all things, and to eſteeme of his loue, as better then any thing elſe in our liues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God the Father himſelfe from Heauen taught vs a maine vſe of this point, when hee proclaimed him to bee his Sonne, for then he charged vs to heare him. None abler to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs, for the Son hath his knowledge out of the boſome of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. and none hath better right to rule vs, becauſe he is the firſt-borne, and therefore ought to rule ouer his brethren: It ſhould therefore bee our conſcionable care all our daies to attend to his voice, and to do whatſoeuer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we muſt hence alſo learne to ioyne Chriſt with the Father in all religious ſeruice: for when God brought forth his firſt-begotten Sonne into the world, he ſaid, let all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heauen worſhip him, and therfore much more we muſt doe it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:14246:125"/>
Againe, from hence we may gather the wofull eſtate of all vnbeleeuers, that weare out their time and do not lay hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way of Saluation by Ieſus Chriſt: for this increaſeth their condemnation, becauſe they doe not beleeue now, that GOD hath ſent his owne Sonne to bee the Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36.</p>
                  <p>Finally, two things about the Diuinity of our Sauiour are here implyed: firſt, that he is God: for if he be the Sonne of God, then he hath the Nature of his Father, and ſo is God: which though the <hi>Creed</hi> doe not expreſſely mention, yet the Scripture doth, acknowledging him for God equall with the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. but becauſe the <hi>Creed</hi> doth not expreſſe this, I forbeare the explication of it, reſting ſatisfied to haue treated of that which the <hi>Creed</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Another thing implyed is, that hee is a perſon diſtinct from the Father: for if he be the Son of God, then he differs in perſon from the Father.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That it is a thing that God chargeth vpon our Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue diſtinctly that Ieſus is our Lord. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> in ſpirit called him Lord, and this all the Houſe of Iſrael muſt know, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 35. 36. and <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. he is ſtiled Chriſt the Lord, and <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 36. he is proclaimed Lord of all: yea, it is a Title ſo proper to Chriſt, as ſometimes hee hath no other
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14246:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name giuen him but the Lord, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. GOD hath raiſed vp the Lord, meaning Chriſt. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. It is accounted a worke of the Holy Ghoſt in any man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this point, That he beleeueth that Ieſus is the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How Ieſus comes to be our Lord, by what right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſo he is our Lord by a fiuefold right: Firſt, by the right of <hi>Creation,</hi> he made vs all, and ſo he is Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth, and all things therein: for hee hath made them all, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. Secondly, by the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: we were all in moſt miſerable bondage to ſin, Satan and Gods Iuſtice: Now Ieſus Chriſt redeemes vs with his bloud, paying that matchleſſe price for vs, and thereby makes vs his owne, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. Thirdly, by the right of preſeruation, and maintenance, hee keepes vs and maintaines vs by his power, and all wee enioy we hold as Tenants vnder him as our Land-lord, from him wee haue protection wages, apparell, and dyet for both ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Fourthly, by the right of ordination: God hath giuen him all power and made him Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36. God hath giuen his Elect vnto Chriſt as their Lord and head, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. Fifthly, by particular Couenant hee is the Lord of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> for both by our vow in Baptiſme we binde our ſelues to his ſeruice, and by effectuall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we conſecrate our ſelues, and as it were, hire our ſelues to be ſeruants to Chriſt and righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In what Nature he is Lord: I anſwer, howſoeuer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Creation he made vs all as God: yet in reſpect of Redemption he paid the price in his humane Nature, and in reſpect of ordination he is made Lord in both natures, both as God and man: and by Couenant we are bound to the whole perſon. The Lordſhip of Chriſt is a name of office, and ſo belongs to both natures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The excellency of his Lordſhip: and ſo there is no Lord like to Ieſus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe he hath no partners in his dominion: though there be many adminiſtrations, yet there is but one Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. and though there be many Lords, yet to vs there is but one Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. as there is but one God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14246:126"/>
ſo there is but one Lord, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. Hee is the bleſſed and onely Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe all other Lords are his ſeruants and tenants: he is Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In reſpect of the extent of his dominion: for hee is Lord ouer all, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In reſpect of the continuance of his dominion: hee onely hath immortality: other Lords dye, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16. his honour and power is euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In reſpect of the excellence of his glory and Maieſty: He dwelleth in the light, which no man euer had, or can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vnto: no man euer ſaw, or can ſee ſuch glory in any other, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 In reſpect of his goodneſſe to his ſeruants, Tenants and Vaſſalls, for he hath abaſed himſelfe to ſerue and miniſter to his ſeruants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 37. He hath bought them at ſuch a price as no other Lord could giue, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. Hee is rich to all his ſeruants that call vpon him: he hath no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that gets not great preferment by him, euen his meaneſt ſeruants as well as his higheſt Officers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. He hath no ſeruant that euer asked him the Kingdome of Heauen it ſelfe, but hee gaue it him: yea, all that this Lord is, or hath, he beſtowes it vpon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants freely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And beſides, his ſeruants neuer forfeit their eſtate: He puts out no Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor turnes away any ſeruant. Nothing can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate betweene them and their Lords loue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vſe may be both for information and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>For information, and ſo it ſhould informe vs: Firſt, that hee dwelleth not in temples made with hands, that is, that we ought to conceit of him to bee more excellent, then that thoſe materiall buildings ſhould anſwer to his greatneſſe, or that he hath no houſes to put his head in but theſe Churches: for hee is the Lord of Heauen and Earth, and ſo may dwell where he will, and no earthly building can ſet out ſufficiently his greatneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 24. Secondly, that all our obedience to earthly Lords and Maſters, and Gouernours, muſt be with
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14246:126"/>
due reſpect of Chriſt and his authority, we muſt obey them in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. that is, ſo farre as they command vs nothing that is contrary to Chriſts will. Thirdly, it ſhewes that Chriſt hath power to doe what he will with any of his creatures belonging to men: Thus the owner of the Aſſe, and the Colt of the Aſſe is told, that he muſt let them goe becauſe the Lord hath need of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes for inſtruction are theſe, For, if CHRIST be our Lord</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We ſhould acknowledge him, and confeſſe that Ieſus is the Lord, for no man can make this confeſſion, but by the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. But becauſe Hypocrites may ſay ſo in words, let vs labour from our hearts to yeeld our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, as to our onely Lord, to bee ruled and gouerned by him all our dayes, to be wholly at his diſpoſing, euen to liue to him that dyed for vs, and by the ſound Couenant of our hearts to yeeld our ſelues as ſeruants to obey him in all righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. To ſay Lord, Lord, will not ſerue turne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. vnleſſe we ſay it with our hearts, and proue it by our obedience: which if wee doe, then it is from the holy Ghoſt, as the Sanctifier: whereas the generall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confeſſion is but from the common grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which may be found in Hypocrites. Let vs then with <hi>Thomas</hi> from our hearts ſay vnto Ieſus, My Lord, and my God. Yea, let vs giue our ſelues to the Lord, as the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. For why ſhould we any more ſerue ſtrange Lords. Haue we not reaſon to confeſſe, that we haue ſerued ſinne, and Satan, and the world all this while, and it did not profit vs? <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 27. What greater preferment can we haue then to ſerue the Lord of Lords? Did <hi>Dauid,</hi> a great King, account it his greateſt glory to bee the ſeruant of this Lord, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 36. 1. Was it not his comfort to call him his Lord? <hi>Pſalme</hi> 110. 1. Haue wee not taſted how bountifull the Lord is? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. Did our hearts euer feele any thing more ſweet then the entertainment he hath giuen in his Word and Sacraments and Prayer? Haue we not bound our ſelues by ſolemne Couenant, when wee receiued the Sacrament? What then ſhould hinder vs, but that wee ſhould with all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14246:127"/>
our hearts conſecrate the reſt of our liues to his ſeruice: which if you meane to doe, by the way take notice of theſe rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt, that you muſt with all diligence ſudy the Will of your Lord, to know it, and accordingly muſt labour that the Word of CHRIST may dwell richly in you, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That you muſt forthwith, and for euer, ſeparate your ſelues from all the ſeruants of ſtrange Lords, and come out from amongſt them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 You muſt reſolue to obey your Lord Ieſus, in all things without murmuring or vnthankfulneſſe: though you finde his worke bee contrary to your natures, deſires, eaſe, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, profit, or liking of carnall friends, as reſolued to take vp any Croſſe may fall vpon you for well-doing, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That you ſet downe your reſolution, to hold out thus to the end, as reſolued to hire your ſelues to Ieſus Chriſt, not for a day or a yeere, or a fit, but for euer: neuer more to looke backe to the world or ſinne, forſaking all your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer euill wayes, and taking an eternall leaue of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: which by the power of Chriſt your Lord, you may doe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 That you abound in the worke of the Lord, ſtriuing to doe all the good that poſſible you can, knowing that your worke is not in vaine in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That you looke to it to auoid carnall and corrupt ends, in doing your Maſters worke, looke not after the praiſe of the world, and vſe not praiſing of your ſelues, but reſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with the praiſe of Chriſt: for not hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth himſelfe, or is commended of the world is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but he whom the Lord commendeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 That you meddle with your owne buſineſſe, and make conſcience of it to doe that worke faithfully which Chriſt requires of you in your particular places: as God hath diſtributed to euery man, and as the Lord hath called eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, ſo let him walke: auoiding vaine diſcontentment with his calling and condition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17. and take heed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14246:127"/>
of iudging one another, in doubtfull or in different things: looke thou to thine owne worke, what haſt thou to doe to iudge another mans ſeruant, he ſtands or falls to his owne Maſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, when the chaſtening hand of Chriſt our Lord is vpon vs, either in our goods, or in our bodies, when hee takes away any of theſe things from vs, we ſhould patiently beare it, for as it was the Lord that gaue them to vs, ſo it is the Lord that takes them from vs, and therefore wee ſhould part with them, and bleſſe the Name of the Lord as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>vlt.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The Incarnation of Chriſt, is a part of his abaſement, whereby the Sonne of God, after a moſt perfect manner, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Nature of man into perſonall vnion with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Nature. I call it a part of his abaſement, becauſe it was a great Humiliation for God to become man, and ſo it may bee reckoned with his Paſſion following, ſaue that in the ſame nature of Man hee was afterwards exalted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now that God became man, or Chriſt the Sonne of God was likewiſe true man, is proued by theſe and other expreſſe Scriptures, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>

It was this Son by whom man was created at firſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 16. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the fitteſt to reſtore vnto man what he had loſt, by making him againe. And it was moſt comely, that he that was the naturall Sonne of God, by being made the Sonne of man ſhould make vs ſonnes of God, and giue vs the right of Adopted ſonnes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. and the ſecond perſon in the Trinity alone is called the Image of the Father, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and therefore is moſt fit to reſtore in vs the Image of God which we had loſt, and defaced by our ſinnes.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that the Incarnation being a worke ad <hi>Extra,</hi> is common to all three Perſons in the Trinity: for about it all three worke, and yet the Sonne onely did aſſume our Nature, though the Father alſo did worke it by the holy Ghoſt: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines vſe to expreſſe it thus: three Virgins in one common worke make a garment which one of them onely weares: ſo heere the three perſons make the humane nature, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſecond Perſon puts on or aſſumes when it was made.</p>

Theſe that ariſe from an inward cauſe, doe either vniuerſally follow the whole nature of man, ſince it was fallen, as to be ſubiect to heate, cold, wearines, paine, or the like, or elſe are perſonall, and ariſe not from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſinne of man, nor fall vpon all men at all times, but are found onely in ſome men, ſuch as are ſome kinde of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the former ſort Chriſt bare, not the latter. Now the infirmities of the ſoule are likewiſe of two ſorts, ſome viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deteſtable, as ſins: others vnblameable, deſeruing rather pittie then puniſhment, as to bee ignorant of ſome things, feare, ſadneſſe, anger, and the like: the former ſort were not in Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 46. The latter were, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 52. <hi>Marke</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Mat</hi> 26. 37. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 33. And thoſe affections in Chriſt differed much from ours: for his were eaſily ruled by right reaſon, but not ſo ours: his were carried onely to good obiects, ours often to euill: Chriſt was troubled in his affections, and ſo are we, but with great difference: His affections were without ſin: As a glaſſe that is cleane, and hath cleane water in it, if it be ſhaked and toſſed, yet there is no filth in the water: but if the glaſſe be foule, and mud be ſetled at the bottome of the water, if it bee ſhaked, the water is all foule: ſo is the difference betweene the trouble of Chriſts affections and ours.</p>
                  <p>The fifth point is, the time when the Sonne of God was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and that was not aſſoone as man was fallen, but long after, it being deferred by the Wiſdome of God of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that man being left to himſelfe might both feele his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and ſee need to call for the remedie, and exerciſe his Faith in the expectation of it, and that it might appeare that all mankinde was vnrecouerably fallen into miſchiefe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And at that time was this wonderfull worke done, when moſt fitly an example of the Iuſtice of God towards the Iewes, and his mercy towards the Gentiles, might be ſhewed: for at that time, when the Word was made fleſh, was the ſin of the Iewes almoſt full, and among the Gentiles, in that ripe Age of the world were innumerable Elect ones ready for the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14246:130"/>
ſpirituall harueſt, <hi>Mathew</hi> 9. 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 35. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth point is, the Reaſons why it was neceſſary hee ſhould be Incarnate: and theſe are diuers: firſt, the Iuſtice of God required, that ſatisfaction ſhould be made in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that offended: ſecondly, for ſatisfaction, the maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and curſes of the Law, and in particular, death muſt bee inflicted vpon him that will bee our ſurety: Now as God hee was impaſſible and immortall, hee could not ſuffer nor die: thirdly, he tooke not the Nature of Angels but of man, that ſo he might bee a mercifull High-Prieſt, and fit to deale with man and for man, as concerned not onely our neceſſities, but our infirmities too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. 18.</p>
                  <p>The ſeuenth point is, how he was Incarnate, or the manner of the Incarnation, how the Word was made fleſh; This is a great Myſtery, and cannot fully bee expreſſed or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially by vs in this eſtate of Mortality: yet diuers things may be vttered: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He did not aſſume the nature of man, as it is <hi>extra ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectum,</hi> or a thing that is conceiued by the minde, or as it is common in the ſoules and bodies of all men, but as the nature of a man is in one ſubiect, in <hi>vno indiuiduo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The nature of man as it was in the wombe of the Virgin, was in the very moment of the Conception ioyned to the Nature of God in perſonall vnion, ſo as ſoule and body in Chriſt did not make a perſon, as it doth in other men, but did and doe ſubſiſt in the perſon of the Sonne of God, being carried and vpheld by the diuine nature of Chriſt, ſo as both his natures make but one perſon in him: and this may bee gathered out of theſe places, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 36. <hi>Eſay</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may approach to a better vnderſtanding of this vnion, if we conſider it by way of negation, how it differs from other vnions: The word and the fleſh are made one, not in Eſſence, as the Perſons in Trinity are one, nor in nature as ſoule and body make a third nature, nor is this vnion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as man and wife are one: nor ſpirituall or myſticall as God and the faithfull are one, or as Chriſt and the Church
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14246:131"/>
are one, but perſonall, the two natures being one in perſon: Nor is the fleſh in the Word, by ſimple inhabitation, as the ſailes are in the ſhip; nor by affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as two friends are one; nor in reſpect of ioynt worſhip, as if onely the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had the honour to be worſhipped with the diuine; nor in reſpect of Harmonie or conſent, as if onely the diuine and humane will of Chriſt did agree; nor in reſpect of Title on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if the fleſh of Chriſt had no more but the honour to be called by the ſame Title his Diuinity is, as the Sonne of God, or Chriſt, or the like; nor by mingling the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the diuine, to make a certaine third thing: but the humane nature is faſtened to the diuine nature in the vnity of perſon, after an vnconceiueable manner, ſo as the diuine nature is not changed, nor either nature altered, nor ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by diſtance one from another.</p>
                  <p>The eight point is, the effects of this perſonall vnion of the diuine and humane nature in this worke of Incarnation. The effects I meane in Chriſt, not in vs. Now many things flow from this vnion: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The communication of proprieties; and that is, the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of ſuch things as are proper to either nature, vnto the perſon of Chriſt, becauſe that theſe natures doe ſubſiſt in that perſon: ſo as that is truely ſaid of Chriſt, which yet is to be vnderſtood with a reſpect to that nature vnto which that property doth belong. Thus the Sonne of Man is ſaid to haue power to forgiue ſinnes on earth, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the diuine nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 6. and to bee called the Sonne of the moſt High, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32. Thus the Sonne of Man is ſaid to aſcend where hee was before: Now he was not in heauen in his humane nature before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 62. and ſo he ſaith, hee was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 58. and his bloud is called the bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. The like ſpeeches are found in other Scriptures, as, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The pouring out of gifts vpon the humane nature, which were as great as could be receiued by a created nature: and theſe were giuen both to the body and ſoule of Chriſt. His body obtained the higheſt degree of perfection could be fall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14246:131"/>
a body: which glory (for our ſaluation) was with-held from his body during his abode on earth, in reſpect of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſo his body was ſubiect to infirmities, paſſions of diuers ſorts, and death, and buriall: but that worke being finiſhed which he vndertooke for vs in his body, it now ſhineth in Heauen in greater glory then any bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures doe or ſhall attaine vnto. Vpon the ſoule of Chriſt by vertue of this vnion with the diuine Nature, were powred out gifts aboue the glory of the gifts which are in men or Angels: and to make this a little better to appeare, I will inſtance in his knowledge and in his <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were diuers kinds of knowledge in Chriſt. Hee had an eternall and vncreated knowledge and wiſdome, which did belong onely vnto his diuine Nature: but it is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge belongs to this place: and that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and knowledge, is either from experience, or from reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or from viſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 There was in our Sauiour an experimentall knowledge, by which our Sauiour knew all things could be knowne by the light of Nature: and though hee had not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all things, yet by reaſoning from the like, or the contrary, or from the cauſes or effects, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued things hee had not experience of. As by the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he felt, and by the things he ſuffered, he knowes all the things we ſuffer in the full nature of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 15. and in this kinde of wiſdome it is that hee was ſaid to grow vp in, or profit and increaſe in, and in this kinde of wiſdome he was able to diſcerne more then any man in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There was in our Sauiour a knowledge infuſed, which they call the knowledge of Reuelation, by which heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are vnderſtood by a light they call the light of grace. And by this knowledge our Sauiour did diſcerne in his ſoule ſpirituall things more exactly then euer man or Angell did: of this is ſpoken, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third kinde of knowledge in Chriſt, is the knowledge by viſion, which is called the knowledge of the bleſſed in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14246:132"/>
Heauen, by which God is ſeene face to face, and in this Chriſt excells all men and Angels: for it is hee that brings all iuſt men to this happineſſe of ſeeing God in Heauen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. And beſides this perſonall viſion, his ſoule is neerer vnto God then men or Angels can bee: and therefore ſees GOD more cleerely then they can doe: As a man that hath a good ſight doth ſee a thing that is hard by him more exactly then another man that is farther off from it. Yea, this knowledge in the ſoule of Chriſt doth not fully comprehend God, for that which is infinite cannot be comprehended by that which is finite: he ſeeth God whole, that is, all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And in as much as all iudgement is committed vnto Chriſt, as the Sonne of man, it is moſt probable, that as man hee doth ſee the thoughts of all men that are to be iudged by him as man, though not by any naturall efficacy in his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as man, yet by a ſupernaturall infuſion of light from his diuine nature, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the gift of knowledge: Charity and loue was powred out vpon the ſoule of CHRIST, aboue all the meaſures of Charity in men or Angels, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the gifts were powred out vpon the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt: Yet by the way it is not amiſſe to note, that certaine gifts were not powred out vpon CHRIST, or not till his glorification: as faith and hope were not in CHRIST at all: for in as much as the obiect of faith is things not ſeene, faith it ſelfe could not be in CHRIST, who did inioy the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10.</note> of GOD by vertue of the perſonall vnion, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, euen from the beginning of his Incarnation, by that kind of knowledge which I called before his knowledge of viſion, or the knowledge of the bleſſed: yet to want faith did not argue imperfection in CHRIST, but rather remoued imperfection: as hee that wants Spectacles, when he needeth them not, is no whit inferiour to him that vſeth Spectacles, becauſe of the weakneſſe of his ſight. The like is to bee ſaid of hope, for as Faith beholds things that are not ſeene, ſo hope lookes to things which are not yet had or poſſeſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14246:132"/>
and the cheife obiect of both is the chiefe good, which is GOD: now CHRIST enioyed GOD, yea, euen in the very inſtant of his death: but if we looke to ſecondary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and by hope vnderſtand an expectation of ſome kinde of helpe promiſed by GOD, then ſuch a kinde of hope may be granted to haue beene in Chriſt, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 31. Now there were certaine gifts which our Sauiour had not till he went to Heauen, as impaſſibility and immortality; on Earth hee might and did ſuffer, and dye, but now in Heauen hee can neither ſuffer nor dye any more, <hi>Romans</hi> 6. 10. Thus of the ſecond effect of the perſonall vnion in the Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>The third effect belongs to both natures, and is the grace of office: for from this vnion ariſeth a fit Mediatour and head of the Church, for in both natures conſidered as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is Chriſt our Mediatour: ſo as all things belonging to our reconciliation and ſaluation, were done by Chriſt in both natures: yet were not the Actions of the diuine and humane nature ſo confounded, but that each nature did that which belonged to that nature onely: to ſpeake diſtinctly, in euery thing done for our ſaluation, wee muſt conſider; Firſt, the Worker, and that is the Perſon of Chriſt, or Chriſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red in his Perſon. Secondly, the things by which he workes, and that is his Natures, Diuine and Humane. Thirdly, the working it ſelfe, and that followes that Nature that doth worke. Fourthly, the worke or the thing outwardly done, which they call in another language <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now this outward worke was done by the diuers workings of each Nature, concurring to diſpatch the worke: as to ſacrifice for mans ſinne is one worke, yet to this worke concurre the workings of both Natures: the Humane Nature is offered as the gift, and the Diuine Nature doth inable and ſanctifie the gift, &amp;c. As in <hi>Chirurgery,</hi> when a limbe of a man is to bee cut off, and burnt, or ſeared vp all at once, this is done by a Sword or other Inſtrument made red hot: yet there we ſee in that fired ſword, that it is ſtill but one ſword, and yet there is two Natures in it, fire and yron, and theſe two Natures haue different forces, the one to cut and the other to burne, and there is two workings diuers, the yron cuts, and the fire or
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14246:133"/>
heat burnes, and yet the outward worke is but one worke done at once, which is the ſearing of the Member by cutting.</p>
                  <p>The laſt effect of this vniting of the diuine nature to the humane is the grace of honour and worſhip giuen to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: for the humane nature, that in it ſelfe were not to be worſhipped, being a creature, doth partake of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to receiue diuine worſhip, in as much as worſhip is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to that perſon that is both God and man. Thus of the laſt point in the explication, which is the effects of the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vnion in the worke of the Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes follow, and are for information, and inſtruction, and conſolation.</p>
                  <p>From the Doctrine of <hi>Christs</hi> Incarnation, wee may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of diuers things: as</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Concerning the wonder of the perſon of our Sauiour: for here mortality and immortality meet together in the ſame perſon: It is truly affirmed, that hee is created and vncreated; without beginning, and yet did beginne in time; a <hi>Iew</hi> according to the fleſh, and yet GOD bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer all for euer: GOD before all ages, and yet man liuing amongſt vs; God before the fleſh, God in fleſh, and God with fleſh. By his Miracles ſhewing his Diuinity, and by his Sufferings ſhewing his Humanity. Hauing one generation without beginning, and another generation without example. In the one hee makes man, and in the other hee deliuers man. The one was before man, and the other aboue man. Gods Sonne becomes mans Sonne, and yet not changed from what he was, but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what he was not. The taking of our low eſtate did not diminiſh the Maieſty of his high eſtate, for he ſo tooke what was ours, as he loſt not what was his owne, ioyning both natures in ſuch a bond, as neither Maieſty conſumed the inferiour, nor aſſumption diminiſhed the ſuperiour in man changing the condition of other men, and yet in himſelfe remaining vnchangeable. The manner of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Incarnation being a myſtery to bee beleeued, not diſcuſſed. That the Word was made fleſh I know, but how he was made ſo I know not: nor doe any creature
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14246:133"/>
know. The myſtery hid from ages was reueiled in this laſt age, reueiled, I ſay, that there was ſuch a thing done, but not reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led how it was done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Concerning the glory of God ſhining in this worke, and that eſpecially in two things. The one is in the way of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelfe to the creature. The other is in contriuing the forme of our redemption.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, God being the chiefe good, it ſeemed good to him to communicate himſelfe to the creature, &amp; that he hath done three waies: Firſt, by communicating nature to the creature, that higheſt being, granting nature &amp; being with Nature, with great diuerſities of proprieties in that being. 2. By communicating grace to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the prerogatiue of certaine creatures that by Gods gift hauing powred out vpon them a ſimilitude &amp; likeneſſe of God himſelfe, whether on Earth or in Heauen. Now the third way is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the former to be adored and admired for euer, and that is a way by which God doth not giue any created gifts either of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or grace, but he that is the Creator and Lord of glory, doth giue himſelfe to the creature, to make one perſon with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt way God is communicated to all creatures, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way to the reaſonable creature, the third way to Chriſt man. And yet obſerue and wonder, for God in Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated himſelfe to all creatures; for in as much as the nature of man comprehends in an Epitome, or by way of repetition, the ſubſtance of all that is in all other creatures, and therefore is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a little world: when God aſſumes the Nature of man into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vnion with himſelfe, hee doth after a ſort exalt euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reduce it to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now for the other point, the glory of God in contriuing a way for the ſaluation of mankinde loſt, doth greatly appeare in this work of the Incarnation: for the debt of the firſt man was ſo great that none ought to pay it but man, &amp; none could pay it but God: and therefore God aſſumes man into the vnity of his perſon, that ſo man that in nature ought to pay, and could not, in perſon might make full diſcharge. Againe, all mankind it lieth vnder ſinne: the Iuſtice of God will haue all damned, the Mercy of God will haue all ſaued; now the wiſdome of God moderateth betweene his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy, and by this way ſatisfies both: His Iuſtice is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14246:134"/>
in giuing a ſurety: ſo as the offence being infinite in reſpect of the obiect, which is God, it was exhauſted by an infinite power in reſpect of the ſubiect or the ſurety ſatisfying.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Doctrine of Chriſts Incarnation, ſhould worke in vs by way of Inſtruction: and ſo it ſhould teach vs in ſome things that reſpect Chriſt, and in ſome things that reſpect Chriſtians. In reſpect of Chriſt it ſhould inflame in vs a vehement deſire to bee made like vnto his nature: If he come ſo neere to vs to take our nature, wee ſhould deſire to approach to him to take his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: If he were made like vnto vs in infirmities, we ſhould ſtriue to be made like vnto him in grace and holineſſe: ſhall hee deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to vs, and ſhall not we aſcend to him? If he abaſe himſelfe to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke the proprieties of our Nature, how ſhould we ſtriue to be exalted, in taking to vs the vertues of his nature: and for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to other Chriſtians, the Apoſtle from this Doctrine tels the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in what things they ſhould be like-minded to Chriſt: They ſhould learne of him, to be humble, and to ſhew their loue to their brethren, though it were to deny themſelues, and their owne profit, or ſeeking the good of others, and not their owne good: which you may reade there vrged at large, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Doctrine of the Incarnation might be very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all the godly: and ſo in diuers reſpects. Firſt, in that he did take our Nature into vnion with his diuine Nature, we ſhould ioy in it: for is it not an admirable priuiledge, that the nature of man is taken into ſuch a ſociety with the holy Trinity, being a part of Chriſt, who is the ſecond perſon in Trinity: who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire the honour done to our nature, that it ſhould now be one with the bleſſed Trinity? Secondly, if wee conſider what he aſſumed. He tooke my whole Nature, that I might be wholly ſaued, he left nothing of man which hee tooke not to himſelfe. Thirdly, to comfort vs in all infirmities and diſtreſſes, hee made himſelfe like vnto vs: He was poore with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> wept with <hi>Mary,</hi> thirſted with the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> was an hungry in the wilderneſſe, to ſatisfie for our eating in the Garden, he was in bonds with <hi>Paul,</hi> he was tempted that hee might ſuccour vs that are tempted; in all things he became like to vs, that we might not ſinke vnder the burthen of our infirmities or ſufferings. Fourthly, it muſt it needes be a great deale of comfort to vs, to haue ſuch
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14246:134"/>
aſſurance giuen vs of his loue to vs, that for our ſakes would ioyne his Maieſty to our vileneſſe, his power to our weakneſſe, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to our mortality, that being in the for me of God would for vs vouchſafe to be in the for me of a ſeruant. Fifthly, it comforts vs, in that it may wonderfully ſettle our faith in beleeuing in him: we may ſafely reſt vpon him that wants not power to ſaue vs, ſeeing he is God, nor will to ſaue vs, ſeeing he is one of vs, a true man, that hath had experience of our miſeries. Sixthly, it ſhould greatly encourage our hearts in all our ſuits to God: ſeeing our owne fleſh and bloud ſits at the right hand of God, what can wee aske the Father in his Name that will be denyed? He that was made like to vs in ſuffering, will neuer bee ſtrange to vs in praying. He that became our brother by Incarnation, will not ſhew himſelfe a ſtranger in the buſineſſe of Interceſſion. Laſtly, in the hope of our glorification in Heauen we receiue hence great comfort: for therefore: did the Sonne of God become the Sonne of man on earth, that the Sonnes of men might become the Sonnes of God in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this Doctrine alſo is not without terrour to wicked men that will not receiue him, whom GOD hath ſent amongſt them: that God which hath beene ſo wonderfull in ſending his Sonne to liue amongſt vs in our nature, if we will not beleeue in him, and ſtriue to be like to him, will make himſelfe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in our deſtruction. This will be the condemnation of the world, that ſo great a light came into the world, and the world receiued it not.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Incarnation in generall. Now we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the parts of his Incarnation, <hi>viz.</hi> his conception by the Holy Ghoſt, and his birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One thing is common to both theſe parts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the anunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them by an Angell: God ſent an Angell from Heauen to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie both theſe wonders in the Incarnation of our Sauiour: and the Miniſtery of an Angell is vſed in the beginning of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Incarnation of our Sauiour, partly becauſe as in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition an euill angell came to the woman in the Serpent, ſo would God haue a good Angell come to the woman to treat with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Redemption: and partly becauſe good Angels were in ſome reſpects witneſſes in the worke of our Redemption: for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14246:135"/>
thereby the places amongſt the Angels made void by the fall of diuels, are by the Redeemer to be ſupplyed by holy men, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the Angels receiuing their confirmation in goodneſſe from Chriſt, are now actually to ſubiect themſelues together with Elect men vnder that one Head, Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Conception, which is the firſt part of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, theſe things are to be conſidered. 1. The proofes that there was ſuch a conception. 2. Who was ſo conceiued. 3. Of whom hee was ſo conceiued. 4. What was done by the Holy Ghoſt in this conception. 5. How it was done. 6. When it was done. 7. The effects of this conception in reſpect of vs. 8. Why it was neceſſary hee ſhould bee thus conceiued 9. Where the Body of CHRIST was when it was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. 10. A queſtion about the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and laſtly, the Vſes of all.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, that our Sauiour was conceiued of the Holy Ghoſt, is proued by this Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. as alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 18, 20. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, if wee reſpect the matter conceiued, then Chriſt man was conceiued; but if we reſpect the perſon conceiued, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Trinity was conceiued in the wombe of the Virgin, for ſo it is ſaid in this Text, that it was the Son of the moſt High: and the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, it was <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with vs: for though the Virgin did not giue the diuine Nature to Chriſt: yet the perſon that receiues the humane Nature in her wombe was the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <div type="objection_and_solution">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> Then it ſeemes the whole diuine Eſſence was conceiued, for the whole diuine Eſſence was in the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Incarnation was not according to his Eſſence, but according to his perſon: the perſon onely aſſumed our nature in this Conception, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 31. 32. 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpeake properly, we may not ſay that in this conception the humane nature began to be (for that hath no ſubſiſtence in it ſelfe) but the Perſon began to bee then in the humane nature: <hi>Tylen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the third, he was conceiued of the holy Ghoſt as the former proofes ſhew: He was not conceiued as other men be, by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or by generation in the coniunction of man and woman, but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14246:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without man by the working of the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> If he were conceiued of the holy Ghoſt, then the holy Ghoſt <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> was his Father: and the rather, becauſe in the Originall the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition imports, that this Conception was not onely by him, but of him.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The holy Ghoſt did worke this Conception not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but effectually, by cauſing it to be, not by giuing matter out of himſelf to the Nature of Chriſt. As <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaid, the holy Ghoſt begetteth not ſpermatically but operatiuely. And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt was conceiued not of the ſubſtance, but of the power, not by any generation, but by the appointment and benediction of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>vlt.</hi> all things are ſaid to be of God: Now it were ſenſeleſſe therefore to conclude, that God is the Father of all things: for though he made all things, yet hee did not make them out of his own ſubſtance: for he is Father that makes a thing to be out of his owne ſubſtance: ſo the holy Ghoſt did not make the humane Nature of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For the fourth, there were two things done by the holy Ghoſt in this conception: the firſt was the production of the humane Nature, the other was the vniting of it to the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity: The firſt of theſe is moſt properly the worke of the holy Ghoſt, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but in ſom reſpects, for the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Perſon in Trinity did aſſume the matter ſo prepared, &amp; wrought by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>The humane nature produced was both the body and ſoule of our Sauiour; now in the production of the body of Chriſt there are two things to be conſidered: firſt, the preparation of the matter of his bodie: ſecondly, the ſanctification of it. The matter of the body of Chriſt prepared in the conception, was the very ſubſtance of the fleſh of the Virgin, that is the ſeed or pureſt bloud of the Virgin ſeparated by the holy Ghoſt, and carried to the place of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore is Chriſt called the fruit of her wombe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 42 The ſanctification of this matter containes in it two things: firſt, the waſhing of that ſubſtance from the ſtaine of ſin with which it was infected by nature, ſo as now it ſhould neuer more haue any ſpot or ſtaine of ſin in it, and the ſtopping of the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: ſecondly the infuſion of all pureneſſe and holineſſe, which belongs vnto the ſoule aſwell as the body, in that very moment it was ioyned to the body: Now that Chriſt was conceiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſinne, of that there was no ſin in that fleſh when it became the fleſh of Chriſt, is manifeſt by theſe Scriptures: he was made like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in all things, ſinne onely excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. he was ſaid to be made onely in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh.

                        </gap>age: for firſt, where doe they proue it by Scripture that ſhee was without ſinne? Secondly, if ſhee were conceiued without ſinne, then her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were ſo too, and if her parents, then theirs, and ſo into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: thirdly, then what needed Chriſt this conception by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the producing of the body of Chriſt: His ſoule was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as the ſoules of other men are, that is, It was immediately created by the holy Ghoſt, and infuſed into his body: onely there is difference amongſt diuines about the time of the infuſing of the ſoule of Chriſt: for in the ordinarie courſe, Nature proceeds in this manner: firſt, there is the maſſe of bloud or ſeed receiued in the wombe, but there is no parts of a body framed at the firſt: after a certaine number of weekes, nature formes that ſubſtance into the parts of the body diſtinctly, but yet it is without life: then is the ſoule infuſed, when the body is organicall, and ſo it is quickned &amp;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14246:137"/>
a true man, it is not before a man, but <hi>Embryo</hi> as they cal it: Now the queſtion is, how Chriſt could receiue that imperfect <hi>Embryo</hi> or the fleſh at the firſt conception, ſeeing it was not a perfect humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? To this ſome anſwer, that our Sauiour did not follow the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of taking fleſh, as other men doe, but in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of the conception, his body was made organical, &amp; had perfect members, and the ſoule infuſed at that inſtant alſo: and their reaſon is this, becauſe the Sonne of God did not become a perſon to any thing but the Man-hood of Chriſt: Now the Man-hood muſt needs haue a reaſonable ſoule and body formed, and organicall: elſe we muſt ſay, that ſomething did ſubſiſt in the Perſon of his diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that was not man, as <hi>Embryo</hi> or the lumpe vnformed, and not animated was.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, when God made a man by the power of the holy Ghoſt, without the ſeed of man, hee made him perfect at one inſtant, and euery way formed in all parts: as when he made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> they were in an inſtant made perfect in ſoule and body.</p>
                     <p>Other Diuines conceiue that this opinion cannot be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was made in all things like vnto vs, ſinne onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, now there could bee no ſinne in that ordinary courſe of Nature, if originall ſinne bee remoued as it was in Chriſt. Now in the courſe of Nature: firſt, that which is materiall is formed, as it were the houſe of the ſoule, and then the ſoule is infuſed, not onely as the gueſt of it, but as the forme and life of it: and ſo it muſt be in Chriſt. Now for the firſt reaſon they anſwer, that the Hypoſtatical vnion in the perſon of Chriſt, was ſo made aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as withall, Chriſt aſſumed that which belonged to the nature of man according to the courſe of Nature: and ſo firſt the ſeede, and then the body formed, and the ſoule infuſed according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into that body ſo as that fleſh before the comming in of the ſoule did ſubſiſt in the Word, as it did after the ſoule was infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for the Word tooke our Nature, which is not hindered by the abſence or preſence of the ſoule: as when Chriſt was dead, his ſoule was in his Fathers hands, and his fleſh was ſhut vp in the graue, and was not quickened then by the ſoule, yet the fleſh of Chriſt without the ſoule and life did ſubſiſt in the word, aſwell as it did before or after: The other reaſon is of no force, for God did not make our firſt Parents ſo out of neceſſity, but out of the good
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14246:137"/>
pleaſure of his will, not binding himſelfe to that frame of working for all times afterwards.</p>
                     <p>And thus of the production of the humane nature: The aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Nature into perſonall vnion with the word followes: and the ſumme of that which wee are to beleeue concerning this Myſtery is, that the whole nature of man in that particular ſubiect ſoule and body, with all meere naturall faculties, and parts, yea, and infirmities, was taken into an vnſpeakeable and eternall perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vnion with the diuine nature of Chriſt: There was nothing which was ours (ſinne excepted) which was not by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt vnited to the word: for as Chriſt had all that God the Father had <hi>praeter ignaſcentiam,</hi> ſaue that he was not vnbegotten: ſo he had all that <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>ſolâ except â peccantiâ,</hi> ſaue that he was without ſinne, as a Father ſaid: onely for the manner of this aſſuming of our nature diuines conceiue, that the word was ioyned to the ſoule immediately, and to the body mediately, that is, by meanes of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>And thus of the fourth point: The fifth is, The manner of the conception, how the holy Ghoſt did it: and that in reſpect of the perfect vnderſtanding is ſimply aboue the reach of any creature, eſpecially any mortall creature: if it be true of our conception in the wombe, that we are fearefully and wonderfully made, as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 13. then it muſt needs be much more true of Chriſts conception and forming: but a certaine glimpſe of it is giuen vs by two formes of ſpeech vſed in this Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is: the holy Ghoſt ſhall come vpon thee: the other is the power of the moſt high ſhall ouerſhadow thee: by the firſt forme of ſpeech is noted the wonder of the worke, that it was not done, by any naturall meanes, but extraordinarily aboue the courſe of nature, by the holy Ghoſt, and that it was done after a moſt pure and diuine manner: about which a Father ſaith, Oh moſt pure coniunction without filth, where ſpeech is the husband, and eare is the wife, meaning that ſhee conceiued vpon the ſpeech and hearing of the promiſe, aſſoone as ſhee had giuen her matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial conſent as it were: the ouerſhadowing by the power of the moſt High imports, that is was not done ſpermatically, but opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and that the holy Ghoſt did this by a ſpeciall power of working, neuer any ſuch thing hauing bin donne before: as alſo
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14246:138"/>
it imports that the worke was moſt ſecret and myſticall, ſo as the Virgin being couered as with a cloud, could not her ſelfe tell how it was done: and that though God did worke this with a ſpeciall excellencie of glory, yet his Maieſty ſhould not ouercome her, but it ſhould be as it were clouded: and laſtly, that that holy thing which was to be conceiued in her, and borne by her, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and kept ſafe, as the greateſt treaſure God had care of, or did giue vnto men.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth thing is, why it was neceſſary Chriſt ſhould bee ſo conceiued after ſuch a wonderfull manner, and with ſo much holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſanctification: I anſwer for two euident Reaſons: for firſt, if his body had not bin moſt pure, it had not bin fit to bee ioyned in perſonall vnion with the Word. And ſecondly, if he had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in ſinne, as other men are, he could not haue bin a Sauiour to vs, becauſe then he would haue needed a Sauiour for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth thing is the time when the Virgin conceiued, and that was immediately vpon the ſpeech of the Angell and her owne conſent to it: which was the twenty fiue of <hi>March,</hi> the day which is called the Annuntiation of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and one may wonder why that day ſhould not rather be called the day of the conception of Chriſt, then of the Annuntiation of the Virgin.</p>
                     <p>The eighth point is, the effects of this conception in reſpect of vs, and ſo the firſt effect is the hiding of the impurity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the ſight of God, and ſatisfying Gods Iuſtice for our originall ſinne: for the holineſſe of Chriſts conception, is the firſt and chiefe part of the righteouſneſſe imputed to vs: All his righteouſneſſe is ours, and ſo the holineſſe of his conception, in which hee was qualified with all the habits of virtue or piety, might conſtitute perfect holineſſe of nature: All his righteous actions which he did in obedience to the law flow from theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of virtue infuſed in his conception, and therefore I call it the firſt and chiefe part of the righteouſneſſe imputed to vs, as that which couereth the vnrighteouſnes of our natures, yea, after a ſort it pacifies, and ſatisfied for our offence, and ſo beginnes his paſſiue obedience to God: as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore when he entered into the world he ſaid, ſacrifice and burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings thou wouldeſt not, but a bodie thou had prepared me, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond effect, is our ſpirituall life and conception: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

was he conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, and quickned in the wombe of the Virgin, that from his life, the power of our ſpirituall forming and regeneration might proceede, as from him that tooke life himſelfe amongſt vs that he might become Lord of life, and the true originall of ſpirituall and eternall life of God: for the ſaine ſpirit that formed Chriſt in the wombe, doth beget vs againe that we might liue with him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>The ninth thing is that queſtion, whether it may be ſafely ſaid, that <hi>Mary</hi> was the Mother of God <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: I anſwer, if wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo groſſely, as to thinke ſhee was the Mother of the God-head of Chriſt, it were not only erronious but blaſphemous: and yet it is true, that ſhee was the Mother of God, becauſe ſhee was not onely Mother of him that was God aſ well as Man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo God was incarnate in her wombe, God did not take fleſh in heauen, or in any other place, but in her wombe onely.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, 'tis not vnprofitable to conſider, how the being of the body of Chriſt, differs from other reſpects of the being of the ſame body. The body of Chriſt is in Heauen Locally, it is in the Word ſubſtantially, it is in the Sacrament myſtically, It is in the hearts of euery beleeuer ſpiritually, and was in the wombe of the Virgin by a naturall and circumſcriptible manner of preſence.</p>
                     <p>The vſes follow: and ſo,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They are confuted that ſay, He tooke not his Body of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but brought it from Heauen. They obiect, that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 13. it is ſaid, that Chriſt deſcended from Heauen, and that verſe 23. and 31. He ſaid, he was from aboue, and that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. He is ſaid to be the Lord from Heauen. <hi>Anſw.</hi> None of theſe places ſay, That he brought his body from Heauen. The words are true of the perſon of Chriſt, that he deſcended from Heauen when he abaſed himſelfe to take vpon him the forme of a ſeruant: and if they were true of his humane nature, yet could ſignifie no more but that he was conceiued after a heauenly manner, and not by carnall generation, by the working of the Holy Ghoſt who came downe from Heauen vpon the Virgin. If they reply it muſt needs be true, that he deſcended in the ſame nature he aſcended, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9, 10. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle onely ſhewes that he was abaſed, to ſhew himſelfe in the forme of a ſeruant, and to ſuffer extreme things, and therefore was exalted to bee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14246:139"/>
Lord of al. And beſides, theſe hereticks they are hence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, that ſaid Chriſt had not a true body, but onely a body in appearance. Theſe obiect that Chriſt appeared in the old Teſtament in a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall body, and not in a body indeed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is falſe too: for it was a true ſubſtantiall body hee aſſumed and created for the time: but were that granted, yet the body he ſhewed in the New Teſtament, hath abundant teſtimonie thas it was a true naturall body, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. 2. Againe, they ſay out of the <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. that he was onely in the likeneſſe of a man. I anſwer, theſe places are not all of one ſenſe: for in <hi>Daniel</hi> he was ſaid to be like the Son of Man, becauſe he was not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. He is not ſaid to be in the likeneſſe of fleſh, but of ſinfull fleſh, being reckoned amongſt ſinners, &amp; being made a ſacrifice for ſinne: and in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> hee doth not ſhew what the ſubſtance of his Nature was, but what his abaſement was, that he did not onely take our Nature, but made himſelfe in that nature like to the moſt abiect of men, euen to the pooreſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, when he was heire of all things, and ſo this likeneſſe of his is expounded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. 17, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hence we may informe our ſelues of the wonder of this <hi>Creation</hi> of God: heere is the beginning of a new Creation: heere is a Sonne that had no Mother as he was God, and no Father as he was Man. If it be obiected, that he is called the Sonne of Man, and ſo had an earthly Father: I anſwer, that he is called the Sonne of Man, becauſe he tooke our nature of the ſubſtance of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, I meane it of her fleſh: and if it be on the contrary obiected, that he is in this Text called the Sonne of the moſt High, and ſo had God or the holy Ghoſt to be his Father: I anſwer, he is called the Sonne of the moſt High as the ſecond perſon in Trinity, which Title of Sonne is giuen to the Nature he receiued from the Virgin becauſe it had no ſubſtance but in the perſon of him that was the naturall Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>There are other vſes for inſtruction: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The ouerſhadowing ſhewes that we muſt not curiouſly prie into the glorious manner of his conception: wee muſt beleeue it was ſo, but not ſearch how it was ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The knowledge of this Article, may prepare vs to beleeue the next, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Chriſt was borne of a Virgin: for ſeeing hee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14246:139"/>
was conceiued by the Holy Ghoſt, it cannot bee hard that hee ſhould bee borne of a Virgin, for hee that wrought this conception is hee that worketh all things, and nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to him.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo comfort in this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In particular, to women that conceiue and beare children, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they be true Chriſtians. The very remembrance of this, that the Sauiour of the world was conceiued and borne of a woman, ſhould ſweeten their feares and ſorrowes, about or after their conceptions, or in the birth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In generall, it may comfort all the godly, to ſee in this concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a medicine for their originall ſinne, and all the euils that cleaue to their Nature: for as it was ſhewed before, to this end he was conceiued without ſinne, and ſanctified in his Nature, that thereby he might iuſtifie vs before God from the euils cleaue to our natures.</p>
                     <p>And thus of the firſt part of his Incarnation, <hi>viz.</hi> his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghoſt, his birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> followes: In which words of the Creed, the thing affirmed is the birth of Chriſt, the perſon by whom it is, is deſcribed by her conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhee was a Virgin, and by her name ſhe was <hi>Mary,</hi> and her name is added to bring to our remembrance the Genealogy of Chriſt; who tooke fleſh of her that was of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid</hi> in a right Linage, that thereby the promiſes made to the Fathers might be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Birth of Chriſt, we muſt know that hee is ſaid to be borne three waies: Of his Father, and of his Mother, and in the minde of Man; of his Father hee is borne eternally, of his Mother temporally, in the minde of man ſpiritually: In Chriſt there are three things which haue Relation to his Natiuity, Deity, Fleſh, and Spirit: of his Father, he is borne God, of his Mother, Fleſh, and in the minde of Man, Spirit, ſo as this latter way be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Metaphorically:</hi> of his Father hee was borne euer, of his Mother he is borne once, and in the minde of Man he is borne often. According to diuine Natiuity he hath a Father without a Mother: according to humane Natiuity he hath a Mother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Father: and according to his ſpirituall Natiuity hee hath both Father and Mother, according to that ſaying of his, he that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14246:140"/>
doth my Fathers will, is my Father and my Mother.</p>
                     <p>In the birth of Chriſt God was manifeſted in the fleſh, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. manifeſted I ſay three waies: as he was before three waies hid; firſt, from out of the boſome of his Father in whom he was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: ſecondly, from vnder the ſhadowes of the Law in which he was prefigured: thirdly, from the wombe of his Mother in which he was formed.</p>
                     <p>The effects of the Natiuity of Chriſt were diuers: for firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God himſelfe, the effect was his glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14. The glory I ſay of his truth, wiſedome, goodneſſe, and Iuſtice: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of godly men, the effect is, their Saluation, becauſe he was borne to be a Propher, Prieſt, and King, euen to effect all things that might tend to their Saluation, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, peace was a ſpeciall effect of his Manifeſtation in the fleſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14. Peace I ſay aboue vs with God, Peace within, with our owne conſciences, and peace about vs with men and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and peace below vs in reſpect of Sathan and Hell, becauſe we are deliuered from their power and furie. What ſhall I ſay, he was borne into naturall life, that we might be borne againe into eternall life: thirdly, in reſpect of the wicked, the effect of his Birth was their Iudgement: for he was borne for the falling of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Iſrael, Luke</hi> 2. 34. and this is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and the world comprehended it not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. and that God ſhould ſend his owne Son to be the light, and yet men loued darkeneſſe more then light, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                     <p>The place where our Sauiour was borne was <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which howſoeuer it fell out by accident to be there in reſpect of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which did not by any purpoſe of her owne chooſe that place, yet indeed it was the place foreſpoken of by the Prophet, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. and was appointed of purpoſe by the Counſell and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that euen hence the godly might bee warned of the fulfilling of the promiſe made to <hi>Dauid</hi> the <hi>Bethlemite, Luke</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                     <p>The time when he was borne, was the time agreeing with the propheticall Oracles, called the fulneſſe of time, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 4. The time when the Scepter was departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> an <hi>Idumaean</hi> now ſitting at the Sterne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. A time when the Iewiſh Church and Common-wealth was brought ſo low, as there was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:14246:140"/>
no helpe to be expected but from Heauen.</p>
                     <p>The entertainment hee had at the time of his birth was very poore and meane, he was borne of a poore Mother, and hee was borne ſo poore, that he might make vs rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and that he might thereby trample vnder his feet as vile that vaine pride of wordly men, that ſo much bragge of their worldly glory, and nobility of their birth. And when he might not haue a place in the Inne, hee was not aſhamed to lye in a Manger, that by choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the weake things of this world, he might confound the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and might prepare a place for vs, and many Manſions in his Fathers houſe.</p>
                     <p>In the manifeſtation of the Natiuity of Chriſt God ſhewed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous wiſdome, who to ſhew himſelfe to be no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that he brought this light into the world for all ſorts of men: He ſhewed it both to the Shepherds and to the wiſe men, the one Iſraelites, the other Gentiles, the one poore and ſimple, the other rich and wiſe, the one neere, the other farre of, both ſorts to be ioyned vpon the ſame corner ſtone. The ſame light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Anna,</hi> a woman, as well as to <hi>Simeon,</hi> that iuſt man, that it might be euident, that in him that was then borne there was neither circumciſion nor vncircumciſion, Iew nor Gentle, Male nor Female, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                     <p>Thus of his birth in generall, his birth of a Virgin followes. Now that he was born of a Virgin is euidently proued, not only by the Hiſtory of the Goſpell, but by the Propheſie of God himſelfe in Paradiſe, when he ſaid, The ſeede of the woman ſhould breake the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And by the propheſie of <hi>Iacob</hi> the Patriarke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. Where Chriſt is named <hi>Shiloh,</hi> that is, the Sonne of his <hi>Secundines,</hi> not the Sonne of his loynes; now the <hi>Secundines</hi> belong to the Nature of the woman, not to the man: and by the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> who ſaid, Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceiue, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7. 14. And it was prefigured by the ſtone cut out of the Mountaine without any hands, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. And it was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Angell <hi>Gabriel, Luk.</hi> 1. 31. The reaſons why hee was borne of a woman without a man haue beene ſhewed before. It is a worke moſt wonderfull: He is borne in the armes of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that himſelfe beares vp the whole world in the hand of his power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:14246:141"/>
Men hath beene produced foure wayes: Firſt, without either man or woman, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. 2. Without woman, as <hi>Eue</hi> was. 3. Without man, as Chriſt was. 4. With man and woman, as all other men were.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was to the Virgin a Sonne and her firſt borne. Hee was called her firſt borne, not becauſe ſhe had any ſonnes afterwards, but becauſe he was borne firſt, though he were her onely Sonne. Chriſts brethren were his Kinſmen; nor doth the terme firſt borne import any following, for the firſt borne in Law were ſo called before they knew whether they ſhould haue a ſecond childe; and it is a godly profeſſion of Diuines in all ages, that ſhe was a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin before birth, and in the birth, and after the birth: though this latter be no Article of faith or principle of Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Bread of Life was borne in the houſe of bread, and the moſt fruit-bearing Natiuity was performed in <hi>Bethlehem, Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah, (.i.)</hi> In a moſt fruitfull place, and he was borne in a ſtrange place, as he might bring vs baniſhed men into our true Country.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Birth of Chriſt was both ordinary and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull: It was ordinary, that he was carried in the wombe of his Mother the ordinary time, and was brought forth at the ordinary time: but it was wonderfull both in reſpect of the ſignes that fell out about the time of it, and moſt of all, that his Mother was a Virgin. The ſignes were very miraculous, as the riſing of the Star in the Eaſt, the Angelicall Muſicke in the Ayre, and the great Light, and the publication of it by Angels. Yea, the ſignes were very ſtrange among the Gentiles: for a publike voice was heard, the great God is now about to be borne. At <hi>Rome</hi> was the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a woman carrying a childe in her armes ſeene about the Sunne. And when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> asked <hi>Sibilla</hi> about a Comet was then ſeene: ſhe anſwered, This Childe is greater then thou, adore thou him: many ſuch ſtrange things are obſerued by Writers.</p>

Firſt his abaſement is ſet down in the ſumme or generall conſideration of it, in theſe words, <hi>He ſuffered vnder Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Then is mentioned diuers of the chiefe parts of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>viz. He was crucified, dead, and buried,</hi> and <hi>deſcended into Hell.</hi> In the ſumme of all, hee ſhewes what befell him, and when: what befell him, and ſo <hi>he ſuffered,</hi> meaning that he was put to endure miſery: and when he ſuffered, and that was <hi>vnder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pontius Pilate:</hi> and that time is eſpecially mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe the chiefeſt parts of his ſufferings then fell out. 2. Becauſe thereby the Chriſtian Churches haue occaſion to obſerue the fulfilling of the old Prophecies at the time of Chriſts comming, and ſuffering in the fleſh: for <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Shiloh</hi> muſt come when the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was departed from <hi>Iudah, Gen.</hi> 49. And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:14246:142"/>
ſaid, that the bud or branch ſhould ariſe and grow, when the tree of <hi>Ieſſe</hi> and his houſe was ſo waſted, as nothing was left but the bare ſtocke or root, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 1. This was now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, for <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Gouernour of <hi>Iudah</hi> vnder the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and none of the Tribe or Stock of <hi>Dauid</hi> bare any office of gouernment in that State: God is true in his words, and when the Church ſeemes to be moſt afflicted and forlorne, God can make ſaluation to appeare: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the moſt deſperate afflictions wee ſhould learne to truſt vpon God, who will not forſake his people for euer: and yet another thing may be noted too, and that is, that when God did ſend his Sonne to deliuer his people, it was not to deliuer them from temporall diſtreſſe, but to bring them ſpirituall and eternall ſaluation, and yet they had no cauſe to complaine. So it may be with vs: it is enough in deſperate diſtreſſes, if God will doe good to our ſoules, though hee doe not for the time releaſe or free our bodies. Thus of that circumſtance of the time, only for the titles here giuen to this Ruler, know that <hi>Pilate</hi> was his proper name, and <hi>Pontius</hi> hee is called of the place where he was borne, which was <hi>Pontia,</hi> an Iland that lay neare to <hi>Italy:</hi> This man was Gouernor after <hi>Valerius Cratus,</hi> and come into his place about eight yeeres before Chriſt died vpon the Croſſe. And for the reaſon why the time is deſcribed by the time of this gouernment, we muſt know that the <hi>Romans</hi> did vſe to keep the reckoning of times by the times of their Gouernours: as by <hi>Conſuls</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo by <hi>Proconſuls</hi> or Deputies in the Countries ſubiect to them: as we reckon by the reignes of our Kings. See <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the order and ſenſe of this part of the <hi>Creed.</hi> One thing may be noted, from the coherence of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with thoſe that follow. For we may obſerue, that Chriſt was firſt humbled, and then exalted: God firſt made him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer grieuous things in this life, and then gaue him a Name aboue all names in heauen. For as it is regiſtred in the <hi>Creed,</hi> ſo is it reported in the Scripture, and ſo was it foretold, and it was conuenient it ſhould be ſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26. and this is profitable for vs to know, for it ſhould perſwade
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14246:142"/>
vs to patience and hope in all our ſufferings. We ſhould be willing to ſuffer as well as Chriſt, for we were predeſtinated to be made like vnto Chriſt in this very thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and Chriſt did ſuffer to leaue vs an enſample, that we ſhould walke in his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. And the more patient ſhould we be, ſeeing he ſuffered farre more extreme things than we can doe: and in all our ſufferings we ſhould haue hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue a promiſe, that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reigne with him alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. and then what compariſon can there be betweene our light afflictions on earth, and that eternall glory in heauen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. And if we be not afflicted with him, what are we but baſtards and not ſonnes; for if God ſpared not his naturall Sonne, how can he ſpare vs that are but adopted ſonnes?</p>
                  <p>And thus of the <hi>Coherence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet before I come to the explication of the Doctrine of the Paſſion, a queſtion may be moued concerning ſomething that is wanting in the words of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and that is about the actiue obedience of Chriſt: for here is mention onely made of his Paſſion: now did Chriſt doe nothing worthy our faith but onely ſuffer? Or if hee did, why doth not the <hi>Creed</hi> take notice of it? For anſwer hereunto, we muſt know, that beſides the ſuffering of the puniſhment of our ſinnes threatned by the Law, our Sauiour did alſo abſolutely fulfill the whole Law of God, by an exact and vniuerſal obedience: which was neceſſary for him to doe for diuers reaſons. For firſt his holineſſe of Nature and life made his ſufferings the more acceptable and meritorious, the lambe is not a meet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice if it be not vnſpotted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. 19. nor the Prieſt fit to offer, if he be not holy and ſeparate from ſinners. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he thereby leaues vs a paterne that we ſhould follow his vertue, &amp; ſtriue to learne of him to obey the Law. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chiefly, that he might bring in a righteouſneſſe that was able to iuſtifie vs, that had no righteouſneſſe of out own: for by the obedience of that one Man many are iuſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. and he was the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now this point muſt not be wanting to our <hi>Creed,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:14246:143"/>
it is the chiefe comfort of our liues againſt the ſenſe of our owne vnrighteouſneſſe, and defects of Holineſſe: It is the ioy of our Hearts, that we may euer ſay of Ieſus, he is the Lord our righteouſneſſe, and that he is made vnto vs of God, righteouſneſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. And therefore this great and free gift of God, we muſt not only beleeue, but acknowledge and profeſſe. Againe, we ſhould alwaies be ſtirred vp from the meditation of the ſingular holineſſe of heart and life which was in Chriſt, to ſtriue to be holy, as he is holy: for though a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be not required of vs in the new Gouenant, yet this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is beſtowed vpon thoſe men only, that walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Now for the reaſons why this Article of Chriſts actiue obedience was not mentioned in the <hi>Creed,</hi> I cannot well tell what they were, vnleſſe it were for breuities ſake, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is implied in his paſſiue obedience: for it is true that we muſt not diuide his actiue and paſſiue obedience the one from the other, becauſe as they meet both in one Sauiour, ſo they are both ioyntly imputed to vs, to make vp that one worke of our Iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>It remaines now that I enter vpon the explication of the ſufferings of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo there be Six things of great weight and profit to be diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of:
<list>
                        <item>1. Who ſuffered.</item>
                        <item>2. From whom he ſuffered.</item>
                        <item>3. For whom he ſuffered.</item>
                        <item>4. Why it was needfull he ſhould ſuffer.</item>
                        <item>5. What he ſuffered.</item>
                        <item>6. How he ſuffered.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, hee that ſuffered is deſcribed in the words next before in the <hi>Creed,</hi> it was <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, the only Sonne of Godour Lord,</hi> who was ſo wonderfully <hi>conceiued</hi> and <hi>borne.</hi> For the vnderſtanding whereof, we muſt conceiue that the Paſſion of Chriſt belongs to his Perſon, and ſo is attributed in reſpect of the Perſon to both Natures, for though in his diuine Nature he cannot ſuffer, becauſe hee is Immutable,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14246:143"/>
nor can die, becauſe he is Immortall, and therefore properly ſuffers but in his humane Nature; yet in reſpect of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffering, his ſufferings belong euen to the diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for if the fleſh be the fleſh of the Word, then muſt alſo the ſufferings of the fleſh, be the ſufferings of the Word alſo: for neither was the Word diſioyned from the fleſh, nor the fleſh ſeuered from the Word. Nor was there any hurt done to the Nature that is inuiolable, by that which was to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Nature paſſible. If the Sunne ſhine vpon a peece of timber, though an axe cut the timber, yet the Sunne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines impaſſible; ſo is it when the Diuinitie is ioyned to the ſuffering fleſh of Chriſt: yet I ſay in reſpect of the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vnion, the ſuffering is alſo attributed to the diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus the Scripture ſaith, God redeemed the Church with his bloud, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and the Lord of glory was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. So then, the ſumme of all is, that the Son of God did ſuffer, in that Nature he could ſuffer in: and this point may ſerue for very many vſes. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may ſtand ſtill, and with amazement gaze and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the glory of this Myſtery imported in this firſt point. What is this, the eyes of our faith behold? was it euer thus ſeene before? The Maker of man is made Man, and while he rules the Starres, he ſuckes the breſts: He that is Bread, hungereth; He that is the eternall Fountaine, is athirſt: He that is the Way, is weary; He that is the Truth, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by falſe witneſſes: He that is the Iudge of quicke and dead, is iudged by a mortall Iudge: He that is Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe himſelfe, is condemned by the vnrighteous: He that is the God of all Order, is beaten with rods: He that is the Power of God, is made weake: He that is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is wounded: and He that is Life, dies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Euidence of this Truth, the Chriſtian Church draw out thoſe Heretiques were called <hi>Patripaſſiani,</hi> that held that God the Father ſuffered, and that the termes of <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> did note but one Perſon only. Which groſſe Hereſie as it is confuted by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity before, ſo by this Doctrine contained in this branch of this Article.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:14246:144"/>
3. We may hence gather how hatefull ſinne is, that can make God ſuffer, that can abaſe ſo fearefully (as you ſhall heare afterwards) the very Sonne of God, who yet did no ſinne, but was only a ſurety (as is to be ſhewed) yea it makes him ſuffer from his owne naturall Father: ſo vile a thing is ſin, and ſo iuſt is God. What can be more ſenſeleſſe than the heart of man, that from hence doth not clearely ſee the vgly and monſtrous nature of ſinne, and the moſt vnauoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable iuſtice of God, in puniſhing ſinne? Doth Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and from his owne Father, and is it poſſible any of vs ſhould be ſo bewitched as to go on in ſinne, and yet think there is ſuch mercy in God as to ſpare him, though he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not his euill wayes?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is Gods Sonne thus abaſed for vs, and doe not wee pitie him? Are not our ſtony hearts melted with compaſſion towards him? Oh why doe we not more mourne for him ſuffering, than we would for our owne and only ſonnes? This wee ſhould doe, and muſt neuer haue the praiſe of good Nature, till we can be more affected with his abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that was ſo high and excellent in his owne Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Our faith ſhould be wonderfully from hence ſtrengthned, conſidering the vnſpeakable ſufficiencie of the ſufferings of Chriſt for our ſinnes; for if the Sonne of God redeemed vs, and ſatisfied for vs, and ſuffered for vs, then wee muſt needs be fully ranſomed: and though our ſinnes be many, yet <hi>the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God cleanſeth vs from all our ſinnes,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7. Note that he ſaith <hi>the bloud of the Sonne of God,</hi> for that makes his bloud a perfect and ſufficient price of Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Sonne of God ſuffered, then it ſhould be a ſhame for the ſons of men to be vnwilling to ſuffer, or to be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in their afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. eſpecially ſuch as are in meane condition in this world, ſhould from hence be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued without murmuring to beare hard vſage, as is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the caſe of ſeruants, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 19. Thus of the firſt Point.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond Point, <hi>viz.</hi> from whom he ſuffered: We muſt know, that if we let paſſe the higher cauſes of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14246:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and looke vpon the creatures only, he ſuffered from all ſorts of Enemies. The Deuils and the High Prieſts, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies and the People, <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pilate, Herod</hi> and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Iewes and Gentiles, his owne Countrey-men and ſtrangers, all oppoſe him, and from all he ſuffered, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Goſpell more at large ſhewes. Which point is worthy our obſeruation for diuers vſes. Firſt, we may hence take occaſion to wonder at Gods skill and wiſdome in orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring buſineſſes. What a confuſed heape is here of vile Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet what a glorious worke doth God doe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſorder, nothing being done but according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Councell? <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. Secondly, we may ſee how eaſily all ſorts of men are drawne to practiſe againſt holineſſe and ſincere religion: what doctrine was euer more powerfull than the doctrine of Chriſt, and what man euer liued ſo harmeleſſely, ſo profitably? and yet how quickly is all the world raiſed vp againſt Chriſt, and true Religion taught and profeſt by him: What power hath the Deuill in the hearts of all ſorts of men? Who though he neuer require any worke but what is baſe and dangerous, yet quickly gets Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to effect any thing he requires. Oh how is miſerable man ſunke deepe into rebellion, that ſince the fall of our firſt Parents, had rather follow the Serpent, than the Sauiour of the world: who would euer care for the opinions or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of any ſort of worldly men? Thirdly, wee ſee here a naughtie nature will infect any Calling, the Prieſthood will not continue alwayes good, nor Magiſtracie, nor the retired life of the vulgar: ſinne infects any calling.</p>
                  <p>For the third Point, for whom he ſuffered, that is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in diuers Scriptures; he ſuffered not for himſelfe, but for vs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. Now that this may be diſtinctly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it muſt be conſidered both Negatiuely, and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely: Negatiuely, and ſo he did not ſuffer for all the men and women in the world vniuerſally, as the Arminians and Lutherans affirme: and that we may gather by many ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. He ſaith his bloud was ſhed for many, which imports it was not ſhed for all: And <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23. Chriſt ſaith to ſomemen, <hi>I know you not,</hi> which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14246:145"/>
imports ſtrongly that he did not ſuffer for them: and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. our Sauiour ſtill limits his petitions in his pleading, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſuch as God the Father had giuen him, and ſaid he praied not for the world: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 1. it is ſaid he loued his owne which were in the world, and therefore all were not his owne: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 15. He layed downe his life for his Sheepe, and therefore not for Goats and Swine: and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25. He gaue himſelfe for the Church, not for all the world: and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14. 3, 4. they that are bought out of the earth, are diſtinguiſhed from other men, to ſhew all are not redeemed: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16. The benefit of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Bloud-ſhedding is extended only to ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Thus of the proofe of the Negatiue.</p>
                  <p>Now for the affirmatiue, it is moſt cleare in Scripture, that Chriſt ſuffered for beleeuers, and for all of them, not only for vs, but for all of vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. not only for Iewes, but for all the world, that is, for the Gentiles of all Nations, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. His-righteouſneſſe extends vnto all, and vpon all that beleeue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe may be firſt for the confutation of the opinion of thoſe that hold that Chriſt ſuffered and died for all men in the world vniuerſally; we grant his ſufferings were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redeeme all the world, but not efficient: and that their opinion is very groſſely erroneous, appeares by the former places of Scripture, and many more might bee alledged.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing Chriſt did not ſuffer for all men vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, we ſhould looke to it, that we be ſuch as may haue comfort that he died for vs. Now if we would know who they are in all the world that haue their part and portion in the redemption made in the ſufferings of the Sonne of God, we muſt vnderſtand that they are ſuch as are deſcribed in the ſignes that follow. Firſt, they are beleeuers: ſuch as with the eye of faith can looke vpon, and muſt to the promiſe of God made concerning ſaluation by Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3 16. as is there ſhewed by the type of the brazen Serpent in the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Secondly, they are ſuch as turne from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Iaoob, Eſay</hi> 59. 20. Thirdly, they are ſuch, as will heare
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14246:145"/>
the voice of Chriſt, and be ruled by him, they are his ſheepe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 15. Fourthly, they are ſuch as are made like to Chriſt in ſufferings, they beare his image in ſuffering affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet for all their croſſes they loue God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29. 1 <hi>Per.</hi> 4. 1. Fiftly, they are ſuch as doe conſecrate their liues and ſeruices to Chriſt, they liue to him, that died for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, did Chriſt ſuffer for vs? what patterne was there euer of ſuch leue? Conſider what we were in our ſelues by nature: Firſt, we were vniuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. the Iuſt here ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for the vniuſt: one will ſcarce die for a righteous man, but who euer was willing to die for the vnrighteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8. <hi>Naboath, Zacharias</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> were iuſt men, and yet none would die for them, and yet perhaps for ſome righteous man, one durſt die, as it may be <hi>Ionathan</hi> durſt haue died for <hi>Dauid,</hi> but yet this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſident, which here Chriſt doth, he ſuffers for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous. Secondly, we were not only vniuſt, but his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. yea we were ſuch as neuer ſought to him for redemption, as the Scriptures and experience ſhew.</p>
                  <p>What hearts haue we that cannot be more affected with this wonderfull loue of Chriſt! Behold here is Piety ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the impious mans ſake: Wiſdome is derided for the fooles ſake: Truth is denied for the lyars ſake: Iuſtice is condemned for the vniuſts ſake: Mercy is afflicted for the cruell mans ſake: Life dies for the dead mans ſake, as ſaid an ancient Father. What a ſuffering is this, when the Iuſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for the vniuſt, and with the vniuſt, and vpon vniuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and vnder vniuſt Iudges, and by vniuſt puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hath Chriſt ſuffered for vs? why then from his example we ſhould learne to be willing and ready to ſuffer one for another, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we ſhould comfort our hearts with this Doctrine; ſeeing Chriſt did not ſuffer for himſelfe, but for vs, wee ſhould apply his ſufferings to our ſelues, and plead them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God againſt our ſins, and the temptations of the Deuill: and ſeeing hee hath paid ſo deare a price to reconcile vs to God, wee ſhould make no queſtion of it, but that hee will
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14246:146"/>
now ſaue vs being reconciled, and finiſh his owne worke, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſeeing the Sonne of God is the Paſſeouer, yea our Paſſeouer, and Sacrifice for vs, we ſhould therefore purge out the old Leauen, that we may be a new lumpe, and ſhould therefore keepe the feaſt, not with old leauen, neither with the leauen of malice and wickedneſſe, but with the vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread of ſinceritie and truth; if Chriſt ſuffered for vs, then our life ſhould be a continuall feaſt; yea in as much as he was offered vp as an immaculate Lambe, and is tendered to vs as the food of our ſoules in the Word and Sacraments, therefore we ſhould ſpend our life as if it were a continuall Paſſeouer: and ſo we muſt put away leauen, euen the old leauen of ſuch corruptions as we liued in, and in particular, the leauen of malice, and keepe this feaſt in the vnleauened bread of ſound ſinceritie of life and truth in all holineſſe without hypocriſie. Thus of the third point.</p>
                  <p>The fourth point is, why it was needfull that Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God ſhould ſuffer? and for anſwer thereunto we muſt know that he did not ſuffer caſually, but by diuine prouidence, ſo as nothing befell him in the leaſt thing, which was not ſeene to be neceſſarie for our redemption: that God that doth all things by meaſure in afflicting his ſeruants, doth much more exactly looke to the powring out and filling of the cup he did giue his owne Sonne, ſo as not a drop could light into it, without eſpeciall reaſon and ſound conſideration. Now there be many impulſiue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or reaſons giuen in Scripture why Chriſt muſt ſuffer: as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſo the Scriptures might be fulfilled, that foretold his ſufferings, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26, 27. and therefore it is vſuall in the hiſtory of the Goſpell, when the particular ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt are mentioned, to ſay, it was that ſuch and ſuch a Scripture might be fulfilled. Let wicked men marke this point; God is ſo iuſt of his wotd, that he will not ſpare his owne Sonne, but executeth euery Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miſery, which in his word hee foretold hee ſhould ſuffer, nor he did not releaſe him from the leaſt circumſtance of any part of his Paſſion, as the diuiding of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14246:146"/>
his garments, and caſting Lots for his veſture &amp;c. and therefore how can it be poſſible, that they that are ſo hatefull to God, ſhould eſcape any of thoſe woes and curſes denounced in Scripture? Let Swearers, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Adulterers, Lyars, Hypocrites, and the like, be afraid of this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſo he might leaue vs an enſample that we might walke in his ſteps. The perfect practiſe of Patience was cleane worne out of the world, ſo as a man could not ſee by any bodies practiſe, how he ſhould carry himſelfe in affliction. If we looke vpon <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe, that was one of the beſt patternes amongſt men, yet we reade of ſtrange impatience in <hi>Iob,</hi> he was not dumbe, but opened his mouth to ſpeake ſtrange and vnſauourie things. Now that this hard leſſon might be learned, our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vndertakes to act it before our eyes, that we might ſee it done to the life, and ſo be made more willing, and more able to learne to ſuffer. They are deceiued that thinke, that if godly perſons ſuffer, it is for their faults, for if Chriſt himſelfe come into the world, he ſhall ſuffer from the world: and true Chriſtians are too faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſeeing the Prince and Captaine of their ſaluation conſecrate through afflictions, cannot yet be excited with magnanimitie and ſolide patience to endure the hardſhip of godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſo he might deliuer vs from the bondage of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. and 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That ſo he might become a mercifull High-Prieſt, and might know how to haue compaſſion on our infirmities, and might attaine to a very feeling of our diſtreſſes, and ſo be more fit to ſuccour vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18. and 4. 15. which ſhould afford vnto vs ſtrong conſolation in all grieuances of life: it is a glory we giue to Chriſt, when we by faith in our particular tryals doe reſt vpon this goodneſſe, and fellow-feeling in our bleſſed Sauiour. Theſe cauſes are leſſe principall, but the principall reaſons follow, and ſo</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He was to ſuffer, that ſo he might reconcile vs to God, or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14246:147"/>
bring vs againe to God, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. which he did effect, when in his ſufferings he was made an expiation, atonement, and propitiation for our ſins: as our ſurety he was to make payment and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God, by ſuffering that malediction which we ſhould haue borne, God condemning our ſins in his fleſh, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 4. 25. and 3. 25. and 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. This end of his ſuffering appeares in this, that ſcarce any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was more frequently ſhadowed out in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for euery day the ſacrifices did as it were force it into the mindes of men; and this was it the Prophets ſo longed to ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He was to ſuffer, that ſo he might heale our diſeaſes, and kill and mortifie the vile humours and ſpirituall leproſies had infected our ſoules and liues, which his Paſſion doth partly by way of argument, as the meditation of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doth giue vnto the godly cauſe to hate ſin, and with ſorrow to put it away; and partly and chiefly by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vertue (as a diuine plaiſter) is deriued vnto our ſoules ſecretly by the ordinances of Chriſt, as by the word of the Croſſe, which is the preaching of the Goſpell, and by both the Sacraments, Baptiſme &amp; the Lords Supper, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. He was to ſuffer, that he might purchaſe thereby eternall life for vs, who were not only caſt out of Paradice, but ſhut out of Heauen, and could neuer enter within the veile, had we not beene ſprinkled with his bloud, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 51. and 12. 32, 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10.</p>

that be equiualent to damnation eternall, which all men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and were guilty: I ſay, it is anſwered by this, that it is more for Chriſt to ſuffer a temporarie death, than for all men to ſuffer eternall damnation.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is not to be conſidered as a priuate perſon, but as a publike ſurety for the Elect, and ſo it is iuſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their debts at his hand that becomes ſurety for them.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of theſe principall ends of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may ſerue for great vſe. For firſt we may hence ſee cleerely, how wicked the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, that tels vs of ſatisfactions for mens ſinnes to be made by the works partly of themſelues, and partly of Saints departed: when the Scripture acknowledgeth no other propitiation than the paſſion of Chriſt, nor can there be need of any other, ſeeing it is the paſſion of him that is God. Secondly, hence we may be confirmed againſt the ſcandal of the Croſſe of Chriſt: though Iewes and Gentiles declaime againſt Chriſt for that very cauſe, becauſe he was ſo vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of the world, yet we ſee there was great reaſon for it, he ſhould be ſo abaſed, for elſe our ſinnes had not beene ſatisfied for, nor heauen purchaſed. Thirdly, hence we may ſee the difference betweene Chriſts ſufferings and the ſufferings of the Martyrs: For firſt, the ſufferings of the Martyrs were not puniſhments for ſinnes, but only trials or chaſtiſements; whereas Chriſts ſufferings were maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and puniſhments laid vpon him for our ſins. Againe, the ſufferings of the Martyrs were not meritorious, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued nothing for others, becauſe they are conſidered but as priuate men; but Chriſts ſufferings were meritorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vndertooke them as our ſuretie, and was ſuſtained vnder them by the immediate aſſiſtance of the Diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in reſpect of which they were the ſufferings of God. Fourthly, hence we may take occaſion to be grieued at heart for our ſinnes; for our ſinnes were the cauſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and brought vpon him all the miſeries he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14246:148"/>
when we ſee Chriſt crucified, we ſee him who was ſo pierced for our ſinnes. Fifthly, ſeeing we are bought with ſuch a price, as the ſufferings and bloud-ſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhould therefore not be the ſeruants of men; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt paid ſo deare for vs, we ſhould be aſhamed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie our ſelues to the humours, and luſts, and vanities of the men of this world, as if we were ſtill their ſeruants. He knowes not Chriſt, or the price of his redemption, that for baſe and corrupt reſpects will leaue the ſinceritie of Chriſts ſeruice to humour or pleaſe men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. Sixthly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt laid downe this price to redeeme and ſaue his people from their ſinnes, wee ſhould goe away reſolued to ſinne no more, and to walke worthy of ſo great redemption. Shall wee againe crucifie the Sonne of God, by returning with the dogge to our vomit, or the ſwine to the wallowing in the mire? Seuenthly, how ſhould we admire the loue of Chriſt to vs, that hath waſhed vs from our ſinnes by his owne bloud! Oh glorious medicine! Oh how vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was that loue! What tongue can vtter it? What heart can conceiue of it? <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>But the eſpeciall vſe is for conſolation: for theſe ends of Chriſts ſufferings doe manifeſtly import the fruits and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his ſuffering to vs, which is ſo great, as we ſhould euer exult and glory in the Croſſe of Chriſt aboue althings, and deſire no better a way of liuing, than to liue by the faith of the Sonne of God that gaue himſelfe for vs, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 20. and 6. 14. For ſince Chriſt did ſuffer for thoſe reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified, it will manifeſtly from thence follow;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the hand-writing that was againſt vs is cancelled, our bond which we forfeited cannot now be ſued againſt vs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15.</p>

                        <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the deuill, being but Gods Sergeant or Iaylor, hath now no power ouer vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>

                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:14246:148"/>
5. That we are abſolued and diſcharged from the guilt of all our ſinnes, and may by faith lay hold vpon all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of grace and pardon in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That ſinne ſhall haue no more dominion ouer vs; for the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth vs from all our ſinnes, as well in reſpect of vertue, as in reſpect of merit; and againſt the power of it, as well as againſt the guilt of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That we ſhall be ſure of heauen when we die.</p>
                     <p>And in generall, the paſſion and bloud-ſhedding of Chriſt doth ratifie and aſſure to vs all the good things of the new Couenant or Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16. &amp;c. and for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be needfull for vs in this life, how can we doubt? for if God haue giuen vs his Sonne, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things, <hi>Romanes</hi> 8. 32. Thus of the fourth point.</p>
                     <p>The fifth point is, what he ſuffered for vs: and this will be large in the explication of it: For though his ſufferings vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> be mentioned, and his ſuffering of what fell out at the end of his life be called the Paſſion (by an excellencie) yet in as much as Chriſt ſuffered nothing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, or for himſelfe, but for vs, therefore we muſt reckon all the parts of his ſufferings as parts of his Paſſion for vs; and ſo remouing the <hi>Synecdoche</hi> which is in the words of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and conſidering at large of Chriſts ſufferings euen thoſe parts which are not men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ioned in the <hi>Creed,</hi> as well as thoſe that are, the whole Syſteme or Method of the doctrine of Chriſts Paſſion may be diſpoſed as followeth.</p>
                     <p>The Paſſion of Chriſt is both Priuatiue and Poſitiue.</p>
                     <p>His Priuatiue Paſſion did conſiſt in this, that he wanted that glory, ioy and felicitie, which he might and ought to haue had, if he had not voluntarily for the redemption of man depriued himſelfe of ſuch glory and felicitie: and this kinde of Paſſion did extend it ſelfe to both Natures. For firſt his Diuine Nature ſuffered as it were an eclipſe of glory all the time of our Sauiours dwelling on earth; it was hidden as it were behinde the veile: for if his Diuinitie had ſhone out in the brightneſſe of the glory of it, when he came to dwell amongſt vs, <hi>(Iohn</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>. 14.) it would haue beene as
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14246:149"/>
wonderfull on earth amongſt men, as it was and is in heauen amongſt Angels. And beſides, though the glory of Chriſts Diuinitie be ſo infinite, as nothing can be added to it, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it in it ſelfe, yet is it ſaid to be glorified or obſcured according to the conceptions of it in the minds of men, and ſo he ſuffered a priuation of glory, or rather a defect of it, in that light came into the world, and the darkneſſe of mens hearts was ſuch as they did not comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ehend it. Yea it was a great Paſſion, that the Diuinitie of Chriſt ſhould be ſo ſlowly and by ſo few acknowledged al the dayes of Chriſts being in the fleſh on earth. And as for his humane Nature, there was due to it all abundance of glory, and happineſſe, and ioyfull life, in as much as he was a iuſt man, and did perfectly fulfill the whole Law of God; for he that doth that ſhould liue, the meaning is, he ſhould liue a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and happy life for euer. But this glory alſo for our ſakes he was contented to want for a time to his very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. Of this kinde of Paſſion is ſpoken, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 27. and this priuation of glory he ſuffered, that wee might be brought to perfect glory in heauen; and that wee may ſee how hatefull the clouds of our ſinnes were, that could darken and hide from ſhining the beames of ſuch glory; and to teach vs to be content though our liues be alſo hid with Chriſt, as his was when he liued in this world, expecting the reuealing of our glory, when he appeares in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Thus of his priuatiue Paſſion. His Paſſion conſidered po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuely, comprehends both the euill was imputed to him, and the euill was inflicted vpon him.</p>
                     <p>His ſuffering by way of Imputation was very grieuous: for the Lord Ieſus ſtanding before the Iuſtice of God as our Suretie, all our ſinnes were charged vpon him, as if he had committed them himſelfe: and this was a moſt fearfull kinde of Paſſion, which the Scripture takes expreſſe notice of. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he that knew no ſinne was made ſinne for vs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, hee bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the trce, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and this is a conſideration of great neceſſitie and vſe: for hereby the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14246:149"/>
hearts of the godly may be wonderfully ſetled in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation, ſo as to liue out of the feare of Gods wrath for our ſins. All our ſinnes are charged already vpon Chriſt, and therefore God in iuſtice cannot charge them vpon vs: and it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of comfort, to know that therefore our ſinnes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, that his righteouſneſſe might be imputed to vs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And withall we ſhould hence learne, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our ſinnes are taken off our ſhoulders, and laid vpon him, therefore to ſpend our daies in righteouſneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. And thus alſo of his imputatiue Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Euill he endured for vs, which was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon him: it is true that the Scripture doth moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mention his death and bloud-ſhedding, but yet that muſt be vnderſtood <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> for into the Doctrine of the Paſſion ought to be taken all the things he ſuffered from his Conception to his Reſurrection: and that for theſe two Reaſons: Firſt, It is moſt manifeſt he ſuffered nothing for himſelfe, but for vs: and if all he ſuffered were for vs, then all his ſufferings muſt be reckoned, as concurring to the price of our Redemption. Secondly, Hee was to ſuffer the Curſes and malediction of the Law, which was due to vs for our ſinnes. Now by our breach of the Law, wee deſerued not only death, but a miſerable life alſo: and though it is true, that ſuch puniſhments as are inflicted vpon men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their particular perſons, and not common to the Nature of man, he was not bound to ſuffer, as hee was not bound to ſuffer the paines of the ſtone, or gout, or other like diſeaſes, which are not the maledictions which belong to the whole Nature of Man, but ſpeciall iudgements God inflicts vpon ſome men: yet the common Miſeries of mans life, which may ſtand with the Libertie and freedome of the execution of his office in the chiefe ſorts of them he did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine, &amp; to increaſe the merit of his Paſſion, in ſome things he extends his ſufferings further, as will appeare afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Now the contemplation of the Miſeries our bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffered, which were poſitiuely inflicted vpon him, may bee diuided into theſe parts: <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt for the Humility of his Incarnation. He did not only take the Nature of Man, but he tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and was borne in a moſt meane and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, of a poore Mother, not allowed the common entertainment of an lnne, but thruſt out to be borne in a ſtable amongſt the beaſts, and laid in a very manger, not looked after or regarded, either by his own or by ſtrangers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. And thus he was abaſed for diuers reaſons: For firſt hereby the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> paies for the extreme arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is thruſt downe below the ordinary condition of a man, becauſe the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> affected a condition aboue the Angels, euen to be like to God himſelf. Secondly, he thus hides the glorie of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Natiuity in a meane and temporary birth, that he might purchaſe for vs an heauenly and eternall birth: Our Lord takes vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, that we might enioy the ſtates of ſonnes. Thirdly, he refuſeth the glory of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pompe of entertainment at his birth, to reach the great ones of the world, not to be proud of their births in Nature, but to ſeeke after the heauenly new birth, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true glory: And the poore of the world may be comforted againſt the meanneſſe of their prouiſions for themſelues and their children, by remembring that the Sauiour of the world had not ſo good entertainment as vſually the pooreſt of their children haue.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond (to wit) his Abaſement from his Birth to his Baptiſme, two things are to be reckoned as parts of his Paſſion, namely his exile, and his contemptible condition. A little after the birth of our Sauiour, wee reade that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were forced to flie out of <hi>Iury</hi> into <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and in this ſuffering he beares the ſimilitude of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> As
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14246:150"/>
the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhortly after he was created in Paradiſe, was baniſhed out from thence: So Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he was borne in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> is driuen out to goe into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> And this alſo he ſuffered, that the prophecie might be fulfilled, that ſaid long before, <hi>Out of Aegypt haue I called my Sonne, Hoſea</hi> 11. And this part of his ſuffering had alſo comfort in it, for he therefore loſt his liberty in his owne Countrey, that he might purchaſe for vs the right and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our heauenly Countrey: and that ſuch godly men as ſuffer baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, might comfort themſelues in his example.</p>
                     <p>Now for the other Branch, we may obſerue that for thirty yeares, which was the greateſt part of our Sauiours life on earth, he liued in a moſt obſcure condition, reckoned euen in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but as the Carpenters ſonne, and made ſubiect to the authoritie of that poore man <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> In all which time no man regarded him, or once acknowledged his glory, either as the Sonne of God, or King of the Iewes, or Sauiour of the world: and in this time was the old prophecie fulfilled, He was as a Root growing vp out of a drie ground, he hath no forme or comlineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beautie that we ſhould deſire him: he is deſpiſed and reiected of men, and we hide our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 2, 3. And hence godly men may learne to be patient, and contented, though the world know them not, and acknowledge not their glory of the ſonnes of God, though he liue many a day, month, and yeare, without being deſired, or eſteemed in the world. It was thus with the Naturall Sonne, and therefore the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſonnes ſhould not thinke it ſtrange, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If our life be hid, ſo was Chriſts alſo, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 3. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt ſhould greatly checke the vnquietneſſe of the minds of many, that cannot abide to be neglected, and ſo violably hunt after acceptation and fame in the world. And thus much for his ſufferings from his Birth to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in all which time our Sauiour carried himſelfe but as a priuate man, and ſpent his time in performing a moſt exact obedience to the Law of God, and the commandement of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his reputed father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="320" facs="tcp:14246:151"/>
His publique ſufferings began from his Baptiſme, when he was about thirtie yeares of age; and the firſt Diuiſion of them I make to be from his Baptiſme to his laſt Supper: and about theſe firſt obſerue the circumſtance of the time: We know that Chriſt as the Lord our righteouſneſſe was to doe two things for vs: <hi>(viz.)</hi> to performe a moſt abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, and to ſuffer the malediction of the Law for our ſinnes. Now as he began the publique profeſſion of his obedience to the Law at his Circumciſion, ſo he began the publique enduring of the malediction of the Law at his Baptiſme: or thus, The obedience to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law he begins at his Circumciſion, his open obedience to that ſingular Law giuen him by his Father about redeeming the Church by his Paſſion, he begins to execute from the time of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                     <p>Now the things that hee ſuffered in this part of his life were theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Temptation: As ſoone as he was baptiſed, and had ſolemnly vndertaken in publique the Redemption of the Church, the Deuill ſet vpon him with diuers helliſh and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſaults, as you may reade, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. And vnto this conflict doth our Sauiour voluntarily offer himſelfe, being led to the combat by the Spirit, and begins to wraſtle with the Prince of all aduerſarie power, enduring with great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and reſiſting and vanquiſhing with great skill his fiery and blaſphemous Darts. And in the Deſert by ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, as in an open field, before God and Angels was this battell fought. And in the Deſert doth our Sauiour ſuffer this conflict with the Deuill for diuers reaſons. Firſt, that hee might redeeme vs, that with our firſt Parents did wander vp and downe in the vaſt deſert of this world, being baniſhed from Paradiſe, and might by ſubduing the Deuill, the Lion of the wilderneſſe, the god of this world, leaue vs a ſecure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation all the dayes of our pilgrimage, and purchaſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to a better Paradiſe, Secondly, He was tempted of the Deuill, that hee might feele what wee ſuffered when wee are tempted, and might be able to ſuccour them that are tempted, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 17, 18. and 4. 15. Thirdly, That he might ſhew vs a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14246:151"/>
way how to reſiſt the Deuill, and to wreſtle with Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, that we may ouercome them. For hence we may learne many things: for firſt here we may know our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, and what Enemie wee ſhall haue, if wee giue our names to Chriſt, and binde ourſelues by the Sacraments to enter into a courſe of holy obedience to God. The Deuill <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s well as the world will oppoſe vs. Secondly, we may gather from hence that no true Chriſtian may promiſe himſelfe freedome to be ſpared from this warre, nor ought to deſire to be diſcharged from this Triall, ſeeing the Sonne of God was not free from it. Thirdly, wee ſhould hence learne, that a godly Chriſtian, who is Gods Champion, is not brought to the combat of temptations at the meere luſt, or when the Deuill out of his malice will, but he is ſolemnly led to the fight by Gods Spirit, who will ſtand by him, and giue iſſue, and make a way to eſcape the danger: they ſhall haue no more laid vpon them than they are able to beare. Fourthly, from the practiſe of our great Commander, we ſee with what weapons wee muſt reſiſt: wee muſt get ſtore of the written word of God into our hearts, and with the force of Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and true words, wee muſt beat backe and vanquiſh the blaſphemies and prouocations of the Deuill. Chriſt beats the Deuill by quoting the Scripture; which word of God is called the <hi>Sword of the Spirit.</hi> Finally, hence our ſoules may draw euerlaſting comfort, and courage againſt all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by faith and confidence in Chriſt, who hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouercome the Deuill, but did it in our ſteads, and that he might merit our victory, and hath promiſed to helpe vs with his power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Extreme pouerty of Eſtate: The ſecond thing he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in this part of his life, was grieuous pouertie and want of the ordinary comforts and poſſeſſions of life, ſo as hee complaines, <hi>The birds of the aire haue neſts, and the foxes haue holes, but the Sonne of Man hath not where to lay his head, Matth.</hi> 8. 20. And we reade that when he was to ride in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, as it were, into <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as the King of Sion, <hi>(Zach.</hi> 9. 9.) he was faine to ride of a borrowed Aſſe, and <hi>the foale of an Aſſe, Matth.</hi> 21. Now this meanneſſe of Eſtate he endured
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14246:152"/>
for theſe reaſons. Firſt, Hee became poore, as the Apoſtle ſaid, that he might make vs rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. He wanted earthly things, that he might enrich vs with heauenly things. Secondly, our King comes to vs thus meeke and lowly, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Maieſtie, and applying himſelfe to the meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>on of his ſeruants, that he might entice vs to ſeeke more heartily thoſe great things of our ſaluation from him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. And from hence we may learne diuers things. Firſt, we ſhould know and acknowledge this grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and bleſſe his bleſſed pouerty, that hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a way for ſuch riches for our ſoules, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as are rich ſhould learne not to contemne poore Chriſtians for their pouerty, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was poore; and withall they ſhould imitate Chriſt, euen to make themſelues poore (as it were) through their abundant liberality to the diſtreſſed Saints, as <hi>Paul</hi> vrgeth it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. And further, they ſhould not place their felicitie in the poſſeſſion of worldly things, ſeeing the Heire of all things, and the fountaine of all happineſſe, did by willing pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo trample vpon the glory of the riches of the world. Thirdly, ſuch as would follow Chriſt in this world, muſt hence learne not to ſeeke great things from his ſeruice in earthly things: for ſo our Sauiour vrgeth this point, as you may reade <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 19, 20. Laſtly, poore Chriſtians may wonderfully reioyce, and ſerue God in their meane places with much gladneſſe of heart, ſeeing the Sauiour of the world was as poore as they, and liued in as much want of all things as they doe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infirmities of all ſorts, eſpecially bodily weakneſſes, as famine, and thirſt, and wearineſſe, and teares, and the like, reported in the ſtorie of the Goſpell: as alſo infirmities of the minde, as anger, ſadneſſe, trouble of heart, and the like: and theſe he ſuffered for diuers reaſons alſo. Firſt, that in all things he might be made like vnto vs, ſinne only excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. Secondly, that he might aſſure vs that he knowes how to haue compaſſion of our infirmities. Thirdly, Chriſt was made weake for vs, that we might be ſtrong in his might, and might each of vs ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:14246:152"/>
                        <hi>I can doe all things by Ieſus Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi> Laſtly, it is a ſhame for vs to be impatient when we ſuffer theſe things, ſeeing the Prince of our ſaluation hath abaſed himſelfe to ſuffer ſuch things in his owne perſon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Ignominie and extreme diſgrace. And his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that belong to this head were of diuers kinds: As firſt, vile eſtimation and neglect, as to be reckoned but as a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, or the ſonne of a Carpenter, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. and to be regatded of none of the Rulers, and great men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 48, 49. Secondly, the expreſſe deniall of his chiefe glories. Thus the <hi>Iewes</hi> denied his Diuinitie, as is recorded in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Goſpell. They likewiſe would neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the glory of his birth of a Virgin, but ſtill reckoned him for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſonne. Nor would they receiue him as their Sauiour and King, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 10. and his Miracles they ſaid he wrought by the Deuill. Thirdly, vniuſt accuſations and vile reproaches: and thus he is charged with all ſorts of vices, againſt God, and the Magiſtrates, and againſt his owne Soule. Againſt God he is charged with blaſphemy, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the people, and to be a Samaritane: Againſt the Magiſtrate he is charged with treaſon and ſedition: and againſt his owne Soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is charged with gluttony, and working with a Familiar, &amp; madneſſe, and to be a friend of Publicans and ſinners: and theſe Indignities were the more grieuous, becauſe hee ſuffered them from the Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſes, as well as from the people, they being men that profeſſe learning and religion: and becauſe he ſuffered them alſo from his owne, euen thoſe amongſt whom hee was borne and bred: and becauſe alſo theſe things wrought ſuch an impreſſion in the hearts of the people, that they not only diſliked him, but were ſcandalized and offended in him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. and ſome of his Diſciples fell away from him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. All this ſhame and reproach he bare for diuers reaſons: Firſt, hee thereby ſuffers the imputation of our ſinnes; being our ſurety he endures it to be charged with all ſorts of crimes, becauſe though he were innocent, yet we were guilty: and that may be the reaſon, why he ſaith ſo little to excuſe himſelfe againſt theſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14246:153"/>
aſperſions. Secondly, that thereby he might deliuer vs from that eternall ſhame was due to vs, and merit for vs eternall honour, and glory, and praiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 2. Thirdly, that therein he might giue an vnanſwerable prooſe of that naturall hatred of goodneſſe that is in the men of this world, of what degree ſoeuer. Fourthly, that hee might leaue vs an example of patience vnder the like ſufferings, and that we might prepare and looke for the tryals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for well-doing, and not thinke it ſtrange to be reckoned for euill doers, and to lie buried vnder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of foule aſperſions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Many dangers of the loſſe of his life. The <hi>Nazarens</hi> would haue caſt him downe headlong from the brow of a Hill, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 29. The <hi>Iewes</hi> tooke vp ſtones to kill him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 59. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> tooke counſell how to deſtroy him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 6, 7. Diuers conſultations of this kinde we reade of, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 1. and 11. 53. And theſe dangers he ſuffered as the fruits of our ſin: they are neuer ſafe that liue in ſinne. And alſo he endured theſe dangers, that he might redeeme our liues, and ſaue vs from danger of eternall deſtruction. And further, that he might teach vs how to carry our ſelues in time of danger, <hi>viz.</hi> to reſt vpon God without feare, as knowing that our times are in Gods hand, as Chriſt did when he ſent that meſſage to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Goe tell that fox, I worke to day and to morrow,</hi> &amp;c. and yet withall to vſe all lawfull waies of preuention or eſcape from danger, as we reade our Sauiour often did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 1. &amp; 11. 53, 54. And further, that we might reſt vpon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his power; He that was able to preſerue himſelfe from ſuch deſperate dangers, is able and will keepe vs in all our waies. Finally, it ſhould teach vs patience vnder loſſes, croſſes and dangers, ſeeing, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We haue not reſiſted vnto bloud, Heb.</hi> 12. 4. our dangers are not ſo great as his: and therefore it is a ſhame for vs to faint or be diſcouraged.</p>
                     <p>Thus of his ſufferings from his Baptiſme till about the time of his laſt Supper. His Arraignment followes.</p>
                     <p>Vnder his Arraignment I comprehend thoſe dreadfull
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14246:153"/>
things he ſuffered, which containe the firſt part of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Paſſion: And here we are to conſider, firſt, what went before his Arraignment; and then the things he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Arraignment it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Before his Arraignment fell out three things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The conſultation of his Aduerſaries.</item>
                        <item>2. The treaſon of <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. His apprehenſion.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But before I open theſe points, two things in generall that concerne his laſt Paſſion are to be conſidered, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the place where he ſuffered, and the time when.</p>
                     <p>The place where he ſuffered was <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> which was ordered ſo of purpoſe in the prouidence of God for three reaſons. Firſt, that ſo the types of the Old Teſtament might be fulfilled: for there it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> would haue ſacrificed his ſonne <hi>Iſaack</hi> as a type of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that ſo our Sauiours owne prophecies concerning the place of his Paſſion might be fulfilled: for hee had foretold his Diſciples that it muſt be at <hi>Ieruſalem, Matth.</hi> 20 17, 18, 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 31, &amp;c. Thirdly &amp; chiefly, that by his Death and Paſſion, he might obtaine for vs the viſion of eternall Peace, which the word <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſignifies.</p>
                     <p>The time when he ſuffered was at the Paſſeouer: At which time was the greateſt aſſembly and concourſe of people of all ſorts, and from all parts of the world. Hee being our ſurety, payes our debt publikely before thouſands of witneſſes; and withall thereby ſignifies, that hee is the true Paſchall Lambe, which was offered vp for people of all Nations: and the better to confirme our Faith, and affect vs, chuſeth to be killed about the ſame time the Paſchall Lambe was eaten: And it might ſignifie, that God that would ſend the Deſtroyer againſt the world, would yet paſſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer the Elect that are ſprinkled with the bloud of his Son: and that Chriſt Ieſus will guide vs out of the Egypt of this world into the heauenly Canaan; and at the time of the Paſſeouer doth the Lambe of God paſſe out of this world. Thus of the place and time.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing we are to conſider of that fell out before
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14246:154"/>
his Arraignment, is the conſultation of his Aduerſaries, which is recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 3, 4. where obſerue, firſt what they did, <hi>viz.</hi> they call a Counſell, they doe not goe about the worke without aduice. They gather a great aſſembly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to conſult of the buſineſſe. They vnite their forces againſt Chriſt, to let vs know, that the authoritie of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is not infallible: There haue beene Councels againſt Chriſt as well as for Chriſt: and to teach Chriſtian Rulers in Church and Common-wealth, to lay their heads and hearts together, how they may deſtroy Antichriſt. It is much to be lamented, that Chriſtians can no better agree together againſt Antichriſt: It is eaſier to get a Councell againſt Chriſt, than againſt Antichriſt. Secondly, note where they aſſemble, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Hall of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> who was the man, that before in another Councell, had giuen his ſentence for the killing of Chriſt, and was the firſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his opinion expreſly for the death of Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. Thirdly, conſider who were of this wicked Councell, <hi>viz.</hi> the chiefe Prieſts &amp; Scribes, and Elders of the people: euen the neerer men come to God by place and office, the more deſperately vile they are when they once fall to oppoſing the truth: Chriſt had no enemies more malitious than the Prieſts and Scribes, and therefore it is not ſafe to reſt vpon men in the buſineſſes of ſaluation: Things are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be beleeued or done, becauſe they are graced with the authority of great men in Church or Common-wealth. And it is not vnprofitable to note the cauſes of theſe mens proceedings againſt Chriſt. Firſt, they enuied his glory and reſpect among the people, which had ſo much eclipſed their glory: then this Enuy begat the darkneſſe of affected Ignorance, ſo as neither Scripture, nor his teaching, nor the often foyles he had giuen them, nor his Miracles could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them: Then their affected Ignorance begat hatted and loathing of the Truth: and that hatred of the Truth, made them fall into this mad and vnappeaſable Rage and Malice againſt Chriſt, which appeares by the laſt thing I note in their conſultation, which was the end why they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, <hi>viz.</hi> to take him by ſubtletie and to kill him. Note
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14246:154"/>
here that Malice in the enemies of Religion is very cruell: Nothing but his bloud will ſatisfie them, and they make no conſcience to vſe ill meanes to take him, they profeſſe to deſire to take him by ſubtlety. There is a world of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe committed by ſuch as ſit in ſeats of Iuſtice and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the Iudge of the world will haue it brought to light, it ſhall bee knowne many times to their eternall ſhame amongſt men. I may adde one thing more about this conſultation, and that is about the time of it: Now when they ſhould haue beene preparing themſelues for the Paſſeouer, they are met here in a Councell to take Armes againſt the true Paſchall Lambe: and had it not beene for feare of the tumulting of the people, they would haue as ſecurely ſought his deſtruction at that time as any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But where was our Sauiour now?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> and got himſelfe of purpoſe out of the way, that they might haue full ſcope to meet and conſult about his death, as knowing that his houre was come, &amp; thereby declaring that he did willingly lay downe his life for vs. Thus of the conſultation of his Aduerſaries.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> diuers things are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the noting, as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The parts of it: and ſo his treaſon conſiſted of two deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh practiſes: The firſt was his compact with the Prieſts about betraying Chriſt; of which reade <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 14. &amp;c. The ſecond was the villanous execution of the Treaſon, according to that agreement: of which reade <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 47. &amp;c. where you ſhall finde that he betrayed him with a kiſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The qualitie of the Traytor: He was a Miniſter, a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Diſciple of Chriſt, yea preferred to the higheſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> to bee an Apoſtle, one of the Twelue that was called out of the reſt of the Diſciples, and made one of Chriſts owne family, and amongſt the Twelue of ſome ſpeciall reckoning, for he was, as it were, the Steward, and bare the Bagge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The cauſe of the Treaſon, or what moued <hi>Iudas</hi> to this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14246:155"/>
deuilliſh practiſe, and that was his couetouſneſſe, which is expreſſely noted by the Euangeliſt <hi>S. Iohn, Chap.</hi> 12. 6. And his couetouſneſſe was the more vile, and may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated againſt him diuers wayes. As firſt, becauſe hee was an Apoſtle: Couetouſneſſe is more hatefull in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter than in any other. Secondly, Becauſe he would ſell his Lord and Maſter at ſo meane a price; that he ſhould offer to ſell the Lord of all things, as if he had beene a vile bond-ſlaue, and that he ſhould reckon him to bee made for his owne priuate gaine, that did vouchſafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a common price for the redeeming of all men, was a grieuous offence: but that hee ſhould ſell him for ſo meane a price, as thirtie peeces of Siluer, was extremely baſe: Nay it was the more exceſſiuely vile, that he vſeth Chriſt worſe than a Clowne would doe his hogge; for if a country clowne were to ſell his hogge, hee would not leaue the price to the diſcretion of the buyers, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Patience of Chriſt towards the Traytor, vſing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to warne him, and reclaime him: For firſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Treaſon began, our Sauiour vouchſafeth to waſh the very feer of the Traytor, thoſe feet that were ready to ſhed innocent bloud, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 2, 5. Secondly, He thence taketh occaſion to ſay, <hi>Yee are cleane, but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t all, Ioh.</hi> 13. 10, 11. Thirdly, He comes nearer, and: by a prophecie tells them, that one of them that did eat bread with him ſhould file vp his heele againſt him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Fourthly-Heyet more plainly ſaith, <hi>One of you ſhall betray mee,</hi> not naming him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 21. Fiftly, To awaken him, ſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him, <hi>Woe vnto that man by whom the Sonne of Man is betrayed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mut.</hi> 26. 24. Sixtly, When all this would not melt the heart of <hi>Iudas,</hi> he falls into a grieuous Agony for very compaſſion, and vexation at the ſinne of <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſo as <hi>be was troubled in Spirit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhewes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 21. Seuenthly, Though hee knew him to be a curſed Enemie and a Wolfe, that wayted to prey vpon him, (though now in a ſheepes skin) yet he giues him a Sop: He gaue vs a patterne, how to practiſe that ſaying, <hi>If thine</hi>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:14246:155"/>
                        <hi>enemie hunger feed him, if he thirſt giue him drinke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Why was it neceſſary Chriſt ſhould be betrayd by <hi>Iudas? Anſw.</hi> He ſuffered this betraying: Firſt, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be fulfilled that had fore told this Treaſon, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 18. Secondly, in abiding this Treaſon, hee paid for our perfidiouſneſſe and ingratitude in <hi>Adam;</hi> our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe in betraying the Truth to the Deuill; and our ingratitude, that had receiued of God ſo many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by Creation, and yet ſo euill rewarded him: and hee was betrayed with a kiſſe, that hee might ſatisfie for vs, that in <hi>Adam</hi> had admitted the flattery of the Serpent, when hee told vs wee ſhould <hi>be like God;</hi> yea that had as it were flattered the Serpent, obeying him rather than God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. What end this Traitor had: <hi>viz.</hi> He died miſerably, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſee Chriſt ſuffer ſo much, as filled his conſcience with cruell torments, and afterwards hanged himſelfe, ſo deſperately, that he burſt afunder in the middeſt, and all his bowels guſhed out, as you may reade in the Goſpell, and the <hi>Acts, Matth.</hi> 27. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                     <p>Out of all this diuers vſes may be made: As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Information, and ſo two things may benoted: Firſt, that Miniſters if they be corrupt, and lye in the practiſe of any groſſe ſinne, proue very deuils incarnate; <hi>Iudas</hi> for this cauſe is called a <hi>Deuill, Iohn</hi> 6. 70. Nothing is more loathſome to God than a wicked Miniſter; and no men proue more vile, and impudent, and fenſeleſſe than they, if they make not conſcience of their wayes. If Salt be vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoury, where with ſhall it be ſalted? Seldome doeiwe reade or heare of the conuerſion of theſe men. Againe, if God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake a man in his iuſt iudgement, we ſee how impoſſible it is for a man to get out of the ſnare of ſinne. <hi>Iudas,</hi> after Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe had infected him, was ſtill an Apoſtle, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts of preaching and working miracles, enioyed the benefit of the daily doctrine &amp; holy example of our Sauiour, ſaw his Miracles, was enterrained into his familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and had manifeſt warning giuen, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 70. And now at the time of his Treaſon frequent admonitions, as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14246:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ſhewed before, and yet ſo corrupt was his nature, and ſo had the Deuill bewitched him, that he giues not ouer till he had fully finiſhed his wicked deuice. Yea let all men take heed how they truſt vpon vaine euaſions, or pretended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, to auoid the hurts and miſchiefe may follow vpon their wicked actions. It is probably gathered by ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, that <hi>Iudas</hi> though hee meant to betray Chriſt, yet hee meant not to haue him killed, but thought he might get the money of the Prieſts, and yet Chriſt when he came to the pinch would eſcape from their hands, as he had often done. And this may beegathered two wayes: For firſt, when he comes to Chriſt, and giues the ſigne to the Iewes by kiſſing him, he ſo ſpeakes to Chriſt, as he ſeemes to will him to ſhift for himſelfe; when he ſaid, <hi>Maſter ſaue thy ſelfe,</hi> or <hi>haile Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> And ſecondly, the Euangeliſt obſerues, that when <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſaw that Chriſt was condemned, he was horribly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and falls into deſpaire: which imports that he thought he ſhould neuer haue beene condemned. But all this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt notwithſtanding, by betraying him, he became guiltie of Innocent bloud, which he ſaw when it was too late. Yea yet further, all men may take warning too from <hi>Iudas,</hi> to looke to the beginnings of diſcontent. The Deuill can work ſtrange miſchiefes out of ſmall beginnings: for though <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was couetous, yet what made him fall vpon this practiſe of betraying Chriſt at this time? The Text notes that he was diſcontent about the loſſe of the oyntment, &amp; grew ſullen &amp; diſpleaſed, that the woman was iuſtified in her courſe, &amp; his reproofe not allowed. Now vpon this diſcontent, it is ſaid the Deuill entered into him. Let men receiue information from thence, and take heed of anger, and grudge, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, for by giuing place to theſe things, they may let in the very deuill into their hearts, who may leade them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and vile concluſions and practiſes: as we reade the like in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Saul, Achitophel,</hi> and diuers others, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26, 27. Againe, we may from hence note, that a man may be a monſtrous vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet liue amongſt good company, and ſpeake Chriſt faire, and profeſſe to be his Diſciple, and ſalute him
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14246:156"/>
with a kiſſe, and yet be a notable enemy to Chriſt. Many Chriſtians amongſt vs draw neere to Chriſt with their lips, when their hearts are farre from him. Notorious wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are yet ſo impudent, as to come and ſit downe with Chriſt, and eat at his table, and dip their hands with him in the ſame platter: but let them not deceiue themſelues, their place ſhall not priuilege them, nor their hypocriſie couer them; Chriſt knowes them to be <hi>Iudaſſes,</hi> and will make them knowne in due time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For inſtruction: and ſo all men from hence ſhould learne to beware of couerouſneſſe; if they doe not; that which vndid <hi>Iudas</hi> will vndoe them. Now that men may both diſcerne what couetouſneſſe is, and what reaſon they haue to auoid it, I will briefly define couetouſneſſe. Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe is a ſpirituall diſeaſe in the heart of man, ariſing from Nature, corrupted and inſnared by Satan and the world, inclining the ſoule to an immoderate (yet vaine) care after earthly things, for his owne priuate good, to the ſingular detriment of the ſoule. I call couetouſneſſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, becauſe it hath ſuch a priuation, as hath not only want of vertue and happineſſe, but a diſpoſition to euill and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſquietneſſe: and ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> cals it <hi>an euill ſickneſſe.</hi> I ſay it is a ſpirituall diſeaſe, to awaken couetous perſons, for that imports it is hard to be cured: no medicine but the bloud of Chriſt can heale it; and it is the worſe, becauſe it is not felt of the moſt, but hated only in the name of it. The ſubiect of the diſeaſe is the heart of man, there is the ſeat of it, and therefore Saint <hi>Marke</hi> addes couetouſneſſe to thoſe vices Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> had ſaid did defile a man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. The internall efficient cauſe of this ſinne is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corrupted: it had need to be looked to, becauſe it is a diſeaſe the Nature of man is apt to be infected withall. Yet I ſay Nature corrupted, for Nature it ſelfe is content with a little. The outward cauſes are the deuill and the world: A couetous heart is neuer without the deuill in it, or not for any long time; and therefore the text notes, that vpon the ſtirring or fits of this diſeaſe in <hi>Iudas,</hi> the deuill entred into him. The world alſo by varietie of baits and obiects excites
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14246:157"/>
this diſeaſe. The forme of this ſinne lieth in the inclination of the ſoule to an immoderate and confident care of earthly things. I make earthly things the obiect, becauſe it were a great vertue to couet ſpirituall things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. I ſay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, becauſe honeſt labour and deſire after neceſſary things is not condemned: and care is immoderate, when it hath any of theſe ſignes following, all which are euident ſignes of couetouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When a mans affections are ſo ſet vpon earthly things, that he is in loue with them, and placeth his felicitie in them: and therefore couetouſneſſe is called the loue of money, by a Periphraſis, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A ſecond ſigne of couerouſneſſe or immoderate care, is, when the minde is ſo taken vp about earthly things, that it can not attend to Gods word or his ordinances, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. 36. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31. and therefore the couetous cannot brooke Gods Sabbath, and deſires greatly to haue it ouer, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third ſigne is, when men will vſe ill meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe gaine, as when men will vſe lying, flatterie, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, vſurie, falſe weights and meaſures, or any other wayes of fraud and crueltie, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 16. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, when men giue ſparingly, or grudgingly, or ſlackly to charitable vſes.</p>
                     <p>I adde, that this care is vaine, and that in diuers reſpects: For firſt, he that loueth filuer ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſiluer; and beſides, after all his trauell, his earthly riches will periſh while he lookes on; or if they doe continue, he muſt not continue with them: for as he came forth of his mothers belly ſo ſhall he returne, naked, to goe as he came: he ſhall carry away nothing of all his labour; in all points as he came ſo ſhall he goe, and then what profit hath he that hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled for the winde? I ſay inclining the ſoule, to take in the loweſt degree of couetouſneſſe: for ſome haue their hearts and eyes, and hands, and tongues, all exerciſed in it, 2 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> 2. 14. Now others are only ſecretly drawne with it, and infected with the daily inclinations to it. I adde, for his owne priuate good, to note the end of couetouſneſſe: for if
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14246:157"/>
he ſought theſe things only for Gods glory, or the good of the Church, it were to be allowed. The laſt thing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, is, to the ſingular detriment of the ſoule; for many are the vile effects of couetouſneſſe: Firſt, it infatuates a man, and makes him without vnderſtanding, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 11. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 16. Secondly, it leaues a man in continuall danger to erre from the faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. Thirdly, it is the root of all euill, it drawes a man to many a ſinne, as we ſee here in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> and ſeldome is couetouſneſſe mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſome vile ſinne or other is ioyned with it. Fourthly, it angreth and vexeth God exceedingly, eſpecially when men are exerciſed in it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 17. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 13. beſides temporall iudgements, it cauſeth the damnation of the ſoule in hell, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5, 6. and therefore it ſhould not be ſo much as named amongſt Chriſtians, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 3. And as couetouſneſſe ought to be auoided by all men, ſo eſpecially by Miniſters: Couetouſneſſe in them is very abominable and pernicious; the Prophet cals ſuch Miniſters greedy dogs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 11.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this lamentable example of <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould make men abhorre the ſinne of betraying Chriſt. Many men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and yet commit it or the like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for Chriſt is betrayed many wayes, as when his truth and honour is denied before men, and men dare not ſhew their faith or puritie before others: ſo alſo when men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe true religion, and yet denie the power of it, and liue wickedly, and cauſe the aduerſaries of Chriſt to blaſpheme: this is to deliuer Chriſt to be accuſed, arraigned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of euill Iudges. Againe, when for reward a man will betray the truth by bearing falſe witneſſe; for to betray the truth, is to betray God who is Truth: and ſo when men violate brotherly loue, they betray God who is Loue. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alſo betray Chriſt (with <hi>Iudas)</hi> when they betray the flocks of Chriſt, and following their owne ambition or gaine, leaue their flocks to the Wolfe to be daily deuoured, and beſides ſtaruing them for want of fodder, or wholſome food. And ſuch <hi>Iudaſſes</hi> are they that will ſell Religion and their owne ſoules to get vnlawſull gaine, by lying, and

Againe, let all men take heed of groſſe ſinnes, or any extraordinary cauſes of corruption, for ſtrange puniſhments will follow ſuch workers of iniquitie. The fearfull iudgement of God vpon this poore creature, may affright the Sodomites &amp; Effeminate, the curſed Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Blaſphemers, the damned Drunkards and Atheiſts, the helliſh Traitors and Hereticks of our time.</p>
                     <p>Further, wee ſee that all godly Chriſtians in this world had need to looke well to themſelues: this world is full of treacherie, and falſhood, and diſſimulation: We ſee Chriſts familie was not without a <hi>Iudas</hi> in it; and there are few ſorts of men, or priuate families of any note, but there is one <hi>Iudas</hi> or other there. It is and will be ſtill true, A mans enemies are they of his owne houſe: Sometimes the very wife that lieth in a mans boſome proues falſe and treacherous, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a mans ſtate, ſometimes to a mans reputation, and oft times to his ſoule and Religion, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 5, 6, 7. The vſuall complements of the world proue but as <hi>Iudas</hi> his kiſſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſuch as ſuffer for the ingratitude or perfidiouſneſſe of others, ſhould comfort themſelues in this part of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt: they may the more patiently abide it, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was ſo vſed, and by ſuch a one as <hi>Iudas</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the Treaſon of <hi>Iudas.</hi> The apprehenſion of our Sauiour followes: and there we are to conſider two things; Firſt, What Chriſt did: Then, What was done to him.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, the Euangeliſts with great care record what our Sauiour did now that the time was come that he muſt be apprehended and brought to his laſt Paſſion: and ſo they ſhew how he prepared himſelfe for theſe ſufferings, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before he was to be apprehended: and ſo they report fiue things that he did.</p>
                     <p n="1">

1. He made a Feaſt to his Diſciples: he choſe to ſuffer at the time of the great Paſſeouer, that thereby he might confirme the hearts of the Diſciples, and ſhew how little he feared death, and how willing he was to obey the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Father, by being obedient to the death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He made his will and laſt Teſtament, and therein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a ſolemne aſſembly to bee yearely and oft in the yeare obſerued in commemoration of his Paſſion, by all that loue him to the worlds end: and further grants a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pardon of all ſinnes, to all that ſhall worthily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that ſolemnitie at all times till his comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and beſides, bequeathes vnto godly Chriſtians all the merits and benefits of his Paſſion, and all the good things contained in Gods Couenant made with the Church in Chriſt, and all this is comprehended in the inſtitution of his laſt Supper.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He tooke his leaue of his D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſciples, and made an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeech to them, recorded in the 13. 14. 15. and 16. Chapters of <hi>Iohn:</hi> which ſpeech may be all referred to three heads, Prediction, Exhortation, and Promiſe: By way of Prediction we ſhall finde in that ſpeech, that he tels them before hand of the things hee ſhall ſuffer, and the glory he ſhall haue after his ſufferings, and withall the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prouiſion he will make for them in heauen after his Aſcenſion, &amp; comforteth them againſt his departure from them. Secondly, by way of Exhortation he earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them by theſe his laſt words, to looke to their cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the world after he was gone, in theſe points eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; namely, that they ſhew forth the continuall proofe of their vnfained and feruent loue one to another, and that they arme themſelues with all patience, to ſuffer all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and troubles ſhould befall them from the Deuil, and the world: and chiefly that they abide in him, as the branch doth in the Vine, bearing good fruits to the glory and honour of his Name. Thirdly, By way of promiſe, he labours to fill them with comfort, by aſſuring to them three ſingular fauours: Firſt, that he would ſend them the Holy Ghoſt to be their Comforter all their daies. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14246:160"/>
that they ſhall at all times haue audience in heauen for all ſuits whatſoeuer, if they be made in his Name. And thirdly, that what troubles ſoeuer they ſhall haue in the world, yet in him they ſhall haue peace. Neither did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this ſpeech only for his Diſciples, but for all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all ages that ſhould mourne for his abſence.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing our Sauiour did for preparing him for his Paſſion, was the choice of the place where he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Paſſion: and therein two things are worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: <hi>viz.</hi> The kinde of place he chooſeth, and his great willingneſſe to ſuffer for vs. The place he choſe was a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: and that he did of purpoſe, for as the firſt ſin was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a Garden, ſo he is pleaſed to offer himſelfe to ſuffer the firſt part of his great Paſſion in a Garden. Thus is our bleſſed Sauiour pleaſed by his obedience in a Garden, to make ſatisfaction of the ſin of Rebellion committed by our firſt Parents in Paradiſe: The next is the demonſtration of our Sauiours willingneſſe to ſuffer for vs, which hee ſhewes plainly in chooſing the place: for firſt it would be hard for the Prieſts to apprehend him in the Citie, becauſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore hee gets out of the Citie to a place that was neare. Againe, the Euangeliſts note that he went to a place he was accuſtomed to goe to, that ſo it might not be difficult to finde him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 39. And to make it out of all doubt, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed him knew the place. And it is profitable for vs to know that our Sauiour did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer willingly, becauſe that addes to the price of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for vnleſſe his Paſſion had beene voluntary, there had not beene a iuſt ſatisfaction for our ſinnes to Gods Iuſtice: And beſides, that circumſtance ſhould the more ſtirre vp our hearts to admire the greatneſſe of his loue to vs. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a moſt liuely preſident to teach vs with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to take vp our croſſe and follow him, that hath ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffered ſuch grieuous things for vs.</p>
                     <p>The fifth thing our Sauiour did in his preparation, was the offering vp of prayer to God before hee entered vpon his Paſſion. Now the prayers Chriſt made, were partly for the Church, and partly for himſelfe: The prayer for the Church,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14246:160"/>
which he made immediatly before his apprehenſion, is at large recorded in the 17. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which prayer he made as the High Prieſt; whoſe office was two-fold, to make interceſſion for the people, and to make ſatisfaction and atonement for their ſinnes. And though the interceſſion of Chriſt be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed in heauen as hee ſitteth at the right hand of God, yet that we might know what he ſaith for vs in heauen, he conceiues that moſt ſacred frame of Interceſſion, which is there recorded for our euerlaſting conſolation. Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that prayer of our Sauiour, many things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For whom he prayes and makes interceſſion; and ſo hee expreſly ſaith, That he did not pray for the world, but for the Elect, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Why he made that prayer on earth, and did not reſerue it till he came to heauen? And to that he anſwereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. that hee ſpake thoſe things on earth, that his ioy might be fulfilled in vs, for it muſt needs bee an vnſpeakable comfort to vs to know what Chriſt prayes for in heauen to obtaine for vs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What things he aſſumes, as taken for granted, before hee puts vp his petitions to God: and ſo hee reckons vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God diuers admirable priuiledges which belong to the godly, which God did neuer deny, but alwaies gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to belong to them: and theſe were,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God had giuen Chriſt full power to beſtow eternall life vpon the godly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the godly were Gods owne people, and that he had beſtowed them all vpon Chriſt to redeeme them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Chriſt is glorified in them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. meaning that God had giuen him leaue to make himſelfe glorious by aduancing them, and that he did account himſelfe to haue no glory on earth, but what he had in and from them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That he did ſanctifie himſelfe for them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. that is, that God was to account all his merits to belong to them, and that all he endured when he was ſet apart as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was for their ſakes.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:14246:161"/>
5. That all he was to pray for, did belong to all beleeuers as well as to the Apoſtles, euen to all that did or ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to the worlds end, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That by the Goſpell Chriſt was to make all the godly feele, that God loued them, as well as he loued him, <hi>verſe</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What he did begge of his Father for vs: and ſo we ſhall finde that hee hath fitted his ſuits to our deſires. For looke what in this world the godly moſt deſire to be freed from or to haue, that he hath asked, namely,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God would vndertake to keepe vs ſo as we might not any of vs be loſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God would preſerue and keepe vs from euill, both the euill of ſinne, and the euill of danger that might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vs, <hi>verſe</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That God would ſanctifie vs by the power of his word, and ſo furniſh vs with all gifts needfull to a holy life, <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That we may be admitted into fellowſhip and indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable vnion with the bleſſed Trinitie, and amongſt our ſelues, that in a ſort wee might bee ioyned to God as Chriſt was, <hi>verſe</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That God would ſo perfect this holy vnion in them, that he might make the very world to know that God loued them, as well as he loued Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That God would in his due time bring them all to him in heauen, that they may for euer behold his glory there, <hi>verſe</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are maruellous things, and ſhould wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vs and comfort vs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By what arguments our Sauiour vrgeth theſe pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itions: for his very reaſons doe ſhew what care he had of vs, and how he pities vs, and that he ſtands vpon our right. And ſo we ſhall finde that hee vſed foure Reaſons why God ſhould grant all he asked for them. The firſt was becauſe we are Gods: <hi>thine they are, verſ.</hi> 9, 10. and therefore God ſhould defend vs in that we are his owne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his charge and care. The ſecond was, becauſe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14246:161"/>
the world hates vs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. we are likely to be ſo ill vſed in the world, that God muſt needs looke to vs, to protect, and prouide for vs. The third was becauſe our Sauiour himſelfe ſhould be now no more in this world to looke to vs in his owne perſon, and therefore hee praies God to looke to vs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. The laſt was becauſe hee had ſanctified himſelfe for our ſakes, and therefore pleads his owne merits for vs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is profitable for vs to marke the intimation our Sauiour giues all along his prayer, by which he lets fall a deſcription of what we muſt be if we would haue our part in his Interceſſion. For in the 20. verſe wee may ſee it plaine, we muſt be beleeuers, and verſes 6, 7, 8. with 26. We may ſee further that we muſt be ſuch as will receiue the words which God gaue to Chriſt to deliuer to vs, &amp; by them will know Gods name, and ſuch as will keepe the word as the greateſt treaſure in the world. They that heare not Chriſts preaching on Earth, ſhall not haue benefit by Chriſts praying in Heauen. Nor will hearing ſerue turne, but there muſt be knowledge and beleeuing, and keeping of the word as a treaſure, and for practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the prayers our Sauiour made for the Church.</p>
                     <p>The prayers he made for himſelfe, concerne either his Glory in Heauen, or his Paſſion on Earth. His prayer for his Glory in Heauen is recorded, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 6. and in that prayer our Sauiour firſt layes downe the ſubſtance of his requeſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Secondly, hee vrgeth it with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. Thirdly, hee explaines his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the manner how he would haue his petitions gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The ſubſtance of his ſuit is, that God would glorifie his Sonne. The Reaſons are: Firſt, becauſe God is his Father and he his Sonne, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Secondly, becauſe if God glorifie him, hee will glorifie God againe, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. Thirdly, becauſe God had giuen him power before to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow glory vpon others, and therefore much more he ſhould haue it himſelfe, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3. Fourthly, becauſe hee had glorified God on earth, and ſhould within a little time fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all his hard taske, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. Now the manner how

hee would be glorified, was, by receiuing the ſame glory againe, which hee had with the Father before the world was; which referred to his humane Nature, muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his exaltation aboue all things that are made in heauen or earth, and ſo to be worſhipped with the diuine Nature. And as it is referred to the diuine Nature, it muſt bee vnderſtood of manifeſtation to the world, that as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies he as ſecond Perſon had glory equall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that God would let it be knowne to be ſo through the world, which was accompliſhed after his reſurrection, when the Diuinitie of Chriſt was publiſhed to all Nations.</p>
                     <p>Thus of his prayer for his Glorification. The prayer that concernes his Paſſion was made in the Garden a little before his enemies came to apprehend him. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that prayer diuers things may be obſerued.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The company was with him, or neere to him at the time of his prayer, and ſo the Text notes that he ſingled out of all the Diſciples three of them whom he loued moſt, viz. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames.</hi> Now this company hee tooke for two Reaſons: Firſt, that they might bee witneſſes of this part of his Paſſion. Secondly, he choſe them to be by him, as ſuch as to whom he could more freely diſcouer himſelfe: and in this our Sauiour did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that which is ſetled in the natures almoſt of all men, and ſo of all godly men, in the buſineſſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. There be ſome perſons before whom a man would more willingly pray or preach or doe any dutie; and yet others haue no iuſt cauſe to take exceptions as if they were neglected, or it was partialitie, for we ſee here Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did ſingle out theſe men, and leaue the reſt of the Diſciples further off, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 36, 37. and withall from hence we may learne that the very preſence of ſuch as we loue, doth vs good when we are in diſtreſſe, though they ſhould ſay nothing to vs; as here our Sauiour giues theſe Diſciples a great charge to tarry by him, and yet they ſay not a word to him, no not when he makes his moane, that his heart was heauy to the very death: yea it ſeemes our Sauiour was not willing to be without them, though they
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14246:162"/>
ſlept by him, and ſeemed to take little notice of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. Further, theſe three were they that had ſeene his Transfiguration on the Mount, and therefore are now the fitteſt to behold this great abaſement, without wauering in the faith of his Diuinitie, becauſe they had ſeene him glorious, whom now they are to behold ſo infirme.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The geſture he vſed in prayer, <hi>viz. He felt on his face and praied.</hi> Euen the more grieuous the diſtreſſe was vpon him, the more humbly did he demeane himſelfe towards God: When his heart was ſo heauy, nothing but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God would helpe him; for he had made his moane to the Diſciples, and that eaſed him not. Nor doth hee reſt in that, ſimply to pray, but his Agonie being great, hee applies himſelfe to that geſture might beſt fit the greatneſſe of his diſtreſſe, to teach vs what we ſhould doe, when our hearts are heauy, and how we ſhould ſtriue to inlarge our affections, and ſuit our whole behauiour in Gods preſence according to his hand vpon vs, or the great need we haue of his helpe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What befell him when he went to pray, <hi>viz.</hi> a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous Agonie in ſoule, which with ſuch ſpeed increaſed vpon him, that he cried out to his Diſciples, that his ſoule was euery way compaſſed about with ſorrow euen vnto the death, and he ſweat in that Anguiſh very bloud, as is noted by the Euangeliſt, and he was maruellouſly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and afraid. Now if any aske, what made our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 38.</note> fall into this perplexitie? I anſwer, that wee muſt not thinke, that it was the feare of bodily death that thus affrighted our Sauiour, ſeeing we know that the Martyrs that were infirme men, did yet embrace death without theſe Agonies: though by the way we muſt remember, that it is a thouſand times more eaſie to ſuffer the death of a Martyr, than for Chriſt to ſuffer bare death of any kinde, becauſe Martyrs in death are freed from the guilt of all their ſinnes, whereas Chriſt in death, as our ſurety, ſtands charged with ſinne: but it was not the feare of death thus troubled our Sauiour; he had many other more dreadfull things to thinke of: As firſt, the tyrannie
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14246:163"/>
of Sinne, Death, and Sathan, that had preuailed ouer mankinde. Secondly, the great ingratitude of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of mankinde, who would not regard redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion though made in his bloud. Thirdly, the diſperſion of his Diſciples, and the ſcandall that euen they would take at his death. Fourthly, the ruine would come vpon the Iewiſh Nation by making themſelues guilty of his bloud. Fifthly and eſpecially, the ſenſe of the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wrath of God againſt the ſinnes of the world, which he muſt endure, and did begin to feele, for our ſakes, as being our ſurety. It was not death then ſimply that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but death ioyned with that powring out of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wrath of God vpon his ſoule: this bred that incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deadly ſadneſſe, and paine, and inward feare in our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>Now this mournfull conſideration of his grieuous feare and agonie, may ſerue vnto vs for great conſolation, and that in diuers reſpects: For firſt herein we may ſee his loue to vs, that can be content to take vpon him our infirmities, euen thoſe that are moſt troubleſome, ſuch as this dreadfull feare and perplexitie was: he was here truly transfigured: for as on the Mount by transfiguration hee ſhewed what glory he ſhould haue in heauen, ſo in the Garden, by this transfiguration he ſhewes what weaknes cleaues to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on earth: only we muſt ſtill remember, that he tooke vpon him only vnblameable infirmities; for in this he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not. If any aske how could ſuch vnſpeakable feare and ſadneſſe be without ſinne, ſeeing the affections were ſo violently moued and troubled? I anſwer, that the perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was in our Sauiours heart, was like to cleane water in a cleane glaſſe; if it be ſhaked neuer ſo violently, yet it is cleane ſtill, becauſe there is no mud in the bottome. But on the other ſide, if cleane water be put into a cleane glaſſe, and mud withall be ſetled in the bottome, then the leaſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that is makes it foule: and ſo it is with vs, there is ſinne in almoſt all perturbations that ariſe in our hearts, becauſe euery ſhaking of our hearts ſtirs vp ſome corruption that is in our nature; but it was not ſo with Chriſt. Againe, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14246:163"/>
Chriſtians may take ſome comfort from hence, to ſee that their Sauiour was afraid as well as they. His Agonie may comfort them againſt their puſillanimitie; and further ſuch as finde ſtrange accidents in prayer, and are ſuddenly oppreſſed with feares and doubts or terrors, may profitably remember what befell their Sauiour when he went to pray. Laſtly, ſuch as are afflicted in conſcience vnder the ſenſe of Gods wrath, may wonderfully from hence be releeued: Firſt, by conſidering that Chriſt himſelfe did feele the ſame, or much greater ſorrowes than they doe, and therefore doth pitie them, and will ſuocour them. Secondly, by conſidering that Chriſt hath borne in his owne ſoule the brunt of Gods diſpleaſure for ſinne, and therefore they ſhould not be ſo diſmayed, but behold his ſoule as made a ſacrifice for their ſinnes. And thus of his Agonie. There was yet another great diſcouragement befell him in his prayer, and that was the maruellous ſenſleſneſſe, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and want of compaſſion in his Diſciples, who were ſo farre from comforting him, or mourning with him, that they could not watch with him one houre: That <hi>Peter</hi> that a little before ſaid, If all men were offended in him, yet he would neuer be offended, yea he was ready to die for him, yet now he doth not reſiſt his very ſleepe, but neglects his Sauiour in his greateſt diſtreſſe. And from this obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may gather diuers Vſes. For hereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the whole burden of ſatisfaction lies vpon Chriſt only: Here is no bodie to helpe him to pay one farthing, nor ſo much as pitie him, or incourage him: when our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is in paying, the great Apoſtles are a ſleeping. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, men in miſery muſt learne to truſt vpon God only, for there are none ſo neare or deare to vs, but in times of diſtreſſe may come farre ſhort of that compaſſion or ſuccour which we may expect from them: and if any ſuch thing befall vs in our paines or other miſeries, we muſt labour to comfort our ſelues with this example of the like caſe of our Sauiour. Moreouer, men that are giuen to bodily ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in time of Gods ſeruice ſhould be warned from hence: Euen ſuch a bodily infirmitie, if it be nouriſhed, may bring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14246:164"/>
vs into fearefull temptations, and makes vs guilty of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous offence againſt God and Chriſt; as is imported by our Sauiours milde reproofe of the ſleepie Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The forme of prayer hee vſed, and that was, <hi>Abba</hi> father, let this cup paſſe from me if it be poſſible; yet not my will but thy will bee done, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 36. In which forme we may note three things: Firſt, the Titles he giues to God. Secondly, the ſubſtance of his ſuit to God. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the clauſes limiting his petition.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Titles are recorded by Saint <hi>Marke:</hi> and wee ſhall finde them giuen to God in three places of the new Teſtament: <hi>viz.</hi> in this prayer of Chriſts, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. and <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 7. The tearme <hi>Abba,</hi> is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriacke</hi> word: and the other word <hi>Pater,</hi> is both a <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> word: Now in that Chriſt calling vpon his Father giues him his title in diuers languages, it is thought, that thereby Chriſt would intimate that he was the God of both Iewes &amp; Gentiles, and in as much as the time drew on in which the partition wall was to be broken downe, and God was to bee beleeued on, and called vpon by both ſorts of people, Chriſt himſelfe firſt beginnes to treat with God in both langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And it may well be, that being now in infinite torment he would intimate by theſe tearmes, that he ſuffered them both for Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for the ſubſtance of the petition, a great doubt may ariſe in a mans mind how this could be in Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, or contradiction to himſelfe. He that had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his death, and profeſſed ſo often to bee willing to die, and was ſent into the world for this purpoſe, and if he died not all the Elect were vndone: how can it bee that now hee prayes that if it be poſſible he may not die? I anſwer this obiection two wayes: firſt, that he doth not expreſly pray againſt his death, but his words may be vnderſtood as well (as I conceiue) of the Agonie he was in, in his ſoule: and ſo what inconuenience can follow, if we grant that hee deſired of God that it might paſſe from him, or bee quickly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if it were poſſible and might ſtand with Gods will: there
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14246:164"/>
was no neceſſity that his Agonie ſhould abide ſtill vpon him. Secondly, if it be vnderſtood of his death, yet all that might bee without ſinne, becauſe they are the words of Chriſt, now aſtoniſhed and amazed, his vnderſtanding and memory by the violence of the paine being interrupted in their working for a ſhort time. As a Clocke may be perfect, and yet ſtand by reaſon of ſome outward cauſe, as a mans hand, or the weather, or the like: ſo the frame of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours affections and deſires was moſt perfect, though by the violence of the hand of God vpon him for a time, his nature remembred only the preſeruation of her ſelfe. From this frailty of our Sauiour ſhewed in the matter of his petition, weake Chriſtians may gather much comfort, and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their weakneſſe and frailties in prayer ſhall be paſſed by of God and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The clauſes limiting his petition are two. Frſt, if it bee poſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, not my will but thy will be done: which as they ſhewed the holineſſe of Chriſt, in deſiring to auoid the requeſting of abſurd &amp; contrary things, and to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe &amp; his deſires to Gods will notwithſtanding the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he was in: ſo it is a notable example to teach vs what to do in all diſtreſſes, yea the bittereſt croſſes can befall vs, euen to ſtriue vehemently to beare Gods ſharpeſt ſtroakes, with all humble ſubmiſſion to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the fourth point in his prayer.</p>
                     <p>The fift point, is the iſſue and euent of his prayer, and that is reported partly by the Euangeliſt, and partly by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> The Euangeliſt ſaith that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell came from heauen and comforted him in his Agonie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 43. which may teach vs to know, that when God will not preſently deliuer vs from the croſſe, yet he is able to comfort vs vnder the croſſe: and if ordinary meanes faile, he can ſupplywith extraordinary: If men on earth will not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vs, he can ſend his Angels from heauen to releeue vs. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> further tels vs, euen that this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was heard of God as he reports, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. Now from hence ariſeth another great ſcruple, and that is how it can be ſaid this prayer was heard, ſeeing hee was not deliuered,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14246:165"/>
but did ſuffer death. I anſwer, if you vnderſtand his prayer only of the ſpeedy taking off of Gods hand, then there is no difficultie or doubt: and if it bee vnderſtood of death, wee muſt fly to a diſtinction, which is thus: God heareth pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er two wayes, the one when he directly grants what we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aske, the other when he giues vs ſo much of our ſuit as is good for vs, and what he denies, recompenceth in ſome other thing which is anſwerable thereunto, and more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs. So he dealt with Chriſt here, though he did not free him from death, yet he did free him from the hurt of death, ſo as he was able to beare it, and was deliuered from it in due time, which was all that which the nature of Chriſt in diſtreſſe in effect ſought, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſeruation of it ſelfe: and this may bee very vſefull for vs to obſerue: God may ſeeme to deny vs many things, which yet he grants, and our weakeſt prayers may get vs ſome bleſſing, though wee feele it not for the preſent: and if God change with vs, and giue vs that which is better for vs than that which we aske, he doth vs no wrong. In hearing prayer God conſiders not ſo much the pleaſing of our wills, as the furthering of our Saluation. And therefore wee muſt take heed we grow not froward, or diſcouraged, and iudge that God heareth vs not, becauſe he lets vs pray often, and yet according to the letter of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we ſee not that we are heard: let this example of Chriſt that prayed thrice, and the like of <hi>Paul</hi> praying thrice againſt the temptation of the Deuill, ſtay our heart, and teach vs as to get skill and reſolution to pray, ſo to ſeeke the skill of Gods different manner of hearing of prayer. Thus of what Chriſt did: now followes to conſider what was done to him, and that both by the Iewes, and by his owne Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the behauiour of the Iewes in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, I obſerue two things: Firſt, how they came to Chriſt, and met him. Secondly, how they laid hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and bound him and led him away.</p>
                     <p>About their comming to Chriſt, three things would be noted: 1. Who came: 2. How they came furniſhed: 3. What communication paſſed betweene Chriſt and them, when they were come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:14246:165"/>
For the firſt: The perſons that came to Chriſt, were the Iewes and <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſouldiers and feruants, all ſent from the High Prieſts and Phariſies, and Elders of the people, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 47. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 3. And they were a great multitude of them. So naturall is the hatred that the men of the world beare to Chriſt, that it is eaſie to get men enow to beare armes againſt Chriſt, or to doe hurt to Religion, or religious perſons: but wee ſee in our times what a wonderfull hard thing it is to get men or money to doe any ſeruice againſt <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the ſecond: <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Iewes came thus furniſhed; They firſt get a band of men, (which being not in the power of the Prieſts) they muſt needs haue them, as borrowed from <hi>Pilate:</hi> And with this Band they ſend their owne officers, and all were furniſhed with weapons, ſwords, and ſtaues: and the Text notes that they were a great multitude of them. Now what was all this to doe? It was to take Chriſt, Chriſt I ſay, that was knowne to be ſo peaceable a Man, and ſo quiet, as no man came neere him for meekeneſſe and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and beſides, he was vſually in the Temple, and ſo eaſie to be taken at any time, or in any place, if they will needs lay violent hands vpon him. But obſerue two memorable things: Firſt, the effect of an ill conſcience, in <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Prieſts: they knowing the cauſe to be ſo naught, ſuffer ſuch a conflict with an armie of feares in their owne hearts, that fearing leſt both God and men ſhould be againſt them, they raiſe an armie of men, for the effecting of their wicked purpoſe: Oh the force of conſcience! What a fearefull baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it to be wicked, or to ſet vpon wicked purpoſes? It is a very troubleſome and chargeable thing, to be engaged for the effecting of miſchieuous deuices. Secondly, note how iuſt God is: theſe ſinfull men haue drawne their ſwords and bent their bowes againſt the Iuſt one: How deſeruedly therefore afterwards did God make the ſword enter into their owne breſts. Theſe men that entertaine but one Band of <hi>Romans</hi> againſt their Lord and King, euen Chriſt, ſhall afterwards receiue into their owne bowels and boſomes the ſwords of the whole armie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to reuenge their
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14246:166"/>
rebellion, not againſt them, but againſt Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now for the communication that paſſed betweene Chriſt and the Iewes, the ſtorie of it is recorded, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6. And in the whole ſtory I note three things: Firſt, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt was to be apprehended. Secondly, how miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly he ſhewed his diuine power vpon his enemies. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how carefully he prouides for his Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>His willingneſſe to ſuffer, appeares by thoſe words, that affirme that he knowing all things ſhould come to him, went forth, and as it were offered himſelfe, by asking, <hi>Whom ſeeke yee,</hi> and by anſwering that it was He, when they name him. Euen the more he feared in the Garden at prayer, the more he ſtriues to ſhew vndauntedneſſe now; yea to ſhew how great difference there is between affliction of ſpirit, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſtreſſes: when the fit of the diſtreſſe of his Soule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods wrath for our ſinne, is for a while intermitted, hee goeth out to ſeeke his Aduerſaries, that ſought him, as being moſt willing to take vp a croſſe, hee accounted ſo eaſie in compariſon of what he had felt.</p>
                     <p>The demonſtration of his diuine power vpon his enemies he thus ſhewed. When he had anſwered that he was that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth,</hi> whom they ſought, then all went backward and fell to the ground, ſuch amazement fell vpon the hearts of the ſtouteſt of them. They ſought the <hi>Man Ieſus,</hi> but that God whoſe Name was <hi>I am,</hi> out of the temple of his body giues that anſwer, <hi>I am he,</hi> with ſuch impreſſions of his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie as ſtrikes them to the ground like dead men. And this he did for diuers reaſons: Firſt, to preſerue the vndoubted teſtimony of his Diuinitie. He that was ſhortly to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a Lambe, now warres like a Lion for a ſeaſon, that at leaſt the Chriſtian world might know, that it was God that did ſuffer for our ſinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. Secondly, hereby his enemies are conuicted, and left without excuſe, that will lay hands on him iniuriouſly, that had firſt laid hands on them ſo iuſtly, and made them know how able hee was to binde them ouer to eternall perdition. Oh how incorrigible is the heart of a wicked man! Here may a man behold men ſmitten to the ground by the hand of God, and yet ſee them riſe vp
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14246:166"/>
againe as deſperately bent as before: Yea, here ſtood with theſe men, and among them fell, <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Apoſtle, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Chriſt, and yet riſeth againe ſtill a Deuill, a Traitor, and a Standard-bearer of the Iewes malice, who hauing the Deuill in his breſt, doth moſt impudently giue the ſigne of peace with his mouth. Thirdly, hereby he giues euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to all the world, of the terror of his voice againſt wicked men at the laſt day. Hee that can fright them thus, when he is about to die, being yet in the forme of a ſeruant on earth; how will he be found then, when he comes in his Kingdome to iudge them from heauen, and ſhall ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the forme of God, as well as Man? What tongue of man can expreſſe the terror of that voice, at that day, <hi>Goe yee curſed into euerlaſting fire prepared for the Deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> And impenitent men may gheſſe at this, by the power they haue felt in the voice of Chriſt in the preaching of the Goſpell. Another demonſtration of his diuine power may it be reckoned, that ſuch as knew him ſhould looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and not know him, when hee asked them, <hi>Whom ſeeke yee;</hi> they doe not anſwer, thee, but <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth,</hi> yet <hi>Iudas</hi> was amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, his care of the ſafetie of his Diſciples he ſhewed two waies: Firſt, by going out alone to meet his Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, leſt in the tumult his Diſciples ſhould be ſeazed vpon. Secondly, by ſpeaking to the armed men to take him, and let them depart without in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ury. Now the reaſon why he was ſo carefull of them, was (as the Euangeliſt notes) that the word of Ieſus might be fulfilled which he ſpake in his prayer to his Father, <hi>Of thoſe which thou haſt giuen me, I haue not loſt one:</hi> And loſt they had beene (in our ſenſe) if they had not beene preſerued to do the worke they were elected to, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to be witneſſes of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world; which worke might haue beene hindered by their apprehenſion. Againe, note how our Sauiour carries himſelfe towards them: Hee ſpeakes to them as their Lord and King, and therefore ſaith, <hi>Let theſe depart,</hi> which are words of authoritie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to let the Apoſtles go; which thing is the more cleare, becauſe they did let them go accordingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="350" facs="tcp:14246:167"/>
And thus of their comming to Chriſt: The taking of him, and binding of him, and leading him away followes, the ſtory of it we finde in all the Euangeliſts. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he ſuffered theſe things are to be conſidered. He that giues libertie to Captiues, was taken himſelfe, that hee might deliuer vs from captiuity vnder Satan, by whom wee were detained, and that his captiuitie might comfort the Martyrs that ſuffer for the Teſtimony of Ieſus, and might ſanctifie their reſtraints, and ſo he was bound, that we might be freeed from the bonds of our ſins, and of the Deuill, and euill examples and cuſtomes of the world in which we were fettered, and that he might comfort ſuch as are in bonds for righteouſneſſe ſake. He was vnciuilly led out of the Garden, that ſo he might lead vs into the heauenly Paradiſe, out of which we were caſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus of what the Iewes did to him. What was done by his Diſciples is briefly noted, and that was, that they all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him and fled: ſo as he was forſaken on all hands. And he ſuffered this deſertion for diuers reaſons. Firſt, that ſo no iot of our redemption, no not the leaſt parcell of it, might be aſcribed to any other than to one Ieſus alone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that hereby he might ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for vs, that had forſaken God, and fell away from him by our ſins. Thirdly, that this example might ſomewhat eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſuch as are left and forſaken by their friends, in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. Fourthly, the Scripture was herein fulfilled, <hi>Smite the ſhepherd and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered:</hi> and Chriſts words came to paſſe, <hi>All of you this night ſhall be offended in mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I omit here the reſiſtance made by the Diſciples, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Peter,</hi> and the diſcourſe and behauiour of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vpon it, becauſe that was no part of Chriſts Paſſion, though it were ſomething that fell out in the ſtorie.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of Chriſts Apprehenſion, and ſo of the things that went before his Arraignment.</p>
                     <p>The things he ſuffered at his Arraignment follow: and theſe may be referred to two heads. The one is the things he ſuffered (when he was brought bound before the Iudges or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14246:167"/>
Rulers) in the night, when things were carried tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and without any order. The other containes the things he ſuffered when they would proceed iudicially with him, and that was in the day time.</p>
                     <p>In the night he ſuffered three things. Firſt, he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vp and downe bound from one High Prieſt to another. Secondly, he was three times denied by <hi>Peter</hi> his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and Diſciple. Thirdly, he was ill intreated by the men that kept him bound. And that theſe things fell all out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſolemne Councell of the High Prieſts, and in the night, appeares by Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> narration of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. though the other Euangeliſts obſerue not the order ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt: The Captaine of the band, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Officers of the Iewes, carried Chriſt firſt to <hi>Annas</hi> that was father in law to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and then to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. In which dealing two things may be noted. Firſt, the glory theſe wretched men take in ſhewing their Priſoner one to another: How glad they are to ſee Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus bound, and to know but that their deuices proſper ſo farre; now was the time that the world reioyced, and the Diſciples wept, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 20. Secondly, it ſeemes <hi>Caiaphas</hi> playes the Politician, for ſince the time he had beene author of that counſell, that one muſt die for the people, all the worke is directed to him. If great men once become authors of miſchiefe and ill counſell, they know not how farre they may be lead on in wickedneſſe: but <hi>Caiaphas</hi> perceiuing the worke muſt light vpon him, ſubtilly giues order (as is likely) that he ſhould firſt be carried to <hi>Annas,</hi> that ſo hee might either decline the enuy of the people, or haue him partner in it.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond: The ſtorie of <hi>Peters</hi> deniall is at large ſet downe by the Euangeliſts, and therein three things are noted; the occaſions of his fall, the manner of it, and the euent. The occaſions are obſerued by the Euangeliſts to be foure: or, by foure ſteps and degrees he is brought into the ſnare of this temptation. For firſt he followed Chriſt afarre off, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 58. That he followed him, it was his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14246:168"/>
and deuotion; but that he followed him afarre off, it was his feare: and in this feare is laid the firſt ground of his fall. To expoſe himſelfe to danger, when he felt his heart afraid of it, eſpecially when there was no neceſſary cauſe to venture himſelfe vpon it, was a ſtrong occaſion to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Secondly, a Diſciple that was knowne to the High Prieſts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent in with Ieſus into the Palace, ſpake to him that kept the doore, and ſo got <hi>Peter</hi> in, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 15, 16. and this was a ſecond ſtep to his temptation. The courteſie of his friend proues a ſnare to him, and the rather becauſe he went in out of curioſitie, and not out of any ſetled reaſon or cauſe to glorifie God: for Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith he went in but to ſee the end, that is, to obſerue what would become of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 58. Thirdly, he ſate and warmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the High Prieſts fire, with the ſeruants of the High Prieſts, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 18. He that was for a long time accuſtomed to the holy conuerſation of Chriſt, and his fellow Diſciples, where he was accuſtomed to goodneſſe in words and deeds, now comes into the company of the vngodly without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whoſe tongues were bent to miſchiefe, and their throat an open ſepulchre, and here as a man comming ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new world, receiues ſtrong impreſſions of euill, his feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart being not able to caſt vp the poiſon hee receiued from their Societie: and this was the third degree or ſtep to his fall. Fourthly, he was examined and accuſed to be one of Chriſts followers, and ſo charged in that part in which he was weakeſt: For firſt, a Damoſell that kept the doore, asked him whether he was not one of them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 19. and then the ſeruants by the fire-ſide charge him againe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering belike from his behauiour that hee was not one of their ſide, in that he did not ioyne with them to diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, and therefore it was likely that he was Chriſts Diſciple, and they told him his ſpeech bewrayed him, hee ſpake like a <hi>Galilaean.</hi> Then in the third place, a kinſman to <hi>Malchus,</hi> whoſe eare he cut off, charged him that hee ſaw him in the Garden, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 26. The Deuill that deſired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſift him, and to increaſe his miſery, plies him with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, and all ſuddenly till his ſinne was brought to the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14246:168"/>
height. Thus of the occaſions of his fall. The manner of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: &amp; ſo the Euangeliſts ſhew, that firſt he denied Chriſt, ſaying that he knew him not. Then he denied him again with an oath: Then thirdly, he began to curſe &amp; ſweare, ſaying, he knew not the man: Oh <hi>Peter</hi> knoweſt not thou the man, that before hadſt confeſſed him to be God? The euent was his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; &amp; there is obſerued the means of it, and the maner of it. The means leſſe principal, was the crowing of the Cock, according to the prophecie of his Sauiour. The principall was, that Chriſt looked backe vpon him, and then <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred Chriſts words, which preſently brake his heart, <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> 22. 61. The manner of his repentance was, that he went out of that wicked place, and wept bitterly. He forſakes the needleſſe ſociety of the wicked, and with much ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailes his great ſinne. Thus of the Story.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why our Sauiour ſuffered this kinde of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to be denied thus of his owne ſeruant, was, that ſo he might ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for vs, that had denied God in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> becauſe we had denied God, he was content to be denied by his owne ſeruant.</p>
                     <p>There may be many vſes made of this lamentable Story of <hi>Peters</hi> fall: 1. For firſt, we may all be warned by his fall, to take heed of the occaſions that led him into this ſinne; and ſo eſpecially to take heed of ſecurity and truſt in our owne ſtrength. This is the man that a little before ſaid he would not deny him, though he ſhould die with him. Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall: No man is ſtrong by his owne might, and therefore let vs work out our ſaluation with feare and trembling, and know that we are kept onely by Gods power and true faith in him. Againe, we ſee how pernitious a thing it is to fall ſuddenly into carnall company, without a Calling: It is hard to touch Pitch, and not be defiled, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in euill times when men are heated with malice, we ſhould altogether auoid their preſence, if it be poſſible: The High Prieſts fire vndid <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Wicked men muſt take heed of abuſing ſuch examples as this, by gathering from thence any libertie to ſinne: think not to ſinne ſecurely, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned ſo grieuouſly:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14246:169"/>
Remember two things, if thou take liberty to ſinne, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſo ſinned. Firſt, that <hi>Peters</hi> ſinne brought bitter griefe to his heart: <hi>He went out and wept bitterly,</hi> ſaith the Text: If thou wouldeſt as well conſider the ſorrowes Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants brought vpon themſelues for their ſinnes, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their offence, thou wouldſt finde ſmall prouocation from ſuch wofull preſidents. Againe, it is true that <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned and yet was ſaued, and yet it is as true that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and was damned, and yet was an Apoſtle of Chriſt as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We may hence learne what is neceſſarie to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, to get out from the ſociety of wicked men: a man cannot repent, and yet remaine ſtill by the High-Prieſts fire. Secondly, to bewaile our ſinnes by true godly ſorrow in ſecret: without mourning for ſin, there can be no true repentance for ſinne; and therefore the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of our ſoule for our ſinnes is peremptorily required, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. And <hi>the ſacrifices of God are a broken and contrite heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Here are diuers things worthy the marking about the meanes of a mans conuerſion: For firſt hence we may learne, that the Doctrine a man heares, though it doe not preſently worke vpon him, yet the remembrance of it in after-times may be very powerfull to turne a mans heart to God: as here <hi>Peter</hi> is turned by remembring what <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaid vnto him, though when he ſaid it, <hi>Peter</hi> made no good vſe of it. Againe, wee may gather hence, that God can awaken the conſcience of a man by ſtrange operations, by very ſimple and vnlikely meanes; as here the conſcience of <hi>Peter</hi> is excited by the crowing of a Cocke; but eſpecially the heart of <hi>Peter</hi> is diſſolued, and grownd almoſt to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with the very lookes of Chriſt: <hi>Ieſus looked backe vpon him, and he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Here is alſo matter of Conſolation: for penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may bence gather, that great offences may be forgiuen, if they be truly humbled: If we weepe for our ſinnes as <hi>Peter</hi> did, we may be receiued to fauour as <hi>Peter</hi> was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our Sauiour that foretold his fall, annexeth two admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14246:169"/>
conſolations: Firſt, that he prayeth for the godly that their faith ſhould not faile, though they fall grieuouſly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that how far ſoeuer the Deuill preuailes, yet all his temptations ſhall be but like a winnowing: God can tell how to draw light out of darkneſſe, and to waſte the maine heape of corruption, euen from his working vpon mens hearts through the ſight of their falls into ſome particular corruptions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the example of the falls of godly men ſhould teach vs to vſe all meanes to ſtrengthen one another, that wee may be vpheld from falling; eſpecially ſuch as haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and are recouered, ſhould ſtriue by all meanes to warne others, and to helpe by all waies they can to preſerue others, <hi>When thou art conuerted ſtrengthen thy brethren,</hi> ſaid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour to <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22. 32.</p>
                     <p>Thus he was denied by <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He was ill intreated by them that kept him bound: for as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſhewes chapter 22. they mocked him and ſmote him, and when they had blindfolded him, they ſtroke him on the face, and asked him, ſaying, <hi>Prophecie vnto vs, who it is that ſmote thee. And many other things blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſpake they againſt him.</hi> Here we may behold a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſpectacle, of that diſorder into which wretched men fall, when they giue the reynes to their wicked malice, and thinke they may doe it without puniſhment. What wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indignities are theſe, theſe baſe <hi>Iewes</hi> offer to our bleſſed Sauiour? They blindfold and buffet that face, which their godly Forefathers and Prophets ſo longed to behold, euen that face that was fairer than the children of men. And what was of more authoritie than the ſacred Prophecying of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who <hi>ſpake as neuer man ſpake,</hi> and confirmed it by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and yet ſee how this baſe vulgar ſcornes his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying? They that before perſecuted the Prophets of the Lord, now blaſpheme and deride the Lord of the Prophets. Thus it is ſtill with vs in places where the wicked multitude dare oppoſe the Meſſengers of Chriſt, with opinion they may doe it without puniſhment. When Magiſtrates are wicked &amp; haters of goodneſſe, theſe things fall out amongſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14246:170"/>
the multitude. There are two ſignes of a childe of God: The perſonall loue of the Lord Ieſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and the high eſtimation of the word of Chriſt. Now on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there cannot be more palpable ſignes of a wicked or reprobate heart, than to loath Chriſt, and deſpiſe Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Againe, note another madneſſe and folly in theſe beaſts: They thinke they can hoodwinke Chriſt: What, can their baſe couering hide the eies of the Son of God, that had ſo often made them know that he could ſee into their very hearts? Will God be blindfolded? Thus fooliſh are wicked men: and this mad folly is not out of the hearts of ſuch men amongſt vs, that thinke they haue the skill ſtill to hoodwinke God, that he ſhould not ſee their hypocriſie, and know their ſecret corruptions. But ſome one may ſay, it was wonder Chriſt would endure ſuch meane vſage: I anſwer, we muſt looke higher than the wickedneſſe of theſe men: Chriſt as our ſurety ſuffers all this, that he might make expiation for our ſinnes, that had loſt the face or image of God, and that he might deliuer vs from thoſe contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies might iuſtly follow vs for our ſinnes: and withall might leaue vs an example of patience, if we ſuffer meane vſage from the men of this world: and the rather becauſe we ſee in the Text, what interpretation was made of this dealing of theirs, it is reckoned as blaſphemy againſt God.</p>
                     <p>And thus of the things done in the Night tumultuouſly: Now followes the things he ſuffered in the Day, when they proceed to Iudgement; for in the morning early they bring forth Ieſus to be indited, and heare Iudgement, and that both in the Eccleſiaſticall and in the Ciuill Court. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I open the particulars, our hearts ſhould make a ſtand, and thinke of the generall, with amazement at the worke was done that day. There was neuer ſuch a dreadfull ſight to be ſeene, in any age of the world: for on that day, the Sonne of God, the King of Heauen and Earth, ſtood at the barre of mortall creatures, was indited and condemned of ſinfull men, and had many grieuous things laid to his charge. Oh, in what <hi>Labyrinths</hi> are our dead hearts ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that ſo prodigious a thing as this cannot waken vs to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14246:170"/>
vnſpeakable ſenſe and wonder! But let vs conſider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Paſſion in this kinde in generall.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Our Sauiour would not die in a tumult or ſecretly, but came ſolemnely to his triall in both Courts, that ſo his innocency might be fully cleared, and the wicked enuie and malice of the High Prieſts and the Iewes might be made manifeſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſtood there as ſurety for vs, that were obnox ous to the ſentence of the eternall Iudge, and had deſerued by our ſinnes to bee indited and condemned to eternall perdition.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He was indited and condemned on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might free vs from the furie of Gods iudgement, that we might neuer appeare before Gods Tribunall to be arraigned for our ſinnes, but only to heare iudgement for our abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and entrance into the poſſeſſion of that euerlaſting kingdome.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Vſe of this ſhould be for ſingular comfort to the godly, euen to all that beleeue in Ieſus. He was arraigned before the Prieſts, and <hi>Pilate,</hi> that they might not be arraigned before God. He was purſued in euery Court, that no Court of Iuſtice might lay hold on them. He was accuſed before an earthly Iudge, that they might be freed by the heauenly Iudge. He was condemned on earth, that we might be abſolued in heauen. And withall here is terrible diſcomfort to the wicked, that will not repent of their ſinnes and beleeue in Ieſus. They may geſſe what ſhall become of them: if Chriſt endured to bee arraigned on earth, and to be ſo vſed at mans Tribunall, how ſhall they eſcape the terror of their arraignment at the dreadfull day of Iudgement? He that hath beene abaſed to theſe indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will pay them home with iuſt vengeance, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hey ſhall fall into his hands at the laſt day: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God ſpared not his owne Sonne, but arraigned him for our ſinnes, how ſhall he ſpare them?</p>
                     <p>Thus in generall. Now in particular in the arraignment of Chriſt we are to conſider: Firſt, his accuſation: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his condemnation or ſentence. In his accuſation
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14246:171"/>
there was a double proceeding: For firſt he was brought into the Eccleſiaſticall Court, before <hi>Caiaph as</hi> the High Prieſt, in a great Councell or Synedrion at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and then after he was brought before the Politicall Tribunall of <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Gouernour.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of the arraignment of our Sauiour in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court: The Storie of the Euangeliſt ſhewes with what corruption and iniuſtice he was vſed in their Conſiſtorie: For firſt the Iudges themſelues, before they heare the cauſe, take counſell how to put him to death, intending by all their courſes to deuiſe all the wayes they could to get colour of matter againſt him, to complaine to the Ciuill Magiſtrate that hee might put him to death. Secondly, it is expreſly ſaid, that they ſought falſe witneſſe againſt him: and this was a groſſe iniuſtice to ſuborne falſe witneſſes. Thirdly, in the very Court before the face of the High Prieſt, Chriſt is ſmitten on the face with a rod by a baſe ſlaue that was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant or officer to the High Prieſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 22. Fourthly, he was accuſed of double blaſphemie, the one againſt the Temple, and the other againſt God. Againſt the Temple, becauſe he ſhould threaten to deſtroy it, and pull it downe, and ſet it vp againe by his owne power, within three daies. Againſt God, becauſe he ſaid he was Chriſt the Sonne of God. And this is the ſumme of the proceedings in that Court. Now out of the whole Storie many things may be noted which may ſerue for good vſe, as</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we may ſee hence, that Chriſt and true Chriſtians may be perſecuted and monſtrouſly abuſed in Spirituall Courts as well as Temporall. Chriſt neuer had worſer ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor more corrupt and malicious than Churchmen. In his owne perſon none hated him more deadly than the Prieſts and great ſpirituall Counſellors of the State Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke. And in times after of all the great ones that oppoſed Chriſt and his Kingdome, none deſerued the name of that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> more than the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> And certainly if he ſuffer ſuch wrongs in their Courts, if they repent not, and reforme, he will iudge them in his Court one day to their eternall confuſion. Againe, it is moſt cleare from hence,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14246:171"/>
that the reſtimonie of Councels, or the outward glory of learned men profeſſing a religion, are not infallible marks of the Truth. Here is a great Councell, and here ſit the great <hi>Rabbies</hi> in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> when Chriſt ſtands amongſt them in the condition of a poore priſoner. Now what could the Papiſts ſay in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> times to the Proteſtant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, that might not be ſaid by theſe Iewes againſt true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Againe, we may obſerue out of this Storie, what horrible iniurie may bee done to a man in reporting his words, though the moſt of the words be reported that were ſpoken, and how a mans meaning may be vilely peruerted by a little change of the words: Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and I will build it up againe in three daies:</hi> he meant his body by the Temple, and his Reſurrection ſhould be the building vp of it againe. Now the falſe witneſſes vrge this ſentence contrary to his ſenſe, and in ſtead of the word <hi>Deſtroy yee,</hi> they report it thus, <hi>I will deſtroy:</hi> and ſo out of all frame that accuſation, that hee would pull downe the Temple. Let all men take heed what they heare, and what they report: eſpecially in hearing do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine let them take heed that by their fault they doe not make their Teachers ſinne in the word as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets phraſe was, that is, that they doe not by miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king make ſuch report of their Teachers doctrine, as may bring them into danger, when they meant or ſaid no ſuch thing. And yet moreouer wee may note one thing more for information, and that may be gathered from the behauiour of the High Prieſts feruant, in ſtriking Chriſt ſo proudly and vniuſtly, without any bidding or warrant; and the rather, if we marke how the night before Ieſus was vſed by theſe Seruing-men and officers, and ſo afterwards: That I would obſerue, is, That it often falls out that ſeruants are like their Maſters. If the Iudges of Courts be not louers of goodneſſe, and good men, but rather ſuch as ſeeke all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions againſt them, &amp; diſgrace and diſcountenance them, it is ordinarily ſeene, that their ſeruants and officers, their Sergeants and Apparitors, and ſuch like, carry themſelues with vile iniuſtice and ſcorne towards the godly. What ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14246:172"/>
in the world can be more odious than the ſeruants and officers of great men, or Iudges, or Biſhops, or ſuch as haue Authority in Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall things, when the Maſters proue to be men of corrupt minds, and not louers of goodneſſe and iuſtice. And ſo it is in all States, euen in the family. How often doe the ſinnes of Maſters and parents breake out in their children and ſeruants? Certainly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of ill ſeruants would be in the greateſt part of it, taken away, if Maſters were better themſelues.</p>
                     <p>And thus for information. Now beſides here may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things learned for our inſtruction, from the behauiour of our Sauiour at this time, from the things he ſaid or did. Yea there is one thing to be learned from theſe wicked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, though they did ſinfully: We reade here of them, that they riſe early in the morning &amp; getto the Court, &amp; diſpatch the buſineſſe quickly: Now if to doe miſchiefe, their feet make ſuch haſte to ſhed bloud; ſurely good Iudges ſhould learne expedition from them, ſo it be in good cauſes: Iudges of Courts ſhould prouide, if it be poſſible, to cut off theſe miſerable delayes in ſuits: and when they fully vnderſtand the cauſe, diſpatch the Iuſtice of it quickly.</p>
                     <p>Now from the behauiour of our Sauiour we may learne diuers things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whereas he was examined both of his doctrine and his Diſciples, he anſwers to the point of his doctrine, but ſaith nothing of his Diſciples, and yet he might haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that one of them betrayed him, and another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, and the reſt ranne away from him: To teach vs that no extremity befalling our ſelues, ſhould make vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the weakneſſes of others to the Enemies of Religion, when it may any way doe hurt to the honour of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion. And againe, we may learne to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient vnder the aſperſion of Schiſme, &amp; not to be vnquiet at it. Our Sauiour was examined about his Diſciples, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence that he had made a Schiſme in the Church, by admitting ſo many followers, and ſuch concourſe of people to heare him, with intimation that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſedition in the State: Now to all this he giues no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14246:172"/>
but reſts ſatisfied, as knowing that the conſciences of his aduerſaries were perſwaded otherwiſe of him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When he anſwers about his doctrine, it is in generall, and ſparingly, to teach vs wiſdome in euil times, and to learne how to bridle our tongues, when we ſpeake before men in authority, eſpecially if they be enemies to Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From his anſwer about his doctrine, the Hearers of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teachers may learne one profitable leſſon, namely, to marke the doctrine of their Teachers, and to grow ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it, that they may be able to defend their Teachers and the Truth. Chriſt referred himſelfe to his Hearers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What admirable patience was that in Ieſus Chriſt, when he was ſmitten by the High Prieſts ſeruant, to ſpeake to him ſo coolely, ſaying, <hi>If I haue euill ſpoken, beare witneſſe of the euill: but if I haue well ſpoken, why ſmiteſt thou me? Iohn</hi> 18. 23. He deales like a wiſe and patient Phyſitian: if he haue a patient that is madde, he doth not rage if his madde patient ſhould ſtrike at him, but rather quietly will ſtriue to pacifie the fury of the madde man, or elſe binde him: So doth our ſweet Phyſitian of our ſoules: they are ſpiritually madde, that will ſtrike Ieſus their ſpirituall Phyſitian, or offer indignities to ſuch as come in his name. Let vs all learne patience of our bleſſed Sauiour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſhould from the conſideration of all this vniuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with our Sauiour, be ſtirred vp from our hearts to praiſe God for the publique peace wee enioy in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and hearing the Goſpell: We little know what we ſhould ſuffer, if we ſhould fall into the hands of vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, whether in the Eccleſiaſtical or Ciuil Courts: but if at any time, without our fault, we ſhould haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of corruption, and enuious and malitious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt vs for our conſciences ſake, wee ſhould comfort our ſelues by the remembrance of theſe things that befell our bleſſed Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>Before I leaue this part of his Paſſion, one queſtion may be asked, and that is, why our Sauiour held his peace when the falſe witneſſes gaue euidence againſt him; yea he held his
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14246:173"/>
peace, though the High Prieſt vrged him to ſpeak to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the witneſſes: Now for anſwer to this queſtion we may conceiue that our Sauiour was ſilent for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he knew that he came thither to ſuffer, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, as being ſent thither to ſuffer by God himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe he knew he ſhould be condemned, though he did cleare himſelfe of their accuſation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That by his patience and ſilence, he might intimate the vanitie of their accuſation, and the falſeneſſe of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Scripture might be fulfilled, that ſaid, <hi>He was as aſheepe dumbe before his ſhearer, Eſay</hi> 53. 7.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That ſo he might pay for our ſhiftings and excuſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That he might thereby acknowledge our ſin-guiltineſſe: as ſuretie he ſtood there for men that were iuſtly accuſed of God; and therefore as one confeſſing a fault, he forbears to defend or excuſe himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That hee might by his example teach vs to bee ſilent in euill times, when truth will not take place.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the Arraignment of our Sauiour in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court. Now followes the things he ſuffered in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Court before <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi> And here firſt in generall we may conſider the reaſons why Chriſt would be iudged in the <hi>Politicall</hi> Court of Iuſtice: and he did it,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That his innocence might be made more publike; which fell out, as appeares by the ſtory, in many things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That ſo he might be ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to die by the ordinary Iudge: for the Iewes had not power to put any man to death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ſo it might appeare that the Gentiles had intereſt in his death as well as the Iewes; and therefore the Gentiles lay their hands vpon the head of this Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the crueltie and vnequall dealing of the Chiefe Prieſts and their counſell might be more manifeſt, when it ſhould appeare that the Politicall Iudge ſhall vſe Chriſt with more reſpect, than they did. And thus it often comes to paſſe ſtill in the caſe of his Miniſters and ſeruants.</p>

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14246:173"/>
Chriſt ſeemes to ſay himſelfe that God had giuen that power to <hi>Pilate</hi> to put Chriſt to death, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 10, 11. Secondly, it hath beene noted before, that by this circumſtance it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that the Scepter was now departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and therefore Ieſus was that <hi>Shiloh</hi> that ſhould come. And here by the way they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might learne that Church-men muſt abide the iudgement of Lay Iudges; yea, though they be of a falſe religion. Chriſt yeelded himſelfe to be iudged by <hi>Pilate;</hi> and therefore it is a tricke of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> to refuſe it.</p>
                     <p>Now in the Arraignment of our Sauiour before <hi>Pilate,</hi> we are to conſider two things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. His Accuſation.</item>
                        <item>2. The proceedings of the Iudge.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>About his Accuſation three things may be noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By whom he was accuſed <hi>viz.</hi> By the Chiefe Prieſts, and Elders, and Scribes, and Phariſies. They that were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while his Iudges, are now become his accuſers: Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> notes they did it of enuy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 18. Surely enuy is very cruell and very baſe. It is a cruell thing to purſue a man to the death, for no other cauſe, but becauſe he is better beloued of God or man than themſelues. And it was moſt baſe for theſe great men to turne accuſers at the Barre of the Ciuill Iudge, and to doe it in their owne perſons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where he was accuſed: <hi>viz.</hi> at the doore of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28. Theſe wretched men that made no conſcience of purſuing an innocent man to the death, yet are very ſtrict about Ceremonies. They would not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common Hall leſt they ſhould be defiled, and ſo be made vnfit to celebrate the Paſſeouer. And why would the Hall defile them, but becauſe it was the ſeat of a Gentile? Oh vile hypocriſie! will the houſe defile them, and yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the man do them no hurt? It is a moſt hateful thing to be an Hypocrite, and an Hypocrite he is that ſtraines at a Gnat and ſwallowes a Cammell; that is preciſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious about ſmall matters, and yet makes not Conſcience of groſſe ſinnes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What they charged vpon him. They charged vpon
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14246:174"/>
him three things: Firſt, ſeducing of the people, as one that had peruerted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> their Nation, and ſtirred vp the people throughout all <hi>Iudea,</hi> beginning from <hi>Galile</hi> to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Luke</hi> 23. 2. 5. Secondly, ſedition, as one that deceiued and forbade the paying of tribute to <hi>Caeſar, Luk.</hi> 23. 2. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, high treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in ſaying hee was a King, <hi>Luke.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 12. The firſt of theſe was vaine, and the two laſt falſe. For the extraordinary mouing of the people is not in it ſelfe a fault, vnleſſe they be moued without cauſe, or by ill meanes, or to ill ends. The other two are falſe: for he paid tribute himſelfe, though as a Prince of the bloud hee was free, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. And when the people would haue made him King he refuſed it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 15. Hence we ſee that euen Chriſt himſelfe hath beene liable to the ſame accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſlanders are caſt vpon his poore ſeruants: which ſhould the more comfort the godly when they are ſlandered and charged with Innouation, Schiſme, Sedition, or to be enemies to Princes, or the like. But eſpecially hence ſhould the godly take comfort in the hope of the forgiueneſſe of all their ſinnes againſt God, how great ſoeuer: for to this end was Chriſt charged with theſe great offences vniuſtly, that he might make atonement for our ſinnes that were guiltie, euen of high treaſon againſt God.</p>
                     <p>Thus of his Accuſation. The proceeding of the Iudge followes, where we may note two things: Firſt, how <hi>Pilate</hi> exammed Chriſt. Secondly, what meanes he vſed to deliuer Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, when the Iewes had thus accuſed our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Pilate</hi> went in to Chriſt, and examined him only vpon the three points, whether he were a King. The firſt, as a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe concerned their owne Law, hee would not meddle with. And the ſecond either he beleeued not, or accounted it to be comprehended in the third. Now to this queſtion of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>late</hi> our Sauiour giues an anſwer: wherein we ſhould take notice of ſoure things, which he thought good to teſtifie and auouch at his Arraignment as truths moſt needfull, and not to be denied or controuled at any time: Firſt, that hee was a King. Secondly, that his Kingdome was not of this
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14246:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world, Thirdly, that the end of his comming was to beare witneſſe of the Truth. Fourthly, that his ſubiects were ſuch as were of the Truth, and did heare his voice, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 36, 37. Theſe parts of the confeſſion of Ieſus, ſhould not paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liuely vſe in our hearts. For firſt, if Ieſus be King, why are we diſcontented with our eſtates, why liue we not out of feare and care? Is there not a King in <hi>Sion, Mich.</hi> 4. 9. and the rather, becauſe our King is a King vniuerſall, and all power is giuen vnto him in heauen and earth: and beſides, he is a King immortall, and of his kingdome there is no end: and therefore we ſhould ſeeke to him in all our neceſſities, who is ſo able to helpe, and truſt in him. And for the ſecond, if his kingdome be not of this world, wee ſhould not expect to haue the glory of our Religion to be liable to outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, but rather pray that God would open our eyes to ſee wherein the true glory of Chriſts kingdome lies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. And withall it ſhould teach vs to imploy our ſelues about ſpirituall things, and not about earthly; for the wealth of his kingdome lieth not in earthly things, our trading muſt be about heauenly commodities, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And further, ſeeing his kingdome is ouer the ſpirits of men, wee ſhould labour to get ſpirits without guile, and to ſerue him in ſpirit and truth. And poore men ſhould not be diſcontent with their eſtates: His kingdome is not of this world, hee neuer promiſed great things in earthly matters to his followers; they ſhould rather reioyce that they are exalted to get the preferments of his kingdome in ſpirituall things.</p>
                     <p>Now for the third point, if the end of Chriſts comming were to beare witneſſe of the Truth, we may gather diuers things from thence: As firſt, it may informe vs of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment Truth findes in the world: It is more villanouſly neglected, and oppoſed, and wronged, when the Sonne of God muſt come from heauen to giue euidence in the behalfe of truth. It imports the truth is more often queſtioned than error and wickedneſſe. Againe, it may intimate, that Truth is great and will preuaile: God will ſend from heauen to helpe it, rather than it ſhall be ſuppreſt, though it be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. And beſides, we may gather hence, that the preaching
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14246:175"/>
and publiſhing of diuine Truths is a moſt excellent worke, in that the chiefe office of the Son of God was to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Truth: and ſo it ſhould teach vs to receiue the word of truth with all reuerence, and gladneſſe, and good conſcience: as accounting truth to be the moſt precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure God ſends to men. And from the practiſe of Chriſt both Miniſters and People ſhould learne with all wiſdome and conſtancie to ſtand for the truth, though it were to death, and neuer to be aſhamed to witneſſe to the truth, by holding out the light of the profeſſion of it, and ſhewing our ſound obedience, and ſubiection to it, howſoeuer it be taken in the world.</p>
                     <p>As for the laſt point, our Sauiour giues an excellent mark to know his ſubiects by: They are of the Truth and heare his voice: They are of the Truth, not only as they take part with Truth to defend it, but as men that were borne and bred by the power of truth: they were regenerated and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the force of the ſound of Truth: and accordingly the chiefe comfort and treaſure of their liues they account to be the hearing of the voice of Chriſt: Hearing of Sermons is the Character of a true Chriſtian. But it is not all hearing, but a hearing of ſuch Sermond as haue the voice and power of Chriſt in them: and ſuch a hearing as placeth ſuch felicity in the voice of Chriſt, as they could be content (as it were) to doe nothing elſe but heare Chriſt ſtill: and ſuch a hearing too, as will giue glory to Chriſts voice in the hardeſt times, when it is moſt ſcorned and oppoſed in the world: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is ſuch a hearing as containes obeying and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be ruled by the voice of Chriſt. And this was the anſwer which our Sauiour made to the Gouernours queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> notes that when the chiefe Prieſts accuſed him, he anſwered nothing, and though <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Heareſt thou not, how many things they witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee? yet he anſwered not, in ſo much that Pilate maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greatly, Matth.</hi> 27. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>He thus conſtantly forbare and refuſed to anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he needed not any apologie, being knowne to be innocent, and thus it became the Chriſt, the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14246:175"/>
King, to carry himſelfe: Kings need not ſeeke protection or defence for themſelues by words againſt the falſe accuſations of their ſubiects.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hereby hee ſhewes his magnanimitie in contemning death: If he had anſwered, hee might ſeeme to doe it, to preuent the ſentence of death: He that ſeekes not life, feares not death. He that ſaues all men, betrayes his owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he might purchaſe our ſaluation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By his Silence hee ſatisfies Gods iuſtice for the ſinnes of our words.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is ſilent on earth, that he might merit to ſpeake for vs in heauen, by making interceſſion freely for vs at the right hand of God: and that we might haue free acceſſe to God for our prayers, in pleading for our liues through his merit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hee hath thereby left vs an example, to teach vs to beare falſe accuſations patiently; and imports that our innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhall not need defence, when wicked men are vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: He may well be ſilent that needs not defence. Let them be eager to make Apologies that feare to be found guiltie: the cauſe is the better, that is not defended, and yet is proued.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hereby he proues himſelfe to be the Meſſias promiſed, becauſe he was as a ſheepe dumbe before his Shearers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophecie, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 7.</p>
                     <p>And as he was ſilent in theſe accuſations that touched his life, ſo afterwards when they accuſed him for making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Sonne of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 7. he would giue no anſwer to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that being much afraid, asked him whence he was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. both becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> was vncapable of the doctrine of the Trinitie, and becauſe there was no time to reueale his Deitie, but rather to ſuffer and die according to his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                     <p>Thus of our Sauiours examination: Now follow the courſes the Iudge tooke to auoid putting of him to death, and ſo to ſaue his life; and ſo in the ſtory we ſhall finde, that <hi>Pilate</hi> vſed foure policies to ſaue Chriſt, or at leaſt to put off the buſineſſe from himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:14246:176"/>
The firſt was, that he perſwades the Iewes to take him themſelues, and iudge him by their owne law, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 31. but this policie ſucceeds not, and that for two Reaſons: Firſt, the Iewes plead they had not power to put any man to death, becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken that iuriſdiction into their owne hands. In which anſwer of theirs, we ſee their horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe and impudencie that profeſſe to haue reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon his death, and to tell the Iudge ſo, before the cauſe be opened: and yet the prouidence of God was in this thing. God had ſent him to die for the people, and by the people his death is called for with importunitie. Secondly, the Text ſaith, That this was done that the ſaying of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould die: for he had ſaid that he ſhould be deliuered vp into the hands of the Gentiles to be crucified, and therefore this policie muſt be diſappointed: whence we may note, that the Counſell and word of God concerning the ſufferings of his people cannot be altered. It ſhall not be with vs according to the will of men, but Gods Counſell ſhall ſtand, which ſhould make vs with the more patience to beare what may befall vs, ſeeing if God doe it, it will be good for vs, and no aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can haue their wills of vs further than their plots and practiſes doe ſerue to accompliſh Gods ſecret will.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond policie vſed by <hi>Pilate</hi> was, that he took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the report that Chriſt was a <hi>Galilean,</hi> to ſend him to <hi>Herod</hi> to be tried before him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 6, 7, &amp;c. This <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was he that cut off <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> head, and was called (to diſtinguiſh him from other <hi>Herods) Herod Antipas. Pilate</hi> though he dealt herein politickly, yet he deales vniuſtly, for he ought to haue defended the innocencie of our Sauiour, and deliuered him from the hands of his violent and vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable aduerſaries, and not ſend him to another.</p>
                     <p>In the Story of Chriſts appearing before <hi>Herod,</hi> obſerue:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The diſpoſition of <hi>Herod,</hi> and how he ſtood affected towards our Sauiour: the Text ſaith, <hi>He was glad of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and had long deſired to ſee him, and hoped to ſee him work ſome miracle before him, Luke</hi> 23. 8. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene godly men and wicked men, though they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14246:176"/>
both meet in this, that they deſire Chriſt, or to ſee Chriſt. A wicked man deſires more the miracles of Chriſt than his word: A godly man eſpecially deſires to heare the voice of Chriſt. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> had beene ſo ſearched by the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he durſt not aduenture to heare any effectuall miniſterie after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: He hath no deſire to haue Chriſt to inſtruct him in the great myſteries of the kingdome of Heauen, or to ſhew him how he might ſaue his ſoule. To deſire Chriſt for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ends, as pleaſure, glory, profit, or the like, is but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerat humour. To deſire Chriſt for his owne ſake, or for his word ſake, or for the holineſſe we deſire to get from him, is proper only to the godly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The behauiour of our Sauiour, who would not yeeld to worke any miracle before <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe he knew <hi>Herod</hi> would abuſe the power of God, to make ſport of ſuch great works to feed his owne vanitie: and beſides our Sauiour conſtantly applies himſelfe to the buſineſſe he came about. He knew then, that was not a time of exerciſing his power, but of ſuffering. Secondly, though <hi>Herod</hi> queſtioned with him in many words, yet he anſwered him nothing, Which he did firſt to abate the pride and vanity of <hi>Herod,</hi> thereby intimating how little he eſteemed his worldly greatneſſe, and how much he contemned his leuitie and vanitie of minde. Secondly, he would not caſt Pearle before Swine: He knew he ſhould doe no good by talking to him, that was a man giuen to ſo much viciouſneſſe of life and voluptuouſneſſe. Thirdly, becauſe he knew that he muſt receiue his ſentence not from <hi>Herod</hi> a Iew, but from <hi>Pilate</hi> a Romane and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ie, and be condemned and put to death after the Romane manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by crucifying.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The things our Sauiour ſuffered: and ſo firſt from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then from <hi>Herod.</hi> The <hi>Iewes, viz.</hi> the chiefe Prieſts and Scribes, ſtood and vehemently accuſed him; which our Sauiour endured, and came to paſſe by Gods prouidence, that ſo thereby the innocencie of Chriſt might be the more manifeſt, which was eaſily diſcerned by <hi>Herod.</hi> obſeruing the violent and tumultuous proceedings of the Prieſts: and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14246:177"/>
it may be gathered from <hi>Pilats</hi> ſpeech, that <hi>Herod</hi> did finde no fault in him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 15. From <hi>Herod</hi> our Sauiour ſuffred two things: Firſt, he was extremely mocked by <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of warre: and then hee was ſent backe to <hi>Pilate</hi> arraied in a gorgeous robe. For the firſt, we ſee how great men that are giuen to pleaſure and worldly pompe, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſt and religion. It is no ſtrange thing that religion ſhould be ſcorned by voluptuous worldlings, or people gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vanitie. It is enough for the ſeruant to be as his Lord is: If we be ſet at nought, and reproched, and ſcorned by the world, we ſhould not thinke any great matter was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen vs, for thus was Chriſt himſelfe vſed, and that in the open Court of a great King publikely.</p>
                     <p>Againe, we ſhould know that Chriſt did therefore endure to be thus vilified by <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of warre, that hee might make vs pretious before God and his heauenly Armie of Saints and Angels. And whereas <hi>Herod</hi> ſends him backe clothed in a white or gorgeous robe, though <hi>Herod</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing but matter of ſcorne, yet Diuines conceiue, that God did thereby acknowledge him to be that lambe without ſpot that ſhould take away the ſinnes of the world, and to be indeed the true King of Heauen. That which men did in ieſt, God did in earneſt. <hi>Herod</hi> clothes him with a robe like a King, as one that fooliſhly had affected the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But God by permitting the Royall robe, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his iuſt claime to be King of <hi>Sion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The euent of this buſineſſe, was the reconciliation of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> who were made friends the ſame day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 12. which ſhews the temper of the men of this world, who though they cannot agree among themſelues, yet rather than Chriſt ſhall not be perſecuted, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come friends: Wicked men are eaſily agreed, when there is a common oppoſition to be made againſt religion: <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and yet both will agree to be againſt <hi>Iudah.</hi> Yet obſerue here, the vanity of all friendſhip amongſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians. <hi>Herod</hi> is greatly pleaſed, that <hi>Pilate</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſo much right to him as to ſend his priſoner
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14246:177"/>
to him, only becauſe hee was a <hi>Galilaean.</hi> Now <hi>Herod</hi> was miſtaken, for though that were <hi>Pilates</hi> pretence, yet he intended another thing, which was to deriue the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſo foule a buſineſſe vpon <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had ſerued <hi>Annas</hi> before. And thus of <hi>Pilates</hi> ſecond Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
                     <p>The third Policie which <hi>Pilate</hi> vſed to acquit Chriſt, was to make a motion to the people to haue Chriſt giuen to them, in honour of their great Feaſt. About which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The occaſion of this practiſe, and that was a cuſtome which the <hi>Iewes</hi> had, to haue a priſoner deliuered at the Feaſt of the Paſſeouer, by the Gouernour, which they would. Now this cuſtome was either an ancient cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who to ſignifie their deliuerance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> had deuiſed this cuſtome at the Paſſeouer to let a priſoner goe free: Or elſe it was ſome grant which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had made vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> after they had reduced the Country into the forme of a Prouince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The manner of <hi>Pilates</hi> dealing to accompliſh his will in this motion: and ſo he matcheth <hi>Chriſt</hi> with one <hi>Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> that was a murtherer and a notorious malefactor, and then giues them power to chuſe their priſoner, ſo as they chuſe one of the two, ſuppoſing that the horrible offence of <hi>Barrabas</hi> would for the very ſhew of it, hinder them from chuſing him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The choice the <hi>Iewes</hi> made: and ſo by the perſwaſion of the Prieſts, the multitude chuſeth <hi>Barrabas</hi> and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth <hi>Ieſus.</hi> The author of life is by the <hi>Iewes</hi> reiected, and a murtherer choſen: The innocent muſt die, and the guilty liue: He that thought it no robbery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o be equall with God, hath a Theefe and a Robber preferred before him. Now doth he pay for our ſinne, that preferred the Deuill that murtherer, before God the author of life. In theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> we ſee the nature of carnall perſons: They make more account of groſſe offenders, than they doe of godly Chriſtians. They chuſe the <hi>Barrabaſſes</hi> of the world (Drunkards, Papiſts, Whoremongers, Swearers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,)
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14246:178"/>
to be the companions of their liues, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhun and auoid the company of Gods ſeruants. But the godly that are ſo vilified, ſhould comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by this example of our Sauiours ſuffering herein. Chriſt was not ſo well accounted of as <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and yet endured it: but what cauſe haue thoſe Chriſtians to be ſo vnquiet, when others are preferred before them, that are indeed more wiſe, learned, godly &amp; humble than they?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When none of theſe courſes will ſerue turne, then <hi>Pilate</hi> yet tries one more to ſee whether he can appeaſe the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell malice of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The way he vſed was this. He tooke <hi>Ieſus</hi> into the common Hall, and cauſed him there to be extremely ſcourged and vilified by the ſouldiers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3. thinking that when the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaw him ſo hardly vſed, and abaſed, and that he being a <hi>Iew,</hi> ſhould be ſo dealt withall by <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they would haue relented, and ſo haue beene ſatisfied with that puniſhment was now inflicted vpon him. Obſerue the implacable malice of men, that hate ſinceritie and true religion, nothing but bloud will ſatisfie their thirſt of reuenge: And withall obſerue the fooliſh reaſoning of <hi>Pilate; I finde no fault in this man, I will therefore chaſtiſe him, and let him goe:</hi> Moſt ſenſleſly ſpoken: Shall he be chaſtiſed, and yet be innocent? <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 14, 15, 16. But wee muſt looke higher, if we would finde out the true cauſe of the ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. He was ſcourged, that he might redeeme vs from thoſe ſpirituall and eternall ſcourges were due vnto vs for our ſinnes. Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> fugitiue ſeruants were brought backe to their Maſters, and beaten with rods. We haue all beene fugitiue ſeruants, and run away from God our Maſters workes: <hi>Ieſus</hi> now beares our ſtripes, and giues his owne hands that giue liberty, to be bound, and his owne bodie to be beaten, that he might deriue our ſtripes vpon himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he might ſanctifie thoſe bodily ſcourges which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, ſuch as are diſeaſes of any ſort. For diſeaſes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſcourges, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:14246:178"/>
3. That by the vertue of his ſtripes, our ſoules might bee healed of our ſinnes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and the ſores that ariſe from the buffets of Sathans temptations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That we might learne in patience from his example: If we be ſcourged vniuſtly either with the ſcourge of the tongue, or of the hand: and in particular, ſeruants that are beaten by froward Maſters vniuſtly, are exhorted to patience by the force of this enſample, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the accuſation of our Sauiour, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Iudge in his tryall: his condemnation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: and there foure things may be noted.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. How our Sauiour was pronounced innocent before ſentence.</item>
                        <item>2. Why <hi>Pilate</hi> would not deliuer him knowing him to be innocent.</item>
                        <item>3. The Sentence it ſelfe.</item>
                        <item>4. The conſequents of the Sentence.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the firſt, our Sauiour was declared to be innocent: firſt by <hi>Pilates</hi> wife, and then by <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Pilates</hi> wife it is obſerued, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 19. That when <hi>Pilate</hi> was now ſet on the Iudgement ſeat, ſhee ſent to him, ſaying, <hi>Haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man, for I haue ſuffered many things this day in a dreame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him.</hi> Where we may note diuers things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The great glory of Gods power in giuing teſtimonie to the innocence of his children: When <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> haue banded themſelues againſt Chriſt, and when his owne Diſciples are now fled, and dare not ſpeake for him, yea when all that profeſſe religion were ſwallowed vp with amazement, God herein raiſeth vp a woman, a ſtranger, a Pagan, to force a way for his teſtimony euen at this great Aſſiſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note that God keeps this teſtimonie till the very laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Iudge is now ſet to giue Iudgement: to ſhew vs that God can ſend comfort and ſuccour to his ſeruants, though he withhold it till almoſt all hope bee gone.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods meſſage muſt be deliuered though neuer ſo many
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14246:179"/>
obiections lie againſt it. Shee might haue thought how vnfit it was for her to meddle being a woman, and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and her owne husband being Iudge, but yet ſhee will ſend the meſſage.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Diuinitie of Chriſt ſhowes it ſelfe maruellouſly in this thing, while <hi>Pilate</hi> is ready to condemne him, hee miraculouſly conuerts his wife. His Godhead breakes through the veile: and their opinion that thinke this woman was truly conuerted, is charitable, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. For what was in the confeſſion of the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, or the Thiefe vpon the Croſſe, that is not in the confeſſion of this woman? Shee confeſſeth him, when all the world refuſeth him: yea ſhe vrgeth her Husband to ſaue him, when it might proue his vtter ouerthrow, conſidering the tumult of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the diſpleaſure <hi>Caeſar</hi> might take, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> was charged with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and beſides ſo peremptorily to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his goodneſſe, at ſuch a time, when it was ſo generally queſtioned, imported a minde much affected to <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Howſoeuer we may learne of this great woman to ſtand for the truth, how euill ſoeuer the times be, or what danger ſoeuer it may bring vpon vs. Yea note that <hi>Ieſus</hi> can doe great things in Priſon as well as at Liberty: No outward abaſements or reſtraints can hinder Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or the ſucceſſe of religion, or Gods worke for the ſoules of his people.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Concerning Dreames, we muſt vnderſtand that they are of foure ſorts; Naturall, Morall, Diuine, or Diabolicall. Naturall dreames ariſe from the conſtitution of the body, according to the complexion or preſent eſtate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, either as diſeaſed, or well. Morall dreames ariſe from the ſtudies and imployments that we are extraordinarily affected withall in the day time. Diuine dreames ariſe either from the working of ſome Angell, or by ſome other way vnknowne to vs, and are vſed by God either to ſhew his power, or foretell things to come, or vnknowne, or as an extraordinary entertainment he would giue vnto his ſeruants. Diabolicall dreames are villanous conceptions
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:14246:179"/>
wrought in the mindes of men in their ſleeps, either to torment them, or to ſeduce them, or to tempt them to ſome monſtrous euill. The queſtion is what kinde of dreame <hi>Pilates</hi> wiues dreame was? There is no colour of reaſon to thinke it was Naturall. Some Diuines thinke that it was Diabolicall, and giue this reaſon, that the Deuill ſome way now perceiuing that the death of Chriſt would be the life of the world, hee ſeekes to hinder it by this dreame. But if that were ſo, why had not <hi>Pilate</hi> the dreame? or why did not the Deuill vſe the Iewes that were his owne inſtruments? and therefore it is more than likely that the dreame was from God. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may we now giue heed to dreames? <hi>Anſw.</hi> By dreames we may gueſſe at the ſtate of our bodies ſometimes. And by dreames wee may gueſſe at the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and finde what ſinnes we are ſecretly prone to. Yea no doubt, but wee may haue Diabolicall dreames, which we may diſcerne by the ſame ſignes we know the temptations of the Deuill from corruption of nature. As when we are tempted to things contrary to our natures, and prodigiouſly vile; or when we feele that our nature doth abhorre the motion, and giue no conſent to it. Nor doe I doubt but God may treat with his people alſo by dreames: and we ſhould be thankfull for holy dreames, wherein God giues vs ſpeciall comforts, or doth in any ſpeciall manner fire our hearts to the loue of goodneſſe. Only we muſt receiue no opinions by dreames which are not agreeable to the word, nor muſt we truſt vpon Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of things to come, only when they are come to paſſe, glory ſhould be giuen to God, with a reſolution ſtill to depend vpon the Law and the Teſtimonies only, as the direction of our liues.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We ſhould all feare the great power and wrath of God: we ſhould be afraid to diſpleaſe him: for hee can finde ſtrange wayes to make vs ſuffer: If all the world were at firme peace with vs, and all the Deuils in Hell would be quiet, yet God can fight againſt our ſpirits with a very Armie he can raiſe in our very dreames: Little doe we
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:14246:180"/>
know how ſuddenly, and how eaſily, and yet how feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God can ſeaze vpon vs either body or ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Note that ſhee ſaith <hi>I haue ſuffered many things,</hi> and yet it was <hi>Pilate</hi> that offended: whence we may gather, that ill husbands may make all that belongs vnto them ſuffer for their faults. They may be as a common plague to all that is about them, or comes of them: They ſinne, and their wiues may ſuffer many things for their ſakes, ſo may their children and their poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, obſerue that ſhe dreames in the day time. It ſeemes ſhe was no early riſer, but guilty of that fault which is ſtill too common amongſt great perſons, yea amongſt them that are much inferiour to her, to lye long in bed: whereas the good woman deſcribed in the <hi>Prouerbs, chap.</hi> 31. is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for <hi>Riſing while it was yet night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus of the declaration of our Sauiours innocence by <hi>Pilates</hi> wife.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe he was declared to be innocent, partly in words, and partly in action: In words, <hi>Pilate</hi> came forth publikely three times, and profeſſed that he found no fault in him, after he had heard out their accuſations, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 14, 22. Whence we may gather, that wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in the Viſible Church may be as vile, yea more vile than thoſe that are not in the Church at all. The Iewes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, when a Gentile abſolues him. They wilfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Chriſt to death, when the Pagan for a good while ſtriues as hard to ſaue him. <hi>Pilate</hi> was afraid when his very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers had charged him that he ſaid that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and yet theſe curſed Iewes are not afraid, though they had ſeene many ſignes that proued he was the Son of God. And therefore it ſhall be eaſier for Pagans and Papiſts in the day of Iudgement, than for theſe wicked men in the Church, as our Sauiour ſaid of the Cities of <hi>Galilea, Mat.</hi> 11. 20. to 25.</p>
                     <p>In Action, <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounceth our Sauiour innocent, by vſing ſolemnly the Ceremony of waſhing his hands, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth his meaning, thereby to ſignifie, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and did not conſent to our Sauiours death. It ſeemes that he had borrowed this Ceremony from the Iewes, who
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:14246:180"/>
had an ancient vſe of it in ſome caſes, as appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 6. and did thereby think the more to affect them with remorſe, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 6. Though this Ceremony were not neceſſary, yet Iudges and publike Officers of State ſhould haue cleane hands, hands (I ſay) cleane from bribes and corruption, and hearts fearing God, and hating couetouſneſſe: and ſo all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſeruice in Piety, as well as Iuſtice, requires the waſhing of the hands in innocencie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 6. for if the Ciuill ſeat of Iuſtice muſt not be compaſſed but with integritie of heart and life, much leſſe ſhould we dare to compaſſe Gods Altar, vnleſſe we haue waſhed our hands in true innocencie. But further obſerue what poore ſhifts a troubled and ill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence flyes to. What will it iuſtifie <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he waſheth his hands, and yet by and by doe that which himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes? The baſeneſſe of his minde cannot be ſcoured off, with the water on his fingers. An ill conſcience is often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſenſeleſſe minde. To conclude, Note one fearfull thing that fell out vpon this Action: <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am innocent from the bloud of this man:</hi> Immediatly the madde Iewes ſhout it out, that for <hi>his bloud, let it light vpon them and their children, Matth.</hi> 27. 25. How ſuddenly did the Iudge of the world take vp this Imprecation; He ratified it in heauen: This direfull curſe fell vpon them, and yet lyeth vpon them to this day, as a ſtanding monument to warne all curſing Caitifes, ſuch as wiſh death and damnation or deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſeaſes to themſelues or others, God may ſay <hi>Amen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be aware.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the declaration of our Sauiours Innocencie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing about his condemnation, is the cauſe, why <hi>Pilate</hi> would not deliuer him, knowing him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: and ſo two cauſes are aſſigned; the firſt was his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to content the people, <hi>Marke</hi> 15. 15. And <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, the inſtancie and clamour of the Commons and the chiefe Prieſts preuailed, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 23. And a ſecond cauſe is aſſigned by Saint <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 19. 13. And that was the feare of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for they had charged him, that if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Ieſus,</hi> he was not <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend; and when he heard this ſaying, he ſate downe in the Iudgement ſeat to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14246:181"/>
Which ſhewes vs, that it ſometimes comes to paſſe, that Chriſt and the ſincerity of Religion may ſuffer very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, either to ſatisfie the ſtubborne humours of wicked people, or vpon pretence that Chriſt and true Chriſtians are enemies to Princes. Many things are done in <hi>Caeſars</hi> name, and vpon pretence of <hi>Caeſars</hi> right, which yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> knowes not of, or if he did, ought not to fauour ſuch proceedings. We ſee that of old theſe two things haue beene great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to iniuſtice.</p>
                     <p>The third thing was the manner of the Iudgement: and ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> reports that <hi>Pilate</hi> brought forth <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and ſate downe in the Iudgement ſeat, and after ſome reproachfull ſpeeches to the people about <hi>Ieſus</hi> as their King, and after their laſt tumultuous crie to haue him crucified, he deliuered him to be crucified. Oh what heart can by faith ſee <hi>Ieſus</hi> come out vpon the <hi>Pauement,</hi> and ſo patiently ſet himſelfe before the Tribunall of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and not be diſſolued into teares, to ſee our ſweet Sauiour after ſo many indignities, to ſtand amongſt ſuch vile people to receiue iudgement of death, that was the bleſſed Author of life! But in this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation lieth one chiefe conſolation: for in that houre, and in that ſentence did God our heauenly Iudge giue ſentence vpon our ſinnes in him our Surety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinne in his fleſh, that had no ſinne; and therefore our faith ſhould gather hence aſſurance of eternall comfort, ſeeing he was condemned, that we might be ſaued: and in this ſentence vpon him, God hath fully ſatisfied his iuſtice, ſo as we need not feare the day of Iudgement, for Ieſus hath beene already iudged for our ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and a part of the iudgement it is to be reckoned, that he found no mercy in the Iewes, when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> but rather with greater rage they called for the ſentence to haue him crucified: and withall that he was reiected of the chiefe Prieſts, and Scribes, and Elders of the people. He found no mercy in the Iewes, that he might thereby procure for vs the eternall Mercy of his Father: He found no mercy with Men, that we might obtaine mercy with God. And he was reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the chiefe Prieſts, that the Scripture might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14246:181"/>
that had ſaid, <hi>That the ſtone that the builders refuſed ſhould be made the head of the corner, Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. And that he might thereby ſatisfie for vs that had refuſed God, and would not haue him raigne ouer vs, but yeelded our ſelues to the Deuill to rule vs.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing in the Story is the conſequent of the Iudgement, or what followed immediatly vpon the ſentence, and that was moſt vile vſage by the Souldiers of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for they tooke him into the common Hall, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him the whole band, and they ſtripped him, and put on a Scarlet Robe, and a Crowne of Thornes vpon his head, and a Reed in his righthand, and bowed the knee, and mocked him, ſaying, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes,</hi> and ſpit vp-vpon him, and ſmote him on the head with the Reed; and after they had mocked him, they tooke off the Scarlet Robe, and put his owne rayment on him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 27. to 32. Now whereas Saint <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3. mentioneth that diuers of theſe things were done before the ſentence, to moue the people to pitie, we may ſuppoſe that they were twice done, once by <hi>Pilates</hi> commandement before ſentence, and then by the prophane rage and ſtorme of the Souldiers after ſentence: howſoeuer, to vs it is ſufficient to know they were done, and why hee endured ſuch things wee ſhould chiefly inquire.</p>
                     <p>Now out of this part of the Story ſome things may be learned in generall, and ſomethings from the ſignification of ſome ſpeciall things here mentioned.</p>
                     <p>In generall wee muſt inquire after the Reaſon of two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why he is here ſhewed in the habit of a King, and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the repreſentation of the ornaments &amp; reuerence of a King. He is crowned, and clothed with a Robe, and a Reed put into his hand like a Scepter, and ſaluted as a King, all in ſcorne. Conſider firſt, that God did by his ſpeciall prouidence acknowledge the regall dignity of his Sonne, euen in the middeſt of his greateſt abaſement: that which <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Souldiers did in ſcorne, God did in earneſt; for all theſe things are enſignes of his
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14246:182"/>
Kingdome. Secondly, hence we may gather how ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and ſcornefully the men of this world doe iudge of the Kingdome and glory of Ieſus Chriſt. It is ſo farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued out of their ſenſe and iudgement, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it but fooliſhneſſe and ſcorne, yea as lyes, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of that glory can runne into their ſenſes. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is impoſſible for the men of this world to ſee the glory of Chriſts Kingdome in the daies of tribulation and affliction. And therefore Chriſtians ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the excellencie of their eſtate, though the world will not acknowledge their glory as the ſonnes of God. Thirdly, herein he payes for our affectation of Gods own Kingdome, when in Paradiſe our hearts would not be content vnleſſe they were gods, or like the Almighty in Maieſty. Fourthly, hereby hee merited for vs an eternall kingdome, and made vs Princes and Kings before God, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Why did he ſuffer theſe ſtrange indignities, as to be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of his cloathes, ſpit vpon, and beaten on the head, and all ſo publikely? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, that hereby he might beare that ignominie and ſhamefull diſgrace, and loathing, which was due vnto vs for our ſinnes: hee herein carries our filth, and ſuffers that abomination was due to vs, and ſo ſatisfies for the many and baſe iniuries which wee haue done to God, and to his holy Name. Secondly, that he might here leaue vs an enſample to learne of him, and ſo might be armed and fenced againſt all the ſcornes and baſe vſages we may finde in the world, eſpecially when wicked men doe therefore deale ſhamefully with vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe abhorre it, that we ſhould profeſſe the hope and expectation of a kingdome from God in heauen. Wee ſhould neuer account any indignity ſtrange, that haue had a Sauiour that ſuffered ſo vnſpeakable meane and baſe vſage.</p>
                     <p>Thus in generall: Now almoſt euery one of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things done to Ieſus, haue their ſpeciall vſe and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Theſe things were done in a Myſterie: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is ſtripped of his cloathes, that thereby he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:14246:182"/>
our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> that by ſinning loſt our garments of originall Righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They put vpon him a Scarlet Robe, that thereby it might appeare that he was that excellent Warriour, ſo liuely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and deſcribed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 1, to 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He was crowned with Thornes, that thereby hee might merit for vs a crowne of glory in heauen; and that hee might take vpon him our cares, and beare that maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God had laid vpon vs in our bodily labours, and that he might thereby ſignifie that he ſhould make vnto himſelfe a royal and diuine people, that ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe about when he ſpake in the name of the Lord. For out of men that were like Briers and Thorns, for iniuſtice and hurtfulneſſe, doth he gather a People, which in the publike aſſemblies do compaſſe him about, in the honour of his Name, and publike profeſſion of his Truth, as the King and Lord of heauen and earth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He had a Reed in his hand as a Scepter, to ſignifie that it was he that ſhould breake the old Serpents head: for they write that a Reed is mortiferous to Serpents: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now that he was in the Chaſe of the old Dragon, he takes a Reed into his hand, that wee might be deliuered from the power of that Serpent.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That face of his, that was to be reuerenced of Angels, was diſhonoured with the loath ſome ſpittle of theſe baſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that thereby he might cleanſe the face of our ſoules (once made in the likeneſſe of God) from the filth and loathſome fouleneſſe that temptations and ſinnes had left vpon them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They tooke off his purple garment, whereby was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that his kingdome of grace ſhould be laid downe, and put off.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. His owne garments were put vpon him againe, to ſignifie that as he clothed his owne body, ſo ſhould we be clothed with his owne garments of Righteouſneſſe, and life, and immortalitie.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the Arraignment of Chriſt. The parts of his Paſſion after his Arraignment follow in the <hi>Creed:</hi> and ſo his crucifying is the firſt to be conſidered of. And about the crucifying of our Sauiour ſix things are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in the ſtorie.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, for the place where he was crucified, and that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall was without the Citie, and in particular it was called <hi>Golgatha.</hi> Now he ſuffered without the Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for foure reaſons. Firſt, that thereby he might fulfill that which was foreſignified by the figures of the old Law. For the bodies of thoſe beaſts, vpon which the ſinnes of the people were put, (whoſe bloud was offered by the High Prieſt in the holy place) as things accurſed, were burnt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the campe of the people of Iſrael, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 1. 11, 12. and 6. 30. and 16. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 11, 12. So Chriſt as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that bare the curſe due to the ſinnes of the people, as vnworthy the ſocietie of men, was led to be crucified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Secondly, that thereby he might teach vs to take notice of it, that we haue here no abiding Citie, and muſt not looke for any long peaceable entertainment in the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14246:183"/>
world, but muſt ſeeke an abiding Citie in the world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. Thirdly, that thereby we might be armed and reſolued to goe to him without the campe, bearing his reproach, not caring what indignities we finde from the world, ſo we may meet with <hi>Ieſus, Heb.</hi> 13. 13. Fourthly, he was caſt out of the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that he might bring vs into the heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The particular place was called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> (that is to ſay,) a place of a Skull. Why this place was called <hi>Golgotha</hi> is not with one conſent affirmed. Many of the Fathers ſay it was called the place of the Skull, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was buried there, and his Skull was found there. Some haue ſaid it was called ſo of a little Hill that was in the place, of the likeneſſe of a mans Skull. But the moſt likely opinion is, that it was ſo called, becauſe it was a place full of Skuls of dead men that had beene executed there: and ſo it muſt needs be a place, whither only noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders were brought, and beſides a place of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of the touch of dead bodies. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſuffered in this place, Firſt, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, that ſaid, he ſhould be deſpiſed and reiected of men, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 3. Secondly, that ſo for our exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, he might cure the barrenneſſe of our iuſtification and ſaluation in the very place of condemned men, whom Iuſtice had ſentenced to die: and that he might deliuer vs from the place of eternall Iudgement, where wee ſhould haue all lyen as ſo many dead mens skuls, and bring vs to a place of eternall ioy. Thirdly, hee is defiled with the dead, that we might be deliuered from the filthineſſe that is in the world, and be preſented pure before God, being waſhed in his bloud.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond point, that is, the things that fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his crucifying, we haue three things noted in the ſtorie. The firſt is about his carrying of his Croſſe. The ſecond is about his ſpeech to the women that met him on the way. The third is about a potion they gaue him, when he was come to the place where he muſt ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>About the cariage of his Croſſe, it is noted in the ſtorie, both that they made him carry his owne Croſſe, and that
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14246:184"/>
when by reaſon of his former Agonie in the Garden, and ill vſage by <hi>Pilate</hi> and the ſouldiers, he was not able to carry it any further, they compelled one <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> to carry it to the place of execution.</p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour carried his Croſſe for diuers reaſons. Firſt, that thereby he might fulfill the figures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for <hi>Iſaack</hi> who was a type of Chriſt, carried the wood for the Sacrifice, when <hi>Abraham</hi> would offer him vp to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 6. Secondly, that thereby he might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that he had taken vpon him the malediction of the Law due to vs, and carried it vpon his owne ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>Simons</hi> carrying of the Croſſe diuers things are thought to be ſignified in the ſtorie. Firſt, that when godly men faint vnder the burthen of their croſſes, God will ſend ſome helpe; he will prouide one <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> or other to helpe vs. Secondly, that there is a ſpirituall fellowſhip and conſociation betweene Chriſt and the Saints in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: The Martyrs carried Chriſts croſſe; their afflictions are Chriſts afflictions, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his ſufferings, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 24. Thirdly, this <hi>Simon</hi> was a <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> a ſtranger to Chriſt, and not a <hi>Iew,</hi> and is now made to beare his Croſſe, and in bearing it, is firſt diſcouered to be a diſciple of Chriſt; which might ſignifie two things: The one that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould haue their part in Chriſt crucified: and the other that men are ſtrangers to Chriſt, till they ſuffer for him: if wee be at peace in the world, and are not put to beare Chriſts croſſe, we are ſtill ſtrangers to Chriſt. Some conceiue that the intereſt of the Gentiles in the Croſſe of Chriſt was intimated by that that the Euangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Simon</hi> came from the country <hi>Evilla ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>a,</hi> now <hi>Pagos</hi> was the Greek terme for a village, whence came vp the terme of Pagans, which now noted the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Concerning our Sauiours ſpeech to certaine women that met him by the way, the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 23. 27. to 32. notes both the occaſion of it, and the matter of it. The occaſion was, that as he went to execution, a great company of people followed him, and women alſo which bewailed and lamented him. Now it is noted of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14246:184"/>
that paſſing ouer the forlorne multitude, as men that were ſenſleſſe, and not yet ripe for repentance for their late horrible crime in crying to haue him crucified, he turnes his ſpeech to the mournefull women: and in that ſpeech, Firſt, he compaſſionately ſeekes to reſtraine their lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him. Secondly, he foretels the horrible miſery ſhall fall vpon that Citie, which he deſcribes both by intimation, when hee bids them weepe for themſelues and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and by way of aggrauation expreſſes the horror of the deſtruction ſhall fall vpon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by telling how they ſhall be affected in that day, wiſhing they neuer had had poſteritie, <hi>v.</hi> 29. and that they might ſpeedily die before they felt it, <hi>v.</hi> 30. Thirdly, he giues a reaſon of it by an argument taken from the leſſe to the greater: If God ſuffer men to ſhew ſuch ſeueritie vpon Chriſt that flouriſhed in grace and good workes like a greene tree, how can they eſcape Gods terrible vengeance that haue beene voide of all goodneſſe and good works, like a dry tree fit for nothing but the fire? And out of all this I will obſerue a few inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may ſee what power teares haue ouer Chriſt. Hee that for no words or terrors would ſpeake to <hi>Pilate, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> or the <hi>Iewes,</hi> now of himſelfe with great compaſſion anſwers the teares of theſe women. God is much moued with the teares of tender-hearted perſons. He muſt needs ſpeake to a melting heart. Howſoeuer theſe women were wrought vpon we know not, but ſure it is that God can deny nothing to a broken and contrite heart. The teares of ſuch perſons are ſtrong arguments with God. The like to this we reade of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The vniuſt death of godly perſons hath more comfort in it, than the life of wicked men. They muſt not weepe for <hi>Chriſt</hi> dying that haue great cauſe to weepe for the <hi>Iewes</hi> liuing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Publike miſeries vpon the Church and State where we liue are to bewailed. And out of <hi>verſe</hi> 29. and 30. we may obſerue theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſtrange puniſhments ſhall be to the workers of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:14246:185"/>
iniquitie: Notorious offenders ſhall be followed with nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iudgements. Though God may ſpare for a time, yet there daies are comming vpon them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wicked men are monſtrous impatient when God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits them for their ſinnes. They bleſſe the barren and wiſh to die. Iudgements when they come from God haue ſuch a face of terror, and a guilty conſcience is ſo outragious, and beſides when outward things are taken from the wicked, they are vtterly vndone in their owne ſenſe: and if they be no better able to beare temporall iudgements, what will they doe when they come to ſuffer eternall torments? And here is implied, that a Chriſtian that can ſtand in the euill day vndaunted, is an excellent creature, one of a thouſand: if godlineſſe did neuer appeare to be of great worth, yet in the euill day it is moſt remarkable, for that it works vpon godly perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſay, It is good to be barren, or to be dead, only for temporall croſſes, is the ſaying not of God, nor any godly, but of wicked men only.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wicked men neuer begin to talke of their miſery till it be vpon them.</p>
                  <p>And out of <hi>verſe</hi> 31. we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ote</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt and ſo godly Chriſtians are like a greene tree, they alwaies flouriſh whether they be in proſperitie or aduerſitie, they are good, and they doe good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That wicked men are like a dry tree: and ſo to haue a heart void of gifts, and the affections of godlineſſe, and a conuerſation void of good works, is a ſigne of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That if iudgement begin at the houſe of God, where ſhall the wicked and ſinners appeare? If profitable Chriſtians ſuffer from men, how ſhall vnprofitable people eſcape ſuffering from God? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thus of his ſpeech to the women. The third thing that befell our Sauiour before his crucifying, was a Potion which they gaue him when he was come to the place of execution. Concerning which Saint <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, They gaue him <hi>wine</hi> mingled with <hi>mirrhe, Mark.</hi> 15. 23. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:14246:185"/>
They gaue him <hi>vineger</hi> mingled with <hi>gall, chap.</hi> 27. 34. As for the reaſon of this fact, it is generally receiued amongſt Diuines, that either the Iudges appointed, or that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> out of pitie to the malefactors, going to execution, prepared a Potion of ſtrong wine the better to comfort them againſt death, or to inebriate their ſenſes, ſo as they ſhould not feele the paines of crucifying. And it is gueſſed that this was a cuſtome euen in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that ſentence hee vſeth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 6. <hi>Giue ſtrong drinke to him that is ready to periſh, and wine to him that is of a heauy heart.</hi> If the Potion were giuen only to cheere their hearts, it was a worke of mercy, at leaſt in their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if it were to make them drunke, it was horrible cruelty to the ſoules of the poore creatures, that ſhould be better prepared for death. Now for reconciling of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Euangeliſts, (to omit many opinions) I thinke their iudgement is the moſt probable, that ſay that the women of Ieruſalem gaue him <hi>wine</hi> mingled with <hi>mirrhe,</hi> but the Souldiers and the Iewes out of very ſpight and cruelty changed it into <hi>vineger</hi> mingled with <hi>gall.</hi> Now it is ſaid of the firſt Potion, he receiued it not, and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when he had taſted he would not drinke of it. By all which was ſignified,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt hath paid for our vicious pleaſures, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the cup of gall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That true ſolace and comfort is not to be found or ſought from the earth, or the men of this world, who in ſtead of ſweet incouragements, vſually doe of purpoſe giue vnto Gods ſeruants drinke of gall and vineger, that is, proffer them all occaſions of vexation and diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>And for further vſe let vs conſider, that it was our ſinnes that were this gall and vineger to Chriſt. If we blame the <hi>Iewes</hi> for giuing him ſuch a Potion, let vs iudge our ſelues for our ſins, for it was we that gaue him this gall to drinke, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third queſtion in the diuiſion: Chriſt was crucified for theſe Reaſons or Vſes. Firſt, that thereby it might appeare that he was the true Meſſias and Sauiour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:14246:186"/>
to the Fathers, as he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 28. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that thereby he might deriue the malediction of the Law vpon himſelfe which was due to vs, and that we might poſſeſſe and inherit the bleſſing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. Thirdly, that by a vertue flowing from his crucifying, the viciouſnes of our corrupt natures might be aboliſhed, that we might not afterwards ſerue ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. Fourthly, that our debts being there paid, the hand-writing that was againſt vs might be cancelled, ſo as our ſinnes ſhould be no more remembred of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. But the ſpeciall thing to be conſidered in Chriſts crucifying is to looke vpon it as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered vp to God for the ſinnes of the elect, in which an atonement and expiation is made for our ſinnes. About this Sacrifice diuers things are to be inquired into: As firſt, who is the Prieſt? And that is Chriſt, conſidered in both Natures, as is proued in many chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And he is indeed the only Prieſt of the New Teſtament, conſidered really, for he came in ſtead of all the Leuiticall Prieſts, &amp; his Prieſthood is euerlaſting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24. becauſe it doth not paſſe from man to man by ſucceſſion, as the Leuiticall High Prieſthood did. Secondly, what is the Sacrifice? and that is Chriſt as he is man, or the manhood of Chriſt: ſo we are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified by the offering vp of the body of Ieſus, Heb.</hi> 10. 10. and this Sacrifice of his was not an <hi>Euchariſticall,</hi> but an whole burnt offering, or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie Sacrifice, ſuch a Sacrifice as was ſeized vpon by the fire of Gods wrath and all burnt to aſhes. Thirdly, what was the Altar? And that was the Godhead of Chriſt, not the Croſſe properly, becauſe <hi>the Altar ſanctifieth the gift, Matth.</hi> 23. 19. and that which ſanctified the Humanitie, that it might be a meritorious Sacrifice, was the Diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon which it was laid and preſented to God. Fourthly, how often this Sacrifice was offered? <hi>viz.</hi> but once only, as is proued, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. and 9. 28. 25. Fifthly, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of this Sacrifice, which appeares by the fruit of it, and by the continuance of it: The fruit of it was both the bearing of our ſinnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. and the taking away of our ſins from before Gods ſight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. ſo as he made
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:14246:186"/>
thereby a perfect atonement and propitiation for our ſinnes, God ſmelling a ſauour of reſt, and his ſacrifice being a ſweet ſmelling ſauour vnto God, ſo as he is well pleaſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. And beſides, by this Sacrifice we are conſecrated as a holy and peculiar people to God, as the Prieſts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. Thus of the fruit of it. The continuance of the Atonement and fruit of this Sacrifice is for euer, it was not ſuch as needed to be renued, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. for <hi>he is a Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is required of vs, that we may haue benefit of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and crucifying for vs? And ſo three things chiefly are required: Firſt, that we be crucified with him, not only in ſorrow for his ſufferings, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 12. but in bewailing our ſinnes, and croſſing the corrupt diſpoſition of our Natures, and forſaking the vaine pleaſures and glories of this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Secondly, that we looke vpon Chriſt by faith, as the Sacrifice offered for vs, or the brazen Serpent lifted vp vpon the Croſſe for vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. Thirdly, wee muſt be ſanctified as a people willing to conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God as a liuing ſacrifice, ſoule and body for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p>The fourth point is the manner how he was crucified, and ſo ſix things are diſtinctly to be noted.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That he put off his garments, and ſuffered naked.</item>
                     <item>2. That he was lifted vp vpon the Croſſe.</item>
                     <item>3. That he was faſtened to the Croſſe, and faſtened with nailes driuen into his hands and feer.</item>
                     <item>4. That he hanged with his armes ſpread abroad.</item>
                     <item>5. That he was crucified in the middeſt of two Theeues.</item>
                     <item>6. That he ſuffered the effuſion of his precious bloud on the Croſſe.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, our Sauiour being to be crucified, put off his garments for diuers reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might thereby ſhew that he was ready for death, and did willingly imbrace it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might ſatisfie for the ſin of our firſt Parents, that made themſelues naked, by loſing the garment of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, in which they were created; and ſo make expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:14246:187"/>
for their abominable nakedneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That hee might vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>loath vs of ſinne and mortalitie, of which the garments giuen to our firſt Parents were a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument: for when they had ſinned, God made them gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the skinnes of dead beaſts, and put them vpon them as memorials of mortality inflicted for their ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He vnapparrelled his body amongſt men, that our ſoules might be clothed with his Righteouſneſſe before God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> entred into the earthly Paradiſe naked; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> might enter into the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſe alſo naked in body, but graced and apparelled with glory and innocencie and immortalitie, and that we might likewiſe ſo enter into heauen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That we might be comforted in the example of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if at any time we be vncloathed of earthly things, and ſuffer the ſpoile of our goods by the hands of vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he might teach vs, that he that prepares for heauen, as a man that hath vanquiſhed the world, and the Prince thereof, muſt not ſeeke earthly things, but rather forſake them as hinderances to his paſſage: The world muſt be crucified to him, and he to the world.</p>
                  <p>For the Second, he was faſtened to the Tree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That as by the Tree death entered into the world, ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tree it might be conquered, and driuen out of the world, and life and immortality brought backe againe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the old ſhadowes might be fulfilled, <hi>Iſaack</hi> was laid vpon the wood for ſacrifice: and the brazen Serpent was faſtened to the tree, and ſo the ſacrifices were laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was faſtened with nailes for foure reaſons: The one that the Scriptures might be fulfilled that ſaid of him, <hi>They haue digged into my hands and my feet, Pſal.</hi> 22. 17. The other that he might thereby declare, that the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing that was againſt vs, was cancelled, and therefore he nailed it on high on the Croſſe, that it might appeare to be of no force, and ſo that we might be deliuered from the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were but as ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:14246:187"/>
or Bills of our hands againſt vs. Thirdly, that by his wounds, we might be cured of the ſpirituall wounds, with which the old Serpent had wounded our Natures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14. Fourthly, that when we are wounded by the enemies of the Truth, we might beare them as the markes of the Lord Ieſus in our bodies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>For the Third point, hee was lifted vp on high on the Croſſe for three reaſons. Firſt, that thereby he might fulfill the figure of the old Law, for the ſacrifices were lifted vp vpon the Altar, and there ſacrificed, <hi>And as Moſes lifted vp the brazen Serpent, ſo muſt the Sonne of Man be lift vp, Iohn</hi> 3. 14. Secondly, that he might thereby carry on high in his body our ſinnes, and ſo take them away, and make it manifeſt he was ſacrificed for vs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 26. 28. Thirdly, that being lifted vp into the Aire, he might ſubdue and triumph ouer the ſpirits that rule in the Aire, that is, the Deuill, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth point, hee was crucified with his hands ſpread abroad: Firſt, that he might draw all men vnto him, and vnite both Iewes and Gentiles among themſelues. This day of his crucifying was the day which the Prophet <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9, 10. in which he ſhould remoue and take vp the ſinnes of the world, and make peace amongſt men, ſo as men ſhould call one another by the preaching of the Goſpell into the communion of the Church, which hee reſembles to a Vine and Fig-tree: ſee alſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 16. Secondly, that thereby he might ſignifie his great loue to vs, readie to imbrace vs, and take vs into his armes, and beſtow vpon vs the benefits of his Paſſion, and that his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made him the more to long after vs.</p>
                  <p>For the fift point, our Sauiour ſhed his bloud on the croſſe for diuers reaſons: Firſt, that he might fulfill the figures of the old Law; for the bloud of the ſacrifices ſhadowed out the effuſion of Chriſts bloud. Secondly, that thereby he might make expiation for our ſinnes, and reconcile vs to God, and ſo make peace betweene God and vs, pacifying his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20. and ſo get forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our ſinnes for vs; for without effuſion of bloud
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14246:188"/>
there could be no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 18, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. Thirdly, that his bloud might be a fountaine and lauer, in which our ſoules might be waſhed and purged from all our ſinnes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 7. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. &amp; 20. 22. Fourthly, that the partition wall might be broken downe, and Iewes and Gentiles be made one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12, &amp;c. Fiftly, that we might be deliuered from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. Sixtly, that his bloud might be our drinke to eternall life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 55, 56. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, that his bloud might be an vniuerſall medicine for all the infirmities and languiſhings of our ſoules, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7. Laſtly, that thereby he might open heauen for vs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an eternall Redemption for vs. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 12. &amp; 10. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>For the ſixt point, he was crucified in the middeſt of two theeues, for diuers reaſons: Firſt, that the Scripture might be fulfilled that ſaid, <hi>Hee was reckoned among the wicked in his death, Eſay</hi> 5. 3. 12. Secondly, that he might ſanctifie the death of malefactors, that turne to God by repentance, that they might know that their kinde of death ſhall be no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to their Saluation. Thirdly, that hee might thereby ſhew, that the fruit of his death ſhould be diuided amongſt ſinners, and that he came to die for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thereby he might ſhew that he ſhould be the Iudge of the quicke and dead, of good and bad, hauing the good on his right hand, and the bad on his left.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the fourth thing in the Hiſtory of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
                  <p>The fifth point, is the things he ſuffered, while he hanged on the Croſſe: and thoſe were,
<list>
                        <item>1. The diuiſion of his garments.</item>
                        <item>2. Deriſion from the High Prieſts and people.</item>
                        <item>3. Grieuous torment both of ſoule and body.</item>
                        <item>4. Thirſt of body.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the diuiſion of his garments, the Euangeliſts ſay that the Souldiers diuided them into foure parts, to each one a part; and for his Coat without ſeame, for it they caſt Lots who ſhould haue it: and all this was done.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:14246:188"/>
1. That the Scriptures might be fulfilled that had foretold of ſo much, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thereby might bee ſignified, that the goods of Chriſt and his grace ſhould be diuided euen amongſt his enemies, and that he would inrich them that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enemies to him: which we reade was fulfilled in the Story of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and is ſtill found to be true by experience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The diuiſion of his garments into foure parts, ſignified that the grace of Chriſt ſhould be caried into all the foure parts of the world, and diuided amongſt the Elect, whoſe ſinnes crucified Ieſus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The not diuiding of his Coat without ſeame, imported ſome Myſtery, as that the whole righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is giuen to the godly without parting of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The caſting of lots for it whoſe it ſhould be, ſhewed that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ints in light is by lot, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the deriſion he ſuffered, it is obſerued by the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 27. 39, &amp;c. that they that went by <hi>wagged their heads at him,</hi> vpbraiding him with the deſtruction of the Temple; and the chiefe Prieſts, and Scribes, and Elders derided him many wayes, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, mocking at his Miracles and truſt in God: and the Theeues alſo that were crucified with him, vpbraided him; alſo the ſtanders by mocked him about the very prayers hee offered vp to God, peruerting his words wilfully, as if he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſome creature to helpe him: ſo that he was here on all hands deſpiſed as a worme and no man; and all this he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That from thoſe often extreme contempts powred out vpon Chriſt at other times &amp; now, we might be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to know how hatefull our ſinnes are to God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſinnes by which we and our firſt Parents haue deſpiſed or ſlighted God, and diſhonoured him, and cauſed others to blaſpheme his Name, in that God doth
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:14246:189"/>
ſo reuenge our Tranſgreſſions vpon his Sonne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That wee being deliuered from that eternall ſcorne and contempt which was due to vs, might in this life inioy the comfort of a good name, and in the life to come eternall glory before God and his Angels: Chriſts ignominie did merit and procure our honour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That by his example wee might be comforted, and by his ſilence and patience learne to deſpiſe the ſhame and ſcornes of ſinfull men, and not render reuiling for reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps runne in mens mindes to wiſh that our Sauiour would haue done as they ſaid, ſeeing they promiſe to beleeue in him, if he could ſaue himſelfe from the Croſſe. But let men conſider: firſt, that our Redemption had beene hindered, if he had not died on the Croſſe, and beſides being brought to that houre, as our ſurety, hee could not come downe till he had ſatisfied Gods iuſtice: and further, he had denied to worke Miracles in his life time, when they and <hi>Herod</hi> defired him to doe it, becauſe they were an adulterous generation, and caſt off of God, who was now loth to haue them conuert, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 10. Neither would they haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted though they had had their deſire; and if Miracles would haue ſatisfied them, he had done ſtore of them in his life time, and in that kinde, he had ſaued himſelfe from the hands of a multitude that intended to kill him, as when they tooke vp ſtones in the Temple to ſtone him; and it was more that he did, to riſe from the dead, then to come downe from the Croſſe; and yet they did not beleeue him. Againe, in theſe reproches we may obſerue, that wicked men doe hate god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, for the very goodneſſe that is in them, and the true glory God hath ſtamped vpon them, and the good they do: They doe not vpbraid Chriſt for any euill, no not for the euils they accuſed him of before, for they themſelues knew hee was innocent, but for the good hee had done in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing others, and for his truſt in God, and for his prayers to God.</p>
                  <p>Further, we may gather from hence, that all perſecutors are Atheiſts, though they profeſſe Religion: for theſe men,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:14246:189"/>
though learned and great men, yet blaſpheme God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride him, as if he had not power to ſaue him.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we may obſerue how malice and wickedneſſe had beſotted the Prieſts and Scribes. They alledge a place in the Pſalmes, <hi>viz. He truſted in God, let him ſaue him now, if he will haue him;</hi> which words were there vttered in the name of the wicked enemies of God: and yet theſe men ſo skilfull in the Old Teſtament, haue not the braines to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that by their owne mouthes they haue condemned themſelues. Thus doth God in his iuſtice infatuate wicked men, ſo that their owne mouthes doe betray them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſee how deſperately wickedneſſe is ſet in the hearts of men: the poore Theeues now ready to dye for their offences, yet haue no loue of <hi>Ieſus</hi> or the truth in him, but ioyne with the <hi>Iewes</hi> in reuiling <hi>Christ.</hi> It ſeemes both the Theeues reuiled <hi>Chriſt</hi> when they firſt came vp vpon the Croſſe, which increaſeth the wonder of the conuerſion of one of them.</p>
                  <p>The third thing he ſuffered was grieuous torments both of ſoule and bodie: And firſt for the torments of his bodie, they muſt needs be great, both in reſpect of what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what he then felt. Before he had beene grieuouſly pained in that Agonie in the Garden, when he ſweat bloud: and afterwards was tyed &amp; bound and carried away bound; and was buffeted and beaten with rods, and with extreme contumelie kept waking all night, and then cruelly whipt, crowned with thornes, and beaten with a Reede, and made to carry his Croſſe on his ſhoulders: and after all this to be ſo tortured with nailes in his hands and feet, it muſt needs import a moſt grieuous torment he felt: ſo as of him may be ſaid what <hi>Dauid</hi> vttered, <hi>My heart melted like wax, my tongue cleaued to the roofe of my mouth, and thou haſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me in the duſt of death, Pſal.</hi> 22. 15, 16. and this excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weakneſſe and torment of body he ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thereby he might ſatisfie for vs that had ſo often deſpiſed the power of God, and his threatnings againſt our ſins, and in generall to pay for all the ſinnes we had committed in the body.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:14246:190"/>
2. That thereby he might free vs free vs from eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our bodies, and that he might make vs ſtrong in his might, ſo as to ſay, <hi>The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> and <hi>through Christ I can doe all things.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14246:190"/>
forſaking of him may bee diuers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It may confute their opinion, that ſay he ſuffered not in ſoule at all, when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>His ſoule was made an offering for ſinne:</hi> and theſe words cannot without great iniurie to Chriſt be thought to be vttered by Chriſt in reſpect of his bodily torments: then not onely the Martyrs, but the Theeues on the Croſſe ſhould beare their paine and death more patiently than he.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It may make vs all afraid of ſin, when we ſeriouſly thinke on it, how wroth God is with his owne Sonne, to purſue him ſo that was but a ſurety, to make him vtter this pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull complaint. Can men euer thinke that God can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſinne in them, that in the ſpirit, heare Chriſt making this moane? Now was the time that the whole Sacrifice was on fire, and burning in the flame of Gods wrath.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It may greatly comfort Gods ſeruants when they are in great diſtreſſe, Chriſt was forſaken of God for a time, that they might not be forſaken for euer: and therefore wee ſhould take heed of doubting of Gods care for vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 28 and 49. 15. and reſolue vpon it, that though he leaue vs for a time, yet he will receiue vs with euerlaſting mercy, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 7, 8, 10. Yea and withall it may bee ſome comfort to weake Chriſtians, that doe too much feare leſt God will leaue them, to thinke that this feare was in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may hence gather what is the wofull caſe of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners: if it were ſuch a griefe to Chriſt to be forſaken for a time, what is their caſe that ſhall be forſaken for euer? If God thus torment his owne Sonne, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew ſinne, how can he ſpare them that haue beene tranſgreſſors from the wombe?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſhould hence learne to pitie poore Chriſtians that are afflicted in conſcience: no torments of the body are like the trouble of the conſcience, which our Sauiour ſhewes here in his owne caſe. And withall we may hence learne to iudge charitably of ſuch as ſay they are damned or forſaken of God, for we ſee it may be found in Gods deare children: though it be true that in ſome men theſe
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:14246:191"/>
words are the fruits of helliſh deſpaire.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, note in the words of Chriſt, that he expreſſeth his faith in the middeſt of his conflict: <hi>My God, my God,</hi> are words of hope, as <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> are words of feare. Whence we ſhould learne to eſteeme aſſurance, and to make vſe of it, as the only thing will be left to vs to hold by, if great extremities come vpon vs. To know that God is our God, if the chiefe ſupport of our ſpirituall life.</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing which he ſuffred while he was aliue on the Croſſe, was the Thirſt, of which he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt, Ioh.</hi> 19. and this thirſt of body he ſuffered: Firſt, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, that ſaid, <hi>In my thirſt they gaue me vineger to drinke, Pſal.</hi> 69. 22. Secondly, that thereby he might merit the ſatisfying of our ſpirituall thirſts, and the deſires of our hearts.</p>
                     <p>In his thirſt they gaue him vineger to drinke, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſame Scripture might be fulfilled, which was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 28. Secondly, that thereby hee might expiate for the taſting of the Iuice of the forbidden fruit, and for all our ſinfull pleaſures. Thirdly, that we might be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not to looke for better intertainment from the world, but to be ſerued with ſharpe and bitter potions; for we muſt drinke of his cup, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 23.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the things our Sauiour ſuffered while he hanged aliue vpon the Croſſe. The glorious Teſtimonies giuen to Chriſt on the Croſſe while hee was yet aliue follow: and they were foure.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt, <hi>Pilate</hi> cauſed a Superſcription to be written ouer his head, in Latine, Greeke and Hebrew, in theſe words, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth the King of the Iewes:</hi> or rather, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:14246:191"/>
ſounds, <hi>Ieſus that Nazarene that King of the Iewes, Ioh.</hi> 19. 19. This Superſcription (it is likely) was written in a Table and hanged ouer our Sauiours head; for it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſo many words, in ſo many Languages in great Characters, that might be read of them that paſſed by, could be grauen vpon the head of the Croſſe. As for <hi>Pilates</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herein, ſome Writers thinke that it was the cuſtome for the ludges to ſet ouer the heads of them that died, the cauſe of their death. Yet we reade not of any ſuch cuſtome in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of any Title ſet ouer the heads of the two Theeues: It is very probable that <hi>Pilate</hi> meant in this Title both to vp-braid the Iewes, and withall to ſaue himſelfe from blame with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to ſhew how carefull he had beene of <hi>Caeſars</hi> right. But God intended by a ſpeciall prouidence herein, to giue teſtimonie to his Sonne: which we may gather two wayes: Firſt, by the conſent of the Euangeliſts, who all make mention of this Title, which muſt needs import that they ſaw ſome myſtery in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Secondly, by the very words, for (beſides that, they containe a moſt exact deſcription of the ſubſtance of our faith in Ieſus) they are not the words of the Iewes accuſation vpon which he was condemned, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe affirmation of his glory: which is the more plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the Prieſts (gowled by the Title) would haue it mended thus, <hi>He ſaid he was King of the Iewes,</hi> yet <hi>Pilate</hi> would not alter it, his hand being ſtayed by the power of God. This Title then was giuen from God from aboue, and is of Gods owne deuiſing, and ſhe was vs, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith, what God himſelfe acknowledgeth, and what he would haue vs make vſe of in the meditation of the Paſſion of Chriſt. Many things may be hence noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God acknowledgeth his Name vpon the Croſſe to be Ieſus, that is, a Sauiour of his people from their ſins. This name was giuen him, by an Angell before hee was horne, with this ſignification, yea with an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Diuinitie, that he was <hi>Emmanuel, God with vs, Matth.</hi> 1. 22, 23. And now on the Croſſe did he fulfill what was ſignified, and God doth acknowledge that in that houre, he had made an Atonement and ſaued vs from
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:14246:192"/>
our ſins: ſo that we haue Gods owne hand to acquit vs, if we beleeue in Ieſus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God acknowledgeth him to bee that <hi>Nazarene:</hi> which title importeth his condition, and may be diuerſly interpreted. As that Ieſus was the more deare to God, euen in that wherein he was moſt deſpiſed of men: It was one of the wayes by which the Iewes derided Chriſt, to call him a <hi>Galilean</hi> or a <hi>Nazarene;</hi> as intending thereby to proue he could not be a fit man to ſaue <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in that hee was not a <hi>Bethlehemite,</hi> and of the houſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> But this reproach God puts into the crowne of Ieſus, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, That he can loue and honour ſuch as men reproach and deride. It was a Nick-name giuen to true Chriſtians as well as to Chriſt, to be called <hi>Galileans</hi> by the Iewes. Beſides, he was that <hi>Nazarite,</hi> in as much as he was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to God, and had all thoſe perfections of holineſſe, of which the <hi>Nazarites</hi> in the Law were types. But chiefly I thinke by this Title is ſignified, that Chriſt was that Branch foretold by the Prophets, <hi>His name was the Branch:</hi> which terme in the Hebrew is <hi>Netzar, Iſai.</hi> 11. 1. And God would by this Addition tell the Chriſtian Church that he can raiſe the Kingdome of his Sonne out of the duſt, and from ſmall beginnings can erect a mightie frame of Soueraigntie and power to his Sonne Ieſus: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to comfort vs in our abaſements: that God that can lay the foundation of Chriſts Kingdome, in ſuch extreme abaſements of Chriſt, can glorifie his power and grace to his people, euen in reſcuing them from their loweſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That God acknowledgeth Ieſus not only to be a King, but that King by an excellencie, that the Prophecies had made ſuch honourable mention of, and that excelled all the Kings of the earth. God now giues him a Name aboue euery Name that is named, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. The name of a King is greateſt on earth, and amongſt Kings, <hi>Ieſus</hi> is that King that excells them all; and that in diuers reſpects, as that in the preheminence of his Perſon, and in the excellency of his gifts for gouernment, and in reſpect of his indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:14246:192"/>
and in the extent of his Kingdome, hee being a King vniuerſall, and other Kings being but his ſubiects, and in the Laws by which he gouernes, and in the power of his prerogatiue, and in diſtributing of Iuſtice, and in the nature of his kingdome, and in the continuance of his kingdome, as hath beene ſhewed in the former Article of the <hi>Creed,</hi> vpon the word <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  </div>
                  <div type="question_and_answer">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why would God haue the Chriſtian Churches to know that Ieſus is a King, and ſuch a King, and why doth he tell it them now when Ieſus is in ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious a condition?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That they might know that his kingdome comes not by obſeruation, and that neither his right nor his power is loſt by any outward abaſements: Hee can triumph vpon the Croſſe, and can come forth of ſo low a condition, to conquer as a mighty King: and withall, that they might know for euer, that tribulations ſhal not hinder the kingdom of Chriſt, and that he can bring ſtrange things to paſſe, when all humane helpes doe faile.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they might know that he was able to ſaue them by application, as he now did by merit: He did like a great King pay the Ranſome for all the Elect on the Croſſe: as he is called of God a King, to let vs know that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs in the day of our ſaluation, by making his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings effectuall for all the worke of our redemption; and can grant vs better priuiledges than any of the Kings of the earth: See the firſt vſe of the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That notice might hereby bee giuen to the Chriſtian world, that the redemption made in the bloud of Ieſus muſt giue no liberty to ſin: for he was a King, and would looke for ſeruice and ſubiection, and that we ſhould doe all that to him, which ſubiects owe to their Soueraignes, as to ſtudie the myſteries, and bowe at the Name of Ieſus, and ſtand for his honour, and obſerue whatſoeuer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, fearing to diſpleaſe him in any thing, yeelding themſelues to be gouerned by his ordinances.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Chriſtians might be incouraged to ſeeke to <hi>Ieſus</hi> in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:14246:193"/>
all time of diſtreſſe, ſeeing he is ſo great a King, and hath had ſuch experience of ſorrowes himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is to be noted, that God acknowledgeth <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be the King of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> which imports the great glory of Chriſts power and ſoueraigntie, that can raiſe vp a Kingdome to himſelfe, euen among the very <hi>Iewes</hi> that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him: which was ſhortly after made manifeſt, when ſo many thouſands of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were conuerted to the faith of Chriſt: of the <hi>Iewes</hi> I ſay, not thoſe <hi>Iewes</hi> that ſaid they were <hi>Iewes,</hi> and were not, but were the Synagogue of Satan, but of the ſpirituall <hi>Iewes, Rev.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, this Title was written in three Languages, and that was to ſignifie that euery tongue ſhould confeſſe the glory of <hi>Ieſus, Phil.</hi> 3. 11. ſo as the Goſpell ſhould be carried into all Nations, It is likely <hi>Pilate</hi> did it, that ſo the people of all Nations that were at the Paſſeouer might vnderſtand the Title: but God did it to ſhew that the Goſpell ſhould be carried into the whole world. Theſe three languages were the moſt knowne of all the reſt. The <hi>Latine</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> by reaſon of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the antiquitie of it, and being the language of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But why in three lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages? but to ſhew vs that God would haue his ſeruice, and his will made knowne in the mother tongue of their Nation: and withall to ſignifie that neither the ſuperſtition of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor the wiſdome of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> neither power of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſhould hinder the conqueſt of <hi>Ieſus</hi> in his kingdome.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Pilate</hi> though moued to it, would not alter a letter of the Title. Which ſhould teach vs, that no aduerſarie power in the world can hinder the kingdome, or ſaluation by <hi>Ieſus:</hi> and that God will not ſuffer vs to loſe a iote of our right in Chriſt: and withall ſuch Chriſtians as can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Sectaries,</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> to alter the records of their faith, and put out and deface one Article after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe Chriſtians are not true Chriſtians, and in ſome reſpect worſe to <hi>Ieſus</hi> than this Heathen man was.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the firſt teſtimonie giuen to our Sauiour vpon the Croſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:14246:193"/>
The ſecond teſtimonie was giuen by the darkneſſe that fell out from the ſixth houre to the ninth. About this darkneſſe two things are to be inquired after: Firſt, the manner of it, and then what it might ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>For the manner of it: It was without queſtion miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: for firſt it falling out at the time of the Paſſeouer, which was the fifteenth day of the Moone, the Moone was then at the full, whereas the Sunne is neuer eclipſed in the courſe of Nature but in the new Moone: and beſides Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſeemes to import that there was a darkneſſe brought vpon the whole earth, beſides the darkning of the Sunne, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 44, 45. And whereas Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>it was ouer all the earth,</hi> Interpreters are diuided in opinion about the meaning of <hi>all the earth.</hi> Some thinke it was but ouer all the land, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Iudea:</hi> other thinke it was ouer all the world. About this latter opinion, ſomething ſeemes to make for it, and ſomething makes againſt it: for it ſeemes to be the teſtimonie of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> who is ſaid to ſee it in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and of the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> that ſeeing it ſhould ſay, Now either the world is periſhing, or the God of Nature ſuffers: and of <hi>Oroſius,</hi> that ſaid it was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ioyned with great trembling of the Earth; and of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who ſaith it was in <hi>Bithinia.</hi> Againſt it ſeemes to be manifeſt reaſon: for with the <hi>Antipodes</hi> it was at that houre midnight: and it could not be at the ſixth houre in all places. It is very likely it was chiefly in <hi>Iudea,</hi> but yet ſo as in the neighbouring Countries it might be obſerued, and a part of the darkneſſe might extend thither.</p>
                     <p>Now for the ſecond point, many things may be hereby ſignified, as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It might ſignifie that the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe did now ſet: That the true light and life of the world was now a dying.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It might ſignifie the horrible blindneſſe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and foretell the ſpirituall darkneſſe ſhould be confirmed vpon them, that as heretofore the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had darkneſſe, and in the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> was light, and by that darkneſſe was ſignified the imminent deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:14246:194"/>
and by that light the liberty and ſaluation of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> ſo now the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould be left in horrible darknes and deſolation, and the light of the Goſpell ſhould ſhine in other Nations to bring ſaluation to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It might import the deteſtation of that fact. The great light of the world withdrawes his beames, as abhorring to ſee ſo dreadfull a ſpectacle, as the Sonne of God cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, or to vouchſafe light to ſo miſchieuous creatures as the <hi>Iewes</hi> about ſuch a worke, and at that very time railing and blaſpheming.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It might ſignifie the vnſpeakable vileneſſe of our ſinnes, ſeeing that at the time they were opened, and by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid vpon our ſurety, the very frame of Nature is turned vpſide downe: and it was vſuall in Scripture, by the threatning of the darkning of the Sunne, to ſet out the wrath of God againſt the ſinne of man, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 32. 7, 8. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 10. 30. 31. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> 8. 9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It did moſt euidently ſignifie the Diuinitie of Chriſt: this and all other miracles which fell out at that time, were therefore wrought that it might appeare hee was more than man that ſuffered: If he had died without miracles, he might haue beene thought to be but a meere man; and that our faith might be ſtrengthned by the greatneſſe of the wonders, that otherwiſe might be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ignominie of his ſuffering ſo vile a death as to be hanged on a Tree.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Was it not to teach vs compaſſion? Is Nature troubled at this ſight, and doth the Sunne mourne, and couer it ſelfe with blackneſſe as with a garment? and cannot our hard hearts be melted to mourne for him, who was pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for our ſinnes?</p>
                     <p>Thus of the ſecond Teſtimonie. The third Teſtimonie was the conuerſion of one of the Theeues vpon the Croſſe: and his conuerſion did notably ſerue to demonſtrate the glory of Chriſt, both in reſpect of his Diuinitie that could conuert a ſoule without meanes: he muſt needs be more than man that can immediatly make the heart of man new: as alſo in reſpect of the vertue of his Paſſion and Death,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14246:194"/>
which ſo liuely ſhewes it ſelfe vpon the ſoule of the Theefe, in killing his corrupt humours, and kindling in him the life of true grace: and both the more wonderfull in reſpect of the circumſtance of the time, that it was when Chriſt was on the Croſſe, derided of men, and plagued of God, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his owne, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now in particular concerning this conuerſion, I would make vſe of three things: By conſidering firſt who was conuerted. 2. When he was conuerted. 3. How he ſhewed the truth of his conuerſion.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt: The perſon conuerted was one of the two Theeues: whence we may gather, That notorious malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors may repent and be ſaued: for God is abundant in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the bloud of Chriſt is of vnſpeakable value: which as it ſhould teach vs to admire Gods goodneſſe, ſo it ſhould keepe vs from deſpairing of any, though their courſe be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo vile, ſo long as God continues the day of his grace, and prolongs his patience towards them.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond: He was conuerted at his laſt end, euen when he was ready to die vpon the Croſſe. I ſuppoſe diuers that heare but this point named, will hence gather that men may repent them at their latter end, euen at the laſt gaſpe. It is true that a man may be ſaued that repents not before his end: This Theefe was ſaued; and they that went into the Vineyard at the eleuenth houre: and God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to receiue the ſinner in what day ſoeuer he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and repent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. But yet leſt men ſhould abuſe this example to confirme themſelues in that moſt dangerous procraſtination, conſider with me foure things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we here reade of one that repented at his latter end, that no man might deſpaire; and yet but one, that no man might preſume.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the conuerſion of this Theefe was an immediate worke of the diuine power of Chriſt, and ſo a dreadfull miracle: and though this one man was ſaued ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily without meanes, yet that doth not proue that God will doe ſo to other men: if Chriſt doe conuert thee at thy latter end, he doth as great a worke, as to raiſe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14246:195"/>
the dead, or darken the Sunne, and cleaue the rocks, or the like. And what warrant haſt thou that thou ſhalt be ſaued by miracle?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That men haue as much reaſon to be afraid they ſhall not repent, becauſe the other Theefe did not repent at his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, as to thinke they ſhall, becauſe this Theefe did repent.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That it is ſaid by them that went into the Vineyard at the eleuenth houre, that therefore they went not in ſooner, becauſe no man hired them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. which was like to be the caſe of this Theefe. He neuer was called before, he had not had the meanes of conuerſion: but this can be no ground for ſuch as haue had the meanes from the third, or ſixth, or ninth houre, and will not be hired, nor perſwaded to enter into the Vineyard, but put all off till the eleuenth houre. Indeed if men had neuer had the meanes till their old age, or ſickneſſe, they might haue the better aſſurance that God would ſhew mercy, but this is not the caſe of moſt of our people.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the repentance of this Theefe had a great deale of buſineſſe in it, more than ſaying three words at his latter end; as will appeare by opening the third point, and that is how he ſhewed the truth of his conuerſion.</p>
                     <p>So that for the third point, we may obſerue in the ſtorie of his conuerſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. that he ſhewed three excellent fruits of his conuerſion. The one was reproofe of ſinne in his fellow: The other was his confeſſion that he made both concerning himſelfe and Chriſt: The third was his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prayer to Chriſt for mercy.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. that when the other malefactor railed on Chriſt, he anſwered and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, ſaying, <hi>Doſt not thou feare God, ſeeing that thou art in the ſame condemnation?</hi> Out of which words I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue diuers things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a true conuert cannot abide ſin, or that God ſhould be diſhonoured by thoſe that they conuerſe withall: He that repents of his owne ſinne may diſcerne it by his true diſlike of ſinne in others. They are farre from true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14246:195"/>
that can liue in places where God is daily diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and yet haue not their hearts vexed, or their tongues looſed to reproue ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he that will reproue ſinne in others, muſt be ſure they haue mouing and effectuall arguments. They muſt haue skill to admoniſh. We ſee here what a ſtirring ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the conuerted Theefe brings. Yea it is true, that if the hatred of ſinne be ſincere in vs, it will furniſh vs with ſolid arguments to furniſh reproofe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the want of the feare of God is the cauſe of all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: as it was of this mans rayling, ſo it is of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoredome, ſwearing, ſtealing, lying, vſurie, and the like; if men had the feare of God before their eyes they would not doe ſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That ſuch as do abuſe Chriſt by ſcoffing or rayling, haue great cauſe to be afraid of God, and what he will doe to them, though they eſcape puniſhment amongſt men. Such ſinnes as men will not puniſh God will, eſpecially theſe ſinnes of ſcorning, or reproching Chriſt, and true Chriſtians, and the ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That a true conuert doth loue Chriſt better than his old acquaintance: as here the Theefe ſpeakes againſt his old comrade and companion, and for Chriſt, though he had neuer ſeene him before.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That ſuch as will ſcoffe and raile at the truth, haue no feare of God in them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That for a man not to repent when the iudgement of God is vpon him, is a ſigne of a careleſſe and graceleſſe heart. It is a wickedneſſe or ſtubbornneſſe to be wondred at, that a man being vnder the execution of condemnation, as a malefactor, ſhould yet be void of the feare of God: ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 3, 4. Hee that will not thinke of paying his debts, when the Arreſt is ſerued vpon him, hath no minde to pay it at all. And the childe that relenteth not when he is vnder the rod, is in a manner paſt grace. So is it with men, that haue hearts like Adamants when Gods ſpeciall hand is vpon them. <hi>Doſt not thou feare God?</hi> As if he would ſay, though others were careleſſe, yet it is
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14246:196"/>
an infinite ſhame for thee, that art in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to feare God.</p>
                     <p>Now for his confeſſion that he made, it ſtands of two parts: In the one he doth penitently accuſe himſelfe, and his fellow, as ſuffering iuſtly, and receiuing the due reward of their deeds: and in the other he doth excuſe Chriſt, and auouch that hee hath done nothing amiſſe, or that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, or out of place, as the originall word doth import, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt part of his Confeſſion, I obſerue theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That without confeſſion of ſinne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>here can be no true repentance, <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 13. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That a true Conuert doth from his heart acknowledge that he hath deſerued all the miſeries are inflicted vpon him from God or man: and doth patiently ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to beare them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 7, 8. without ſtomack, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or deſire of reuenge vpon ſuch as are inſtruments of his puniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he that reproues ſinne in others in ſincerity of heart, doth acknowledge ſinne in himſelfe, if he be guilty of the ſame, or the like offence: The repenting Theefe makes this confeſſion in his owne name, as well as in the name of the railing Theefe.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond part of his Confeſſion, I obſerue;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a ſigne of true grace, to haue from the heart an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable opinion of Gods ſeruants, though they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſgraced, and ſlandered, and reuiled; as in the Theefe here, to beleeue Chriſt did nothing amiſſe, though almoſt all the world accuſed him, and put him to death as a malefactor.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That in Religion it is not enough to be free from groſſe ſinnes, but we muſt be free from the ſinnes of indiſcretion and raſhneſſe: Nor is it enough to doe good duties, but we muſt doe all things wiſely, and in their place: ſo the word in the originall imports.</p>
                     <p>About his prayer we are to obſerue, both what he ſaid, and what our Sauiour anſwered. His words were theſe, <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy kingdome, verſ.</hi> 42.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14246:196"/>
In which words of his prayer, I note, the wonder of his faith, the truth of his deuotion, and the humilitie of his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. His faith was to be wondered at, both for the things beleeued, and the circumſtances of beleeuing. For the things beleeued, hee here ſaith foure great things of Chriſt: Firſt, that he was Lord and King. Secondly, that his Kingdome was ſpirituall, and not of this world. Thirdly, that in that very abaſement he was poſſeſſed of a Kingdome; he ſaith not, When thou ſhalt come to reigne, but, when thou commeſt reigning. Fourthly, that he had power to let in all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners into that Kingdome. The circumſtances make it more wonderfull; that he ſhould confeſſe all this, and yet haue no Preacher to inſtruct him, and Chriſt himſelfe ſo much abaſed, and being a man that had not ſeene his former Miracles, that he ſhould ſay thus, at this time, when the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſicke was ceaſed, and the giuing ſight to the blinde, and the raiſing of the dead; and that he ſhould thus acknowledge theſe glories in Chriſt, when the great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, the Prieſts and Scribes blaſphemed him, and could not acknowledge him for the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The truth of his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeares in this, that he askes not temporall but eternall life: He is more carefull to pray for the ſaluation of his ſoule, than for the deliuerance of his body. The humility of his petition appeares in this, that he askes not for a great place in heauen, or to ſit at his right hand, or his left (as the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> did) nor to be preferred before others, nor at all to preſcribe vnto Chriſt, but onely deſires to be remembred of him, for any place in heauen.</p>
                     <p>We muſt all learne of him, and that diuers points out of his prayer. The one is, to flie to Chriſt only, and to rely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him alone for ſaluation. Another is, to deale particularly for ourſelues, and euery one to ſay as he did, <hi>Lord remember me.</hi> Thirdly, he may teach all the Chriſtians in the world how to exerciſe their faith; euen to beleeue though it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſenſe, and aboue reaſon; for this Theefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues theſe great things of Chriſt, when there was no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of any of them, but rather of the contrary. It is the greateſt praiſe of our faith, to beleeue when we haue no ſenſe or feeling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="410" facs="tcp:14246:197"/>
And the practiſe of the Theefe in this point, doth greatly condemne a number of Chriſtians now adaies. The Theefe worſhips him, and honours him, beleeues and repents, when Chriſt was on the Croſſe in extreme ignominie: What ſhall become of them then that will not worſhip him, now, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as blaſpheme him, and diſhonour him, now that he ſits at the right hand of God?</p>
                     <p>Here is conſolation alſo: for if this be all the ſuit to Chriſt, that he would remember vs when he comes into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, this we may be ſure of if we be truly godly: for he hath now an infinite memory: and he loues vs with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable loue, and he muſt needs remember vs, for it is his office to be our Remembrancer before God: and he being our High-Prieſt, hath all our names written on his Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, ſo as he cannot chuſe but be ſtill looking vpon vs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he hath bought vs at ſuch a price, that hee hath good cauſe to remember vs; and therefore howſoeuer it goes with vs here, and though all the world forgets vs, yet we may be ſure that Ieſus Chriſt remembers vs in heauen: and if wee would haue our faith confirmed in this point, we were beſt to doe as the Theefe doth, <hi>viz.</hi> put him in minde of vs in particular, and pray him to remember vs; and withall, it will much helpe, if we remember him here on earth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him before men, and to ſtand for his honour and glory; deſiring to know and remember nothing more than Ieſus Chriſt: ſetting our affections on things aboue, where he ſits at the right hand of God.</p>
                     <p>But on the other ſide, if men be workers of iniquitie, and will not repent, and be ſuch as loue not the Lord Ieſus, and can ſpend daies, weekes, months and yeares without Chriſt in the world, he will not remember them: He cannot think of them in heauen, if they forget him on earth: Yea if they had beene acquainted with Chriſt on earth, and eaten and drunken with him, and beene of in his company, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. yea if they had died with him at the ſame time, and the ſame kinde of death (which was the caſe of the other Theefe) when Chriſt ſhall come from heauen againe, he will let them vnderſtand, that hee did not remember any ſuch
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:14246:197"/>
thing, he knew them not, all ſuch naked relations vaniſh out of his minde; if they had repented of their ſinnes, he would neuer haue forgotten them. The anſwer of our Sauiour is, <hi>Verily I ſay vnto thee, this day ſhalt thou be with mee in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe:</hi> In which anſwer we may obſerue diuers things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, as alſo diuers things concerning heauen.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the prayer of penitent ſinners gets great ſuits: here is a Kingdome giuen for asking.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That poore men may ſpeed in great ſuits, as well as great men: A poore Theefe here ſpeeds as well as if hee had beene a Patriarch or a King. What could <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> haue had more than is granted to this Theefe?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That poore ſinners obtaine ſpeedy Audiences, they are not put to long ſuits when they ſeeke the greateſt things; <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me.</hi> If we ſpeed not preſently with God, it is long of our ſelues, or God delayes for ſome reſpect of vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21, 23.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Chriſt ſtands not vpon the length, or eloquence of our prayers, he will heare a ſhort prayer as well as a long: he loues a plaine heart; if wee ſpeake the words of our hearts, and aske according to Gods will, in the name of Chriſt, we ſhall ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning heauen, it is deſcribed by the terme of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> The Scripture makes mention of a two-fold Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; The Terreſtriall, where the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was placed, and the Celeſtiall, into which the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enter. And that by Paradiſe is meant the Heauen of the bleſſed, or rather the bleſſedneſſe of glorified ſoules, is plaine, becauſe it is the kingdome mentioned by the Theefe; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes, that when he was caught vp into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, he was in the third heauen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. But here are two queſtions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> He calls heauen Paradiſe, becauſe it was that which was ſhadowed out by the earthly Paradiſe. In the earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe was a Tree of life in the middeſt thereof: &amp; in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Paradiſe, is Ieſus Chriſt the true Tree of life, by whoſe vertue and grace we ſhall liue for euer. The great pleaſures in that firſt Garden, the Trees of all ſorts, did ſhadow out the vnſpeakable variety of heauenly delights in the kingdome of Chriſt: In the earthly Paradiſe was a Riuer that diuided it ſelfe into foure heads, and ſo runne euen without the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: What is this Riuer, but the abundance of holineſſe flowing from the Holy Ghoſt, for the qualification of the Elect gathered from all the foure parts of the world, the ſtreames of which Ocean runne in the hearts of the godly in this life, euen on the outſide of Paradiſe? And at this time did our Sauiour fitly vſe this <hi>Metaphor:</hi> for thereby he ſignified, that though this world were but a place of baniſhment, yet in death Gods baniſhed ſhould returne: After all the labours, and trauells, and ſorrowes they haue felt in this curſed world, they ſhould in death come to a place of pleaſure and eternall reſt: and that as by the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> meanes, all were caſt ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In this anſwer of Chriſt diuers errours are confuted, as</p>

                     <p>Thus of the Conuerſion of the Theefe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth teſtimony giuen to Chriſt on the Croſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, was the miraculous rending of the Veile of the Temple from the top to the bottome: and that this fell out before the death of Chriſt, appeares by Saint <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 23. 45.</p>
                     <p>The Temple had three roomes in it: the one more inward (as it were our Chancell) and into that roome came only the High Prieſt once a yeare, and was called <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum, The Holy of Holies,</hi> and in that roome was the <hi>Arke,</hi> and the <hi>Mercy Seat:</hi> The next to that was the <hi>Holy place</hi> (as it were the body of our Church) and into this place came the Prieſts only to offer ſacrifice; for there was the Altar for burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, and the Altar of Incenſe, and the Table of the Shew-bread. Now without this was a third roome whither the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came to worſhip, and was called the <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> It is reſembled by our Church porch; but it was a very great roome, able to receiue a multitude of people: Now the Veile was that parted the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> from the <hi>Holy place,</hi> and was made of Blew, and Purple, and Skarlet, and fine twined linnen of cunning worke, hanged vpon foure pillars of Shittim wood ouer-layed with gold.</p>

The moſt holy place was a type of Heauen, and the holy place a type of the Church Militant on Earth, as it conſiſts only of Gods elect, as a Nation of Prieſts offering holy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to God.

                     <p>The rending of the Veile ſignified diuers things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God did abhorre and deſpiſe the Temple of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and was departed from them, with indignation, and had reiected that Nation, for their reiecting of Chriſt his Son, and that he did diſſolue all their priuiledges and ſtaine their glory. If the <hi>Iewes</hi> will forſake God, he will forſake them: and ſo will hee deale with all Nations, where he hath dwelt, if they deſpiſe his word, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and will not walke worthy of his mercies ſhewed to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. That now we haue acceſſe freely to goe to the Mercy-ſeat, euen to the Throne of Grace, with our ſuits and requeſts in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 51. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the crucifying of Chriſt: His death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. And concerning his death, I ſhall firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Propoſition, Reaſons, and Vſe in generall, and then conſider of diuers particular things that concerne the explication of the doctrine and ſtorie of his death.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt died is abundantly teſtified by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons why it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould die are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſatisfie the iuſtice of God for our ſinnes. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Chriſt therefore taking vpon him the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh as our ſurety, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinne in his fleſh by inflicting death vpon him, and ſo ſatisfied his iuſtice. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But can the death of one man ſatisfie ſo as to be accepted for the death of many men? <hi>Sol.</hi> The death of one bare or meere man cannot, bot the death of him that is the Sonne of God, both God and man, is of infinite price, and ſo an infinite ſatisfaction, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the truth of God: God had ſaid, <hi>The day thou eateſt thereof dying thou ſhale die, Gen.</hi> 2. 17. which preſently fell vpon <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of ſpirituall death, and in time inuaded his body, and ſeazed vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his poſteritie. Now Chriſt comming in the firſt
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:14246:200"/>
                     <hi>Adams</hi> ſtead, muſt ſuffer what God had threatned, and beare that puniſhment he had appointed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the fulfilling of the types and prophecies of Scripture, the Sacrifices were ſlaine: and <hi>Eſay</hi> had ſaid, <hi>He muſt be as a ſheepe led to the ſlaughter, Eſay</hi> 53. 7. and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had foretold his owne death and buriall diuers times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the ratifying of the New Teſtament, and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his laſt Will, wherein he grants by vertue of the new couenant with God, all thoſe Legacies, that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſpirituall and eternall felicitie of the Church. This will is not of force without the death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That he might aboliſh the power and kingdome of death, and ſo deliuer vs from eternall death, and from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Deuill, who had power to inflict death vpon vs, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 6. 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſeeing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death was due to vs for our ſins, how could Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs from it, ſeeing he ſuffered not eternall death? Or how did he ſuffer al was due to our ſins, ſeeing he ſuffered not eternall death? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Death in it ſelf is the wages of ſin, &amp; growes eternal only, becauſe men or deuils that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ouercome it, &amp; performe ſufficient ſatisfaction in a ſhorter time. Now Chriſt in a ſhort time makes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient payment to Gods iuſtice, and ouercomes death for vs, and that by reaſon of the worthineſſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It is more for Chriſt to die one houre, than for all the world to be dead for euer. For it is in this, as it is in a priſon into which many debtors are caſt: It is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting priſon to ſuch as cannot pay their debts: but it is but a temporarie priſon, to ſuch as either by themſelues, or any other, make full payment of what is owing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That by his death he might make a medicine to kill ſinne in vs, which might ſo eat downe the power of ſinne that it ſhould no more reigne in vs, and ſo by degrees aboliſh ſinne. He died, that we might die to ſinne by the vertue of his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That thereby he might buy life for the world: He gaue his fleſh for the life of the world, euen to purchaſe eternall
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:14246:200"/>
life for the elect world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 51.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That many ſonnes might be borne to God. Chriſt was like ſeed falling from heauen to the earth, and there dying, it quickned and brought forth many ſonnes to God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 24. yea the doctrine of Chriſt dead for our ſins is ſtill like to diuine ſeed falling into our hearts, which conuerts men and turnes them to God.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Now what vſe may we make of the conſideration of the death of Chriſt? Many things we may learne from hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſhould teach vs to be ſtedfaſt in the faith, and to beleeue and truſt vpon Gods mercies: for Chriſt died for our ſinnes, and therefore wee are certainly reconciled vnto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And God doth aſſure vs of ſo much in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould neuer be afraid of Death and Hell, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 9, 10. Chriſt by dying for vs hath deuoured and euen ſwallowed vp Death and Hell, ſo as they ſhall neuer hurt vs. As the fire conſumes the ſtubble, ſo by wonderfull Art Chriſt by dying hath conſumed all the forces and power of Death, and the ſting of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. 14. Death as a curſe was laid vpon Chriſt, that our death might be bleſſed to vs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould maruellouſly inflame our hearts with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the loue of Chriſt to vs, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Henceforth we that liue ſhould not liue to our ſelues, but to him that died for vs, and carry our ſelues as men that are dead to the world, and the ſinfull pleaſures and luſts thereof, and ſhew the proofe of the vertue of Chriſts death in vs by the mortification of our ſinnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2. 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It ſhould breed in vs a holy reſolution to ſuffer any thing for his ſake, euen to forſake Father, Mother, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Husband, yea and Life it ſelfe for his ſake and the Goſpels, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 24, 25, 26. yea it ſhould make vs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay downe our liues one for another, if our life may doe ſeruice to the Church of God and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>

6 Seeing Chriſt in death falls to the ground like a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas, we ſhould be like ſpirituall Eagles, to flie to it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we finde it, whether in the Word or Sacraments, and our ſoules ſhould feed heartily (but ſpiritually) vpon it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. And ſeeing God in his ordinances pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents vs ſtill with the dead body of his Sonne, it ſhould be a meanes to draw all men to it, and to gather into one all the children of God that were ſcattered abroad, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 52. and 12. 32, 33.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The meditation of the death of Chriſt ſhould make vs in all eſtates to liue at reſt, and in a holy ſecurity, as knowing that Chriſt died for vs, that whether we wake or ſleepe, we might liue together with him, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>If we liue, we liue to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we liue or die we are the Lords, Rom.</hi> 14. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall propoſition concerning the death of Chriſt, and the Reaſons and Vſes of it. In the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things are to be confidered:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Who died.</item>
                     <item>2. Who were the ſpeciall witneſſes of his death.</item>
                     <item>3. How he died.</item>
                     <item>4. For whom he died.</item>
                     <item>5. When he died.</item>
                     <item>6. The conſequents of his death.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, if we aske who died, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 34. anſwers, <hi>It is Chriſt which is dead.</hi> Which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, the better to ſtirre vp our hearts to conſider, both the wonder of it, and the reaſon of it. That any other man ſhould die, is no wonder, becauſe all other men were ſinfull and mortall, but here <hi>Ieſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> who onely hath immortality, dies: and withall, it leads vs to thinke of the reaſon of it, for he did not die, nay he could not die, if he had beene conſidered as a priuate perſon, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not death in his owne perſon, but he died as our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and as a publike vndertaker for vs all, hee died in our roome.</p>
                  <p>But yet we are further to inquire into this queſtion, and to conſider whether this death belong to the perſon of Chriſt,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:14246:201"/>
or only to his Natures, or to each of them, he being God and man in one perſon: And in this we muſt take heed what our hearts anſwer: for though it be true that Chriſt died in reſpect of the fleſh, ſo as it was only the fleſh that ſuffered death, in reſpect of the Nature that died, yet his death belonged to the Word, in reſpect of the Perſon: for the Word, the Lord of life and glory, ſuffered and died, not in reſpect of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, which is immutable, and altogether impaſſible, but in reſpect of his Humanitie, or in his fleſh, God did not die with the fleſh, but in the fleſh, and he died in his fleſh, that is, in that fleſh which was vnited to the diuine Nature. If the fleſh of Chriſt were the fleſh of the Sonne of God, then his dying in the fleſh, doth belong to him as the Sonne of God. Thus his bloud is ſaid to be the <hi>Bloud of God, Act.</hi> 20. 28. and this we muſt needs beleeue, for elſe his death, as a bare man, could not haue beene of ſufficient merit for all our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one thing more to be thought on about this Queſtion, and that is, that the Humanitie, that is, the ſoule and fleſh of Chriſt did in death, and after death remaine in the Perſon of the Sonne of God firmely vnited: Though the Soule was diſvnited from the Body, yet neither Body nor Soule were diſ-vnited from the Perſon of the Sonne of God. The parts of the Humane Nature were diuided in death one from another, ſo as one was on earth, and the other in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but yet both of them remained and ſubſiſted in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Nature; elſe if in death there had beene a new manner of ſubſiſting, Chriſt had had two Perſons as well as two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is Hereſie to beleeue.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, we ſhall finde in the Story of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, that the chiefe Witneſſes of Chriſts death were women, that followed Chriſt from <hi>Galile,</hi> and miniſtered to him, by name <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Ioſes,</hi> and <hi>Salome,</hi> and the mother of <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bedees</hi> children: Theſe a farre off beheld what was done. Of all the Apoſtles and ſeuentie Diſciples here is not one, but onely <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, who was by the Croſſe with the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:14246:202"/>
Thus will God exerciſe the faith of his ſeruants, the Church muſt receiue the report of the things that concerne the death of Chriſt from women, as the chiefe Witneſſes: and hereby did Chriſt honour the pietie of theſe women that followed him to the death, when the Diſciples fled and left him; which is an euerlaſting honour to their ſex, and ſhewes that God can make women glorious confeſſors of the Truth, euen at ſuch times as men hide their heads for feare. What a ſhame is this for the Apoſtles to be abſent from a ſpectacle, vpon which the ſaluation of the whole world doth depend? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, hence we may gather, that Chriſt can preſerue vnto himſelfe ſome number that profeſſe his Truth, and can arme them againſt the feare of danger, euen in the moſt deſperate perſecutions: Yea ſome ſuch as will neither flie nor hide themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third Queſtion, there are many things to be noted in the manner how Chriſt died: for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee died truly: It was not a putatiue death, but a true death. He died in deed, and not in ſhew, or appearance onely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He died a grieuous death: for hee died a painfull death, and he died a violent death, and he died a curſed death. There were certain in ancient times that held that Chriſt receiued many wounds, was ſmitten, whipped, nailed, and ſhed his bloud, and died, his Soule going out of his Body; but yet neuer indeed felt any paine. He had, they ſaid, a body that could ſuffer, but not a Nature that could grieue, or feele paine. But that he did feele paine, is not <note place="margin">Vid. Amand. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. de morte Chriſti.</note> only manifeſt by his owne words, but is expreſly affirmed by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 53. He ſuffered alſo a violent death, he did not die a naturall death: and it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe Chriſt had nothing in him to cauſe him to die; and beſides, he thereby anſwers to the Types in the Sacrifices of the old Teſtament, which were not onely beaſts dead, but beaſts ſlaine. Thirdly, he ſuffered a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death: for ſuch was the death of the Croſſe, and God had before pronounced it a curſed way of dying, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 13. All which, as it ſhewes the grieuouſneſſe of our ſinnes
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14246:202"/>
by nature, ſo doth it import the greatneſſe of our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by grace: for therefore did Chriſt die a curſed death, that wee might liue a bleſſed life, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. Yea, and beſides, hereby the Curſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from our death, ſo as it is a bleſſed thing for a Chriſtian man to die, and go out of the world when God calls for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He died willingly, not by compulſion, he laid downe his life, for no man could take it from him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 18. and that may appeare by the Story, for Chriſt cried with a loud voice, and gaue vp the ghoſt. Now men that lye a dying, languiſh, and their voice failes them, or at leaſt growes weake: Againe, it is ſaid Chriſt laid his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and then gaue vp the ghoſt; whereas other men firſt giue vp the ghoſt, and then their heads fall aſide: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſhew that he died when he liſted, he was found dead ſooner than other men that died on the Croſſe, which <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe wondered at. Now this is for our great comfort that he died ſo willingly, for it both addes to the ſufficiencie of the propitiation in his death, and ſhewes vs the greatneſſe of his tender loue to vs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it ſhould fire vs to a holy reſolution, with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe any thing he would haue vs, or ſuffer any thing for his ſake.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He died moſt religiouſly, and his piety in his death is commended for his obedience to his Father, and for his care for his Mother, and for his loue to his enemies, and for his deuotion in reſpect of himſelfe. His obedience to God his Father in his death is commended, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee did not onely obey all the Morall Law, that all men were bound to, but obeyed the ſingular commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen by his Father, euen that of dying for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which as Man he was not bound to, but as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Which ſhould teach vs abnegation of our ſelues: whatſoeuer it is God commands vs, we ſhould be willing to do, how hard ſoeuer Gods work ſeemes to be. This care for his Mother is recorded by Saint <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 19. 25, 26. when he ſaw his Mother ſtanding by, with the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14246:203"/>
Diſciple, he ſaid, <hi>Woman behold thy Sonne,</hi> and vnto him, <hi>Behold thy Mother.</hi> Thus is Chriſt a moſt perfect Patterne of righteouſneſſe in both Tables: for as hee had before ſhewed his godlineſſe in the firſt Table, ſo doth he here ſhew his naturall affection and tender care of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſecond Table. Now was the time come when <hi>Simeons</hi> prophecie was accompliſhed vpon his poore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now did the ſword of bitter ſorrowes pierce thorow her righteous ſoule, while ſhee beholds that dolefull ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of her matchleſſe Childe ſuffering death vpon the Tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 35. And therefore now to comfort her, doth he commit her to <hi>Iohn</hi> his beloued Diſciple, with charge that he ſhould looke to her after his death: taking this care for his Mother of whom he was made man, and commending her to his Diſciple with ſuch humane affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ſhewes himſelfe to be that high Teacher ſent of God. The Tree to which the members of Chriſt dying were faſtened, was a chaire of a ſpirituall maſter teaching, for hereby he teacheth children how they ſhould honour their parents, and continue a reuerent loue to them, euen to their laſt gaſpe: and hereby he teacheth hearers how to performe gratefulneſſe to their Teachers, not only by releeuing their Teachers while they liue, but by helping their parents or children when they are dead. He calls her <hi>Woman,</hi> not out of contempt, but to tell her and all men, that he that then was a dying, was more than the Sonne of <hi>Mary.</hi> Yea, and thereby the comforts her, for he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that being more than Man, hee was able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and could not be van quiſhed by his enemies. His loue to his enemies he ſhewes, by praying for them, when they moſt outragiouſly and blaſphemouſly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the death: He ſaid, <hi>Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe.</hi> The crie of their blaſphemies and his innocent bloud went vp to heauen againſt them, but Ieſus makes haſte to ſend vp the crie of his prayers for them, that they periſh not for euer: and therefore the firſt words he ſpeakes on the Croſſe, is the words of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. which ſhould be an admirable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14246:203"/>
to teach vs to goe, and doe likewiſe. Neuer was there a greater man on earth, nor did euer man ſuffer ſuch wrongs, and yet you ſee how he is affected: He that bids vs pray for our enemies, doth it himſelfe, in a harder caſe than euer can be ours. If we will be true diſciples, we muſt ſhew it by forgiuing men their treſpaſſes, and by praying for them: eſpecially when we are about to die; if we would euer haue God forgiue vs, we muſt forgiue men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes againſt vs. This prayer of Chriſt was heard, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the conuerſion of many of thoſe enemies of his after his death: Yet obſerue, he prayes not for ſuch as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of malitious wickedneſſe, but for ſuch as ſinned out of ignorant zeale, or generall prophaneneſſe of Nature: many of the people were carried with blinde zeale, and many of the Gentiles were ignorant of the true ſtory of the life, and cauſe of Chriſt for which he ſuffered, thoſe were curable, and for thoſe he prayes. And this may be a comfort to vs, he that can obſerue this difference in his perſecuting aduerſaries, will much more ſhew it, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the frailties and ignorances of his owne ſeruants that deſire to pleaſe him, though they faile of that they deſire to doe, through ſtrength of temptation or other weakneſſe and ignorance. Againe note, it is not enough for the partie offending, that the partie offended doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, but God alſo muſt be ſought vnto for forgiueneſſe. Laſtly, our Sauiour ſhewes his religiouſneſſe in his maner of dying, by his deuout care for his owne ſoule ſhewed in his prayer, when he ſaid, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit, Luke</hi> 23. 46. when he had be queathed all other things, as Peace to his Diſciples, his body to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> his garments to his Tormentors, Paradiſe to the Theefe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the penitent, and his Mother to his Friend; now only remained his Soule, and that he commends to God. Euen Ieſus can carry nothing with him out of the world, but his Soule, and therefore he prouides for that. Which ſhould teach vs what we ſhould doe; our greateſt care ſhould be that our ſoules may be ſafe when we die: and that they may be ſo, we ſee here two things muſt be done
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14246:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
while we liue: Firſt, we muſt get aſſurance that God is our Father, &amp; we are his children, and then when we come to dye we muſt commit our ſoules by faithfull and heartie prayers into his hands; and for feare of the worſe, wee ſhould begin betimes to prepare for death, and by daily prayer to put our ſoules into Gods hands. Obſerue that theſe words were firſt vſed by the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 31. 5. who committed his ſoule to God, being horribly perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and in great danger, and hauing no friend to truſt to. Now our Sauiour being in like, but greater diſtreſſe, doth make choice of <hi>Dauids</hi> words to expreſſe his prayer in, which ſhould teach vs to acquaint our ſelues with the Scriptures, eſpecially of this kinde: for as it will be accepted if our prayers be made according to Gods will, ſo is it a ſpeciall aduantage and helpe to our faith and prayers, to faſhion them to the very paternes in Gods Booke; and to ſay, as the godly haue ſaid to God in the like caſe. Finally, this practiſe of our Sauiour may be a great comfort to vs, and that two waies: for firſt we may gather from his example, that if once we haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our ſoules to God he will keep them ſafe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 12. And ſecondly, it will be comfortable for vs in death or danger to flie to Ieſus Chriſt, to beſeech him to helpe our ſoules with his Father, who cannot forget that once himſelfe on earth made the ſame moane to his Father, that we doe now to him. Thus <hi>Stephen</hi> doth, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>The fourth queſtion is, for whom Chriſt died? and the Anſwer is giuen diſtinctly in many places of Scripture: Firſt, he died for men, not for other creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. 18. Though the effect of his death reach to other creatures, as to the Angels, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10, 11. and to the creatures that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vanitie for mans ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20, 22. Secondly, he died not for his friends, but ſuch as in the ſtate of nature were his enemies, and ſinners, not iuſt men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 10. Thirdly, he died not for <hi>Iewes</hi> only, but for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 2. Fourthly, hee died not for goats, but for his ſheepe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 11, 15. not for the world, but for the Church,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14246:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. euen for ſuch as ſhould beleeue in his name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. Fifthly, he died not for ſome beleeuers, but for all beleeuers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. and ſo not for learned men or great men, but for all men of all ſorts that beleeue, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. Sixthly, he died not for thoſe that did beleeue his words, but for all that ſhould beleeue the words of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants afterwards to the end of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 21. And ſo he died for vs many hundred yeares before wee were borne. Seuenthly, not for all beleeuers in generall only, but for euery particular by name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 3. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>And the knowledge hereof ſhould ſerue for diuers Vſes. For firſt it ſhould be very comfortable for all ſorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to thinke that Chriſt died for them, and did thinke of them in particular, and by name. Secondly, it ſhould much affect vs with admiration of the greatneſſe of his loue, that would die for ſuch vile wretches as we were by nature, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enemies to him, as the Apoſtle vrgeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. to 10. And thirdly, in ſpeciall it ſhould much incourage ſuch as are burthened with the greatneſſe of their ſinnes, to know that he well vnderſtood it, that he was to die for the vngodly. Fourthly, it ſhould teach Chriſtians to reſtraine cenſure and iudging of them that are without. The vertue of Chriſts death may reach to many more than we know, and to ſuch as for the preſent are vile enemies to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name. Fifthly, wee ſhould all labour to be ſuch as Chriſt hath deſcribed to haue actually a part in his death. And ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, we muſt be ſuch as ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge how vile and wicked we are by nature, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer gifts or priuiledges we haue, and how ciuill ſoeuer we haue liued in compariſon of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, &amp;c. and our Sauiour tels vs, we muſt be beleeuers, and ſheepe ſuch as will heare and be ruled by his voice: and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, We muſt be ſuch as will liue to him that died for vs: and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14. 3, 4. we muſt not be defiled with women, that is, with Idolatry or ſpirituall whoredome, that is, with any beloued ſinne, and muſt follow the Lambe whitherſoeuer he goeth. Finally, if Chriſt died for vs, it muſt needs be an excellent eſtate he brings vs to:
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14246:205"/>
we are redeemed out of the earth: we are firſt fruits to God, and the Lambe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 4. hee accounts of vs as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, and as his onely treaſure in the world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>The fifth queſtion is, when Chriſt died? And that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered either by the ſeaſon of his death, or by the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of it. For the ſeaſon, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, he died in the due time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, it was when he had finiſhed the performance of what was ſhadowed in the types and ceremonies of the Old Teſtament; when all things were accompliſhed hee gaue vp the ghoſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 28, 30. The Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith, it was once in the end of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26, 27, 28. The Angell told <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould be cut off after 62. weekes (in prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall account) from the time of his prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, it was at the time that God had appointed in his eternall counſell and foreknowledge, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. yea he died preciſely at the very houre God had ſet, ſo as he could not be killed either before or after, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 30. and 13. 1. and that houre was the ninth houre of the day, euen at the time when the Euening Sacrifice was offered vp, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 46. 50.</p>
                  <p>For the Chronologie, <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith he died in the yeare of the world 3982. and the common opinion is that hee died in the 34. yeare of his owne age, and on the Friday (as we terme the fifth day of our weeke) which that yeare was the 15. day of their Moneth <hi>Niſan,</hi> or as others thinke, the 14. day, which that yeare anſwered to the ſeuenth day of our Aprill.</p>

                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:14246:205"/>
3. In reſpect of the efficacie of his death: for the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God was ſatisfied with that promiſe of his death, knowing it ſhould as certainly be, as if it had beene then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Neither was the effect here before the cauſe: for if a Suretie compound with the Creditor, the Debtor is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of priſon, though the payment be made long after, at the time the Suretie and the Creditor agree vpon: ſo it was here.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In reſpect of the Sacrifices, which ſhadowed out his death, which were ſlaine from the beginning of the world. Chriſt was ſlaine typically in thoſe Sacrifices, <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Abel</hi> offered to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In reſpect of his ſeruants that were martyred. So Chriſt was ſlaine when <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlaine.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In reſpect of the faith of the godly: for it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of faith to make things to come to be preſent, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſubſtance or perſon to things hoped for, and a preſent demonſtrarion of things which yet are not ſeene, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In reſpect of ſinne, which was the cauſe of his death, which was committed by the Elect, and was the cauſe of his death. Their ſinne was his death, when they began to ſinne, death was in the pot for Chriſt, and ſo their ſinne was remitted them, only for the reſpect of that ſatisfaction was to be made in the ſacrifice of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. to 27.</p>
                     <p>The Vſe wee may make of the time of Chriſts death, may be</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To leaue the times and ſeaſons to God, and not to exact an account of him why he doth not doe the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church in the time we deſire or looke after. Though the death of Chriſt was deferred almoſt 4000. yeares, yet we ſee God ſaith it was the due time; though perhaps a full demonſtration of the reaſon of it doe not appeare to vs. God is ſo wiſe and good, as we muſt beleeue that is the beſt time for euery worke which he chuſeth: and therefore we ſhould giue God the glory of the time of euery worke of his whether concerning the Church in generall, or our ſelues in particular: as beleeuing that God hath done in the very day, that which was fitteſt
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:14246:206"/>
for the day: and ſo alſo in the things we deſire, either of deliuerance or bleſſings, we ſhould wait till the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed come, and beleeue that all ſhall be done, when it is moſt ſeaſonable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We ſhould hence be much eſtabliſhed about the time of our owne death; God hath ſet the houre, and till that houre come, no diſeaſe, nor enemies ſhall euer be able to take away our life, and therefore wee ſhould follow our worke with diligence and a holy ſecuritie, and leaue it to God to take vs from our worke, when he ſees it to be the fitteſt time.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the time when he died.</p>
                     <p>The conſequences of his death follow: and they muſt be conſidered negatiuely, or affirmatiuely.</p>
                     <p>Negatiuely: It is obſerued by the Euangeliſts, That not a bone of Chriſt was broken: which is worthy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> had made a requeſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that the leggs of thoſe which were crucified might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to haſten their death, that they might not hang on their Croſſes on the day of the great Sabbath, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 31, 32. But notwithſtanding they were preuented, for Chriſt was dead before they came backe, to ſhew that he died when himſelfe would, &amp; not when they would, &amp; to let them haue cauſe to gueſſe thereby that he was more than a bare man. Secondly, becauſe of the excellent ſignification of this thing: for it is ſaid, the Scripture had ſaid, that <hi>not a bone of him ſhould be broken, Iohn</hi> 19. 36. Now the Scripture had only ſaid ſo of the Paſchall Lambe, that not a bone thereof ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. which manifeſtly ſhewes that Chriſt was the true Paſſeouer, the true Paſchall Lambe which was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for vs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. and withall it ſignifies that the myſticall bodie of Chriſt ſhall be preſerued. The Church may haue many enemies, but yet a bone thereof ſhall not be broken. The fleſh of the Church may be wounded, but not a bone of the Church ſhall be broken.</p>
                     <p>Affirmatiuely, the conſequents of his death, bot the piercing of his ſide with a Speare, and the teſtimonie giuen of his glory in his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:14246:206"/>
The ſide of Chriſt after he was dead was pierced with a Speare by one of the Souldiers, and forthwith came out water and bloud, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 34. and this was a buſineſſe of ſo high a nature, that the Euangeliſt ſaith thus vpon it, <hi>He that ſaw it bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that he might beleeue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the ſide of Chriſt was pierced, Firſt, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be fulfilled, which ſaid, <hi>They ſhall looke vpon him whom they haue pierced, Ioh.</hi> 19. 37. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that great myſterie of the originall of the Church is here imported: As <hi>Eue</hi> was formed out of the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was aſleepe, ſo the Church was to bee formed out of that which flowed from the ſide of Chriſt when he was dead. God opened the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> when he would make the woman; and ſo God opened the ſide of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was to make the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. Now that place of the Prophet ſhewes what vſe wee ſhould make of this part of the Paſſion of Chriſt, namely, to take occaſion from thence to bewaile our ſinnes, that were the cauſe of his death, and to acknowledge that we were the men that are ſpiritually guilty of that cruelty ſhewed vnto Chriſt. And becauſe our hearts by nature are barren and vnapt to this godly ſorrow, we muſt pray God to powre out vpon vs of his Spirit, as it is a Spirit of compaſſion to melt our hearts, and a Spirit of deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make vs able by prayer to ſue for pardon of our ſins, and to beſeech God to accept of the propitiation made in Chriſts bloud, that ſo his wrath may not fall vpon vs for our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Now the water and bloud that came out of the ſide of Chriſt, was both miraculous (as is thought) and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully myſticall. That it was miraculous is gathered from that extraordinary notice <hi>S. Iohn</hi> takes of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 34. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. wherin the miracle ſhould lye is not eaſie to tell. There is a skin that incloſeth the heart, called <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium,</hi> which holdeth water in it, that cooleth the heart of man, which is ſo eſſentiall to life, that if it be conſumed it is impoſſible the creature ſhould liue. Now I take it that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:14246:207"/>
the wonder lyes in this, that whereas in death (eſpecially ſuch a painefull death as Chriſts was) that water is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dried vp with the extreame heat of the heart ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for life, yet in Chriſt who died not only willingly, but alſo before the time he needed to die with the paine, the water was ſtill in that bag or skin, and therefore when the ſpeare pierced the heart both water and bloud came forth.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Reaſons why this fell out, diuers are aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>For firſt hereby the truth of Chriſts death is infallibly proued: For no creature can liue, if the heart and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium</hi> be pierced. And it concernes our ſaluation that Chriſt ſhould die indeed, and not in appearance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the chiefe thing intended by this ſuffering, was the diſcouery of a dreadfull myſterie concerning the vertue of the death of Chriſt: for this is he that came by water and bloud euen Ieſus Chriſt, that brings with him for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, both the water of Sanctification to waſh vs from the ſtaine of our ſinnes, and the bloud of expiation to make full atonement before God for the guilt of our ſinnes: Not by water only, but by bloud alſo. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he deliuered the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that bodily deliuerance, came by water, when he went thorow the Red-ſea; but he brought no bloud for atonement. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> when he brought tidings of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deliuerance, he came by water, waſhing men to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie repentance: but there was no bloud that he could exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and his water was but Symbolicall, and ſignificatiue. But Chriſt came by water and bloud, which hee not onely powred out on the Croſſe, but hath left in the hearts of all beleeuers as witneſſes, not only to him, but to them alſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7, 8. For as there be Three in heauen that beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and the happineſſe of Chriſtians in him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, who teſtified by voice from heauen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and the Word, who teſtified both by doctrine and miracles; and the Holy Ghoſt, who teſtified as at other times, ſo on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt, Act.</hi> 2. So there be Three on earth that teſtifie, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Adoption, that witneſſeth to our ſpirits, and the water of Mortification, which waſheth away and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14246:207"/>
the ſtaine and power of ſinne, and the bloud of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; for a beleeuer relying vpon the bloud of Chriſt, as the pacification for his ſinnes, is effectually deliuered from the guilt of them. Now there would be no water to waſh him from his ſinnes, nor bloud to make atonement, if Chriſt had not ſhed both water and bloud vpon the Croſſe. Now all this is teſtified by the Spirit alſo in the Goſpell, and by water in Baptiſme, and by bloud in the Lords Supper: and theſe alſo receiue all their life and force from the water and bloud that came out of the ſide of Chriſt on the Croſſe. Now the vſe that we ſhould make of this dreadfull Myſtery, ſhould be to flie vnto this part of the Paſſion of Chriſt, for our comfort, againſt the power and guilt of our ſinnes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that out of the ſide of Chriſt at this time, did runne that Fountain that was opened vnto the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for ſinne and for vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 1. Though our ſinnes were neuer ſo many and loathſome, yet in this Fountaine they may be cleane waſhed away: but then withall wee muſt ſtriue to get this Fountaine within vs, (this miraculous Fountaine, I ſay, that runnes water and bloud) and to ſhew that we haue indeed a part in the death of Chriſt, by the ſound fruits of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the ſolide tran quilitie of our conſcience, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the expiation made in the bloud of Chriſt for vs, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as if that bloud had beene really ſprinkled vpon our hearts.</p>
                     <p>Some Diuines doe obſerue another myſtery in this water and bloud running out of the ſide of Chriſt; for they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that as out of the ſide of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> came the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that deceiued all the world; ſo out of the ſide of Chriſt came redemption and oblation from that deceiuing.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the piercing of Chriſts ſide after his death.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimonie giuen of his glory in his death, was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuine and partly humane.</p>
                     <p>The diuine teſtimonies were three, the Earthquake, the rending of the Rockes, and the opening of the Graues, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 51, 52.</p>
                     <p>The trembling of the earth may ſignifie diuers things, as
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:14246:208"/>
Firſt, the immediate preſence of the Diuine Nature: for as the earth trembled when Chriſt came to giue the Law on <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, Pſal.</hi> 67. 8, 9. and as both heauen and earth ſhall melt, and be in a manner conſumed when Chriſt comes to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. So now that Chriſt is making atonement for the ſinnes of the Elect, and going out of the world, hee makes the earth doe him homage, and acknowledge his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie at that time, when he ſeemed ſo deſpiſed amongſt men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the horrible indignitie of the fact of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in killing Chriſt: the ſenſeleſſe creatures tremble, when the Lord of life dies, and the Creator is ſlaine by the creature; which alſo vpbraids the ſtupiditie of men, that cannot be moued with ſuch an obiect, eſpecially the horrible wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the chiefe Prieſts and Rulers, and people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that are not ſtirred with remorſe for ſo grieuous a ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this ſhaking of the earth is thought to ſignifie and foretell the ſhaking of the world, by the Goſpell after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſo as all the world ſhould be moued at the ſound of the voice of Chriſt in the Goſpell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27.</p>
                     <p>The rending of the Rockes</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Did vpbraid the <hi>Iewes</hi> for the hardneſſe of their hearts, that were worſe than the very Rockes: The Rockes cleaue at the death of Chriſt, and yet their hearts are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It might ſignifie the ſame with the Earthquake, <hi>viz.</hi> that the vertue of Chriſts death carried by the Goſpell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, would bee of force to teare and rent the hearts of wicked men, though they were as hard as Rockes.</p>
                     <p>The opening of the graues ſignified, that Chriſts death had vanquiſhed Death, and that it ſhould not haue power to hold the body of the Saints in the graue long; and withall, it told the <hi>Iewes</hi> aforehand, that it would be in vaine for them to roule great ſtones vpon Chriſts graue, for he would riſe againe, doe they what they could. It is ſaid that the dead bodies aroſe after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which hath
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14246:208"/>
made ſome Diuines thinke, that the graues were not opened till after the Reſurrection, though Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> reckons this thing together with the reſt of the Miracles that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſts death.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the Teſtimony Diuine.</p>
                     <p>The Humane Teſtimony, was the Teſtimony of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Centurion,</hi> and the Souldiers with him, who feared and glorified God, and ſaid, <hi>Of a truth this was the Sonne of God:</hi> and the multitude that came to the execution, beholding the things that were done, ſmote their breaſts and returned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 54. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 47, 48. And this Teſtimonie ſhewes,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The maruellous ſenſeleſneſſe of the Prieſts and learned men, and great men of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> that theſe men that were <hi>Pagans,</hi> and theſe poore <hi>Plebeians,</hi> ſhould be ſo affected with feare and wonder, and giue ſuch an honourable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the innocencie and Diuinity of Chriſt, when theſe great Pillars of the Church are ſo obſtinately auerſe, and hoſtily minded, it ſhewes that they were prodigiouſly ſinfull and hard hearted; and withall it ſhewes what a plague a hard heart is, whereſo euer it is found, though in learned or great men. Though God ſhake the earth, teare the Rockes, open the graues, and though he make ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to confeſſe his glory, yet they are the ſame men ſtill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is eaſie with Chriſt to defend his owne credit and cauſe euen in the hardeſt times: though <hi>Iudas</hi> betray him, <hi>Peter</hi> deny him, and the reſt of the Diſciples flie from him, yet he can make a <hi>Centurion,</hi> a Souldier, a <hi>Pagan,</hi> to doe the worke his Diſciples ſhould haue done. Hee can glorifie himſelfe by the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, if need be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2.</p>

                  <p>Our Sauiours bodie was buried for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Scripture might be fulfilled that had prophecied of it: ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it might appeare he was truly dead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he might purſue and ouercome death in his owne cell or den.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he might burie our ſins with him; and for euer hide them from the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we being made partakers of the fruit of his buriall, might be buried with him in reſpect of our ſins. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion in the water of Baptiſme is a ſigne of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall buriall with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That he might ſanctifie our buriall to vs, and ſo expell from vs that horror and feare we might conceiue about our lying in the graue, and ſo confirme vs in the hope of our Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That we might learne from thence to giue honour to the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:14246:209"/>
body of Chriſtians, in prouiding honeſt and decent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall for them, ſuch as might anſwer the hope wee haue of our Reſurrection. Mens bodies ſhall riſe, and to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo much, we ſhould lay them in the graue as in a ſafe place to keepe them till the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>For the place where he was buried, that may be diuerſly anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was buried in a noted place neere to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and that for two cauſes: The one, that ſo all occaſion of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his death, or truth of his buriall, and ſo of his reſurrection might be remoued. The other, that by the reſt of Chriſt in the graue, the viſion of reſt and peace (which the name <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſignified) might be knowne to bee procured by Chriſt: Reſt I ſay ſpirituall and eternall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was buried in a Garden: thereby hauing relation to the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> for as our vnreſt began at the ſinne of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo here in a Garden doth the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> come to reſt, and ſo begins our ſpirituall reſt. And withall to giue vs hope, that as from the ſinne of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were caſt out of the garden of pleaſure, ſo by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who lay buried in a Garden, we might haue a happy returne to the heauenly Paradiſe. And as Chriſt was carried from the Croſſe to the garden of reſt, ſo ſhall we be taken from the calamities of life, into heauenly reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was buried in a Sepulchre hewed out of a rocke, that ſo his enemies might haue no occaſion to cauill, and ſay his Diſciples ſtole him away by ſecret holes, or paſſages vnder ground: and withall to ſignifie what the ſtate of our naturall hearts is, when Chriſt comes ſpiritually to reſt in our ſoules, hee muſt hew him a place out of the rocks, if he get roome in our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He was buried in a Sepulchre that was new, that thereby might be ſignified, that the condition of death was by the merit of Chriſt made new, and was altogether diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which it was wont to be: and withall to tell vs, that Chriſt will reſt in the heart of no man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be new.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:14246:210"/>
5. He was buried in a Sepulchre in which neuer man was laid, leſt his aduerſaries ſhould cauill, and ſay it was ſome other that was riſen, or that he roſe from the dead by vertue of touching ſome other corps: ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 21.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He was buried in another mans Sepulchre, to ſignifie that he died and was buried not for himſelfe, but for other men: and that he might ſhew that graues properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to vs which haue ſinned, to warne vs of our mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> cauſed his ſepulchre to be made in his garden of pleaſure, that he might be thereby put in minde of his mortalitie in the middeſt of the delights of this life.</p>
                  <p>The perſons by whom Chriſt was buried, are diuerſly deſcribed; as by their names, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus;</hi> and by their worldly eſtate, they were Senators and rich men; and by their profeſſion or religion, they were diſciples, iuſt men, ſuch as waited for the kingdome of God: but yet all was done ſecretly for feare of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and by the authoritie they had to doe it, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſent of <hi>Pilate, Matth.</hi> 27. 57. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe it is to be obſerued, that God hath giuen theſe men an honourable name in the Storie of the Goſpell, ſo as what they haue done ſhall alwaies be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred where the Goſpell is preached: and this honourable mention they attained not, till this ſeruice done to the dead bodie of Chriſt. Whereby God would teach vs, that ſuch as honour Chriſt God will honour: and the beſt way to get into the Catalogue of Gods Worthies, is to imploy our ſelues in well-doing, and in the ſeruice of Ieſus Chriſt, and then we can doe no good worke, to Chriſt dead or liuing, in himſelfe or his members, but it ſhall be had in honour, yea it may be in euerlaſting remembrance.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, Chriſt was buried by rich men, Firſt that the Scripture might be fulfilled, that ſaid, He expoſed his graue to the wicked, and to the rich man in his death: To the wicked, becauſe he could not be buried without <hi>Pilates</hi> conſent; and to the rich man, becauſe hee was buried by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimatheas</hi> meanes. Thus he was ſaid to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and raiſed vp according to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:14246:210"/>
Secondly, he gaue his dead bodie to rich men, to ſignifie, that amongſt rich men he had his elect, and that the vertue of his death ſhould reach euen to them: for though it bee impoſſible in reſpect of men, that a rich man ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet it is not ſo vnto Chriſt, who can effect wonderfull things, and ſo can by the vertue of his death ſo vntwiſt the gable of a rich mans heart, as to make it in true humilitie like a thread to goe thorow the eye of a needle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 24. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. And hence rich men ſhould learne of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that they ought to profeſſe their loue of Chriſt and ſincere Religion, not only when Chriſt is adorned with miracles and worldly applauſe, but euen when he fals into the hands of wicked men, and is buried in ignominie, they muſt not feare danger or reproach. They muſt honour Chriſt not onely in the peaceable times of the Church, but in troubled times: Euen when Chriſt in his members is betrayed, perſecuted, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, forſaken of his owne, condemned either in ſpirituall Courts or politicall, purſued by warres or any other vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the poore ſeruants of God that ſuffer for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> may hence take comfort, God that ſtirred vp rich men to doe this honour to the bodie of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> will not forſake the afflicted members of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> he can ſtirre vp men to prouide for them, and honour them (euen greatmen when it pleaſeth him) both in their life time, and at their death, and after their death alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third point, they were diſciples of Chriſt, but yet it was ſecretly for feare of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Whence we may obſerue the great wonder of Gods power in theſe men. When Chriſt was in proſperitie, they were afraid to be ſeene to follow him, or to profeſſe reſpect to him: Now that Chriſt is in extreme diſgrace, and the enemies of Chriſt fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in cruelty and malice, now theſe fearfull men proue valiant, and whatſoeuer comes of it, Chriſt ſhall be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen, the dead bodie of Chriſt ſhall not be forſaken by them, Which is the more wonderfull, becauſe the beſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt were ſo ouercome with feare, that they had all forſaken Chriſt. Which may ſerue for great vſe to all of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:14246:211"/>
vs. They that ſtand ſhould take heed leſt they fall. Thoſe that now go for ſtrong Chriſtians, if euill daies come, may proue faint-hearted, and by their fearefulneſſe diſhonour the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſſe. And on the other ſide, weake Chriſtians ſhould not be diſmayed, God is able to make them to ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. Such as in dayes of proſperitie were afraid of the reproach of men, may proue ſo full of courage in the euill day, as not to feare though the foundations of the earth be moued.</p>
                  <p>Further, we may hence gather a diſtinction of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Some are ſo and ſeeme ſo, they make a profeſſion before men. Some are ſo but ſeeme not ſo, as here theſe Counſellors were iuſt men and diſciples, and waited for the kingdome of God, and yet they were not taken for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor knowne to be ſo commonly: which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine cenſure in raſh Chriſtians; ſome of thoſe perſons they deſpiſe as prophane, may be true Chriſtians in Gods ſight. But yet leſt wicked men ſhould be hence emboldned, obſerue that how weake or fearfull ſoeuer theſe men were, yet they would not conſent to the death of Chriſt: Though the weake Chriſtians I ſpeake of doe not ſo much for the truth, as others doe, and they ſhould, yet they will doe nothing againſt the truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. and therefore ſuch perſons as not onely make no profeſſion, but withall doe ſcoffe at and oppoſe ſinceritie in others, cannot be reckoned in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilates</hi> conſent was had for the buriall of Chriſt,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there might be no doubt made of his death and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, ſeeing ſo great a perſon is made priuy to the ordering of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we might know that the hearts of the greateſt men are in Gods hands, and he can turne them which way he will, euen to execute his counſell, when they thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. He can make the very enemies of the Church become friendly and louing when pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>And further, in that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> doth not take the dead body downe, and burie it without leaue of the Magiſtrate, it ſerues to teach men, that they ſhould doe all things with due
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:14246:211"/>
reſpect, not only of the warrant of the action, but of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to it: eſpecially great reſpect ſhould be had to authoritie, that by raſh zeale the power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be not prouoked againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the third point.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the buriall containes diuers things: Firſt, they did it haſtily towards the euening, becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Iowes</hi> for the Sabbath, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. <hi>vlt.</hi> Secondly, they did it openly. Thirdly, they did it with great coſt, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> brought fine linnen to wrap it in, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> brought a mixture of <hi>Mirrhe</hi> and <hi>Aloes</hi> to the quantitie of about an hundred pound weight, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 39. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 46. but it was done without waſhing or embalming. Laſtly, it is noted it was done after the manner of the <hi>Iewes</hi> buriall.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, in that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> makes ſuch haſte, in reſpect of the Sabbath approaching, it ſhewes that all men that haue worke to doe towards the end of the weeke, ſhould order the matter ſo, as they take vp not any part of the Lords day, but vſe the more haſte and prouidence to haue all diſpatched that they may wholly attend vnto Gods worke in that time which he hath conſecrated to himſelfe. And by the way here ſeemes to be an intimation, that burials are not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be performed vpon the Sabbath day, vnleſſe it be in ſome caſe of neceſſitie, when the bodie will not keepe till after the Lords day, and cannot be prepared for buriall before it begin.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, Chriſt was buried openly, that ſo there might be no colour of obiecting, that there was any fraud vſed about his buriall, and beſides to teſtifie that the fruit of his death and buriall did belong to all men: and withall it ſhewes the courage and ſtrength of faith in theſe diſciples, that are now no more afraid of men and their terrors, but giue glory to God in their hearts, and will ſuffer what can come of it.</p>
                  <p>For the third point, diuers things may be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the coſt they are at, we may obſerue that men that will follow Chriſt and be true diſciples, muſt not thinke much to be not only at labour, but at coſt alſo in what
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:14246:212"/>
may be requiſite for the ſeruice of Chriſt liuing or dead. If rich men muſt be at coſt with the dead bodie of Chriſt, then muſt they alſo doe to the liuing members of Chriſt. And further hence it is manifeſt, that it is not vnlawfull to be at coſt about the funerals of the dead Saints: God makes great account of the dead bodies of his people, that haue beene the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore it is no ſinne according to mens eſtate to be at ſuch coſt as is requiſite to comely and decent buriall according to their condition; though vaine oſtentation or idle cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are not to be iuſtified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he was wrapped in pure linnen, and with ſuch coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpices: it was</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To proclaime the innocencie of Chriſt, and to take away the ignominie of the Croſſe: and therefore they would not ſuffer his bodie to lye amongſt the carkaſſes of theeues and malefactors: They tell the world here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that Chriſt was no ſuch man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſignifie that the memoriall of the iuſt is bleſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead. Therefore they vſed things of ſuch ſweet ſmell in burying the dead, that they might thereby ſignifie how ſweet the memorie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Saints is. They are amiable euen when they are dead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It might in ſpeciall ſignifie, that from Chriſt dead and buried ſhould ariſe a moſt ſweet ſauour in the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rts of men brought vnto them by the efficacie of the Goſpel, cauſing Chriſt to dye and be buried in their ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This coſt about the bodies of the dead was vſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their aſſured hope of reſurrection, and therefore they beſtow that coſt, as knowing that it is beſtowed vpon bodies that ſhall liue againe.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all this coſt Chriſts bodie was not embalmed, which in reſpect of them came to paſſe by reaſon of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the time, the Sabbath was ſo neere: and therefore the women came the third day to annoint him after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ouer, but he was rifen. But in reſpect of God, this embalming was not performed, that thereby might be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:14246:212"/>
that Chriſts bodie needed no embalming, becauſe it could ſee no corruption in the graue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. and that this incorruption might not be imputed to skill, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of men, but only to the diuine power: and withall to ſignifie that by Chriſt wee ſhould be freed from that corruption which the ſinne of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought vpon vs all.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in that it is ſaid, that Chriſt was buried after the manner of the <hi>Iewes</hi> burying, it ſhewes plainly, that reſpect is to be had to the cuſtomes of any country or place where we liue, and that Gods ſeruants haue beene carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them, and not willing to giue offence by croſſing ſuch cuſtomes. This is true of all cuſtomes that are not ſinfull, and againſt the word of God; though they be ſuch vſages as are not commanded in Scripture: for this manner of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall was no where commanded in Gods word, and yet the cuſtome preuailes, and good men obſerue it.</p>
                  <p>Now in this place I may adde further two adiuncts of the buriall of Chriſt. The firſt was the rowling of a great ſtone vpon the mouth of the Sepulchre; which was not done ſo much out of any faſhion, as firſt that the bodie of Chriſt might not be expoſed to any indignities or vile vſages by the enemies: and further, that thereby the glory of the power of Chriſt might the more appeare, that could riſe though a great ſtone were rolled vpon the mouth of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. The ſecond adiunct, was the preſence of certaine women, that were witneſſes of the buriall, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were fled. Which alſo was done the better to ſhew the glory of Chriſt, and his power and triumph, that could make ſuch weake ones ſtrong, and braue the enemies of mans ſaluation, by ſetting weake women in the forefront of the battell, that hold out the confeſſion of Chriſt, and giue not backe for all the furie of the aduerſaries. And thus of the manner of his buriall.</p>
                  <p>Now for the laſt point, our Sauiour continued in the graue till the third day: for he was buried the euening before the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath, and lay in the graue all the Sabbath day, and roſe about the beginning of the firſt day of the weeke,

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1. and a little after his buriall, his aduerſaries deſired of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that the Sepulchre might bee watched, leſt his Diſciples ſhould ſteale him away by night. <hi>Pilate</hi> grants them the Band of Souldiers, who were appointed for the guard of the Temple; and theſe they ſet to watch the Sepulchre, and beſides ſealed the mouth of the Sepulchre: now in all that time the bodie of Chriſt did ſuffer no putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or corruption.

                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, theſe words, <hi>He deſcended into Hell,</hi> were not in the moſt ancient <hi>Creeds.</hi> Learned men giue inſtance both in the <hi>Creeds</hi> that haue them not in, as alſo of moſt ancient Expoſitors that vndertooke to expound the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> and yet makes no mention of this Article at all. <hi>Amandus Polanus</hi> ſaith they are not in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> nor in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Sardis,</hi> nor in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the firſt <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor in the firſt <hi>Toletan Councell,</hi> nor in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> nor in the <hi>Creeds</hi> of the ſixt and the eleuenth <hi>Toletan Councells,</hi> nor in the <hi>Creeds</hi> of the <hi>Councels</hi> of <hi>Wormes</hi> and <hi>Franckford,</hi> nor in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other <hi>Creeds.</hi> And beſides, it is obſerued, that neither <hi>Clement</hi> the firſt, nor <hi>Iernaeus,</hi> nor <hi>Tertullian,</hi> nor <hi>Iuſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> nor <hi>Origen,</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> though they expound the <hi>Creed,</hi> yet make any mention of this Article: and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> that doth receiue the words, yet ſaith that they are not in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, nor amongſt the Churches of the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, though theſe words haue not beene found to be acknowledged in the firſt Churches, yet becauſe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages they haue beene receiued with an vniuerſall conſent of all Chriſtian Churches, and are acknowledged by many of the ancient Fathers, and <hi>Councels,</hi> and are receiued by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and by all ſorts of Diuines in our Church, therefore it were great impudencie for any man to reiect theſe words, or queſtion their authoritie, either for the truth or vſe of them: onely for the interpretation of the words, the learned know that the Diuines of no one age

And therefore men muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and take heed of raſh cenſuring of the opinions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines <note place="margin">In this point, the Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, I thought not fit to alter any thing: he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth herein but his priuate opinion.

                  <p>Now for the ſenſe of the words of this Article; if the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Diuines be gathered together, ſome of them will be found apparantly falſe, ſome of them <hi>veriſimilies,</hi> things that be like Truth, ſome of them are manifeſtly true: And laſtly, there is a ſenſe is not onely a truth, but the proper truth of this place, if we could finde it out.</p>
                  <p>Now for an introduction, it will not be vnprofitable to take notice of the diuers acceptations of the Originall words rendered here <hi>Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the <hi>Greeke</hi> word <hi>Hades.</hi> Now the Kings Tranſlators of the Bible, doe not render the words all alike in euery place As for the word <hi>Hades,</hi> in the new Teſtament they tranſlate it the moſt places <hi>Hell:</hi> Yet in one place I finde it tranſlated the <hi>Graue, viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. So for the word <hi>Sheol</hi> in the old Teſtament, vſually they tranſlate it <hi>Hell.</hi> Yet in diuers places they call it the <hi>Pit,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> 17. 16. and likewiſe in ſundrie places they call it the <hi>Graue,</hi> and it cannot well be otherwiſe rendered, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 38. and 37. 35. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49 15. and 6. 5. <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 18.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt may be ſaid to deſcend into Hell, either in reſpect of the wholeman, or in reſpect of the body only, or in reſpect of the ſoule only.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the whole Man, it is true that he deſcended into Hell in foure Reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Incarnation: when our Sauiour deſcended
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:14246:215"/>
from heauen to take our Nature, in a large ſenſe he may be ſaid then to deſcend into <hi>Hades.</hi> For the ancient <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> whence the word <hi>Hades</hi> comes, vnderſtood by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the <hi>Earth;</hi> and many of the ancient Fathers, call the earth <hi>Infernum,</hi> or <hi>Hell:</hi> for they make a diſtinction of <hi>Hell,</hi> and ſay, One is ſuperiour, and that is the Earth; and another is inferiour, and that is the Hell of the damned. Nor did Chriſt deſcend only to be vpon earth, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume Earth, when he tooke our nature, and that too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the earth was vnder malediction for the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſinne, and expreſt in that ſentence, <hi>Thou art earth, and to earth thou ſhalt returne:</hi> and that other, <hi>The earth is curſed for thy ſake, thorns and briers ſhall it bring forth.</hi> And that he deſcended both in reſpect of his body and ſoule, and of both of them together: In reſpect of his body, as <hi>Adam,</hi> made of the earth; ſo was Chriſt borne of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who had her originall from the earth: and the earth is vſually ſaid to be the common mother of vs all: and his ſoule deſcended into this earth, when it was vnited to his moſt ſacred body: In both ſoule and body in his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he deſcended into the earth, euen the earth as it was accurſed, both in reſpect of infirmitie, and in reſpect of mortality. The infirmities of our Nature which he tooke, both in ſoule and in body, what were they but ſo many thornes and briers to afflict, and ſeratch, and paine his moſt bleſſed Nature? I meane by his infirmities, ſuch as were without ſinne, ſuch as came from ſinne, but did not tend to ſin: ſuch were in his ſoule, ſorrow and feare, and in his body, thirſt, hunger, pouertie. And beſides our Infirmities, he tooke our Nature as it was Mortall, and ſo deſcended into that <hi>Infernum,</hi> the Fathers call <hi>Infernum mortalitatis:</hi> for though he died not ſo ſoone as hee was borne, yet he liued alwaies vnder the ſentence of death. A priſoner in the Goale when he is condemned, all the time he liues is reckoned but as a dead man. So was Chriſt. Now the Scripture ſeemes clearely to acknowledge the deſcenſion of Chriſt into the earth of mortalitie and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, as when he deſcended to take vpon him the forme
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:14246:215"/>
of a ſeruant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. So it is by ſome Interpreters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 7. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9. though it is not doubted but theſe places haue a further meaning. Thus of the firſt ſenſe, as <hi>Hades</hi> ſignifies the earth: and the rather becauſe ſome Diuines make it a rule, that Chriſt is neuer ſaid to deſcend any whither, but into <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Hades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt may be ſaid to deſcend into <hi>Hades,</hi> when by death he went among the dead, both in his body and ſoule. He deſcended when he went downe among the dead: And thus he deſcended not only into the <hi>Infernum mortalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> but into the <hi>Infernum mortis</hi> alſo. Thus according to the <hi>Pſalme</hi> he was free among the dead: and this was the greater abaſement, becauſe hee was detained ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, kept downe as a Priſoner in the graue, in reſpect of his body: He deſcended then, when he ſuffered the ſtate of the dead both in body and ſoule. I ſay his abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was very great in this condition, becauſe both his friends thought all was loſt in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 10. and his enemies inſulted ouer him as conquered, and called him <hi>Deceiuer, Matth.</hi> 27. 62, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. See what God ſaith, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>And death held him downe as his priſoner, Rom.</hi> 6. 9. So as it was with him, as <hi>Iob</hi> 17. 12, 13. But yet it is true he was glorious in this eſtate, both in that his ſoule was in Paradiſe, and his body inioyed incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But yet all this was ſecret, and not knowne to men; therefore ſome Diuines call this a kinde of middle ſtate, betweene humiliation and exaltation, becauſe it was partly glorious, and partly ignomious. And his detenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the graue anſwer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fitly to the order of the Articles. For as Reſurrection anſwers to his death and crucifying, ſo A ſcenſion anſwers to his going into the graue; and Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">In this ſenſe Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> takes the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> at the right hand of God, anſwers to his continuance in the graue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt may be ſaid to deſcend into <hi>Hell</hi> in reſpect of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie: becauſe though neither ſoule nor body went into the Hell of the damned locally, yet the vertue of what he ſuffered in ſoule and body penetrated into Hell it ſelfe:
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14246:216"/>
This was an operatiue deſcenſion: The merit and vertue of his Paſſion deſcended euen amongſt the damned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to ſpoile them of their power, and confirme them in the horror of their eſtates, and to ſignifie the deliuerance of the Elect out of their hands.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe words, <hi>He deſcended into Hell,</hi> may be taken as an effectuall <hi>Epitome</hi> and repetition of all his Paſſion deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed before, with a generall intimation of the vnexpreſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the things he ſuffered for our ſinnes: as if they that inſerted the words into the <hi>Creed,</hi> would ſay, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all things that might concerne our Redemption, which were ſo many and ſo grieuous, as the heart of man is not able to reckon them, or to finde the bottome of them; for when he came to ſuffer for vs, he deſended into a very <hi>Abiſſus,</hi> or bottomleſſe pit of miſery, not to bee ſounded by any mortall heart. This ſenſe is taken too by ſome Diuines, as the moſt proper ſenſe of the words in this place. And for mine owne part, (with ſubmiſſion to information of better iudgements) if one particular ſenſe muſt be taken to, I beſt like this.</p>
                  <p>Thus of his deſcenſion in reſpect of the whole Man.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of his body our Sauiour deſcended into <hi>Hades,</hi> or <hi>Sheol,</hi> when he deſcended into the graue; and ſo it is the ſame in ſenſe with his buriall: and this interpretation is not to be ſlighted, for firſt I haue quoted many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before, where the Tranſlators themſelues render the words by the terme of the graue. So <hi>Iacob</hi> deſcended into Hell, when he went downe into the graue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 38. And beſides, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his <hi>Creed,</hi> (which is one of the moſt ancient that haue this Article in) leaues out <hi>Buried,</hi> and puts in, <hi>He deſcended into Hell,</hi> as if he ſignified thereby, that he tooke that to be the meaning of the Article. And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> ſaith in his Expoſition of the <hi>Creed,</hi> that the ſenſe of theſe words ſeemes to be the ſame with the other word <hi>Buried.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of his ſoule, our Sauiour may be ſaid to deſcend into Hell in two ſenſes: Firſt, in that hee abaſed himſelfe ſo farre, as to let his ſoule to be in that condition which our ſoules are in betweene the time of our death and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14246:216"/>
our reſurrection, which was a great abaſement, though the ſoule ſuffered no paine: for his very ſoule herein endures the common condition of all mens ſoules in death, though the ſoule die not in reſpect of the ſubſtance, yet in a generall ſenſe euery change from that being wee haue for the preſent, is a kinde of death, becauſe it makes a not being of that which was before, or makes ſomething not to be, which had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before: What is mutabilitie but a kinde of death, which while it changeth any thing into another faſhion, that cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be what it was, and beginneth to be what it was not. Thus in the ſoule of Chriſt, there was not only a change, but a priuation of what he had before: for firſt the Body was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſoule, and a diuorce made between that couple that had liued ſo louingly together: See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> part of the ſoule was aboliſhed, ſeeing, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ng, ſpeaking, and the like, all ceaſt in Chriſt, all the veſſels or inſtruments of the ſenſes being taken away from the ſoule. Thirdly, all outward operations did ceaſe, in which the ſoule was wont to worke, and now could worke no longer: This is to be vnderſtood of doing worke in the viſible and corporeall world. Fourthly, there is in the ſoules euen of the godly, and ſo in Chriſt, a moſt earneſt longing (yet without paine or ſorrow) for the conſummation of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie to be enioyed with the body reſumed. The ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted is ioyned to the body ſtill, though not in life and ſenſe, yet in naturall affection, ſo as it enioyes no happineſſe which it doth not wiſh to the body. The ſoules of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous crie vnder the Altar; for though they reſt, ſaith one, <hi>à labore,</hi> yet they doe not reſt <hi>à clamore:</hi> and though they haue nothing that moleſt them, yet they haue not yet what would more delight them, <hi>viz.</hi> their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt in ſoule deſcended into Hell, when as our furetie he ſubmitted himſelfe to beare thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">Or equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to them.</note> helliſh ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which we were bound by our ſinnes to luffer for euer: His deſcenſion is his proiection of himſelfe into the ſea of Gods wrath conceiued for our ſinnes, and his ingreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt vnſpeakable ſtraits and torments in his ſoule, which
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14246:217"/>
we ſhould elſe haue ſuffered for euer in Hell. This way of Chriſt deſcending into Hell is expreſly vttered in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the type of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 13. and 116. 3. and 69. 3. Thus the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>His ſoule was made an offering, Eſay</hi> 53. 10. And this I take it <hi>Dauid</hi> meanes, when hee ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell, Pſalm.</hi> 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And thus Chriſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell when hee was aliue, not when he was dead. Thus his ſoule was in Hell, when in the Garden hee did ſweat bloud, and on the Croſſe, when hee cried out ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee, Matth.</hi> 26, 38. And according to this ſenſe is the Article fitly placed in the <hi>Creed:</hi> for hauing reckoned before what hee ſuffered in bodie, in this Article is expreſſed what hee ſuffered in ſoule: and in the ſixteenth <hi>Pſalme</hi> it ſeemes hee firſt reckons what hee ſuffered in ſoule, and his deliuery from it, when hee ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell,</hi> and then ſpeakes of the priuiledge of his body in the graue, as a thing which followed the ſuffering and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his ſoule out of Hell.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this Article may be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To informe vs againe of the hatefulneſſe of ſinne, that hath thus abaſed the Sonne of God: and withall to ſhew vs how great that ſurpaſſing loue of Chriſt to vs was, that could bee content for our ſakes, to be thus abaſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inſtruct vs eſpecially in two things, Humility and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to conſider of the Articles that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the exaltation of Chriſt, as hee is the Mediator made glorious: and ſo three things are entertained into the Chriſtian faith, as the three parts or degrees of the glorification of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Seſſion at the right hand of God. But before I handle theſe in particular, I muſt conſider of his exaltation in generall.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the exaltation of Chriſt in generall, two things are to be conſidered: both what in Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and what good it is to vs that hee was ſo exalted.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe: The perſon of Chriſt was exalted, and that in reſpect of both Natures: The Diuine Nature was exalted but in ſome reſpect, the Humane Nature was exalted ſimply: The Diuine Nature being immutable, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no increaſe of glory or eſſence in it ſelfe, but yet was exalted in reſpect of the manifeſtation of the glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, which in the eſtate of humiliation was hidden, as it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:14246:218"/>
were, vnder a vaile, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. ſo that Chriſt was exalted in reſpect of Manifeſtation onely, as he was God. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was exalted abſolutely and ſimply, and that two waies, namely by the depoſition or laying downe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and by glorification or ſuſception of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling gifts. In the eſtate of exaltation Chriſt put off the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of our nature, which he aſſumed in his Incarnation, ſuch as were hunger, thirſt, wearineſſe in the body, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue ignorance, and feare and ſorrow in his ſoule. The gifts he receiued were both in body and ſoule: his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſcued from corruption, and death, and all miſery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incorruptible, immortall, impatible, and was made to ſhine with all purity, ſtrength, agility, and brightneſſe, as became the body of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44. His ſoule receiued all knowledge could befall a nature, euen the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perfect of all things that are, and all vertues and gifts in their higheſt degree that can be in a glorified creature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all bleſſed Angels and men. Yet by the way wee muſt know that Chriſt did receiue ſuch glory as did not deſtroy the humane nature. Chriſt laid downe all infirmities of the fleſh, but not the fleſh it ſelfe; for now hee is glorified, hee hath the ſame fleſh he had when he was borne and crucified: He was not emptied of the ſubſtance of his humanity, but in it glorified, not deified: for, How can a finite thing equall that which is infinite? And how can wee ſay wee beleeue in Chriſt God and Man, if he be no more a man? Wherefore we muſt conſtantly hold the difference between the Maieſtie vncreated, &amp; the Maieſtie created, which is in Chriſt; the one belongs to the Diuine nature, the other to the humane.</p>
                  <p>The good that comes to vs by his exaltation is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; the firſt is, the confirmation of our faith and hope: for his exaltation ſhewes plainly, that hee hath fully ſatisfied for our ſinnes, and conquered all our enemies, Sinne, the Law, Death, the Deuill, the Graue, and Hell, and that hee hath purchaſed Gods fauour, and all that concernes our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. The ſecond is, the perpetuation of his office, both as the Prophet and Apoſtle of our confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. <hi>vlt.</hi> as our Prieſt to make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:14246:219"/>
for vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. and as our eternall King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. 5. and 89. 36. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. and in all theſe by his glorification hee hath procured a larger donation and effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which makes the times vnder Chriſt more happy than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 39. In all his gifts he giues now as he that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue euery name that is named in heauen and earth. The third is, our owne exaltation; he was therefore exalted, that he might exalt vs to the glory of heauen, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of the exaltation of Chriſt, may ſerue greatly for our comfort, for beſides the former benefits, it may raiſe vp in vs an aſſurance of hope of preferment by him, ſeeing our Brother is ſo highly preferred: and withall, it may greatly encourage vs in all our ſuits to God, ſeeing wee haue Chriſt with him, that is ſo high in his fauour: and further, in all the ſtraits and diſtreſſes of the Church here on earth, this may ioy our hearts, that Chriſt is ſo highly preferred, that he is able to preſerue and deliuer the Church when pleaſeth him. But yet we muſt remember two things if wee would haue benefit by Chriſts exaltation; the one is, that wee be true Chriſtians, for elſe his preferment will not reach to vs; onely ſuch as are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, haue part in his glory, and ſuch are none but true beleeuers. The other is, that if wee will reigne with Chriſt, wee muſt ſuffer with him: wee ſee here how it was with him, firſt he was abaſed, and then exalted; ſo it muſt be with vs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Thus of his exaltation in generall. The firſt degree of his exaltation was his Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Reſurrection of Chriſt, diuers things are to be conſidered of;</p>

That Chriſt did riſe from the dead, we beleeue againſt all Iewes, Turkes, and prophane Mockers, and are enduced ſo to doe by teſtimony both diuine and humane. The diuine teſtimonies are three: firſt, the Spirit of God, which teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ech two waies; firſt, by the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, in the Euangelicall Story, which wee ought to beleeue if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had neuer beene eye-witneſſes: for if the witneſſe of men be receiued, the witneſſe of God is greater. Secondly, in the heart of euery beleeuer that relyes vpon the Goſpell, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 26. The ſecond teſtimony is the witneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who were ſent from heauen of purpoſe to ſignifie ſo much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 5. as by Angels the conception and birth of Chriſt was teſtified from heauen, ſo was his reſurrection. The third was the Apparition of Chriſt, ſhewing himſelfe many times aliue from the dead. The Humane teſtimonies were three; firſt was the teſtimony of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the other women that came to annoint the body of Ieſus, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 1. as a woman was the firſt that brought from the Deuill the tidings of ſinne vnto the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo a woman is the firſt that from the good Angels brings the tidings of the Reſurrection of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from our ſinnes. The ſecond was, the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and fifty Diſciples, and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who all ſaw Chriſt after hee was riſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6. The third was, the teſtimonies of the Souldiers that watched the Sepulchre: wherein obſerue the great prouidence of God, that makes the high Prieſts againſt their wils from theſe men to know, that Chriſt was riſen from the dead, who were ſet of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hinder the report of the Reſurrection, by watching the Sepulchre leſt his Diſciples ſhould ſteale away his body by night.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is quickly opened: If any aske, What of Chriſt did riſe? The anſwer is, That the body of Chriſt onely did riſe: his Deity could not, and the ſould did not.</p>
                  <p>For the time of the Reſurrection, Chriſt did riſe the third day, after the end of the Sabbath, on the firſt day of the weeke, about Sunne riſing: and concerning this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer diuers things are to be conſidered of; Firſt, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:14246:220"/>
Chriſt ſhould not riſe from the dead ſooner or later, than the third day from his death and buriall; for ſo it was foretold, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>He ſhall reſtore vs to life after two daies, (viz.</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall doe it) <hi>and the third day hee ſhall raiſe vs vp, (viz.</hi> in his owne perſon, which was a pledge of our Reſurrection) <hi>and wee ſhall liue in his ſight.</hi> It is thought S. <hi>Paul</hi> had reſpect vnto this place, when he ſaid, <hi>He roſe againe the third day according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this was prefigured by the type <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet, as our Sauiour himſelfe ſhewed in his life time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40. Thirdly, he could haue riſen as ſoone as hee was buried, but he would not, leſt the truth of his death ſhould haue beene queſtioned; and beyond the third day hee would not tarry, leſt the faith of his Diſciples ſhould faile, and leſt any ſhould haue cauſe to thinke that he brought not the ſame body was dead, but ſome other.</p>
                  <p>Further obſerue, that as Chriſt died the ſame day <hi>Adam</hi> was created, ſo he liued againe the ſame day the world began to be; the ſame day God made heauen and earth, the ſame day he filled the earth with the grace, and heauen with the ioy of the Reſurrection of Chriſt: and therefore this day was called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee roſe at the riſing of the Sunne, to ſhew that he was the true Sunne of righteouſneſſe, that was now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to enlighten the new and Chriſtian world, after the long night of darkneſſe and legall ſhadowes, and that hee had brought life and immortality to light, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth point (to wit) how Chriſt roſe, diuers things are to be anſwered: firſt, that he roſe by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>He raiſed himſelfe vp from the dead, Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. and 10. 18. and 5. 25. for though other Scriptures attribute reſurrection to God the Father &amp; the Holy Ghoſt, yet that hinders not the truth of this aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for in the works <hi>ad extra,</hi> all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity work, but yet in their order; God the Father, by the Son, through the Holy Ghoſt, raiſed the dead body of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he roſe by a way that neuer man roſe, and not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men haue riſen, or ſhall riſe, by a way peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Lord of Life, as the firſt borne of the Dead,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:14246:220"/>
as the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. 23. not as a priuate perſon, but as a publike perſon, as our head and ſurety. He ſaw no corruption in the Graue, as other dead bodies doe; and he roſe to immortall life, neuer to dye againe, whereas <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and others that were raiſed, were raiſed but to a mortall life, they were to dye againe, he was the firſt tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> euer roſe to eternall life. Thirdly, hee roſe in the ſame body that was dead and buried, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 39. which was neceſſary for our comfort, in the diſcharge of our debt, that the ſame body that was impriſoned, came out of priſon, and doth the better aſſure the hope of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies. Fourthly, he roſe <hi>inuitis cuſtodibus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Keepers of the Sepulchre would or not, and ſmote them with great amazement, to ſhew how eaſie it is for him to triumph ouer his enemies, when they ſeeme to bee ſureſt of victory. He that could conquer them when they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in appearance to oppoſe them but a dead body, can as eaſily defeat all his enemies, that onely differ from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only in greatneſſe of earthly power: If the Church were as the dead body of Chriſt, yet it may riſe againe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their armed Troopes. Fiſtly, hee roſe with an earthquake, that thereby hee might ſignifie, Firſt, that the earth did him homage, and as it were ſware fealty to him as her Lord and Proprietary. Secondly, that as the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his death, ſo now as it were is exalted for ioy that ſhee was to render him aliue from the dead. Thirdly, that Chriſt would ſhake the world, and the heart of man by his Goſpell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. Fourthly, that Chriſt by his power can and will make the earth giue vp her dead at the laſt day. Laſtly, the Angels miniſtred vnto him by rolling away the ſtone, &amp;c. to ſignifie, that not onely he was Lord of Angels, but that God was ſatisfied; as Iudges that ſend ſome officer to fetch the priſoner out of priſon and releaſe him.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, but why was it neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould riſe againe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, that had foretold it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 54. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the Scripture had not foretold, yet ſuch was the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:14246:221"/>
dignity of his perſon that he muſt needs riſe, for it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to be holden downe of Death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. for, firſt he was the onely Son of God, and the Father loues his Sonne, and cannot ſuffer him to be ouercome of death. Beſides, he was God himſelfe, the Author and Prince of life, and therefore it had beene abſurd for him to abide in death, that giues all others life. Thirdly, hee was a iuſt man, and innocent, and had fully ſatisfied for our ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God could not keepe him in priſon for nothing: and where ſinne is not, there death cannot reigne. Thus of the ſecond reaſon. Thirdly, ſuch was the office of him that roſe againe, that he could not abide in death; as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee muſt declare Gods name to his brethren, hee muſt make interceſſion, hee muſt reigne as a King euerlaſting, all which he could not doe if he abide in death. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a Decree for his reſurrection in Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Councell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. commpared with <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 32. 33. Fiftly, that the types and ſhadowes of it might bee fulfilled. <hi>Ionas</hi> was a type of the Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 39. So was <hi>Adam,</hi> waking out of the ſleepe into which hee was caſt when the Woman was made out of his ſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> was <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that brake aſunder the barres and gates, and was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: ſo was <hi>Dauid</hi> that was ſo often oppreſſed, and yet exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the kingdome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 13.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Apparitions of Chriſt after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the Scripture records that our Sauiour was on earth forty daies, and in that time appeared to many at ſeuerall times, ſhewing himſelfe aliue from the dead, and giuing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concerning his Kingdome: as hee was forty daies in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount, ſo was he forty daies in giuing order about the new Law to the Apoſtles, and hee that began to conſecrate himſelfe to the office appointed him by his Father in faſting forty daies, doth now take forty daies, both to lay downe that office, and to conſecrate the Miniſtery of his Diſciples. Now concerning theſe Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions diuers things are to be conſidered;
<list>
                        <item>1. The Reaſons why he appeared.</item>

                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:14246:221"/>
For the firſt, our Sauiour ſtaied a while vpon earth, and appeared at ſeuerall times for theſe Reaſons;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might confirme the infallible truth of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that the Chriſtian world might bee fully aſſured of it, that God had raiſed him from the dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 40, 41. and that he was raiſed in the ſame body that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and buried for our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he might giue order to his Diſciples concerning all things that concerned his Kingdome ouer <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and might appoint all the alterations were to bee made in the manner of gouerning the Chriſtian world, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 3. and thus hee inſtituted the ſeuerall orders of Miniſters vnder the Goſpell, granting full Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. and ſo we haue reaſon to beleeue, that the tranſlation of the day for the Chriſtian Sabbath, was by appointment from him, while he was on earth, with other things which the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he might giue gifts vnto the men that were to begin the worke of erecting the Chriſtian world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. promiſing to giue the holy Ghoſt more fully, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>The perſons to whom hee appeared are to be conſidered negatiuely, and affirmatiuely.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatiuely, he appeared not to the world, not to all the people, not to the chiefe Prieſts &amp; Rulers of the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. that therby he might ſhew, Firſt, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not of this world, <hi>Iob.</hi> 18. 36. Secondly, that he did not need the helpe and patronage of the greatneſſe of this world in buſineſſes of his Kingdome. Thirdly, that his Kingdome comes not by externall obſeruation, and is not obiected to the eyes of the body, but to the eyes of the minde and faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 20, 21. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 29. Fourthly, that the contempt of the meanes in the ordinances of Chriſt, ſhall bee ſcourged with a priuation of all fellowſhip with Chriſt in his glory: The chiefe Prieſts and Rulers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſers of the Doctrine and Miracles of Chriſt in his abaſement, are now iudged and plagued with this fearefull
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:14246:222"/>
preterition, that Chriſt will not vouch ſafe them ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as to let them ſee him in his glory any more, till they ſee him as their Iudge, as he threatned before he died, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 64. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He appeared (in the affirmatiue) vnto his owne, euen to witneſſes God had choſen of purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. And it is a charitable tradition of ſome of the Ancients, that all thoſe that ſaw Chriſt after his reſurrection were godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indeed, as well as diſciples in outward profeſſion: and thus he appeared the very day of his reſurrection fiue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> alone, out of whom hee had caſt ſeuen deuils, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. to ſhew that he was a redeemer of that ſex as well as of men: and that he came to ſaue ſinners, and deliuer them from the tyrannie of the deuill, and to remoue all ſuſpition of fraud or violence, that it might not be thought that he was lifted out of the graue by the power of men. In this apparition our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would not let <hi>Marie</hi> touch him, but vſeth theſe words, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but goe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay brethren,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the more ſtrange, becauſe he offereth himſelfe to <hi>Thomas</hi> to touch him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 17. 27. For anſwer of this doubt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our Sauiour did not ſimply forbid her to touch him, but in reſpect of the haſte of the meſſage to the diſciples: he would haue her leaue that ceremonie, and ſpeedily goe to tell his brethren. Yea he rather incourageth her to it at another time, for in ſaying, <hi>I am not yet aſcended,</hi> hee ſeemeth to meane, that ſhee might haue time enough to entertaine his bodily preſence, hee ſhould not yet goe away from them: but yet withall he intimates that after his aſcenſion ſhe might embrace him without ſtint or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, after that way of touching of him which was more profitable for her than this way was, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhee might doc it by faith in a ſpirituall manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the ſame <hi>Mary,</hi> and the other <hi>Mary,</hi> as they returned from the Sepulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the two diſciples going to <hi>Emnus.</hi> In this apparition
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:14246:222"/>
are diuers queſtions. As firſt, who theſe diſciples ſhould be: To which it is anſwered by many of the Ancients, that they were of the ſeuenty diſciples: and ſome thinke that <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ophas</hi> was an inhabitant at <hi>Emaus,</hi> and that the other diſciple ſhould be Saint <hi>Luke</hi> himſelfe, becauſe he doth not name who it was, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the naming of himſelfe in his Storie: but all this is coniecturall, and doth not much concerne vs to know who they were. Secondly, a queſtion is moued about the bodie of Chriſt, what ſhould be the reaſon that the diſciples did not know him, when he went and talked with them by the way: and the rather, becauſe it is ſaid, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did not know that it was <hi>Ieſus:</hi> was it becauſe the glorified body of Chriſt was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inuiſible, ſuch as mortall eyes could not know? For anſwer hereunto: ſome thinke that Chriſt did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in another ſhape and metamorphoſed himſelfe: but this anſwer cannot be ſound: for to what end were his apparitions, but to ſhew that he was truly riſen from the dead, in the ſame body that died? and beſides it is a dreame to thinke that the ſame body cannot ſuffer a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis,</hi> and ſtill remaine the ſame true body it was. Secondly, ſome thinke it came from the habit and kinde of rayment he appeared in, as here he ſhewed himſelfe in the habit of a Traueller, and to <hi>Mary</hi> in the habit of the Gardiner: but yet this anſwer doth not ſuffice. Thirdly therfore, from the Text it ſelf we muſt look for the reaſon, &amp; ſo it is ſaid, that their eies were held that they could not know him. The cauſe was in the power of Chriſt, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon their ſight, and not in the ſhape of the body of Chriſt: but yet if we obſerue that it is not ſaid ſo of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and that Chriſt ſcarce euer appeared to the Apoſtles, no not after they beleued that he was riſen, but in part or in ſome degree for a time, they doubted and did not know him, therefore I conceiue, that the cauſe may be ſafely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the qualitie of his body now glorified: for though the beames of his perfect glory were reſtrained for the forty dayes, yet he carried about a true glorified
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:14246:223"/>
body, which is ſo much altered in qualitie (though the ſubſtance be the ſame) as it is called a ſpirituall bodie, and therefore no wonder though it were not ſo eaſily knowne. And the like may be ſaid, about his vaniſhing out of their ſight: for though it be true, that thereby cannot be meant the annihilating of the ſubſtance of his body, but the withdrawing of it from them, for he was not vaniſhed out of ſight, (but out of their ſight:) yet the manner how hee became ſo ſoone inuiſible to them, may ariſe from ſomething in the qualitie of a glorified body, that it is endued with ſuch agilitie, as it can remoue it ſelfe in an inſtant out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Apparition was to <hi>Simon Peter</hi> alone, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 34. Note that the words vttered in that verſe were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Apoſtles and thoſe that were with them, not by the Diſciples that came from <hi>Emaus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Apparition was to the Apoſtles and others at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the abſence of <hi>Thomas, Ioh.</hi> 20. 19, &amp;c. The doubt is here, how Chriſt could get in, the doores being ſhut? Some thinke he might by his power cauſe the doores to giue way to him as their Creator, and ſuddenly ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: or elſe that he that could thicken the water to make it carry him when he walked on the Sea, could rariſie and make thin and ſoft the ſubſtance of the doore to let him goe thorow it: but what need theſe gueſſes? That he went in the doores being ſhut we beleeue; how he went in we know not: nor will this helpe the Papiſts in their buſineſſe of Tranſubſtantiation; for that he went thorow the doores is no more ſaid in the Text, than that the doores gaue place. Beſides, if their opinion were true, that his bodie could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate thorow a doore, to what end did he appeare to his Diſciples? Or how can he confute their opinion that hee was not a ſpirit? Further, if it were granted, yet they could only proue that two bodies might be in one place, but not that one body could be in many places, at one time. In this Apparition there are ſome other things to be noted: As firſt, about the time of it, it is ſaid it was the ſame day at euening, out of which I gather that the euening did belong
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14246:223"/>
to that day now ſpent, which proues that the day was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from morning to morning, and ſo muſt we reckon our Sabbath. Secondly, in this Apparition the words of our Sauiour to the Diſciples are to be noted. And his words are words of ſalutation, and words of commiſſion. In the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hee wiſheth, or rather commandeth peace to come vpon them: they ſhould haue much trouble in the world, but in Chriſt they ſhould haue peace. And withall they might thence gather, that as any men doe more further and diſpatch the worke of Chriſt, ſo they ſhall more abound in inward peace, and quiet of heart and conſcience, and if we haue peace within, we ſhould not greatly care what troubles or difficulties we meet withall without. The words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, declare both the authoritie of their office in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the confirmation of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their miniſterie, both by ſigne, and by promiſe. The dignitie of their office is great, for as God ſent Chriſt, ſo Chriſt ſends them on embaſſage to the world: They doe no other worke, than what God laid vpon his owne Sonne: The ſigne that ſhould confirme them, was that Chriſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed on them, and ſaid, <hi>Receiue the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this might confirme them two waies, <hi>viz.</hi> both in reſpect of themſelues, and in reſpect of their hearers: In reſpect of themſelues, they need not feare the difficultie of the worke, for their ſufficiencie ſhould be from the Holy Ghoſt. The Spirit of Chriſt ſhould qualifie them and inſpire them to do all that was required of them: In reſpect of their hearers, they muſt take comfort, for that God that made a creation of life in man by breathing vpon him, could and would breath ſpirituall life into the dead world by their preaching. The promiſe annexed to their commiſſion is, that whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſinnes according to the tenor of the couenant of grace in the Goſpell they ſhould publikely or priuately remit, their pardon ſhould be ratified in heauen: and contrariwiſe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould for their impenitencie and contumacie be by them bound ouer to the Iudgement of Chriſt according to the tenor of the couenant of works, and according to the malediction pronounced againſt all ſuch as deſpiſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:14246:224"/>
Chriſt would ratifie their act, in the day of death and iudgement, and for the preſent account of them as perſons reiected of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the fiue Apparitions, on the day of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In the reſt of the 40. dayes we reade of ſix other Apparitions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was the eighth day after the reſurrection to the Apoſtles, <hi>Thomas</hi> being preſent, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 24, &amp;c. Where I note only two things: the occaſion of this Apparition, and the manner of it. The occaſion of it was the vnbeleefe of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which was very grieuous, as containing in it many faults, <hi>viz.</hi> forgetfulneſſe of the doctrine of Chriſt, that had foretold his reſurrection; and wilfull blindneſſe, for though he be told by them as had ſeene the Lord, that Chriſt was riſen, yet he profeſſeth he will not beleeue: and withall an inſolent limiting of God, that vnleſſe he may ſee and feele the print of the nailes and ſpeare, he proteſteth he will not beleeue. Which as it ſheweth what wickedneſſe may lodge in the hearts of good men, ſo it exalteth the praiſe of the compaſſion and patience of Chriſt, that will ſhew mercy in curing ſuch Chriſtians. But yet obſerue the iuſtice of Chriſt vpon ſuch wayward Chriſtians: Firſt, he is kept a long time, <hi>viz.</hi> eight dayes without comfort; and beſides, he loſeth that glorious doctrine was deliuered in the former Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>In the manner of the Apparition, obſerue both the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the words of Chriſt. The circumſtances are reported, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. and are the ſame with the former Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, of purpoſe to helpe the faith of <hi>Thomas,</hi> when hee ſhould ſee it done as the Apoſtles had before told him. The words of our Sauiour are directed either by way of ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Diſciples, or by ſpeciall appellation to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> in the ſalutation he wiſheth them peace as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſhew them that in this world, in doing their worke, it was enough for them if they could poſſeſſe a heart and conſcience within that was at peace, though in all outward things they finde trouble. In the words to <hi>Thomas,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what our Sauiour ſaid, and the effect in <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:14246:224"/>
our Sauiours reply. In his firſt words, to ſhew that he knew all things, and heard euery word <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſaid in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he cals to him to do according to the words of his own wilfull limitation, but withall giues him a laſh for his vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. It is the portion of wayward Chriſtians, euen when God doth moſt comfort them, to meet with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ierks from God, and withall they may ſee, that though men would forget their wilfulneſſe, yet Chriſt remembers it. And as appeares by the reply afterwards, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and doe their beſt, yet their comfort is mixed with their diſpraiſe. The effect in <hi>Thomas</hi> was an excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, excelling the moſt confeſſions had beene made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, expreſſing more than was in queſtion, and much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of heart, both in beleeuing in Chriſt, and reſoluing to be ruled by him, when he ſaid with ſuch words, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> Which ſhewes how Chriſt can glorifie his power in making weake Chriſtians ſometimes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe more life of faith and knowledge than ſtronger Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. In the reply our Sauiour commends that faith moſt, that reſteth leaſt vpon ſenſe and feeling.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Apparition was to ſeuen of the Diſciples as they went to fiſhing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 1, &amp;c. Where the things I would obſerue either concerne the time of this Apparition, or the perſons to whom, or are taken from the ſubſtance of the Storie it ſelfe. About the time I may take occaſion to cleare a doubt, which is this: The Diſciples were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded immediatly after the reſurrection, by a meſſage ſent them by the women from Chriſt, that they ſhould meet him on a Mountaine in Galile, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 10. 16. Now it appeares by the time of this and the former Apparition, that they tarry many daies in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The anſwer is, that they were bound to tarry in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> eight daies becauſe of the Paſſeouer, and it ſeemes they were now going into that place in Galile.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perſons to whom he appeares, they were ſeuen of them of different conditions; <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> had fallen ſhamefully; <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was no Apoſtle, but yet a man without guile; the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> had beleeued after
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:14246:225"/>
they had ſeene the Lord, two other Diſciples are not named, and toward all theſe in a different reſpect is the loue of Chriſt ſhewed: Chriſt will manifeſt himſelfe not only to conſtant Chriſtians, but to ſuch as haue fallen and repented; nor only to Apoſtles, but to priuate Chriſtians; not only to knowne and eminent Diſciples, but to ſuch as we know not.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſubſtance of the Storie: the things I ſhall obſerue for the letter of it, either concerne the eſtate of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in outward things, or the demonſtration of the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſt. About the eſtate of godly men, I note three things. Firſt, that ſuch as are deare vnto God, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of great place in the Church, may befor a time expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to great wants in outward things. As here the Apoſtles that were called to be conquerors and commanders of the world, are faine to goe a fiſhing to get them meat to ſuſtaine their liues. Secondly, that men may take great paines in a lawfull calling, and yet many times get little or nothing: as here they are a fiſhing all night, and can catch nothing. Thirdly, that great wants and diſappointments in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes of life, doe ſometimes forerume extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſupplies from God. They that can catch no fiſh in the Sea, finde fiſh broyling on the Land. The Diuinitie of Chriſt was demonſtrated three waies, by all which they might plainly ſee, he had loſt none of his power by death. Firſt, that by his direction they catch a great draught of fiſh, that could themſelues catch nothing. Secondly, that the net was not broken, though it dragged great fiſhes to the number of an hundred fiftie &amp; three. The third was, that on the ſhore was miraculouſly prouided a fire with fiſh broyling on it.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the literall ſenſe of the Storie. It is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that our Sauiour, that tooke occaſion when he firſt called his Diſciples from their fiſhing to inſtruct them about their office in being fiſhers of men, did likewiſe intend by this manifeſtation of himſelfe to them now they were fiſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to giue them firſt inſtructions, from what fell out then, concerning their myſticall fiſhing, which they were to goe about within a little time after: and ſo the compariſon holds in many things. The Diſciples are the Miniſters of the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:14246:225"/>
Goſpell, the ſhip is the Church, the world is the Sea, the fiſhes are the people of the world where the Goſpell is, the caſting of the Net is the preaching of the Goſpell, the ſhore is heauen, or that eſtate into which we are brought by the power of the word in outward profeſſion. Now about this fiſhing we may be inſtructed in many things from this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the proper end of the labours of Miniſters is to catch ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is difference of gifts and qualities in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as there was in theſe Diſciples went a fiſhing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the beſt place to fiſh in is the Sea, and not ſmall Riuers or Brookes. The places to catch ſoules are thoſe where there is the greateſt multitude of people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in the ſpirituall fiſhing we fiſh in the darke, as they did in the night: we cannot ſee where our nets fall, or what hearts of our hearers our words fall vpon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That godly Miniſters may take great paines, and yet catch nothing: as they fiſhed all night and caught nothing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Chriſt is preſent with his ſeruants in the worke, or when they haue not ſucceſſe, though they diſcerne him not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That it is the ſpeciall prouidence of Chriſt if any ſoules be caught, and comes by his direction.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That many of Gods deare ſeruants may take great paines, and yet ſcarce get meat to keepe them. <hi>Children haue yee any meat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. That after long fruitleſneſſe, Chriſt may bleſſe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of his ſeruants to effectuall conuerſion of ſoules; but then vſually they muſt turne to the other ſide of the ſhip, get them to other people.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That ſometimes God doth ſhew his power in giuing great ſucceſſe to the miniſterie of his ſeruants, euen when it is not looked for: but it is very rare, as was the great draught of fiſhes.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That a powerfull and ſucceſfull miniſterie, is one of the moſt effectuall meanes to manifeſt and diſcouer Chriſt and his preſence on earth.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:14246:226"/>
12. That godly Miniſters that ſeeke Chriſt in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may differ much in zeale, and yet all meet in the end with Chriſt vpon the ſhore. <hi>Peter</hi> leaps into the Sea, which ſeemed a kinde of vnwarranted ſingularitie of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and yet he did not ill; the other Diſciples came ſlowly in a Boat to ſhore, and yet are not blamed for want of loue to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That it is great deale of buſineſſe to get euen godly people to heauen: as here the Diſciples haue a great toile in it, to drag the fiſhes after they haue caught them, to bring them to ſhore.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That the beſt fiſhing is to fiſh for great fiſh. For though it be a bleſſed thing when the poore receiue the Goſpell, yet if we could catch the great ones of the world, they would bring much more glory to God.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That in places where many are caught by the preaching of the Goſpell, it is a wonder, if the net be not broken, that is, if diuiſion and ſome rent in vnitie follow not. It is the great power of Chriſt if it be otherwiſe: but yet note, it is not humble Chriſtians (the ſmall fiſhes) but either great men, or ſuch as are growne big with conceit of their gifts, that breake the net. Yea note, that men may continue long in profeſſion, and yet breake the net in the end, as great fiſhes doe that fall a bounſing when they come neere the ſhore. In generall, here is intimated, that great concourſe of hearers indangers the preaching: the net payes for it, the fiſh eſcape: but yet wee ſee Chriſt can preuent all this when pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The end of all this fiſhing is a ſweet dinner with the Lord Ieſus in heauen, which ſweet fellowſhip with Chriſt is beyond all ſimilitude, and therefore the Euangeliſt doth not ſtriue to ſet out the dinner in many words.</p>
                  <p>The third Apparition was to the eleuen Diſciples on a Mountaine in <hi>Galilee,</hi> concerning which both <hi>S. Matthew, chap.</hi> 28. 16, &amp;c. and <hi>S. Marke, chap.</hi> 16. 14, &amp;c. make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Concerning which Apparition (if both the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts be compared together) we may obſerue</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The place where Chriſt appoints his Diſciples to meet
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:14246:226"/>
him, <hi>viz.</hi> a Mountaine, as a place neare to heauen, and further from worldly diſtractions, and where he might more freely diſcourſe with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The condition of the Diſciples, when Chriſt comes to them, he finds them (as <hi>S. Marke</hi> ſaith) ſitting together, and it is likely they ſate ſo expecting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt to them, being wearied with trauell to the place: herein the Diſciples are a fit reſemblance of the condition of our aſſemblies: what are we all when we meet in the houſe of God, but poore diſciples that ſit here to watch when Ieſus will appeare amongſt vs? we are deſolate creatures caſt out of the world, that haue no happineſſe but in the preſence of Chriſt with vs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The effect of the Apparition in the Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome beleeued and worſhipped him, but ſome doubted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 17. The right faith in Chriſt and knowledge of him, doth breed adoration and the worſhip of Chriſt. And herein the inward manifeſtation of Chriſt to the hearts of true Chriſtians, differs from illuſions in Hypocrites, that in true reuelations of the preſence of Chriſt, the effect is a greater care of the worſhip of Chriſt, and practiſe of all holy duties, whereas illuſions make men more proud, and careleſſe of holy duties. But how is it to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that ſome doubted? Interpreters are diuided in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Some ſay that they that doubted were other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that had neuer ſeene Chriſt, not the Eleuen, that had ſo often ſeene him. Some anſwer, that this doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is to be referred to ſome other time, not to this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prition, <hi>S. Matthew</hi> for breuitie ſake giuing a touch of what fell out in all the Apparitions: And ſo <hi>ſome doubted,</hi> muſt be expounded, <hi>Some had doubted,</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> for one. But I thinke their opinion is the moſt probable that hold that none of the Diſciples here doubted whether Chriſt were riſen, but that at the firſt they did not know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that appeared were Chriſt or not: which was no new weakneſſe in them, for when he ſtood on the ſhoare at the ſea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> it was a good while before any of them knew him.</p>

4. The words our Sauiour ſpake to them: and thoſe if the Euangeliſts be compared, are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Words of vpbraiding or reprehenſion: Hee vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them for their vnbeleefe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 14. and for their hardneſſe of heart, in not beleeuing them that had ſeene him after his Reſurrection; which hee doth moſt wiſely and ſeaſonably: Firſt, it would doe them good to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, before they receiued ſo glorious a commiſſion; they might know it was not for any merit in them, that they were ſo aduanced. Secondly, it might warne them to take heed of that ſinne of vnbeleefe, not only as that which was moſt hatefull to Chriſt, but as that they would be often tempted to, when they went about their worke, by reaſon of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and troubles would befall them. Thirdly, moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he now tell them of their vnbeleefe, that they might be the more compaſſionate and patient when they were to deale with the Nations about their vnbeleefe; and not think it much if their report were at firſt reiected, ſeeing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had been ſo ſlow of heart to beleeue what was written. In generall, we may ſee here what comes of peruerſeneſſe in any infirmitie: We may perhaps heare Chriſt vpbraiding vs, at ſuch times when we looke for nothing but comfort: and therefore let all men and women be warned to take heed of this ſinne of way wardneſſe, and vnteachableneſſe, we may heare of it when we thinke Chriſt hath forgiuen and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Words of declaration: <hi>All power is giuen me both in heauen and earth.</hi> About theſe words we may enquire, both about the ſenſe of them, and about the end or vſe of them: For the ſenſe, had not he all power before and from eternitie as God? Or if it be meant of a power communicated to the Humane Nature, how is it that he had it not from his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? The anſwer is, that he ſpeakes of a power he had, both as God and man, and ſuch a power as he had not before, becauſe this is the power he obtaines as Redeemer of the world, and the price was not laid downe actually, till he had giuen himſelfe as a Sacrifice for ſinne, and had <hi>humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the death, euen the death of the Croſſe.</hi> Now he had
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:14246:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
purchaſed the inheritance of the Nations, now he might lawfully ſend them to take poſſeſſion for him; and if he were reſiſted, he might winne his owne by a ſpirituall conqueſt: of this power is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. and 110. 1. <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 6, 8, 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. Now for the end or vſe of this declaration of Chriſts patent or power, it might ſerue for perpetuall vſe both to the Apoſtles, and all Teachers of the Goſpell, and to their hearers too. To the Apoſtles this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was neceſſary, becauſe of the greatneſſe of the things they were charged to proclaime to the world: for he had need to haue a name aboue euery name, that ſhould in his name offer &amp; giue eternall life to the world, and ſhould chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all the world to come vnder, and doe homage to him, and ſhould ſend ſuch a meſſage in his doctrine, as ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due euery high thing, and ſhould lay all mankind, as it were, at his foot. And though the conqueſt of the Nations might ſeeme an impoſſible worke, yet they need not doubt to goe about it, ſeeing they are ſent from him that hath all power. And the like comfort may all faithfull Miniſters gather from hence againſt all the difficulties of their worke; they ſerue him that hath all power. And ſo in generall this is a doctrine of admirable comfort to all true Chriſtians of any degree, that will be perſwaded to ſerue the Lord Ieſus; they cannot ſerue a better Maſter. No maſter hath ſuch power to preferre them: He hath all power on earth, but if he did it not here, yet he hath all power in heauen, they ſhall be ſure of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Words of commandement, and ſo, his charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes either the doctrine they ſhould teach, or the ſigne by which they ſhould confirme it, <hi>viz. Baptiſme.</hi> As for their doctrine, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Goe preach the Goſpell to euery creature.</hi> The obſeruations are diuers, that if many times God did not ſend the Goſpell to vs, we ſhould periſh, before we would go and ſeeke it. Secondly, that preaching is the ordinary meanes to conquer the world to God. Thirdly, that all Nations need to be taught, and euery creature of euery Nation. They that thinke they can finde the way to heauen without teaching,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:14246:228"/>
are certainly in the direct way to hell. Fourthly, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall worke for the higheſt Miniſters in the Church to do, is to preach the Goſpell. Fiftly, that the doctrine of our Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God in Ieſus Chriſt, is the principall doctrine to be taught or learned. Sixtly, that grace and mercy in Ieſus Chriſt from God, is offered to euery creature vpon condition of faith and repentance: None is excepted. Thus of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The ſigne by which they ſhould confirme their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, was Baptiſme, which was added as Gods broad ſeale to aſſure vs the good things promiſed in the Goſpell, and in particular, if they did beleeue, as certainly as the water did waſh away the filth of the body, ſo ſhould the bloud of Chriſt waſh away the ſins of their ſoules. About the forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme the Trinitie muſt be expreſly mentioned, it muſt be done in the name of the Trinitie, both in reſpect of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſignifie that they were authoriſed to baptiſe by all the Trinitie, and in reſpect of Confeſſion, that no ſaluation could be had without the beleefe of the Trinitie, and eſpecially in reſpect of fellowſhip with the Trinity, as a fruit of faith and Baptiſme, for they had power to ſignifie to true Chriſtians, that in Baptiſme they were married to the Trinitie, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into an euerlaſting fellowſhip with the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. As the wife at her mariage receiues the name of her husband; ſo all Chriſtian ſoules are transferred from the names of their owne naturall condition, to a glorious fruition of the name of God; and therefore in the Originall the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, rendered, <hi>in,</hi> hath the force of <hi>into,</hi> as well as <hi>in.</hi> Baptiſe them into the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Words of conſolation: and ſo he comforts them by two arguments, the one taken from the ſucceſſe of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the other from his own perpetuall preſence with them. The argument from the ſucceſſe of their doctrine is recorded by Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and that is two-fold; the one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, the other extraordinary. The ordinary ſucceſſe is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the good, or in the bad. In the good, ſo many as will beleeue, and are baptiſed, and will obſerue all that Chriſt commands them (which is to be ſupplied out of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew)</hi>
                     <pb n="473" facs="tcp:14246:228"/>
they ſhall be as certainly ſaued in heauen, as they are taught on earth. And contrariwiſe, ſuch as will not beleeue, and receiue their doctrine, Chriſt wil reuenge it vpon them, with the damnation of their ſoules, nor ſhall their Baptiſme helpe them, if they will not beleeue and obey, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. The extraordinary ſucceſſe ſhould be in the ſignes ſhould follow ſuch as beleeue, which are reckoned, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 17, 18. and theſe are attributed to all beleeuers, though they were to be done but by ſome only, becauſe the end of thoſe miracles was to glorifie the doctrine beleeued on by all. Nor did theſe ſignes laſt vnto all times, but onely in the firſt times of the Church, for the more effectual confirmation of that doctrine which could not be demonſtrated by naturall arguments. Nor did euery beleeuer, that ſhewed ſome of them, ſhew all of them; ſome ſpake with new tongues, that yet could not heale the ſicke, for there were diuerſities of gifts and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet all from one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5. The ſecond argument of conſolation, is taken from his perpetuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them, to the end of the world: which muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his ſpirituall preſence, and muſt be extended to all the godly, eſpecially Miniſters, ſeeing the Apoſtles could not liue themſelues to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the third Apparition after the day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. We reade of the appearing of our Sauiour at three other times beſides theſe, as to more than fiue hundred bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6. and to <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle alone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6. And then laſtly vpon the day of his Aſcenſion he appeared to the Apoſtles on Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> not far from <hi>Bethania, Act.</hi> 1. 12. Of theſe three I haue nothing to ſay, for concerning two of them, we reade nothing in Scripture but the bare mention of them; and for the laſt, it belongs to the Article of his Aſcenſion. And thus of the Apparitions of Chriſt after his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The laſt part of my Diuiſion, that concernes the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is about the fruit of the Reſurrection, or the good that comes to vs by our Sauiours riſing from the dead: and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Reſurrection of our Sauiour ſerues exceedingly to
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:14246:229"/>
confirme our faith, and to aſſure vs that he was the Sonne of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that could thus miraculouſly raiſe himſelfe from the dead, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 17, 18. and 2. 19. to 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 39, 40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reſurrection of Chriſt aſſures vs of our Iuſtification from our ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. The Father by deliuering Chriſt to death, did actually condemne our ſinnes in his fleſh as our ſurety, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. So by letting him out of the priſon of the graue in his Reſurrection, he did actually abſolue, and acquit him from the obligation in which he was bound, and ſo in diſcharging him, doth acknowledge payment and ſatisfaction, and ſo we are diſcharged too: If he had not riſen, we had been ſtill in our ſinnes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Reſurrection of Chriſt is the cauſe of a two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in vs. The firſt Reſurrection is of the ſoule from the death of ſinne, to the life of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and this flowes from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. The ſecond is of the body out of the graue, which is to be accompliſhed at the laſt Iudgement: of which the Reſurrection of Chriſt is both the cauſe and the pledge, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 14. And a taſte of this Chriſt gaue in the reſurrection of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Saints, that appeared to many in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vpon his Reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 52, 53.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Reſurrection of Chriſt begets in vs a liuely hope of a moſt glorious inheritance in heauen: As the Apoſtle ſhewes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. where we ſhall for euer triumph with him in the victory ouer Death, and the Graue, and Hell, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Now the reaſon of all this is, becauſe Chriſt ſuſtained our perſon, and roſe againe, as well as died, in our ſtead: He died and roſe againe as a publike perſon, and a root of a new mankinde: and beſides the ſame Spirit that raiſed Ieſus

                  <p>The vſe of this Article may be diuers.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Chriſt: the Apoſtle ſayes he was mightily declared to be the Sonne of God, by the Reſurrection from the dead. He that could ouercome ſo great Enemies, as Sin, Death, the Graue, and Hell; and had power of himſelfe to take vp his life, muſt needs be God: and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the words of the ſecond <hi>Pſalme, Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi> to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which is true in reſpect of the manifeſtation of his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of Inſtruction: and ſo firſt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. chargeth vs in a ſpeciall manner to remember this Article, and to lay faſt hold vpon it: for <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Ieſus died, but a Chriſtian muſt goe further, to beleeue that he was raiſed from the dead. Secondly, wee ſhould learne from Chriſts Reſurrection, to riſe to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life. A Chriſtian ſhould be aſhamed to lye dead in the graues of ſinne, when his Sauiour is riſen from the dead: Nay if we be ingrafted into Chriſt aright, wee are riſen with him, and are aliue from the dead, and ſhew it by a ſpirituall liuelineſſe, in all parts of a renewed conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore if thou wouldeſt haue comfort that thou art a true Chriſtian, thou muſt ſhew it by liuing in a new conuerſation, and by awaking from ſpirituall ſlumbring and ſecuritie, and ſtanding vp from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. If there be life in the Head, there is life in all the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. And if thou haue no part in this firſt Reſurrection, thou art in danger to be ſwallowed vp of the ſecond death, <hi>Reu.</hi> 20. 6. and therefore we muſt all with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeke the vertue of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And to this end we muſt daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelues, with honeſt and good hearts, before the voice of Chriſt in the Goſpell, which is able to raiſe vp the dead hearts of men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 25. and withall pray to God by his power, to plucke vp our hearts out of the

                  <p n="3">3. By way of conſolation, and ſo it is comfortable foure wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Againſt deſperate afflictions: if we be brought as low as Chriſt was by the hand of God, or malice of men, yet we ſhould hope in God, who is able to raiſe vs vp from moſt deadly croſſes. Thus the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> tells the people their dead men ſhall liue, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againſt the combat with Gods wrath for our ſinnes. We may ſafely flie to the Reſurrecton of Chriſt, to aſſure our Iuſtification: hee died and was buried for our ſinnes, and therefore riſing from the dead, it muſt needs be for our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. Seeing in his Reſurrection hee comes our of Priſon, and ſo declares that he hath diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all our debt, and this a good conſcience may plead to ſaue it ſelfe againſt the ſeas of Gods wrath, if they were like the waters of the Deluge, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the point of our Sanctification, againſt our ſinnes, and the power and filth of them; for if leſus be aliue, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this life as our head, and for vs: as the head is the fountaine of Senſes whence they are deriued to all the parts of the body, ſo is Chriſt our Head the Fountaine of ſpirituall life and ſenſes, whence comes life and ſenſe to euery member: If Chriſt roſe the third day, then after two dayes alſo we ſhall be reuiued, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1, 2.

Nor ſhould weake Chriſtians be diſcouraged, that finde not a like degree or meaſure of life, as other Chriſtians haue from Chriſt: for all the members haue not a like meaſure of ſenſe from the head, and Chriſt doth conueigh the influence of his grace by degrees; as he that went into

the water that ran out of the Temple, firſt was in to the Ankles, then to the knees, then to the loynes, then it grew ſo deepe, as it could not be ſounded to the bottome: ſo is it with the water of life in true Chriſtians, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47. 3, 4, 5.

                  <p>For the ſecond queſtion, diuers things are to be anſwered, <hi>viz.</hi> that he aſcended, firſt by his owne power, euen by the power of his diuine nature, carrying vp his body into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and opening heauen to bring in his Humanity, as alſo by a vertue in his glorified body, which was able to moue vpward, as well as downward. Secondly, that being about to leaue his Diſciples, in a ſolemne manner hee lift vp his hands and bleſſed them. To bleſſe, is ſometimes to wiſh a bleſſing, as when Parents bleſſe their Children. Sometimes it is to pronounce a bleſſing, as when the Prieſts bleſſed the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 22. or <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 14. 19. ſometime it is to foretell a bleſſing, as when <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed his two ſonnes: ſometimes it is to conferre a bleſſing, and ſo only God bleſſeth vs, and his Sonne Chriſt. God bleſſeth vs in beſtowing all ſpirituall bleſſings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. And ſo when wee read that Chriſt bleſſed them, lifting vp his hands, wee muſt thinke of him
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:14246:232"/>
as that bleſſed ſeed, the fountaine of bleſſings to all Nations, in whom onely all bleſſedneſſe was to be had, that had now ſatisfied Gods Iuſtice, and remoued the curſe, and therefore had power to eſtate bleſſing vpon his Diſciples, and all true Chriſtians for euer. This bleſſing was the fruit of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Reſurrection, and belongs to all the godly to the worlds end, and therefore he leaues his bleſſing on earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to aſcend to heauen. Vnto this bleſſed Father and Sauiour ſhould we daily flie, and ſeeke his bleſſing, which is able to doe vs more good than all the bleſſings of men or Angels. Thirdly, that hee aſcended viſibly in the ſight of his Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. and therefore he did not vaniſh and become inuiſible in himſelfe, as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries</hi> dreame. Fourthly, he made vſe of the ſeruice of a cloud, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him as he departed, and caried him vp as it were a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and at length hid him from the eyes of his Diſciples: and thus he did, to proue, that it was he of whom it had been long before ſaid, <hi>Hee maketh his Clouds his Chariot, Pſal.</hi> 104. 3. and withall to reſtraine curioſity, he doth as it were draw a curtaine betweene his body and their eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this myſtery and our mindes, that we ſhould reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in beleeuing that hee did aſcend, and not buſie our heads about vnprofitable and curious queſtions, in things not reuealed. And further, it may be thereby was ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the manner of our meeting with our Sauiour at the laſt day, that as a cloud tooke him away, ſo in the clouds ſhould we meet him againe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. Thus of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point.</p>
                  <p>The third queſtion is, When hee aſcended? and to that the anſwer is ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> forty dayes after his reſurrection: why hee ſtaied forty daies before he aſcended, was ſhewed before, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee might inſtruct his Diſciples about his Kingdome; and withall, to ſhew that the doctrine of the Goſpell was not inferiour to the doctrine of the Law, which <hi>Moſes</hi> was in receiuing from the mouth of God forty daies in the Mount: and as he was forty daies in the wilderneſſe meditating of his worke, before he began to preach, ſo is hee forty daies in preparing his Diſciples, before hee ſend them
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:14246:232"/>
forth about that great Worke of the conuerſion of the Nations.</p>
                  <p>The fourth queſtion is, From what place hee aſcended, and that is noted by the Euangeliſt <hi>S. Luk. Chap.</hi> 24. 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>viz.</hi> that he went vp into heauen from off ſome part of the mount of <hi>Oliues,</hi> that was neere the Towne of <hi>Bethania.</hi> Now it is coniectured by Diuines, that hee choſe this place of purpoſe; Firſt, that in the ſame place he might ſhew the proofe of his Diuinity and Glory, in which before he had ſhewed the extreme proofe of his frailty and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when in that place hee ſweat blood, ſtrugling vnder the brunt of Gods fierce wrath; and in that place hee began the declaration of his greateſt glory, where not long before hee had begun to feele &amp; ſuffer his greateſt ignominie and paine. Secondly, this mountainiſh place ſerued ſomewhat to awake the affections of the godly, to teach them to get as high as they can aboue the world and worldly occaſions, haſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their bleſſed Sauiour that is gone vp to heauen before them. Thirdly, <hi>Bethania</hi> ſignifies the houſe of affliction; and ſo by his aſcending to the glory of heauen from that place, he might leaue vs an aſſurance, that a paſſage may be had yea vnto all the godly ſhall bee prepared to attaine vnto the ioyes of heauen, euen through many tribulations: we may aſcend out of the houſe of ſorrow, bed of ſickneſſe, vale of teares, the land of captiuity, vnto heauen, as well as from Ieruſalem a place of peace: Yea, ſuch afflicted ones may much comfort themſelues in the hope that Chriſt will take them to heauen, out of theſe places of ſorrow, in his due time.</p>
                  <p>The fift queſtion is, Whither he aſcended? and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that is in the <hi>Creed,</hi> and the Scriptures before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, into Heauen; and Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, Hee went to his Father in heauen, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 12. and 20. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 20. Now this heauen doth not ſignifie God himſelfe, or a heauenly conuerſation, or heauenly glory, but by heauen is meant that place of eternall bleſſedneſſe, which is without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible world, which is aboue all theſe moueable &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heauens, and to vs now liuing on earth is inuiſible. It is
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14246:233"/>
that place that Chriſt calls, The houſe of his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which are many Manſions, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 12. and <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the place of Gods habitation, the heauens, <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1. and the habitation of his holineſſe in heauen, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 31. Chriſt therefore is now in that higheſt heauen, which muſt contain him til the times of the reſtoring of all things. It is obiected, that Chriſt aſcended aboue all heauens, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, aboue all theſe viſible heauens, aboue the Aire and the coeleſtiall Orbes, in which are the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and ſo went into that heauen called the third heauen, which is the ſeat of the bleſſed. It is further obiected, if Chriſt aſcended aboue all thoſe worldly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, then his body is in no place, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proues in his firſt booke of heauen, that aboue all heauens is no place. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is falſe that aboue all heauens is no place, for though there bee not ſuch a place as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <hi>Phyſically,</hi> yet there is a place: for where there is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there muſt needs be a ſpace in which that body is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to that knowne ſaying, Take away ſpaces from bodies &amp; they will be no where, and if no where, then they are not. This ſpace the Scripture calls a place. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> we oppoſe the expreſſe authority of Chriſt himſelfe, who affirmeth, there are places in heauen, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2, 3. Now God would haue vs to know whither Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended for three Reaſons: Firſt, that we might be certaine he remained ſtill a true man, euen in his glory in heauen. Secondly, that wee might know whither to conuert our thoughts and deſires, and where our hearts might finde Chriſt: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If yee be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things that are aboue, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, Col.</hi> 3. 1. wee cannot find Chriſt on earth, wee muſt looke him in heauen. Thirdly, that we might know where wee ſhall dwell and reigne when wee dye, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2. and 17. 24. Now in heauen Chriſt aſcended to his Father, as he ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 12. and 20. 17. not that hee could not finde his Father any where but in heauen, for he is euery where; but becauſe God the Father doth in a ſingular manner mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his glory and loue in the heauen of the bleſſed, and in
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14246:233"/>
that heauen doth collect his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mily and houſhold that ſhall for euer abide with him: And for this cauſe doth our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teach vs to pray, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi> not which art euery where, though that be true, that we might thereby be admoniſhed, that we doe not belong to the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this world, but vnto that ſociety that is in heauen, that is, to that family of adoption which is the houſe of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, of which family and ſociety Chriſt is the head.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the witneſſes were firſt Angels, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and that for diuers reaſons, for it was very fit to make vſe of their teſtimony, now that he was to ſhew the greateſt worke of his diuine Maieſty, ſeeing he had vſed them and their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and ſeruice at his Conception, Natiuity, Tentation, Death, and Reſurrection: and beſide, their teſtimony is vſed to appeaſe the griefe of the Diſciples, for their ſeparation from ſo meeke and louing a Lord and Maſter: And further, to reach them, that though he be abſent in body, yet would protect his by his Spirit, and by the miniſtery of his Angels.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of witneſſes were the Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. This Article containing one great part of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. it pleaſed our Sauiour to giue them firſt teachers of it, aſſurance of it by the teſtimony of their ſenſes, that with the more liberty &amp; power, they might vrge faith in their hearers, ſeeing they brought them what they had not onely heard, but ſeene and felt, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 2. If any aske, Why our Sauiour would not aſcend in the ſight of the whole Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as well as in the ſight of the Diſciples? I anſwer, they were not worthy ſo much as once to ſee the Lord in his glory, that had made no vſe of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and miracles, when he was amongſt them in his eſtate of abaſement: And beſides, here by all the world is warned to take notice of it, that the ordinary meanes to breed faith, and ſaue their ſoules, is the hearing of the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth our Sauiour of purpoſe withhold from men other waies of information.</p>
                  <p>The end of his Aſcenſion were diuers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To fulfill the Type. The high Prieſt once a yeare was to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:14246:234"/>
goe into the moſt holy place. The moſt holy place was a type of heauen, and the high Prieſt of Chriſt, and his going into the moſt holy place ſhadowed out Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion and going into heauen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. and 6. 20. and 8. 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew, that all things were fulfilled and accompliſhed by him, which were written of him, and that he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly performed all that concord, our reconciliation, and the victory ouer our enemies, and therefore his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a moſt glorious manifeſtation of his triumph, and ſpirituall and heauenly glory, after his moſt abſolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and conqueſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That hauing ouercome death, hee might now enter vpon that glory which was prepared for him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 5. for then was the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar glory of Chriſt made manifeſt, when as <hi>Homo-deus,</hi> or God-man, hee entred into heauen, which was a ſight the Angels had neuer ſeene before: whither may belong that of the Pſalme, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 7. <hi>Open ye Princes your gates that the King of glory may enter in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he might lead Captiuity captiue, and before God and Angels exerciſe a perfect triumph ouer the ſpirits in the Aire that had aſſaulted him, and whom hee had ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and now made to attend the Chariot of his triumph.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That thereby he might ſhew, that Angels and powers in heauen were alſo ſubiect to him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That in heauen he might make interceſſion for vs with the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. which was ſhadowed out in the Law. The high Prieſt went into the holy place alone, and caried vpon his ſhoulders and breſt the names of the Tribes in pretious ſtones, but the people ſtood a great way off, ſhut out in the vtter court of the Temple, making their praiers there, which were caried in by the high Prieſt ſprinkled with blood. So it is with vs, wee are here in this world a great way off, ſhut out of heauen, here we make our moane and prayers, with hearts lift vp to that heauenly Sanctuary: and there doth <hi>Ieſus</hi> cary our names on his breaſt and ſhoulders, and preſents
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:14246:234"/>
himſelfe for vs ſprinkled with his owne blood, to couer and make propitiation for our ſinnes and imperfections.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he might open heauen for vs, and make a way into the moſt holy place for vs, which ſinne had ſhut vp, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19. 20. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. 1, 2, 3. and ſo he ſaith he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he might prepare a place for vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2. 3. and 20. 20. 17. for by lifting vp our fleſh into heauen, therby as by a certaine pledge (he being our head, and wee his members) we might haue aſſurance to aſcend thither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in due time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That from thence he might ſend the holy Ghoſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as a moſt diuine token of his loue to his Spouſe the Church, and by him might fill vs with vnutterable aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and qualifie vs with diuers gifts, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That our affections might not be miſplaced on earth, or on his bodily preſence, but might be drawne vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the minding of heauenly things, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes follow, and are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For information, and ſo we ſhould ſtriue to be affected with the great glory of Chriſts triumph, in aſcending from earth to that glorious heauen in ſo glorious a manner. But perhaps ſome one will ſay, <hi>Elias</hi> aſcended vp to heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore it ſeemes this aſcenſion of our Sauiour was no ſingular thing. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was great difference betweene the Aſcenſion of <hi>Elias,</hi> and this of our Sauiour; for, firſt he aſcended by vertue of the merit of Chriſt, which had couenanted with God to make ſatisfaction, and ſo did open heauen from the beginning of the world. But Chriſt aſcended without the helpe of the merits of any other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Elias</hi> went to heauen, hauing not firſt taſted of death, but Chriſt died and was buried, and roſe againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſcenſion. Thirdly, <hi>Elias</hi> aſcended by the helpe of Angels, being not able to aſcend by his owne power, but Chriſt aſcended by his owne power. Fourthly, <hi>Elias</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen but as a Citizen of heauen, but Chriſt as Lord of heauen, hauing a name aboue euery name. Fiftly, <hi>Elias</hi> went into heauen onely for himſelfe, Chriſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:14246:235"/>
heauen for vs alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For conſolation: and ſo this Article ought to bee a fountaine of great conſolation to vs, if we conſider eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the fruit and profit comes to vs by it: which may bee partly gathered by that which hath beene declared before: for firſt wee get heauen open for vs by it: ſince the ſinne of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> heauen was ſhut againſt vs, which was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by the Angell with a flaming Sword, ſtopping the way into Paradiſe, which was a type of heauen. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhut heauen, and the ſecond opened it: opened it I ſay for vs; for Chriſt entred into heauen in our perſon, to take poſſeſſion for vs, ſo as we doe actually poſſeſſe heauen, in that our fleſh is there, and our head is there: God hath made vs to ſit in heauenly places in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. for as he left vs the earneſt of his Spirit, ſo he tooke from vs the earneſt of the fleſh, and caried it into heauen, as a pawne to aſſure that the whole ſhould be brought after him. So that his aſcenſion into heauen works our aſcenſion into heauen, and ſo a threefold aſcenſion: For firſt, heauen is opened for a ſpirituall aſcenſion of our minds, while our bodies are on earth, our hearts taking vnſpeakable comfort by faith, in our vnion with Chriſt, and ſo with God; whereas otherwiſe without Chriſt, our very thoughts are ſhut out of heauen, our hearts hauing no cauſe of comfort, but rather of ſorrow to thinke of our loſſe of Gods fauour, and ſo glorious a place. Secondly, heauen is opened for our ſoules to enter in when we dye, our ſoules being to bee caried by the Angells into heauen, that before in <hi>Adam</hi> kept vs out of heauen. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heauen is opened for both ſoule and body at the laſt day, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 14. 17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 24. Thus of the firſt benefit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother benefit comes to vs by the aſcenſion of Chriſt, and that is, the leading of our enemies captiue, for his triumph ouer them when he led captiuity captiue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to vs.</p>
                  <p>That we may vnderſtand this the better, wee muſt know that Chriſts victory ouer his enemies had fiue degrees: Firſt, it is the ordination of it, and ſo he conquered from eternity. Secondly, the prediction of it, and ſo his conqueſt was a
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:14246:235"/>
foot in all the ages of the old Teſtament, and began at the promiſe in Paradiſe after the fall, and was plainly renewed in that place of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> quoted before. Thirdly, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of it in his owne perſon, and ſo he conquered on the Croſſe, and triumphed in his Aſcenſion. Fourthly, the application of it, and ſo he conquereth, and hath in all ages conquered in his Members, making them able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sinne, and Sathan, and the World: but this is but in part, and in the beginnings of it. Fiftly, the conſummation and full accompliſhment of the victory, and ſo the Deuils, and the Graue, and Death, and Sinne, and the World, ſhall be for euer vanquiſhed at the laſt day, when Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in glory, and wee be made like vnto him, in an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting freedome from all miſery. The third benefit is the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helpe wee haue from the interceſſion of Chriſt in heauen, that perfectly remembers vs, and appeares before God for vs, to make our perſons, and praiers, and workes ſtill accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before God, as hath beene ſhewed before. The laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is the ſending of the holy Ghoſt, to be with the Church to the end of the world, in a ſpeciall manner to qualifie vs with all needfull gifts, and to be our Comforter, as hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beene ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this Article ſerues for confuration of diuers ſorts of men: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of thoſe that ſay the very body of Chriſt is preſent to the bodies of men in the Sacrament of the Supper: whereas the Article is plaine, he is in body aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> about merit of workes. They ſay Chriſt merited our Iuſtification, but wee muſt merit our place in heauen. Whereas our Sauiour ſaith, He went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to prouide and prepare a place for vs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of ſuch as ſay, they muſt giue way to an inſufficient mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, becauſe able men cannot bee had: Whereas Chriſt aſcended to giue gifts vnto men, and therefore if all lawfull meanes were vſed, able men would bee found by his bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of ſuch as thinke becauſe they were not brought vp to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:14246:236"/>
learning, or haue liued long in ignorance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowledge muſt not bee required of them, nor can they attaine to it: whereas if they had honeſt hearts, and would conſcionably vſe the meanes, they might bee led into all truth, by the Comforter which Chriſt hath ſent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of ſuch as ſay they may liue in ſome ſinnes, and they can neuer bee ſeduced in this life, which is a varne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their negligence, and wilfull indulgence ouer their corruptions, for Chriſt aſcended to lead captiuity captiue.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of all worldlings that profeſſe they are Chriſts, and yet minde nothing but earthly things, whereas if they were true Chriſtians, their hearts would haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended with Chriſt, by ſeeking thoſe things that are aboue, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>A fourth ſort of vſes are for inſtruction: and ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Article ſhould make vs willing to dye, ſeeing it is the higheſt point of our preferment to aſcend to heauen; and ſeeing to dye is but to aſcend to heauen and goe to our Father, and that Chriſt aſcended to take poſſeſſion for vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhould teach vs not to mourne immoderately for the loſſe of our deareſt friends, ſeeing they are aſcended to heauen, and wee can neuer loſe ſo much as the Diſciples did, when ſuch a Maſter and Sauiour was parted from them, and went to heauen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould ſtirre vs vp to all poſſible care of an holy and contented life: it ſhould ſeeme to vs a monſtrous baſe thing to ſerue ſinne, or the deuill, or the world, that are ſuch ſhamefull captiues: to be a ſlaue to a ſlaue is a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe baſeneſſe: and yet this is the condition of the moſt, and which makes it more wofull, man likes it, and deſires to continue ſo ſtill.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt. The third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his exaltation is, his Seſſion at the right hand of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt words of this Article are ambiguous, becauſe they are not taken in their proper ſenſe: for properly, God hath no right hand, as being a Spirit, and Chriſt may not be thought to vſe no other geſture in heauen but ſitting, and therefore we muſt enquire of the Scripture for the ſenſe, as it is figuratiue; and ſo firſt what ſitting may ſignifie; then what the right hand of God ſignifies: and then what it is to ſit at the right hand of God.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: Sitting, in a figuratiue ſenſe in Scripture is vſed two waies; Firſt, to note habitation, abiding, or reſting: as when the Apoſtles were willed to ſit in that City till they were endued with power from on high, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 49 Secondly, to note Soueraignty and Iudiciarie power, and when <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſaid to ſit vpon the Throne of his Father, 1 <hi>King</hi> 1. 30. ſo <hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 5.</p>
                  <p>The right hand of God, when it is ſpoken of about earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, notes his power and helpe: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 3. and when it is ſpoken of as in heauen, it notes ſupreme glory, and Maieſtie, and authority. Now to be at the right hand, when it is ſpoken of men, it ſignifies to helpe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 5. Sometimes God is ſaid to be at mans right hand, and then it notes protection and helpe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. Sometimes the Church is ſaid to be at the right hand of Chriſt, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10. Sometimes Chriſt is ſaid to be at the right hand of God, of which this Article makes mention. But by the way we muſt note, that this geſture is not attributed to Chriſt, as a perpetuall geſture. Sometimes hee is ſaid to bee at the right hand of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. Sometimes to ſtand at the right hand of God, as <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55. But vſually the Scripture mentions his ſitting at the right hand of God, as that geſture which doth moſt fitly ſhadow out the eternall reſt and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, together with his Imperiall and Iudiciall power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:14246:237"/>
Now for the ſenſe of the Article all together, I conceiue, that by the words of this Article, eight things are meant, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt, after all his labours and ſorrowes, after his Croſſe and death, doth reſt in heauen in vnſpeakable ioy, and felicity, and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That hee hath obtained dignity, and power, aboue all men and Angels, as when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſet his mother at his right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it was to ſignifie, that ſhe was to be eſteemed of aboue all his ſubiects. Thus Chriſt hath a name giuen him aboue euery name which is named in heauen and earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That hee is partner with his Father in his Kingdome: and therefore hence it is, that in ſtead of, <hi>He ſhall ſit at Gods right hand,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> quoting the place, ſaith, <hi>Hee ſhall reigne:</hi> teaching vs, that, to ſit at Gods right hand, is to reigne in Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That his authority reacheth vnto all things in heauen and earth, and therefore hee is ſaid to ſit at the right hand of God; of God, I ſay, whoſe dominion is an vniuerſall dominion: This our Sauiour ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Father doth not ceaſe to rule, but doth admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his Kingdome by his Sonne. Therefore in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>v.</hi> 1. the Father takes vpon him to ſubdue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt. The Father and Sonne reigne together, but yet ſo, as the Father commits the rule and execution of all things to the Sonne vnder him, as kings that admit their Sonnes to bee partners with them in their Empire, and commit the truſt of all to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That this kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be deliuered vp vnto the Father againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. For the worke of Chriſt in this Kingdome, is by meanes to gather and ſaue the Church, and to ſubdue and ouerthrow the enemies of the Church; now when there ſhall be no more enemies, and the Church is perfectly gathered, and glorified, then this Kingdome ſhall ceaſe. But that men may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, the naturall kingdome of Chriſt, which hee hath as
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:14246:237"/>
God equall with the Father, that ſhall neuer ceaſe; and the ſupreme glory that hee hath in eminence ouer man and Angels, that ſhall not ceaſe; for ſo he is a King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and of this kingdome there is no end: but after the day of iudgment he ſhall reigne no more; that is, Firſt, not in the middeſt of his enemies as he doth now, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2. Secondly, not by meanes, or by the Word and Sacraments, as he doth now, but immediatly.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he vndertakes fully to accompliſh and perform vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Elect, all that goodneſſe and riches of grace and glory, which God as a Father hath decreed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his Church; and therefore hee ſits at the right hand of God as a Father.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That he is furniſhed with all power to execute all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, either the ſubduing of the enemies of the Church, or the ſaluation of the Elect; and therefore he is ſaid in the Creed, to ſit at the right hand of God, as hee is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and in Scripture, to ſit at the right hand of the power of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 69.</p>
                  <p>There are other things might be mentioned about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Article, but they are either curious, or elſe ſo difficult and perplexed, and intricate in ſenſe, that they will not well agree with popular teaching, and therefore I leaue them and come to the vſe of this Article.</p>
                  <p>This Article may ſerue both for inſtruction and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. For inſtruction, and ſo it ſhould teach vs;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Neuer to be aſhamed of the Goſpell, and the profeſſion of the ſeruice of Chriſt in this world, ſeeing whatſoeuer worldly men thinke, yet true Chriſtians know, that they ſerue him that ſits at Gods right hand, and hath all power in heauen and earth, and is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To bee willing to let him rule ouer vs, and with all reuerence and conſcience to ſubmit our ſelues to his lawes, and to acknowledge his power and ſoueraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Euery knee ſhould bow at the name of Ieſus, Phil.</hi> 2. 11. 10.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. In all things to liue by Faith, and in nothing to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and in all eſtates to bee content, ſince by Chriſt wee may be able to doe all things: and he is able to helpe vs, and will not forſake vs.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. In the caſe of feare of perſeuerance: for Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, and therefore none can take his ſheepe out of his hand, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 29.</p>

There is great need of teaching and explicating of this Article, both becauſe it is a thing ſo much vrged in ſo many places both of the old and new Teſtament, and becauſe it was made one of the moſt fundamentall principles of the Apoſtles Catechiſme, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 42. and eſpecially becauſe it is a doctrine of all others moſt effectuall to awaken the carnall &amp; ſecure hearts of men, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 26. and if it may be to bring them to repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. and the more proper for vs vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ends of the world are come, not only becauſe it is now at hand, but becauſe men are in ſo high a degree forgetful of it, yea becauſe there are ſo many ſcoffers againſt it, according as <hi>S.

                  <p>For the firſt, what kinde of Iudgement this ſhall be, may appeare by the properties of it: and the properties are ſeuen.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is certaine: It is ſuch a Iudgement as will certainly come vpon men. There muſt needs be a Iudgement in the end of the world; Firſt, becauſe ſo many Scriptures haue foretold it, it hath beene proclaimed and men warned and ſummoned from the beginning of the world. <hi>Henoch</hi> gaue notice of it, <hi>Iude</hi> 15. ſo did <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32. and <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 50. and <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9 and <hi>Daniel, ch.</hi> 7. 13. and <hi>Ioel, ch.</hi> 3. and <hi>Malachi, ch.</hi> 4. ſo did Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Iohn, Reu.</hi> 20. and <hi>Iude, v.</hi> 6. here is a cloud of witneſſes. Secondly, becauſe we ſee that in this world full Iudgement is not executed, and therefore it ſtands vp o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods iuſtice that there ſhould be a generall Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for in this world many times godly men be in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as <hi>Lazarus;</hi> &amp; wicked men be in great proſperity, as <hi>Diues.</hi> Now if God be iuſt, he wil render to euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:14246:240"/>
to his works, which becauſe it is not done in this world, it remains that we are yet to expect ſuch a iudgement as will giue euery man his due: If iudgement begin at Gods houſe in this world, then certainly will God finde a time to auenge himſelfe on Satans family. Thirdly, there muſt needs be a iudgement in the end of the world for the declaration of Gods iuſtice, which is now in many things hid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. Many things we ſee not the reaſon of, and many things are hid in darkneſſe, which then ſhall be brought to light: Mens hearts now boile againſt many things they heare in Gods word, or obſerue in Gods workes, now the Lord will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in iudgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. And therefore he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a time, wherein he will cleare himſelfe before all men and Angels. Fourthly, Gods workes of iudgement done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhew, that he conceiues ſuch an infinite wrath againſt ſin, as he muſt needs finde a time to be reuenged on the ſins of all men. Such as are the drowning of the old world, the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of mankind with a world of diſeaſes and miſeries, the ſweeping away of many thouſands together by Peſtilence or ſword, the irreuocable ſentence of death vpon all men, ſhews that God will take an account of mens waies, and will not put vp the tranſgreſſions of his Lawes. Beſides, euery mans conſcience naturally feares a ſupreme Iudge; and therefore ſince there ſhall be a iudgement, men ſhould liue ſo, as to prouide, that it may goe well with them in that day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is immediate, God himſelfe ſhall iudge. There is a iudgement in this world, which is called Gods iudgement, but that is a mediate iudgement, when God iudgeth by man, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the laſt iudgement: men haue receiued their doomes, ſometimes from men, ſometimes from God, either iudging them by his word, or afflicting them by his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iudgements: but theſe are all the firſt things, but this is the laſt iudgement, after which there ſhall be no more triall, or ſentence, or execution; and therefore the more terrible for wicked men becauſe there can be no reuerſing of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as in this life vpon repentance there may be of other
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:14246:241"/>
iudgements, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 7, 8, 9, 10. And for this ſentence there will be no appeale.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a generall and vniuerſall iudgement, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. all muſt appeare both quicke and dead, as will be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſhewed afterwards. God hath his particular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon man in this world, both in life, iudging both the righteous and the wicked euery day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 12. and in death, when he paſſeth a particular ſentence vpon euery man: but this is iudgement of all men together.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is an open and manifeſt iudgement, where all things ſhal be brought to light, euen the ſecret and hidden things of all men, euen the hidden things of darkneſſe. God hath his ſecret iudgements vpon wicked men in this world, when he conſumes them like a moth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 51. 8. and plagues them in their ſoules or bodies, or ſtates, in the things the world ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues not. But at this day of iudgement all ſhall be done and opened before all men and Angels. Which ſerues for excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding terrour to impenitent ſinners. Is it ſuch a ſhame to doe penance before one particular congregation for one fault, when the puniſhment is inflicted for their amendment, and it may be men will pray for them &amp; forgiue them? What wil the horror be then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they muſt be ſhamed before all men and Angels for all their ſins, and this iudgement muſt be for their confuſion, and no eye ſhall pity them. And ſo it ſerues for the ſingular comfort of the godly: if it be a comfort to be praiſed, and cleared of aſperſions before a great aſſembly on earth, as ſay it were at the meeting of Parliament, and done by the mouth of a King, with the applauſe of all the hearers: What ſhall their euerlaſting comfort be, when at that day by the voice of Chriſt himſelfe, they ſhall be praiſed for all the good they haue done, and cleared from all aſperſions, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſuſpitions and wrong iudgements on earth, before all the world of men and Angels?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It will bee a ſudden iudgement: Chriſt will come vpon the world like a theefe in the night, that doth not vſe to knocke at the doore and giue men warning: He will come as the ſnare doth vpon the bird, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 35. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Which ſerues to ſhew the wofull eſtate
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:14246:241"/>
of wicked men that liue in ſecuritie, for while they ſay, Peace, peace, ſudden deſtruction comes vpon them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by particular or generall iudgement, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3. and it ſhould ſerue to warne wicked men, to take heed of thoſe ſins which doe eſpecially harden the hearts of men, and breed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and indiſpoſition in them. Our Sauiour himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and cares of life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. and it ſhould teach all men to watch and daily to pray to God for mercy and grace that they may be alwayes ready, as our Sauiour vrgeth in the ſame place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It will be a righteous Iudgement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Reu.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 9. for God will iudge according to his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is infinitely perfect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 9. and it will be true iudgement without error or miſtaking, either by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the law, or the ſentence, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 15. 5. and 19. 11. He will not reſpect any mens perſons, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. nor will he iudge according to the outward appearance and colours of things, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 3. and it muſt be righteous, becauſe it ſhall be according to mens wayes and workes, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. and hee cannot be corrupted with bribes, for riches will not auaile in the day of wrath, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. Nor will he regard the falſe teſtimonie of the world, either for the wicked, or againſt the godly: for though it be true, that Chriſt ſaith, As I heare I iudge, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 30. yet that is meant of what he heares from his Father, and his booke of preſcience and remembrance, and not of what hee heares from the world: and no multitude nor power can be able to daunt this Iudge, for he is a Lord of hoaſts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11. 20. and will iudge by his ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54. 1. and therefore woe to the Hypocrite that makes a ſhift to ſcape the iudgement of man by his deceitfull colours; and woe to the mightie men, that now breake the net and ſcape, and no man dares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll them: and woe to all thoſe fooliſh men, that beleeue not Gods iuſtice, becauſe they like it not, or ſeemes to be againſt their reaſon; at that day God will ouercome, euen in the things he is now iudged <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. and woe to all them that haue pronounced wrong iudgement on earth, their ſentence ſhall not ſtand, but themſelues ſhall
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:14246:242"/>
come to iudgement for their ill iudgement on earth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 17. and in generall, if God will iudge in righteouſneſſe, then no wicked man ſhall euer be able to ſtand in iudgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It will be an eternall iudgement, for ſo it is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. not becauſe the Iudge ſhall ſit for euer in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of cauſes and ſentencing of men, but becauſe the effect of this iudgement ſhall be for euer: Looke what happineſſe is by ſentence of the Iudge appointed for the godly, that ſhal laſt for euer; and ſo what miſerie the wicked are adiudged to, ſhall laſt for euer. Which ſhould ſerue greatly for reproofe of the careleſneſſe of moſt men, that ſo thinke of a preſent eſtate in this little ſpace of time on earth, that they forget to take order for eternitie: and moſt wofull is the caſe of the wicked, that ſo eſteeme the pleaſures of ſinne here which are but for a ſeaſon, that they care not to plunge themſelues into eſtate of torment which ſhall neuer haue end.</p>
                  <div type="objection_and_solution">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can this be iuſt, that they ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for euer, that haue ſinned but a little time?</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Diuers things may be anſwered to this: 1. That no Iudge limiteth his torments to the time of the doing of the fact or crime: he meaſures his puniſhment by the greatneſſe of the offence, not by the length of time. As in the caſe of treaſon, murder, whoredome, &amp;c. which may be done in an inſtant or ſhort time, and yet the puniſhment be for a long time: as men puniſh by death, which is a remouing of the malefactor from the ſocietie of men for euer; and ſhall not God haue the like allowance for his proceedings? Secondly, we muſt conſider of the greatnes of ſin by the perſon againſt whom it is committed; men ſinne againſt God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and therefore muſt ſuffer puniſhment that is infinite in continuance. Thirdly, if two men bargain together, one ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, another buyeth, the buyer will haue his bargaine for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, though the contract be made in a quarter of an houre: now, ſinning is a ſelling of mens ſoules and bodies to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for a ſhort pleaſure, and therefore why ſhould it not be iuſt that the deuill ſhould haue them for euer?</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:14246:242"/>
The ſecond queſtion is, who ſhall be the Iudge? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is to that, that Chriſt ſhall be Iudge, euen the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is Mediator, and of whom all the former Articles of the <hi>Creed</hi> affirmed, which is apparent by theſe and other Scriptures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 42. and 17. 31. Not that the Father and Holy Ghoſt is remoued from this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the authoritie of iudging belongs to the whole Trinitie, but becauſe the Sonne ſhall appeare in the Humane Nature, and ſpeake and pronounce ſentence: but when he ſpeaks, God ſpeaks, and when he iudges God ſhall iudge, not only becauſe he is God, but becauſe the Father ſhall ſpeake and iudge by him: ſo that the Iudgement belongs to him in reſpect of the viſible proceeding in Iudgement, and the promulgation, and the execution of the ſentence, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. 13. and the like may bee ſaid of his iudging as Man, not that he is not Iudge in his Diuine Nature, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which ſhall be ſeene and heard in the Iudgement ſhall proceed from his Humane Nature. And whereas the Saints and Apoſtles are ſaid to iudge the world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. it muſt be vnderſtood thus: That they iudge as members vnto that head who is Iudge. Secondly, as the Iudgement ſhall be performed before Chriſt, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Elect, <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 2. Thirdly, as they ſhall be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, and giue conſent to the Iudgement, being aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the honour to ſit as Iuſtices of the Peace on the Bench by the Iudge. Fourthly, the Apoſtles ſhall iudge, becauſe their doctrine which they haue preached ſhall be confirmed and auouched by the ſentence of the Iudge. So the word that men heare now ſhall iudge them at the laſt day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. Fifthly, the godly ſhall iudge the wicked, becauſe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their faith and repentance ſhall be alledged as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the condemnation of the wicked. Thus the Queene of the South, and the <hi>Niniuites</hi> ſhall riſe vp in Iudgement and condemne that generation Chriſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 31. So that the point is cleare, that Chriſt ſhall be Iudge. The Vſe is firſt for great comfort to the godly to free them from the terror of that day, they need not bee afraid of the Iudge, nor any hard ſentence he will pronounce
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:14246:243"/>
vpon them, ſeeing the Iudge is their owne brother, yea their owne fleſh as their head, it was he that was iudged for them on earth, and redeemed them with his owne bloud, he that hath continually made interceſſion for them in heauen, that they might be deliuered from the wrath of God. Yea he hath promiſed them that they ſhall ſpeed well in that day, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 36. and 5. 24. Secondly, it is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible doctrine for all wicked men; becauſe this is a Iudge that cannot be corrupted, but will iudge in righteouſneſſe, as there is none higher than he to make appeale to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, one that knowes the heart; and finally, becauſe it is he whom they haue reiected and would not let him rule ouer them, but haue many waies vilified him, and rebelled againſt him and his ordinances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him in his members, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>The third queſtion is, whence Chriſt ſhall come, when he comes to Iudgement? And that is briefly expreſt in the words of the Article. He ſhall come from thence, that is, from Heauen, where he ſits at the right hand of God. The reaſon why he comes out of Heauen to execute Iudgement, is becauſe Heauen is ſo pure a place, as it is not fit for impure men and deuils ſo much as to make their appearance there. And this point is not without Vſe: For firſt hereby we may clearly bee confirmed in the truth of Chriſts humanitie, againſt the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries,</hi> that ſay his bodie is euery where, ſeeing he comes in his bodie out of Heauen at the laſt day. And beſides, it may teach vs to ſend our hearts to Heauen to meet Chriſt, and till he come from thence to looke for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                     <p>The fourth queſtion is about the time when the day of Iudgement ſhall be? Now about the anſwer to this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there haue beene many opinions, and the moſt of them ſtrange and falſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some haue thought it ſhould neuer be: and ſuch were thoſe mockers mentioned 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. whoſe argument to proue their damned opinion was twofold. Firſt, that the firſt Fathers in the firſt ages of the world were dead many ages ſince, and if there ſhould haue beene a Iudgement, it
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:14246:243"/>
is likely it would haue beene before this time. Secondly, that all men ſee by experience that all things continued without alteration ſince the Creation, and therefore why ſhould men feare any alteration for the time to come? To all this the Apoſtle anſwers, firſt concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of theſe mockers, that they are men that follow their luſts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. or that they are willingly ignorant, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and then concerning their reaſons he ſaith againſt them three things; The one, that this world was made at the beginning by God, both the vpper and nether world: and therefore it may haue an end, <hi>v.</hi> 5. The other, that it is falſe that there haue been no alterations, for the whole nether world was drowned by water, which may aſſure men that God hates ſinne, and will generally iudge men for it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. The third is, that the continuance of the world for ſo many ages ought to bee no argument to proue that it is vnalterable: for a thouſand yeares with God are but as one day: it is a ſmall time that the world hath laſted in compariſon of Gods eternitie: and beſides, God hath vrgent reaſon for his ſo long patience in defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt iudgement, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some others in the Apoſtles time taught that the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo by conſequent the day of Iudgement was paſt already: of this minde was <hi>Himenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. It is probable, that they held there was no other reſurrection than that which is of the ſoule ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally riſing out of ſinne, nor any other Iudgement than that which men paſſe through in repentance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third ſort of men that did hold a true reſurrection of the bodie, and a generall Iudgement of all the world, did affirme before the Apoſtles were yet dead, that the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would come vpon the world within a ſhort time after, euen in the age of them that then liued, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. Now theſe falſe teachers are both deſcribed and confuted by the Apoſtle: deſcribed both by the effect of their corrupt doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that it would draw men away from their minds both for the preſent, by making them leſſe carefull of their callings, and for the time to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:14246:244"/>
come, when they ſhould ſee that that day did not come as was foretold, they might then grow either impatient vnder their croſſe, or elſe to fall away from religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing nothing, becauſe that they haue beleeued in this point did not come to paſſe: and deſcribed they were, by the manner of confirming their doctrine: For they pretended firſt the Spirit, that they had reuelations from the Spirit within. Secondly, the word, that is either ſome ſpeciall arguments of their owne, or ſome words which the Apoſtles had vttered. Thirdly, Epiſtles, either wreſting the words of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, as that 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 7. or elſe counterfeiting Epiſtles, and ſaying they were written by the Apoſtles. The Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them by ſhewing that the kingdome of Antichriſt muſt come before the day of Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſort of men are ſuch as aſſigne the time of the comming of Chriſt to be further off from the age of the Apoſtles, and offend in extreme curioſitie, in aſſigning the yeare or age when it ſhould be, and ſo mens wits haue beene ill imployed in all ages. Saint <hi>Auguſtiae</hi> tells that in his time diuers computations were made of the end of the world, and Chriſts comming. Some ſaid it would be 400. yeares after his Aſcenſion, ſome 500. yeares, ſome 1000. yeares: in our age ſince the Goſpell was reſtored, many men haue laboured mightily to aſſigne either the yeare, or at leaſt the age when theſe things ſhould be. As thoſe that aſſigned the yeare 1587. which experience hath proued falſe. It had beene much to haue beene wiſhed that diuers Writers vpon the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which are held in good fame in the Church, had forborne that curioſitie of computation, in reckoning ſo ſtrictly by yeares, for it doth much hurt in the mindes of weake Chriſtians, when either experience or reaſon beats them from thoſe grounds, which they haue ſucked in from ſuch writings. There is a tradition that ſticks in the minds of many, pretended to come from one <hi>Elias</hi> (not <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Thiſbite)</hi> that the world ſhould laſt 6000. yeares: 2000. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, 2000. vnder the Law, and 2000. after the Law, and then the end ſhall be, only for the elects fake thoſe
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:14246:244"/>
dayes ſhould be ſhortned. Now this is a manifeſt dotage: for it was more than 2000. yeares before the Law, and leſſe than 2000. yeares vnder the Law, as the Learned know. How then ſhall we beleeue this tradition to be true for the time to come, that is proued falſe for the time paſt? And as for the ſhortning of the time for the elect, that is ſpoken by our Sauiour about the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not about the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>To let goe then all theſe falſe opinions, the iudgement of ſuch as ſpeake according to the Scriptures containes three aſſertions:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath preciſely ſet and appointed the time and day when he will iudge the world by Chriſt: this appeares by Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. and God will haue this knowne, both for the conſolation of his ſeruants, that they may haue hope in their afflictions, and to leaue the wicked without excuſe, that being warned will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to driue out of the godly ſecuritie, that ſo they may keepe themſelues in the good way, and walke in the feare of God, watching and prouiding for that day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this Iudgement day ſhall be in the end of the world, and not before: &amp; therefore it is ſaid in Scripture, it ſhall be at the laſt day. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doth God put off the generall Iudgment ſo long, &amp; not call men to an account til after ſome thouſands of yeares after ſome of them died? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, God hath vnſearchable reſpects of his owne glory, in diſpatching by his prouidence the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that concerns the riſing or alteration of things in the ſtate of mankinde: As in diſpoſing of the Monarchies of the world, the kingdome of Antichriſt raiſed, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the reiection and recalling of the Iewes, and ſuch like, which will not be effected till the day which he hath appointed for the comming of Chriſt. Secondly, it is put off ſo long, that the elect may be all gathered, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods pleaſure to gather them by ordinarie meanes, ſo as the Iuſt haue a time to be borne, liue, heare the word, fulfill their meaſure of worke, &amp;c. Thirdly, it is put off for the more effectuall triall of the faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:14246:245"/>
of Gods elect, and exerciſe of their hope and prayer. Fourthly, that he might by the confeſſion of all men be iuſtified in this that he hath allowed vnto the world ſpace and time enough to repent in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. and 9. 22. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. and therefore if wicked men doe not repent, they may be left without excuſe, and the rather ſeeing he can no way be charged to proceed in iudgement againſt them raſhly, or with more reſpect of his owne Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſeeing before he paſſeth the finall ſentence he ſtaies ſo exceeding long. Fifthly, as he glorifies his mercy in ſauing the elect, and his iuſtice in damning the wicked: ſo doth he by his exceeding long ſtay glorifie his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and clemencie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the preciſe day, moneth or yeare, when this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be, is knowne to no man or Angell, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Quest.</hi> But ſeeing God will haue vs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that there is a time for Iudgement, why will he haue vs vncertaine when it ſhall be? <hi>Anſw.</hi> That thereby he may teach vs at all times to watch and ſtriue to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: He will not let vs know what day it ſhall be, that we may be euery day prepared. And beſides, he thereby the better exerciſeth our faith and patience, and making vs lay hold on his promiſes without limiting him to times and ſeaſons. And therefore we ſhould make this vſe of it, and reſtraine our curiofitie, and neuer ſearch or inquire after that, which God will not haue vs to know, but looke to our taske, for it is our dutie to thinke it neere at hand, and therefore to get oyle into our lamps to be ready when the Bridegroome ſhall come, and to ſtand alwaies vpon our watch, like the wiſe Maſter of the houſe, that keeps all things carefully, becauſe he knowes not when the theefe may aſſault his houſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. 32, to the end. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 42, 43. and 25. 3, 4. If Chriſtians were taught to ſay, it was the laſt time when <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote to them, how much more cauſe haue wee to thinke wee liue in the laſt time, vpon whom the ends of the world are more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently come? Another queſtion is moued about thoſe words, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. 32. How it was true that the Sonne
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:14246:245"/>
of Man himſelfe did not know the day and houre of his owne laſt comming? Diuers anſwers haue beene giuen to this queſtion. As firſt, hee did not know it, that is, hee did not know it ſo as to make vs know it: or it was no part of that knowledge which as the Prophet of the Church he was bound to make knowne to vs: as in that ſpeech, <hi>The Lord your God proues you, that hee may know,</hi> that is, that hee may make you know, &amp;c. and when wee ſay, <hi>O Lord ariſe,</hi> we meane, make vs ariſe; and ſuch like phraſes are vſed in Scripture: or their anſwer is, that as our Sauiour aſſumed diuers infirmities of ours, yet without ſinne, ſo did hee aſſume ignorance; Ignorance I ſay of ſome things, that were not neceſſarie for him as man to know, which belongs onely to the eſtate of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for now hee is glorified, and hath laid downe all infirmities, he now in heauen as man knowes both the day and houre. Thirdly, it may be anſwered, that as Man he could not know it, without reuelation from his Diuinitie: and therefore if the Sonne of Man did then know it, it was not a knowledge that belonged to his Humane Nature in it ſelfe, but he had that knowledge giuen him from his Diuine Nature.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the time.</p>
                     <p>For the place where the Iudgement ſhall be, we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in particular certaine of the Scriptures: Some men haue thought that it ſhould be held in the valley of <hi>Iehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> which was a place neere to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they alledge the words of the Prophet <hi>Ioel, Chap.</hi> 3. 2. But this opinion is raſh and preſumptuous: becauſe that place ſeemes to ſpeake in particular of ſuch Nations as affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the valley of <hi>Ichoſhaphat</hi> ſeems to be named but by way of alluſion: yet notwithſtanding, that the Iudge ſhould ſit in iudgement in ſome place about <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is not altogether improbable, becauſe it increaſeth the terror of the iudgement, &amp; augments thoglory of Chriſt, to ſit there as a Iudge, where himſelfe was iudged. But in this no man can conclude peremptorily to make a reſolute opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:14246:246"/>
of it, becauſe we haue not ſufficient warrant for it out of the Word. In the generall it is cleare by Scripture, that it ſhall be in ſome part of this nether world, either on the earth or neere vnto it; becauſe, as was ſhewed before, no vncleane things, ſuch as deuils and wicked men, may enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and beſides, it increaſeth the terror and iuſtice of the Iudgement, to keepe the Aſſiſes where men haue offended, and to ſentence them to puniſhment in the place where they haue done their offences: as for great crimes, Iudges are wont to appoint the place of puniſhment to be where the fact was committed. It is very probable, that the Iudge will ſit in the clouds of the Aire neare the earth, whither the Elect ſhall be caught vp to meet the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17. that ſo the deuils may be conquered &amp; ſentenced in the very place where they haue all this while ruled as princes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. I ſay only it is probable, becauſe it cannot be neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the places are alledged, <hi>viz. Matth.</hi> 24. 30. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt queſtion is, who ſhall be iudged? And to this I anſwer out of Scripture by beginning at the remoteſt things, and comming nearer and nearer till it reach to each of vs: and ſo I ſay,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Iudgement ſhall reach euen to the vnreaſonable creatures: for the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the heauens and the earth, and the things in them, are reſerued vnto fire against the day of Iudgement, and the perdition of wicked men,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. And it is likely the Apoſtle hath this meaning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. to 23. And ſo partly God will be reuenged on the old heauens and earth for the vanitie caſt vpon them by wicked men, and as they were the dwelling place of the wicked: and partly, as God in iuſtice will reſtore to euery creature, in the ſort of the creature, whatſoeuer they loſt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his poſteritie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Euill ſpirits ſhall then be iudged, euen the Deuill and all his Angels, which are now bound in the chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe till the iudgement of that day, <hi>Iude</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. There ſhall be opened that great ſecret of the nature, and manner, and time of their firſt ſinning againſt God, and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:14246:246"/>
all the horrible murthers they haue committed and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted vpon the ſoules of all ſorts of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

To this I anſwer, that the beleeuer ſhall not come into iudgement, that is, into the iudgement of condemnation; he ſhall come to receiue iudgement of eternall abſolution from all his ſinnes and miſeries. And the wicked are condemned already: Firſt, in the counſell of God, as hee appointed them to condemnation for their ſinnes. Secondly, in the word of God, which tells him plainly of his eſtate and eternall miſery, becauſe he doth not repent and beleeue. Thirdly, in his owne conſcience, which is as a thouſand witneſſes, and doth iudge him in himſelfe as a forerunner of the laſt iudgement: all this hinders not, but that he muſt appeare openly at the barre of Chriſt, to haue his ſinnes publikely knowne, and ſentence paſt vpon him for all his ſins: ſo that it remaines cleare, that all men ſince the beginning of the world muſt come to iudgement. Yet that it may worke the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually vpon mens conſcience, it will be profitable to take notice of ſuch particular offenders, as God hath in plaine termes telled them before-hand, that he will iudge them at that day: and ſo he will iudge</p>

There is no neceſſity to vnderſtand it ſo, that euery particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world ſhould haue the Goſpell preached to them; or if it were, it muſt not be meant of any one time, but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely at one time or other.

                     <p>The ſignes which do properly prognoſticate and giue warning to the world of the comming of Chriſt, are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture, as they ſerue ſucceſſiuely one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to giue warning in euery age of the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſignes began to diſcouer themſelues in the very age of the Apoſtles, and ſo downwards, and will ſo be ordered, as euery age yet to come ſhall haue their ſpeciall warnings to prouide for that day: and ſo I take the proper ſignes to be in number eight.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the ſignes of certaine <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> that is, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall falſe and hereticall teachers, profeſſing the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which ſhould teach doctrine that depriued the ſoules of men, of the benefit of redemption by Chriſt: and theſe <hi>Antichriſts</hi> were but fore-runners of the great <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> This Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> makes a ſigne, and this ſigne was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or began to be ſo, while yet S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was aliue, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſigne is giuen by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 4. and that is a generall Apoſtaſie of men in the viſible Church, from the ſoundneſſe of religion: and this was accompliſhed vnder <hi>Arrius,</hi> and the many ages of the Papacy.</p>
                     <p>The third ſigne is the reuealing and diſcouering of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> and the making of it knowne who was that great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. and this was done by Gods two witneſſes, that is, by a few choiſe Inſtruments that God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp in the very times of this Apoſtaſie, to preach and teach, that the Pope was <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and this was done in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ages of that Apoſtaſie.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſigne is the preaching againe of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Goſpel, and the publike profeſſion of reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. 7. and 15. 1, 2, 3. and this began in the age next before vs that now liue, in the miniſtery of <hi>Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> and diuers other.</p>

This (in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of it) is yet to come, and will bee accompliſhed at a time appointed, in the day that is called, The day of the great Battell of the Lord God Almighty; when by the ſword of Princes hee ſhall deſtroy that City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath beene the very Throne of the Beaſt, and of the Whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 14. 16. and 17. 17.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt ſigne, is a fearfull corruption of manners in the men of the world, foretold, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. This I reckon as a ſigne, becauſe I ſee all ſorts of Writers haue a great minde to it: but I take it to be ſo, not becauſe the ſinnes there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſhall be then found in the world, for they haue been alwaies in the world, but in a threefold reſpect: Firſt, becauſe all thoſe ſorts of ſinne ſhall reigne at once in the world. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe men ſhall grow in a high degree abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in ſinning, ſo as to ouer-paſſe the formet times in the vnheard exceſſe in ſinning. Thirdly, becauſe the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of manners ſhall bee found in all eſtates and degrees of men, and this ſigne I thinke belongs to this age: I ſuppoſe there was neuer any age wherein men were growne gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo monſtrous, drunkenneſſe, whordome, ſwearing, falſhood, and deceit, beſides the ſinnes mentioned in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles catalogue: and theſe things do ſo prouoke the Iudge, and dare him to his face, that ſure his comming cannot be long deferred, but he will haſten the reſt of the ſignes, to be reuenged of ſo wicked a world.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth ſigne is yet to come, and that is the calling of the Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which, that it ſhall be, is plaine by the Prophecy of <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. but how this ſhall bee performed, and when, I ſuppoſe it cannot be determined by Scripture.</p>

The ſecond ſigne is, the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and lamentation of all Nations, when they behold Chriſt comming in the clouds of heauen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 30. Some Diuines make the firing of the World to be a ſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Chriſts comming forth to iudgment: but that cannot be ſo, becauſe it is not probable, that deuils and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſhall be in the new earth, or the new heauens, for there muſt dwell nothing but righteouſneſſe; and therefore this firing of the world, is to bee reckoned as a conſequent of the Iudgment.</p>

                        </gap>ſtament, that from the beginning of the world cited men to appeare before the iudgment Seat of God; <hi>Henoch</hi> began before the Flood, <hi>Iude</hi> 15. and others followed in euery age, as hath beene ſhewed before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the miniſtery of Chriſt himſelfe, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:14246:251"/>
and the ordinary miniſtery of the Preachers of the Goſpell, in all the ages vnder the Goſpell, till the end of the World. Now the laſt ſummons is this, which ſhall be giuen at that inſtant when Chriſt is come in the clouds of heauen, and ſet in his Throne, and this ſhall bee performed by a ſhout from heauen, and by the ſound of the laſt Trumpet: This cry or ſummons is called, The voice of Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 28. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. and yet it ſeeme sit ſhall be performed by the miniſtery of Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. Hee that imployes the miniſtery of men to call the World to repentance in this life, will vſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Angels to bring thoſe men to iudgment, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as haue not repented of their euill waies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Reſurtection of the dead, vnder which I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the change of the liuing: for vpon this voice all dead men ſhall receiue their ſoules into their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; be quickned, and riſe out of the Graues, or other places of the earth, or waters wherin they haue lyen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13. and thoſe that ſhall bee then aliue ſhall bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpe: and this change ſhall bee in ſtead of death, and a kind of reſurrection: they ſhall bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not in the ſubſtance, but in the qualities of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, corruption putting on incorruption, and mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty putting on immortality, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The collection of all the world of men, and euill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: for the Angels of Chriſt ſhall gather together into one place from all the foure winds of heauen, euen from all the parts of the world, all them that were raiſed or changed, euen all both elect and reprobate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. and 25. 32.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſeparation of the good from the bad, which ſhall be performed by Chriſt himſelfe, which knowes the hearts of all men before the tryall, euen then when they are brought in by the Angels, and before hee proceed to the tryall of all mens cauſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 32. Where by the way diuers things may be noted: as firſt, that wicked men to their terrour ſhal then haue that done by Chriſt, which
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:14246:252"/>
now in their malice and iolity they ſo much ſtriue to doe themſelues. Now they ſhunne the godly, and thinke the Townes the worſe to liue in where they are ſetled, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be any number of them: at that day as their grieuous puniſhment they ſhal haue the godly taken from them, neuer more to liue amongſt them. Secondly, wee gather hence, that there ſhall neuer be a perfect ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no not in the beſt Churches on earth, of the good from the bad; onely at the day of Iudgement it ſhall bee perfectly made: This is ſhewed by the Parables of the Tares and good corne, and of the Draw-net that catcheth both bad and good fiſh. Thirdly, note the titles giuen to both ſorts of people; Chriſt calls the good Sheepe, and the bad Goats, to giue men before hand an intimation of their eſtates, if they will try themſelues, by theſe ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes they may know now how it ſhall goe with them then. Goats are knowne to be creatures, that though they be turned into the ſame paſture with ſheepe, yet will not be kept within any bounds, but are vnruly; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides are creatures of very ill ſmell: theſe reſemble all ſuch vngodly men, as liuing within the compaſſe of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and enioying the meanes of ſaluation with the godly proue vnruly and rebellious, and will not bee kept within the compaſſe of the rules and directions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the word of God, nor follow the example of the godly, but in many things againſt their knowledge ſinne wilfully and preſumptuouſly: and they alſo ſhadow out that prophanneſſe, by which vngodly men diſcouer themſelues by their words and deeds in euery place they come in, ſo as they leaue an ill ſent behinde them, the very place is the worſe for them. Now Sheepe reſemble true Chriſtians: and ſo true Chriſtians are like ſheepe in foure things; Firſt, in teachablenes: Chriſts ſheepe heare his voice and follow him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. A ſudden whiſtle ſtartles ſheepe, ſo as they come in, and are driuen whither the Shepherd will, whereas Goats and Swine will not bee driuen without much toile and labour. Secondly, in ſociableneſſe: ſheepe will ſort with
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:14246:252"/>
ſheepe, and not with ſwine, and will not eaſily liue, but in the company of ſheepe: ſo is it with the godly, their life is vncomfortable, if either they be forced to dwell where the wicked are, or where they may not enioy the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the godly. Thirdly, in profitableneſſe: a ſheepe is profitable in all things about him: and therein reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the good workes of all the godly, in whom euery thing is profitable, their praiers, their practiſe, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, their workes of mercy, their piety; yea, their very afflictions are profitable, not onely to themſelues, but to others alſo. Fourthly, in their patience: they are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et in aduerſity, like a ſheepe, dumb before the ſhearer, ſo are godly men when they fall into the hands of vnreaſonable men that afflict them, perſecute them, and oppreſſe &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud them. Now by theſe things muſt men try themſelues. Thus of the preparation to the Iudggment.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the triall follows, where three things muſt be inquired into;
<list>
                           <item>1. About what the triall ſhall be.</item>
                           <item>2. By what law men ſhall receiue their triall.</item>
                           <item>3. By what euidence they ſhall be tried.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it is cleare by Scripture, that the triall ſhall be about the workes of all men. They ſhall be examined about their workes, and the proceding ſhall be according to their workes, as theſe and other Scriptures ſhew, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. If any ſay, that then it ſeemes faith ſhall not bee enquired after: I anſwer, that it ſhall, as is plaine, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. for by their works their faith ſhall be prooued to the world; and faith it ſelfe is one of the higheſt workes of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 29. If any ſay further, that hereby is imported, that the godly ſhall then be iuſtified by their workes, and be ſaued for their workes ſake: I anſwer, that they ſhall be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then according to their workes, not for their workes; God of his free grace will giue reward according to their workes, but not for their workes, nor will their works then iuſtifie them, otherwiſe then as they declare them to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt, and truly righteous in themſelues. It may be further obiected, that this may diſcourage poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:14246:253"/>
and all ſuch as haue not power to doe good workes: I anſwer, that it is an error to thinke, that there are no good works but giuing of almes: There are good works in the obedience of euery one of Gods commandements. Works of piety, and the works of our particular callings, are good works, as well as works of mercy: and the works of ſpirituall mercy a poore man may doe as well as a rich man.</p>
                     <p>About the triall of wicked men alſo diuers things may be obiected: As firſt, they ſhall be iudged for originall ſinne, being borne children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3, and yet that is no worke: I anſwer, that originall ſinne is a worke as it was wrought by <hi>Adam,</hi> and imputed to them, and as it is the cauſe and root of their actuall ſinnes: ſecondly, it may be ſaid that they may be puniſhed for other mens workes, and ſo be iudged for more works than their owne works. To this I anſwer, that the puniſhment of their Parents ſinnes may reach to their children, <hi>Commandement</hi> 2. but that is to be vnderſtood of temporall puniſhments in this world, and not of the ſentence at that day: only children may then be iudged for their Parents ſins, and others for other mens ſins, but that is only as other mens euill works become theirs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conſent, or partaking, or imitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 35. There is another caſe that concernes both good and bad in that day, and that is the caſe of <hi>Infants</hi> either elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, how ſhall they be iudged that haue done neither good nor euill in actuall works, dying before they come to yeares of diſcretion. To this I anſwer, that the proceedings of God about <hi>Infants,</hi> is not clearly reuealed vnto vs in this world, and therefore we muſt leaue that as a ſecret till that day. In <hi>Infants</hi> reprobated, <hi>Adams</hi> worke is imputed, and the vile corruption of their natures makes them children of wrath: In elect children, both the worke of their Parents faith is imputed vnto them, and beſides the Spirit of Chriſt ſupplies outward works, by inward ſanctification, after a way we cannot expreſſe. Thus of the firſt point.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, by what Law men ſhall be iudged at that day? And to that I anſwer out of Scripture, that all ſuch to whom the Goſpell hath come, they ſhall be iudged by the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:14246:253"/>
Goſpell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. which is thus to be vnderſtood, that godly men ſhall be tried by the Goſpell, ſo as their faith, and repentance, and new obedience, being auouched, they ſhall receiue the benefit of triall, not by the rigor of the Law, but by the promiſes of the Goſpell: and wicked men ſhall be tried by the Goſpell, only as their vnbeleefe ſhall be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauation againſt them, that hauing ſo many waies broken the Law, would not flie to Chriſt, nor ſeeke atonement in him: ſo as properly the godly are tried by the Goſpell. Now all the wicked men in the world are chiefly tryed by the Law, and ſo either by the Law of Nature, euen by the principles infuſed into euery mans minde by Nature, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> and all that know not the Scripture: or elſe by the Law of Scripture, that is, by the Law or Couenant of works recorded in Scripture: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                     <p>The third thing is, by what Euidence mens cauſes ſhall be tryed, and how the ſinnes of the wicked ſhall be proued againſt them? And for anſwer hereunto, we reade <hi>Reu.</hi> 20. 12. that when the dead both great and ſmall ſhall ſtand before the Lord, there ſhall be certaine Books opened, out of which ſhall be taken manifeſt euidence in all the Trials. Now what books theſe ſhall be, other Scriptures tell vs: and ſo we reade of fiue books that are likely then to be opened.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the booke of Nature, and ſo the creatures abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men ſhall be for euidence againſt men: as vnto the Idolatrous <hi>Iewes,</hi> the very hornes of their Altars ſhall teſtifie againſt them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. their ſinne is grauen, and as it were written vpon the creatures they haue abuſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond booke is the booke of Scripture: for all thoſe places of Scripture haue beene in this world rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and vrged againſt them, ſhall then ſerue for vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable euidence: <hi>The word which they haue heard ſhall iudge them at the laſt day,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 48.</p>
                     <p>The third booke is the booke of Conſcience: Euery mans conſcience ſhall then be wonderfully dilated, and made able to remember all their ſinnes afreſh, and ſo ſhall be as a thouſand witneſſes. Though the conſciences of moſt men are now aſleepe, yet Chriſt will make them awake at that
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:14246:254"/>
day, and giue in full and perfect euidence. That worke of accuſing which the conſcience doth in ſome men vnperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly in this life, it ſhall doe perfectly at that day: and ſo for excuſing in the godly.</p>
                     <p>The fourth booke is the booke of Gods remembrance mentioned in the caſe of the godly, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the caſe of the wicked, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. in which booke are written all the things that men haue done in their bodies, whether good or euill.</p>
                     <p>Now beſides theſe books, we reade in that place of the <hi>Reuelations,</hi> of a booke of Life, that is, of ſuch a booke as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the names of all that God hath appointed vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ieſus Chriſt, and by that booke the Iudge will ſee vpon whom to paſſe the ſentence of Abſolution, and ſo by conſequent, on whom to paſſe the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. 12. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                     <p>Now beſides theſe books, we reade of a booke of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that containes a Record of all the perſons to whom God gaue naturall life, and forme, of which <hi>Dauid</hi> makes mention, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 16. and this booke may be of vſe to ſhew who muſt be called to Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>And yet further we may gather out of other Scriptures, that if there be need God can produce other Euidence: As firſt the Heauens and the Earth will declare Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, at leaſt by way of aggrauation, either in reſpect of the benefits they haue brought forth vnto man to allure him to goodneſſe, and the iudgments haue beene vpon them to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 6. The very vanitie which the creatures haue beene ſubiect to, will teſtifie againſt man in that day: <hi>The heauen,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zophar, ſhall reueale his iniquitie, and the earth ſhall riſe vp against him, Iob</hi> 20. 27. And hence it was that God called the heauen and the earth to witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the people at ſundry times in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Secondly, the examples of the faith, and piety, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and mercy in godly men that haue liued amongſt the wicked, will be euidence againſt them: as the example of <hi>Noah</hi> will condemne the old world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. ſo the example of the <hi>Queene</hi> of the <hi>South,</hi> and the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> will
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:14246:254"/>
riſe vp in Iudgement againſt the Iewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 41, 42. Laſtly, the Spirit of God, which hath rebuked the world of ſin, will be able to conuince all the vngodly openly of all their wickedneſſe at that day.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the manner of the Triall. The manner of the Sentence followes.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the Sentence we cannot in this world know, ſaue that our Sauiour himſelfe hath giuen a little taſte of it, by making a briefe deſcription of it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. the latter part of the chapter: and this glimpſe of that glory of his proceedings there he giues, that both the godly might be eſtabliſhed in conſolation, and the wicked left without excuſe hauing ſo faire warning.</p>
                     <p>The ſentence ſtands of two parts, the one concernes the godly, and that is a ſentence of abſolution, as Diuines call it, or rather a ſentence of glorification: and the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the wicked, and that is a ſentence of condemnation. Our Sauiour will begin with the ſentence of abſolution, to ſhew thereby his readineſſe to mercy, and long-ſuffering, and that he is not caried with vniuſt furie againſt thoſe on his left hand, and that thereby alſo he may make the elect capable of the dignitie of being Aſſeſſours with him in the Iudgement vpon the wicked.</p>
                     <p>The ſentence that concernes the godly may be conſidered of according to the foure parts of it. The firſt is the calling of the elect to glory, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. The ſecond is the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for this calling, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35, 36. The third is the anſwer Chriſt ſhall receiue from the elect, <hi>v.</hi> 37, 38, 39. The fourth is the replication of our Sauiour to their anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 40.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, in generall we may note, That if Chriſt call vs to grace and good works in this life, he will call vs to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in another world: All that are effectually called, and ſet about Gods worke in this world, ſhall haue a moſt ioyfull call to the poſſeſſion of an eternall kingdome at the laſt day. Which ſhould much incourage the godly, againſt all the hardſhip of godlineſſe in this life.</p>
                     <p>There are many things may be briefly noted from the particular words by which this glorious calling is expreſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:14246:255"/>
1. In that the Iudge is ſuddenly by change of ſtile called a King, it might haue ſome vſe for the preſent reſpect of the Diſciples, that dreamed of an earthly kingdom in this world: and beſides, a generall reſpect vnto the godly of all ages to informe them, that though Chriſt entertaine his ſeruants in this world but in meane conditions many times, and that thereby his glory ſeems much abaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, yet at that day, he will ſpeake and doe for them like a King, yea a King alone, when all other Kings ſhall lay their Crownes at his feet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith, <hi>Come yee,</hi> it notes how glad Chriſt will be of them at that day, as of ſuch as haue beene long from him. No father can be ſo glad to ſee his children that haue beene long abſent, as Chriſt will be to ſee his members: while he yet ſits vpon the Throne of Iudgement, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but ſhew his affection.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In that he ſaith, <hi>Yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi> he ſhewes them the fountaine of all their preferment to be Gods free loue and grace to them, and not their deſerts. And withall teacheth vs to be confident in it, that no people are ſo bleſſed and happy as ſuch as be true Chriſtians: They are the bleſſed of God; euen ſuch as God bleſſeth as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If <hi>Iſraels</hi> bleſſing could make <hi>Iacob</hi> happy, much more Gods bleſſings vpon thoſe he acknowledgeth for his children. It matters not though the world hate vs, and curſe vs; if God will loue vs and bleſſe vs, it is enough.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In that he ſaith; <hi>Inherit the kingdome,</hi> it imports that we ſhall neuer haue full poſſeſſion of perfect glory till the day of Iudgement. We are heires now, but we are as it were vnder age. And beſides, merit of works is here againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: for if we hold heauen by inheritance, then not by merit: a mans child claimes not his land by deſert but by deſcent. And further, in that he cals their glory a kingdome, it giues vs a glimpſe of the ſurpaſſing aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery true Chriſtian at that day. This world hath no higher eſtates to ſhadow it out by, but a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is the higheſt greatneſſe on earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be greatly comforted againſt the miſeries
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:14246:255"/>
we ſuffer in the daies of our baniſhment, and pilgrimage here below.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In that he ſaith, <hi>Prepared,</hi> we may gather from that word, the great care of our heauenly Father, that prouides eſtates for all his children long before they be ready to poſſeſſe it, which ſhould be ſome inſtruction to earthly Parents to ſhew care for their children in prouiding, if it may be, for them before hand.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In that he ſaith, <hi>for you,</hi> it manifeſtly ſhewes that God did particularly chuſe certaine men, and not all men, as heires of his kingdome.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In that he ſaith, <hi>from the foundation of the world,</hi> we may againe note that Heauen is not had by our merits, becauſe it was prepared before we had done either good or euill. Obſerue alſo, that our Sauiour making mention of the beginning of the world, expreſſeth it by mentioning the foundation of the world, great was the ſurpaſſing glory of Gods power and wiſdome in making the world, and likewiſe beyond all apprehenſion, great was his power in hanging this mightie frame of all things without any thing to hold it vp, ſaue his owne ſecret power and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and will it ſhould be ſo. Or may not the foundation of the world be referred to the minde of God in eternitie? Though this world were framed and reared in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time, yet may we not ſay, that it was founded in the minde of God from all eternitie?</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of all theſe things in the calling to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould greatly abaſe vs for our want of affection, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and ſtrong conſolation in the hope of all this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and if it be poſſible, it ſhould plucke vp our hearts to a feruent loue and longing for, and haſting to the appearing of Chriſt Ieſus; our hearts, I ſay, vpon whom the ends of the world are come, when the day of the Lord is ſo neare at hand. And withall it ſhould worke in vs a perfect patience in bearing the afflictions of this life, theſe light afflictions, I ſay light, in compariſon of that eternall weight of glory.</p>
                     <p>Thus of their calling to glory: The Reaſon followes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. 36. And it is taken from their workes of mercy, as they
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:14246:256"/>
are ſignes of their faith in Chriſt, and as markes of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, not as cauſes of their glory: and yet if it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they were cauſes of glory, yet it will not follow they are meritorious cauſes: There are many ſorts of efficient cauſes, beſides cauſes meritorious: if any aske why their workes of piety are not mentioned, or workes of righteouſneſſe as well as mercy: I anſwer; that mercy is not abſolutely better than piety, but only in a ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of men, and as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth iuſtifie our pietie to be right. Now out of all the words I obſerue</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That good workes are neceſſary to ſaluation, as cauſes without which no ſaluation will be had.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That workes of mercie are very acceptable to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the beſt charitie is to releeue godly Chriſtians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                     <p>From the anſwer of the godly, we may gather ſomething of defect, and ſomething of praiſe. The defect ſeemes to be, that they doe not ſufficiently informe themſelues of the deareneſſe of relation betweene them and Chriſt, and the great account that Chriſt makes of their workes. As we muſt not be iuſt ouer-much, to think better of our ſelues than there is cauſe, ſo we muſt not be wicked ouer-much, in denying Gods grace, or attributing more ſinne to our ſelues than is true. Their great praiſe imported in theſe words is, that they forget the good they haue done, being more prone to ſee and acknowledge their vnworthineſſe, whereas wicked men can remember the good they haue done, but forget their ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>From the Reply of Chriſt we may obſerue, the neere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction betweene Chriſt and Chriſtians: Hee reckons of them as of himſelfe, and is affected with all that befalls them, as if it did befall himſelfe: He is not aſhamed to call them brethren; yea he reckons poore Chriſtians as a part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, though they be deſpiſed in the world, yet he loues them, as he loues himſelfe, they are pretious in his eyes: cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them brethren, hee vouchſafeth them incredible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which ſhould greatly ſtirre vs vp to charity; and if at
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:14246:256"/>
any time we are dull, ſet Chriſt before our eyes, and thinke what a Sacrilege it is to deny releefe to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the ſentence of abſolution: which being ended, he will proceed to the ſentence of condemnation. Hee is not ſo mercifull as to forget to be iuſt. It is in vaine to plead the mercy of God and Chriſt, to proue the ſaluation of the wicked, for he is iuſt as well as mercifull, and that they ſhall know fully at his comming. In the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerue foure things: Firſt, the reprobation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. Secondly, the cauſe of this reprobation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42, 43. Thirdly, the Apologie of the wicked for themſelues, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. Fourthly, the anſwer to their Apologie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 45.</p>
                     <p>In the Reprobation of the wicked I note diuers things, as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that ſpeaking of the Iudge his title of King is left out, which was mentioned, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34, 40. I gather that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, euen at the Tribunall, when they ſhall ſee Chriſt in his greateſt glory, yet they cannot truly loue him, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſteeme of his glory: The naturall hatred of Chriſt will continue vpon them euen at that day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith, <hi>Depart yee from me,</hi> it ſhewes that it is a grieuous miſery to be thruſt out from Chriſt: it were an euerlaſting fearfull puniſhment, if wicked men did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no more, but the abſence of Chriſt for euer; to liue without that Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, is worſe than to liue without the ſhining of the Sunne in the firmament: and herein note the iuſtice of Chriſt, in that wicked men could not abide the company of Chriſt, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this world, they ſhall now be paid in the ſame kinde, they ſhall neuer more enioy the preſence of Chriſt or any one true Chriſtian. Woe to Hypocrites at that day, though now they ſeeme to be ioyned to Chriſt, yet let them thinke what it will be, when they ſhall be made to depart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In that he calls them <hi>Curſed,</hi> it ſhewes that euery wicked man is a curſed creature; and withall, that to be vnder Gods curſe is the quinteſſence of miſery. And therefore godly men haue little cauſe to enuy the proſperitie of any wicked man, nor wicked man to be ſo drunken with the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:14246:257"/>
eſtimation of the fading glory of earthly poſſeſſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In that he ſaith, <hi>Into euerlaſting fire,</hi> it notes the vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able horror of the paine of wicked men in Hell. If a man knew he muſt lie in a burning fire but one day, oh how would he be diſmayed? Oh what ſenſeleſneſſe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched vngodly men, that are not frighted with euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting burnings? They are wonderfully blinded, that ſtriue to beleeue, that there is only <hi>Poena Damni,</hi> not <hi>Poena Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> in Hell: That there is no paine in Hell, but only loſſe of good things, as the preſence of God and Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In that he ſaith, <hi>Prepared for the Deuill and his Angels,</hi> we obſerue,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God neuer purpoſed to ſhew mercy to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is one Deuill is chiefe, and hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That from the beginning God intended to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto mankind, though not vnto deuils.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the eternall companions of wicked men ſhall be deuils: ſuch as loue wicked company in this life, may here ſee what companions they ſhall haue in Hell.</p>
                     <p>From the deſcription of the cauſe of the Reprobation, we may note,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not enough to refraine from euill, but we muſt doe good. Not bearing of fruit will be a cauſe of cutting downe the Tree.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All Religion is pretended in vaine, by ſuch as are able, and doe not ſhew mercy to the poore. It is a ſinne that Chriſt ſhall finde only in the wicked.</p>
                     <p>From the Apologie of the wicked, we learne</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That men may be very innocent in ſome things in their owne ſight, and yet be very guiltie in the ſight of God. They did thinke verily they neuer ſaw Chriſt <hi>naked,</hi> &amp;c. and yet in his members they did.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is the propertie of the wicked to remember the good they doe, and forget the euill: they can remember their prophecying, working of miracles, and eating and drinking with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. but forget all their
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:14246:257"/>
ſinnes of vnmercifulneſſe, and the like: No ma ruell if they iuſtifie themſelues before men, that ſhall dare to doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>From the anſwer to the Apologie, we learne plainly, that all the iniuries done to the godly, yea euen to the pooreſt and meaneſt of them, Chriſt reckons as done to himſelfe, and will accordingly puniſh them at the day of Iudgement; yea not only iniuries, but the neglect of honouring, and ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and relieuing of them.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the manner of the Sentence. The execution followes.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the execution of the Sentence foure things belong.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The deliuery of Poſſeſſion of eternall glory to the godly.</item>
                        <item>2. The detruſion of the wicked into Hell.</item>
                        <item>3. The creation of the new Heauens and new Earth.</item>
                        <item>4. The deliuering vp of the Kingdome of Chriſt into the hands of God the Father.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the firſt, after the ſentence ended, the Elect ſhall be all taken vp to heauen with Chriſt, there to reigne with him in eternall bliſſe: where they ſhall preſently be poſſeſt of foure incomparable benefits: The firſt is the immediate viſion of God, ſo as neuer man ſaw him in this world. If to liue in the preſence of great Princes on earth be ſuch a preferment, what is it to liue in Gods preſence for euer? and if to ſee the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches of the earth in their glory ſo much affect men, what is that eternall ſight, when men that once were but duſt and clay, are now admitted to behold that infinite perfection, and fountaine of all goodneſſe? In God wee ſhall behold moſt perfectly all thoſe things that can be of power to ſtirre admiration, all thoſe beauties and praiſes, that the nature of man can delight in. The ſecond is the perfection of their owne natures both in ſoule and body: Then ſhall their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances ſhine like the Sunne in the firmament; then ſhall their very bodies be like ſpirits, able to paſſe whither they will in a moment: then ſhall they poſſeſſe health, without all infirmitie, or power to feele paine, or defect, nor ſorrow,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14246:258"/>
ſickneſſe, or weakneſſe ſhall any more aſſaile them: but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than thoſe ſhall be beſtowed vpon their ſoules; for then ſhall their knowledge be made perfect: <hi>Here wee know but in part, there we ſhall know as we are knowne:</hi> there we ſhall enioy an euerlaſting day: It is darke night with vs in this world, in compariſon of that celeſtiall light of knowledge: Here we are groaping in the darke to finde out ſome parts of truth, but there God who is whole truth it ſelfe, ſhall fill our mindes with the ſhining beames of his light. Then ſhall all the faculties of the ſoule be made perfectly glorious, in all righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, all impotencies being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, God himſelfe being all in all in the Elect for euer. The third is the acquaintance and moſt glorious ſocietie with all the Angels of Heauen, and all iuſt men, of all ages and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: which fellowſhip ſhall be made perfectly comfortable, all things that may offend being remoued from them, both in their natures and workes: The heart of man cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any true praiſe of friendſhip, that can be there wanting to any of that ſociety. The fourth is the actuall donation of power ouer all things, euen the kingdome of the whole world: God will then ſuffer them to enioy what their hearts can wiſh in heauen or earth: they receiue then as their own, all that euer God made. Now from the poſſeſſion of all theſe ariſeth ioy vnſpeakable, and delight aboue imagination, not only the heart of man, but all his ſenſes being taken vp with perpetuall admiration, and refreſhing, being as it were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>riated with thoſe riuers of pleaſures that are at the right hand of God.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of the Execution, containes the thruſting of all the wicked, with the Diuell and his Angels into Hell: where all the damned muſt ſuffer firſt abiection from the face of God, and depriuation of the very ſight of all that might comfort in heauen or earth. Secondly, the gnawing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vpon the eternall remembrance of all their ſinnes. Thirdly, vnutterable torments in fire vnquenchable. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the horrid preſence of the Deuill and his Angels, all which are made more grieuous, by the impoſſibilitie to find either eaſe or end. The life they loath they muſt liue, and the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:14246:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>
death they deſire they ſhall neuer finde. Oh that men could be warned in time, to prouide that they neuer come into that place. That meſſage <hi>Diues</hi> would haue ſent to his brethren, is brought vnto men now by the Goſpell, and therefore let them awake to liue righteouſly, that they periſh not in this great damnation, where ſhall be the <hi>Chaos</hi> of darkneſſe, the horror of tribulation, the feare of confuſion, the griefe of fearfull viſions, the voice of men lamenting, the biting of wormes gnawing, cold intollerable, fire vnquenchable, ſtinch intollerable, darkneſſe palpable, and an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of all that is good.</p>
                     <p>The third thing is the creation of new heauens and new earth, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 17. and 66. 22. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. Now about this Creation we are to conſider of two things:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The firing of the world.</item>
                        <item>2. The libertie of the creatures.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the firſt of theſe it is manifeſt, that the world, that it may be made new, ſhall be caſt into the fire, as into a furnace: The heauens and the earth are reſerued vnto fire, the heauens ſhall periſh, and ſhall all wax old as a garment, and as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture God ſhall fold them vp, and they ſhall be changed; the heauens being on fire ſhall paſſe away, and be diſſolued with a noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with heat, and the earth with the workes thereof ſhall be burnt vp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 27, 28. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5, 7, 10, 11, 12. The ſubſtance of the heauens and the earth ſhall not be annihilated, but the qualities only ſhall be altered, that is, bettered: The figure of this world ſhall paſſe away, not the nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond of theſe, all things ſhall be ſo made new, as all creatures that were brought into bondage ſhall then be ſet at libertie, and receiue reſtitution, as is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. That this point may be the more clearely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I muſt conſider of two things. Firſt, how the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in bondage now, and then how they ſhall be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then. The creatures be now in bondage many wayes: Firſt, as any of them are corruptible, ſo in bondage to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Secondly, as they are ſubiect to mutations, and
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:14246:259"/>
confuſions, as in the caſe of the Aire and Seas. Thirdly, as they are forced to ſerue the turnes of wicked men, and their vſes. Fourthly, as they are teachers of the world, and men will not learne: the creatures are Gods great booke, and it is a bondage to teach and loſe their labour. Fifthly, as any of them are either the inſtrument, or the ſubiect of mans puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sixthly, as ſince the fall they haue loſt their vigorous inſtincts, as they are dulled and diſtempered in them.</p>
                     <p>Now for the ſecond point, they ſhall then be freed from all that vanitie, or paine, or miſery, or mutabilitie fell vpon them ſince the fall of man; and withall they ſhall be reſtored into a glorious eſtate, when the Elect are glorified: and ſo they partake of the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God. But this reſtitution ſhal not be made to each particular crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hath beene, but to each ſort of creatures ſhall be then found aliue at the laſt day: But what ſhall be their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or how long they ſhall continue, cannot be determined without curioſitie and raſhneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth effect or conſequent of the Iudgement, is the deliuering of the kingdome of Chriſt into the hands of God the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. which is to be vnderſtood, not of the glorious eſtate of Chriſt, but of his temporall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer the world and the Church, as he ruled by means in this world: for this kingdome ends, when hee hath fully ſubdued the deuils and death, and wicked men, and hath fully deliuered the Elect from all ſinne and miſery. Then there ſhall be no need to gouerne men by Magiſtrates, or Preachers, or Sacraments, or diſcipline, or of any of the helps of naturall or ſpirituall life.</p>
                     <p>Thus of the explication of this Article.</p>
                     <p>The vſe that may be made of this Article in generall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and ſo firſt it may extremely affright all men that lies in their ſins without repentance, for there are many things in this doctrine terrible, as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath ſet them a day, wherein he will certainly bring them to account.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this day is moſt certaine, and God will not alter his minde, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="533" facs="tcp:14246:259"/>
3. That this day will be a day of wrath to them, and not of mercy: The date of mercy vnto impenitent ſinners will then be out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That all his ſins ſhall then be diſcouered, euen all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, and none can be forgotten, in as much as the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall bee giuen out of ſo many bookes, where all things are written, as it were, with a pen of iron, and the point of a Diamond, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That euen the longer hee liues, the more hee heapes vp wrath againſt that day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That no meanes will then be auaileable to deliuer them. Riches will not helpe them, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 18, 19. nor multitude cannot ſhelter them, <hi>Iude</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That though thou haſt excelled in many gifts, and done much good in the world, yet if thou die in ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, thou ſhalt not eſcape Gods vengeance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That it is but a little while thither, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 8. The ſignes of Chriſts comming are the moſt of them run out; and we ſee that diuers of the laſt ſignes run together, as if the Lord made haſte to make an end of all things: and if generall iudgement were yet further off, yet death is at hand, which giues a particular iudgement vpon thee.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That when he doth come it will be ſo ſuddenly, as thou ſhalt not haue time to make thy ſelfe ready, or to mend thy courſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 6, 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 39.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That God will be Iudge himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. That it will be a finall ſentence, there can be no reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or appeale.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That Gods proceedings in his iuſtice will be then all cleared, they ſhall haue nothing to obiect; and his iuſtice will the more appeare both by the equity of his dealing: They haue had their dayes of ſinning, and therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſhould haue his day of Iudging: and by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his patience, that hath deferred this laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch a wonderfull while: and beſides, God will then diſcouer a world of offences in euery wicked man,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:14246:260"/>
that are not now knowne to others: and finally, God will then open the ſecrets of his counſell, and bring forth exquiſite reaſons for his decrees, and prouidence, and iudgement, which are now like a great deepe to vs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it muſt needs be moſt terrible to them, if their hearts can apprehend now the horror of their ſummons by the ſound of the laſt Trumpe, and their publike ſhame before all the world, and eſpecially their eternall ſeparation from God and all good things, and that infinite torment they muſt for euer be in with the Deuill and his angels.</p>
                     <p>But yet vnto them this doctrine hath another vſe, that is, more comfortable, and that is, that God yet giues them warning to repent, and if the Terror of this day, can now make them to repent, their ſoules ſhall be ſaued in that day, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. elſe they are moſt wofully vndone for euer.</p>
                     <p>And on the other ſide it may be a doctrine of wonderf u confort to all the godly: and the rather if they conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they haue iudged themſelues already, and therefore haue Gods promiſe they ſhall not be condemned at that day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31, 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God hath iudged them already: they haue indured their paine already in this world: God will account the afflictions of this life ſufficient vnto them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they are alreadie perfectly iuſtified, and abſolued from all their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. and 8. 33.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That they haue Chriſt to be their Iudge: for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comforts in that point. They need not be afraid of his ſentence, becauſe hee hath beene their aduocate all this while, and hath pleaded for them at the barre of Iuſtice, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and he is their brother, their husband, their head, and all things elſe in relation, which imports deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Reade but the Booke of <hi>Canticles,</hi> and conſider whether he that giues ſuch wonderfull, louing, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar termes of affection to his Church, can euer be brought to pronounce a terrible ſentence vpon her? And beſides, hath he not in Scripture left many promiſes that aſſure vs of our happineſſe at that day? And further, who can reade the ſtory of the Paſſion of Chriſt, and thinke that he will
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:14246:260"/>
euer ſpeake terrible things to them, for whom he ſuffered ſo grieuous things on earth. Was he not himſelfe iudged for them on earth, that they might be abſolued from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Laſtly, he hath left vs the ſeale of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, euen his owne Spirit in our hearts, as an earneſt of our moſt glorious and finall Redemption at that day; and beſides that priuie ſeale of his Spirit, how often hath hee ſet to his broad ſeale in the Sacraments from time to time? And therefore they may be all aſſured, that there Chriſt will be made maruellous in that day in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, to their euerlaſting honour, and praiſe, and glory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the doctrine of the laſt Iudgement, ſhould ſerue alſo for inſtruction, and ſo</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It ſhould ſtrike a conſtant feare of God into our hearts, and of his dreadfull iuſtice, and maieſtie, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14. 7.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ghoſt</hi> is an old Engliſh word, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Spirit:</hi> and this Title of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is giuen to the third Perſon in Trinity, in a ſpeciall manner: The word <hi>Spirit</hi> by way of cauſe, and the word <hi>Holy,</hi> by way of effect.</p>
                  <p>He is a ſpirit not only in nature (ſo the Father and Son are a Spirit) but becauſe hee proceeds from the Father and the Son by way of ſpiration or breathing: on the other ſide, he is called holy, not only in reſpect of Nature (for ſo Father and
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:14246:261"/>
ſome are holy) but by effect, becauſe hee makes the Church holy.</p>
                  <p>Now to beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, is not only to beleeue that there is a holy Ghoſt, but to relie vpon him for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſaluation, and all happineſſe: to beleeue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to ſay true when he ſpeaketh, or to beleeue what is written of him, will not ſerue turne, vnleſſe wee beleeue in him.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why there is but one Article about the Holy Ghoſt is, becauſe the doctrine concerning him, hath not beene ſo much oppoſed, as the doctrine concerning Chriſt, or the Father: vnleſſe wee take in the Articles that follow, and place them vnder this head of the Holy Ghoſt, which may be done thus; The third part of the <hi>Creed</hi> concernes the Holy Ghoſt, and his ſpeciall operation, which is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: which is declared partly by the obiect, which is the Church, and partly by the effect, which is communion of Saints: which communion is enioyed in three things, <hi>viz. Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, Reſurrection of the body, and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I come to open the full meaning of the words of this Article, I obſerue from the generall conſideration of them, with the coherence, theſe things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Holy Ghoſt is God as well as the Father and the Sonne, becauſe we muſt beleeue in him, as well as in the Father and the Sonne, which is plainly proued by the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2, 3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 7. with <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 25. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. hence is the Holy Ghoſt recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Father and the Sonne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he proceedeth from the Father and the Son, which the <hi>Creed</hi> intimateth in placing this Article laſt, and is plaine by theſe Scriptures, where he is called, <hi>The Spirit of the Father, Luk.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. 26. and 15. 26. <hi>and of the Sonne, Ioh.</hi> 16. 7. 14. and 20. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he is a diſtinct perſon from the Father and the Son, which is manifeſt in Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:14246:262"/>
4. That he is equall to the Father and the Sonne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt beleeue in him as well as in the Father and Son: This appears alſo in this, That diuine worſhip is due to him, as well as the Father or the Sonne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 619, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. as alſo by this, that the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt is vnpardonable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the meaning of the Article is, That euery Chriſtian in particular doth profeſſe to beleeue in, and put his truſt vpon the holy Ghoſt, as the Author and worker of his happineſſe and ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Now that the reaſon of this Article may appeare, it will be profitable for vs to conſider, what the Holy Ghoſt is in his owne nature, and what he is in effect or operation, vpon which we may ground our faith and truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>There are diuers things in the nature of the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhould moue vs to beleeue in him and reſt vpon him: as firſt, That hee is eternall, and was before the world was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. and therefore cannot alter his diſpoſition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he is immenſe, and euery-where preſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and therefore he is ready to helpe. Thirdly, that he is omniſcient, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 16. and 10. 19. and 20. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. and therefore he knowes what wee want, and what is needfull for vs. Fourthly, that he is omnipotent, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 7. and 7. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. and therefore is able to deliuer vs and make vs happy.</p>
                  <p>Thus of what the Holy Ghoſt is in his nature; what hee is by effect or opperation followes: and ſo we are to conſider of the benefits which the holy Spirit worketh, all which ſerue to proue, that we may &amp; ought to put our truſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Now theſe benefits are either common or proper. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> benefits are ſuch as belong either to all creatures, or to all men: The proper benefits belong only to the godly &amp; elect.</p>
                  <p>The operation of the holy Spirit common to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is the making of them at the firſt, and the ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and quickning of the firſt matter, that it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſeuerall formes of things. Thus the Holy Ghoſt is likened to a Fowle that ſits vpon her egges till the young
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:14246:262"/>
ones be hatched, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. So did the Holy Ghoſt ſit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> till it was made apt for the ſeuerall formes of all things. And it was the Spirit of the Lord that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the heauens, <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 13. and ſo it is the worke of the holy Ghoſt to giue life to all the creatures ſtil in their ſeuerall kinds, for the preſeruation of the ſorts of things. Thus God ſendeth his Spirit ſtill, and they are created, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 30.</p>
                  <p>The operation of the Holy Ghoſt, common to all men are of diuers ſorts, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſpeciall forming and in-liuing of euery particular man that comes into the world: Thus <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath giuen me life, Iob</hi> 33. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The inuention of the myſteries of skill for the managing of particular ſciences, and trades, and callings amongſt men. There is in all trades and profeſſions of men ſuch things of skill, as are aboue the reach of the nature of man ſince the fall, and are diſcouered only by the holy Ghoſt Thus the wiſdome and skill <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> had for building was from the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 3. ſo <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> skill in matters of warre, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 34. and that theſe things muſt needs come from aboue, appeareth by this, that nature in any one man can hardly reach to make him capable of anie more trades or callings then one, though he be helped with inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The inſpiration of certaine men to conceiue and write the booke of God, for the inſtruction of all men in the viſible Church. This ſacred frame of holy words, came not by the wit or skill of men, but by the immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>vlt.</hi> This I reckon among the benefits common, for though the men inſpired were all holy men, yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſpired ſerues for vſe to wicked men as well as godly: for, though the Scriptures be auaileable onely to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Elect, yet it ſerues for ſo much information of the wicked, as may leaue them without excuſe, and it ſerues to terrific them for their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The qualifying of the Miniſters, that are appointed for
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:14246:263"/>
publike teaching: for this skill is aboue nature, and from the holy Ghoſt. And Gods Spirit in the Teachers is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſomtimes vnto the vſe of wicked men as well as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20. and ſo the gift of teaching may be beſtowed vpon wicked men, ſo as they may bee like the Carpenters that built <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and yet bee drowned themſelues, ſuch was <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The gifts of prophecying and working of miracles, theſe are all from the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. and yet theſe gifts may be found in wicked men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The high gifts of illumination in diuine things, in the vnderſtanding of the doctrines of faith, that are aboue nature: for all men by nature haue a veile ouer their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25. 8. now if this veile be in any part pulled off, it is by the holy Ghoſt, for hee is the onely ſpirituall annointing and eye-ſalue, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. Now this gift of enlightning, and taſting of the good word of God, and the diſcerning of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things in reſpect of the theory of it, may be found in wicked men, but not with application and practiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. Thus wicked men may receiue ſo much grace, as to heare and receiue the word of God with ioy, ſo as to haue a taſte of the very powers of the world to come, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13. but this taſte is without digeſtion, they are not ſoundly humbled for their ſinnes, nor is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take them off from the loue of this preſent world, nor will they yeeld themſelues to be ruled in all things by the word they reioyce in: nor doe they apply the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to themſelues, ſo as to beleeue Gods fauour, and their owne ſaluation in the world to come.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The gifts of reſtraining grace: this is a great gift; by which a man is made to forbeare many vile actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the bent of his owne nature, and to act diuers things wholly aboue his owne diſpoſition, ſo as he is as if he were another man: as <hi>Saul</hi> was when the ſpirit of God fell vpon him: and ſo many men euen among the heathen, had an expreſſion on of valour, wiſdome, chaſtity, iuſtice, &amp;c. and this was from the holy Ghoſt for the good of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14246:263"/>
humane ſocieties. Thus God kept <hi>Abimelech</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6. Thus <hi>Haman</hi> can refraine his rage againſt <hi>Mordecai, Hest.</hi> 5. 10. If this gift were not, wicked men would bee as the wilde beaſts of the deſert. And yet it is one thing to reſtraine a mans corruptions, and another thing to mortifie them.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the operations of the holy Ghoſt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to good and bad: but the ſurpaſſing glory of his working, is in the benefits proper to the Elect only, &amp; ſo his works may be conſidered, either in general, or in particular.</p>
                  <p>The generall workes are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The conception and qualification of the humane nature of our Sauiour, by which hee was made fit for that great worke of the redemption of all the Elect, <hi>Math.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. and 42. 1. and thus hee receiued the Spirit without meaſure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His habitation in the godly, their hearts being the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the holy Ghoſt, ſo as he dwells in them after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The regeneration of all the Elect in their ſeaſons, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. 5. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Thus they are waſhed, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and iuſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. and in reſpect of new gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the godly are the Epiſtle of Chriſt, euery grace being as a word or letter, grauen vpon their hearts by the holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The vniting of all the godly, into one myſticall body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe the bond of that vnion in Ieſus Chriſt: of which moſt glorious worke the Scriptures ſpeak euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The quickning and raiſing vp of our bodies at the laſt day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>The particular workes or things he worketh in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſuch as theſe maruellous things: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Liberty: Liberty I ſay chiefly from the power of ſinne: making a godly man able to ſubdue ſuch corruptions as noſtrength of nature, or naturall arguments or meanes could euer maſter: This is farre aboue reſtraining grace: Where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17.
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:14246:264"/>
and, <hi>The law of the Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, hath freed me</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Paul) from the law of ſinne and of death, Rom.</hi> 8. 2. and this the Spirit doth, firſt, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſpirituall circumciſion vpon the heart, cauſing a man to imploy himſelfe in the duties of mortification, till he giue deadly wounds to his beloued ſinnes, and at length caſt them away like a lothſome fore-skin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. making a man to accuſe and condemne himſelfe, &amp; pray againſt the deedes of the fleſh, till hee get ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer his corruptions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. and in this worke the holy Ghoſt diſcouers himſelfe as a Spirit of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Spirit of burning, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> calls him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4. 4. Secondly, by luſting againſt the fleſh, that is, ſtirring vp conſent, and earneſt deſires and grones to be rid of the burthen of corruption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Thirdly, by cauſing a man to heare a word behind him, when hee is about to goe out of the way, either on the right hand and on the left, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. that is, by daily good motions, and inward checks of conſcience, which tend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man from yeelding to any thing he knowes to be a ſinne. Fourthly, by baptizing the penitent ſinner with the baptiſme of fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. which is, when the holy Ghoſt falls vpon his heart, and ſo inflames his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that he is full of indignation, and a deſire of holy reuenge againſt his corruptions, and an vnſpeakable zeale after righteouſneſſe and Gods glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The infuſing of diuine gifts, qualifying the godly with ſuch abilities as are altogether aboue nature, ſuch as are Faith, Loue, Hope, and the gift of Prayer; no man can beleeue things aboue reaſon, and without meanes, vnleſſe he haue the ſpirit of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17, 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. The loue of God is likewiſe ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. and it is the Spirit that makes a man hope and wait for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to be reuealed in another world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. and therefore is the Spirit called the Spirit of prayer, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 11. becauſe it is he only that qualifies a man with ſuch a language, as to be able to ſpeake to God
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:14246:264"/>
with iudgement, affections, and confidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Yea beſides theſe, he beſtowes ſuch gifts vpon the godly, in reſpect of which they are ſaid to partake of the diuine nature, as they are made like vnto God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. as when the Spirit makes a man reſemble God, in his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his loue, in his knowledge or wiſdome, and in mercy, and a pure and ſound minde, and patience, and goodneſſe, and ſuch like: Firſt it is a wonderfull worke to make the heart of man vnmoueable, like God, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pleaſed, and at reſt in himſelfe without diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his condition; and this peace and ioy the Holy Ghoſt is the author of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. and 14. 17. Secondly, the Holy Ghoſt makes a man to reſemble God in his loue to the godly, aboue all the people of the world; and is therefore called the Spirit of loue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. Thirdly, to let goe all the other gifts of the Spirit, which are mentioned in that catalogue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.) I will only inſtance further in that grace of knowledge; it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke to make a man vnderſtand ſupernaturall things, the myſteries of Gods kingdome, which are knowne only to God himſelfe, for <hi>the naturall man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth them not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. 13. 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 11. as to know how God ſtands affected to vs; yea to know the height, length, bredth, and depth of Gods loue to vs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19, 20. yea to know thoſe ſacred truths, ſo as to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, and changed into the likeneſſe of the things taught vs, from one glorious grace to another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi> Now this knowledge or wiſdome from aboue the Spirit worketh in vs, both by curing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſound our mindes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. and by leading vs into all truth, and bringing to remembrance the things which we haue heard, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>The third worke of the Holy Ghoſt in the elect, is the fanctification of their works, or the ſanctifying of them vnto obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. and this the Spirit doth by quickning them, and ſtirring them vp to good works, both by inward motions, and by the miniſterie of the word made effectually. Thus the fruit of <hi>the Spirit is in all</hi>

                     <hi>goodneſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and truth, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 9. and <hi>It is the Spirit</hi> only <hi>that quickens, Ioh.</hi> 6. 63. and further he doth it by purifying the ſoule from ſuch droſſe as might hinder obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. ſuch as pride, hypocriſie, and worldly luſts; and by helping our infirmities, when we know not what to doe as we ought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. and by putting life into v in the manner of well-ding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. and beſides, by cauſing vs to keepe Gods ſtatutes and to doe them, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 27. as it were working our works for vs, ſetting vs to worke, and directing all the worke of our hands: and finally, by ſanctifying the offering vp both of our ſelues and of our ſeruice vnto God, as the Altar ſanctifies the gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. and by opening of an acceſſe vnto God in all our ſeruice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                  <p>The fourth worke of the Holy Ghoſt in the elect is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:</hi> for he is giuen vnto them of Chriſt as an vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Comforter all their daies, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. ſuch a Comforter as the world neuer had, nor can receiue, as Chriſt ſaith in that place: and this ioy in the Holy Ghoſt, is a prime part of the kingdome of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. and thus he comforteth them with ioyes vnſpeakable and glorious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. and this makes the godly to walke on in the feare of God with great incouragement, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. and as he is a Comforter to them in all eſtates, ſo eſpecially in the daies of affliction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, he reſts vpon them as a Spirit of glory, giuing them ſuch taſtes of the ioyes of heauen, as makes them contemne all earthly things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. and this ioy they finde, not only by an habituall gladneſſe of heart at all times, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the word, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 5. and in Prayer and Sacraments and fellowſhip with the godly.</p>
                  <p>The fifth worke of the Holy Ghoſt in the godly, is ſtrength for perſeuerance: and ſo it is his office to ſee to it, that grace goe not out, which in many Chriſtians is but like a bruiſed reed, or ſmoaking flax, and thus he abideth in them for euer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. to ſtrengthen their inward man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. and this he performeth both by nouriſhing the ſeeds of all grace in them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 3. and by ſupplying their wants, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. and by a powerfull aſſiſtance in all times of triall and
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:14246:265"/>
temptation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10. and by eſtabliſhing their faith that they may hold out to the end, which he doth both by bearing witneſſe vnto their ſpirits ſtill that they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. and by being Gods priuie ſeale to all his promiſes, and an earneſt or pledge of the glory to come, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. and 5. 5.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes of this Article follow, and</p>
                  <p>Firſt, diuers ſorts of men may hence be warned to looke to themſelues in many things, which perhaps they little thinke of; men muſt take heed of ſinning againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſeeing he is God, and ſo wonderfull in nature and works.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are either pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable or vnpardonable: There is one ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt cannot be forgiuen. The firſt ſort are grieuous, but yet may be repented of, and forgiuen; and thus men ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they liue without the Holy Ghoſt, as all wicked men doe that are not ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iude</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men acknowledge not the glory of the Holy Ghoſt, in aſcribing to him the praiſe of all thoſe skils or abilities they haue in any eſtate of life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men order their affaires without ſeeking counſell or direction from the Holy Ghoſt, by ſuch meanes as he hath appointed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When men will not giue eare or regard when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks vnto them in the miniſterie of his ſeruants, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20. 30.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When men deſpiſe the counſell which the Holy Ghoſt giues in the word, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When men are ſo far from regarding the word, that they doe purpoſely confirme their hearts, and ſtriue to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, like an Adamant, leſt they ſhould heare the word God ſends in his ſpirit by his Prophets, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When men openly rebell againſt the doctrine of Gods word, and ſet themſelues to vex the Spirit of God in their Teachers, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 10. Such were they of whom <hi>S. Stephen</hi>
                     <pb n="546" facs="tcp:14246:266"/>
ſaid, <hi>Yee reſist the Holy Ghoſt alwaies, Act.</hi> 7. 51.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When men tempt the Holy Ghoſt: and that is when they will doe ſuch things as they know are euill, and put it to the triall, whether they ſhall be puniſhed or diſcouered. Thus <hi>Ananias</hi> tempted the Holy Ghoſt that was in <hi>Peter,</hi> by lying and diſſembling, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. 5.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By receiuing the grace of the Spirit in vaine: and this is a ſinne in ſuch as haue beene inlightned, and haue had ſome common graces, yet fall away, and all comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in that no ſound reformation followes.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. By quenching the Spirit: and this may be committed by two ſorts of men. Firſt, by wicked men that haue temporarie gifts of the Spirit, with ſome ſpeciall taſtes of remorſe, or ioy, or of the powers of the life to come, and then fall away, and hauing begun in the Spirit will end in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. Secondly, godly men may for a time quench the Spirit, when after calling they fall into groſſe ſinnes, which will cauſe the Spirit to ceaſe working ſenſibly, and put out the ioy and life they finde in Gods ſeruice and preſence. There is another way of quenching the Spirit, and that is when the people carry themſelues ſo, as they diſcourage the ſpirit of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and make them leſſe willing, or able to preach in their wonted power and vigour.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when men grieue the Spirit of God, by whom they are ſealed to the day of their redemption: and this is a ſin the children of God are to be warned of, and this they may commit if they wilfully perſiſt in any knowne ſinne, either ſecretly, or in domeſticall cariage, or in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation abroad, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that may be forgiuen if men repent and beleeue in Chriſt: There is one ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that can neuer be pardoned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and 10. 26. 29. To finde out the exact nature of this ſinne is very hard, but vpon the euidence of thoſe three places of Scripture, I vndertake to define it thus.</p>
                  <p>The ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt that is vnpardonable,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:14246:266"/>
is a ſinne after illumination, and ſanctification, by which a man doth wilfully and wholly fall away, contemning the Goſpell, and doth deſpight the works of the power and grace of the Holy Ghoſt, without remorſe to the death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When I ſay the ſin vnpardonable, I exclude all the ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt named before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When I ſay a ſin after illumination and ſanctification, I exclude all the ſins of ſuch people as neuer had the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes of ſaluation, or neuer ſo as to worke a manifeſt change in them. The perſon that commits this ſin, muſt be ſuch a one as was before inlightned, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. and ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. that is ſuch a one as did attaine to diuers gifts which he had not before, which were wrought in him by the Holy Ghoſt, and had a taſte of the doctrine he heard, and of the powers of the life to come: but yet he was not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with any ſauing grace, or repentance from all ſinne, or effectuall relying vpon Ieſus Chriſt for his owne ſaluation. He had taſtes of many things, but did not ſoundly digeſt any thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When I ſay, he doth wilfully and wholly fall away, I meane diuers things. Firſt, that this ſin cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by ſuch as continue in the ſame manner they were in relation to Religion, it muſt haue apoſtacie in it. Secondly, it muſt be a wilfull apoſtacie, which is when a man falls into ſin not only againſt his knowledge, but without any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. and this excludes the ſins of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> Thirdly, I ſay, it muſt be a totall apoſtacie, not a falling into ſome one or two groſſe euils, but a falling away from reſpect of all parts of truth, that ſhould maſter his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or works, though he ſhew not all this openly; but in heart he is an Apoſtata from all grace. He doth as it were depoſe, or abrogate all the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When I ſay contemning the Goſpell, I meane two things. The one, that he doth loath that way of ſaluation by Chriſt; and the other, that he doth extremely ſcorne the meanes of publiſhing the Goſpell, that is effectuall to worke ſanctification in men, and that meanes which had before power to worke change in the partie himſelfe: both theſe
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:14246:267"/>
I take it are imported, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. He may brooke the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vſe of exerciſes of Religion ſtill, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, but not that meanes that hath power and life in it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I adde the word <hi>deſpight</hi> from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. to include the ſins of perſecuting and blaſpheming, and both out of deſperate malice, without any colour of cauſe, or meaſure of diſlike. This perſon is alwaies a knowne aduerſarie, and withall doth reproch godly perſons, and godlineſſe, but it is of wilfull malice, which excludes perſecuting or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that is done of ignorance: as in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When I adde the works of the Holy Ghoſt, I diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence this ſin from the blaſphemie that is againſt the nature or perſon of the Holy Ghoſt; for ſo it is no greater ſin than to blaſpheme the nature or perſon of the Father or Sonne: but it is the ſpeciall operation of the Holy Ghoſt, that is the obiect of this ſin; by which God comes more neere vnto man, than he is in nature or perſon.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I adde, works of power or grace: becauſe as vſually this ſin is committed by deſpighting the worke of grace in other true Chriſtians; ſo ſometimes alſo it is committed by deſpighting the works of power, as the miracles wrought by Chriſt were reproched by the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I adde, without remorſe, becauſe I thinke that he that commits this ſin is ſo far from being capable of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that it is impoſſible he ſhould get but that remorſe or repentance he had when he was firſt inlightned: So I take that place <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and ſo I thinke ſuch as haue any remorſe or deſpaire ariſing from the ſenſe of the greatneſſe of their ſins, cannot be guilty of this ſin:</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I adde, to the death, only to note, that this is that ſin, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the ſinne vnto death</hi> in a ſpeciall ſenſe Finall impenitencie in any ſin is vnto death, but then it hath not the deſcription going before: Nor doe I meane that it cannot be knowne till death, but that it will laſt vnto death, without returning from it.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſin is ſaid to be vnpardonable, not becauſe it is greater than Gods mercy or Chriſts merits, but becauſe God hath reſolued to ſhew his iuſtice vpon this ſin without
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14246:267"/>
mercy: and becauſe in that way of ſauing of men which God hath now reſolued vpon, all meanes of ſalustion are diſappointed to the vttermoſt, elſe if they could repent, God could forgiue: and this iuſtice of God may not ſeeme ſtrange, ſince he declares himſelfe willing to forgiue all ſins, and doth except but this one.</p>
                  <p>Now the explication of this ſin ſhould ſerue for a warning to ſuch heareres as haue had remorſes and illumination, and finde themſelues in many things changed; I ſay, they ſhould be warned to looke to themſelues, ſince this ſinne can be found in no other perſons: and to this end they ſhould take counſell in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now that they are neere the kingdome of God by theſe effects of the Holy Ghoſt in them, they ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to goe on, and neuer reſt till they attaine to ſound conuerſion and true ſauing grace; and that they will doe, if they humble themſelues before God for euery knowne ſinne, eſpecially thoſe ſins that haue beene moſt loued of them, or moſt rooted in nature: and ſecondly, if they will be at the paines to vſe all good meanes to get the particular aſſurance of Gods loue to them, for theſe two things were neuer found in any of thoſe that ſo fall away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My next counſell is, that they take heed of thoſe ſpeciall ſins that were in ſuch as at length grew faultie in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable ſin; that when they feele any of them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they make haſte to get out, leſt they proue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch as were in the Phariſees and others; theſe or the like, the forſaking of that meanes by which that inlightning was wrought, as the Phariſees did the miniſterie of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the conſtant affectation of the praiſe of men, more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>an the praiſe of God. Thirdly, habituall alienation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> heart from God and goodneſſe. Fourthly, wilfull euill practiſes without temptations. Fifthly, conſtant enuie at the gifts and praiſes of the godly. Sixthly, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſinterpretation of all that godly men doe, euen their beſt works; eſpecially if they be gone ſo far as to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:14246:268"/>
feele themſelues to bee tempted to fall into a courſe of open oppoſing and perſecuting of good men and good cauſes, if it bee poſſible let them breake off, and by ſpeedy repentance preuent the horrible miſchiefes they may fall into, leſt from theſe oppoſitions, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in them, they fall into malice, and deſpighting of the worke of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Vſe of Admonition. The Vſes for Inſtruction follow, and ſo the conſideration of this Article, ſhould teach all that haue care of their owne ſoule,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To examine themſelues whether they haue the Holy Ghoſt or not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. Now the Holy Ghoſt doth diſcouer himſelfe to be in the heart of a man by theſe ſignes, all or ſome of them. As firſt, by the combat it raiſeth in the heart againſt the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. if there be an internall worker within vs, that doth conſtantly oppoſe and ſtriue againſt the ſecret corruption that is in our nature, without doubt it is the Holy Ghoſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the taſte and ſauour it breeds in vs about ſpirituall things: for if the Holy Ghoſt be in a man, his taſte for earthly things is marred, and he hath a ſenſible taſte of the things of the Spirit, accounting nothing more ſauourie than holy things; ſuch as are the Word, Prayer, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, godly ſociety, and ſuch like, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. Thirdly, by the victory ouer the power of ſin: If the Holy Ghoſt be in vs, though we may haue ſin, yet we are freed from the law of ſin; our corruptions doe not rule and reigne as they were wont to doe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. The bodie is dead in reſpect of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. The Holy Ghoſt doth daily ſet vs a worke in killing of ſin, one after another as they ariſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. and this is done by the duties of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; thus we are waſhed in the teares of repentance by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. and this ſigne is the more cleare, when it reacheth not only to the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but to the ſins of the heart. It is an infallible ſigne of the Holy Ghoſt, if a man haue felt the circumciſion of the heart, that is, if he haue voluntarily implied himſelfe, in the painfull reſiſting and cutting off, of ſecret euill in the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:14246:268"/>
minde and affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. Fourthly, by that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is wrought in the hearing of the word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi> when a man doth not only heare with admiration, but findes himſelfe perſwaded, and preſently changed vnto that grace and holineſſe is taught him by the word, when he is ſent home another man. Fifthly, by the loue of God in affliction. It is a ſpeciall worke of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit of God, when a man can loue God, and ſhew it by the fruits of it, euen then when Gods hand is vpon him, eſpecially when croſſes doe beſet him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe him about: for that is a worke altogether aboue nature. This loue to God in aduerſitie hee ſhewes, by mourning for his ſpirituall abſence, by eſteeming any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his loue and fauour aboue all things in life, by delighting himſelfe in Gods houſe and preſence, by refuſing ſin, for the reſpect he beares to God, though it might bring him neuer ſo much pleaſure or profit, by his vexation for any diſhonour done to God, by his longing after Gods preſence in glory, and by his conſtant care to keepe Gods commandements. Sixthly, by the gift of prayer: when a Chriſtian is able in ſecret, with affection, and perſwaſion of God as his beſt refuge in heauen or earth, to make his daily recourſe to God vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt Vſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as finde they haue the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to carry themſelues as becommeth ſo great an honour done them, and ſhew it eſpecially three waies. Firſt, by ſtriuing to haue and keepe their ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cleane from ſinne, and to make the roomes of their heart as holy as they can for the entertainment of ſuch a diuine gueſt as the Holy Ghoſt. What a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe would there be about cleanſing and trimming of our houſes, if ſome great perſon were to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Secondly, we ſhould ſhew that we beleeue thoſe things taught vs concerning the Holy Ghoſt, by ſeeking to him vpon all occaſions, when we finde any need in any
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:14246:269"/>
thing that belongs to any of thoſe works of the Holy Ghoſt. But eſpecially we ſhould ſtriue not only to get thoſe great works of the holy Ghoſt wrought in our hearts, but alſo wee ſhould endeauour to ſhew the power of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Ghoſt in vs, by thoſe outward fruits of the holy Ghoſt: more eſpicially thoſe nine fruits men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. it would make a Chriſtian appeare to bee more excellent than any man, if hee can ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act thoſe vertues there mentioned, which hee may doe by the holy Ghoſt that is in him. And it were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable if men would ſtriue to act them, and to lay this patterne ſtill before them.</p>
                  <p>Now the things he ſhould expreſſe are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Loue: that is, a louing behauiour towards the godly, yea, towards all men: ſuch a behauiour as is without hatred, emulations, enuyings, cenſuring, and the like workes of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ioy: that is, ſuch a behauiour as expreſſeth contentment, and comfortableneſſe, both in our ſpirituall eſtate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, and in our outward condition in the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Peace: that is, ſuch a behauiour as is quiet from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with other mens buſineſſe, and is free from diſcord and contention, or ſedition, or hereſies, the workes of the fleſh mentioned before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Long ſuffering: that is, ſuch a behauiour as can beare with the infirmites of thoſe with whom hee conuerſeth, and that is not eaſily prouoked by ſlight iniuries, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by, or pardoneth many a wrong.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Gentleneſſe: which is, when a man is eaſie to be ſpoken to in any buſineſſe, without ſowreneſſe, or pride, or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and doth treat with others in a quiet and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Goodneſſe: that is, ſuch a behauiour as is full of good fruits of mercy, when a Chriſtian doth ſtriue to become as helpfull and as profitable as poſſible he may to all ſorts of people where he liueth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Faith: that is, fidelity, when a man is iuſt in his words
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14246:269"/>
and promiſes, that hee may bee truſted as ſafely as if men had his bonds or obligations; and withall, doth deteſt lying and deceit, and all courſes of fraud and guile.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Meekneſſe: which conſiſts in the ſuppreſſing of anger, and inward perturbations which ariſe from frowardneſs, and diſcontentment: when a man can ſhew himſelfe to be able to beare croſſes or prouocations, without paſſion or worldly diſtempers.</p>

                  <p>When I enquire what the Church is, I meane, the true Church, for the falſe Church is no Church properly, as an ill Gramarian is no Gramarian properly.</p>
                  <p>Now to finde out what the Church is, we muſt firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the acceptation of the word, and then of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> was a word in vſe among the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and came of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> it were by name, or in their rankes by the voice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Crier, to heare ſome ſpeech or ſentence of the <hi>Senate</hi> and was thence borrowed by the Apoſtles for their purpoſes, by way of ſimilitude: The Church or aſſembly of Gods people, being a company that came together, not by chance, or without order, but by the voice of Gods Miniſters, as it were Criers, called out of the Kingdome of <hi>Sathan,</hi> to heare the doctrine of the Goſpell reuealed from heauen. The common people in common ſpeech, call the places ſet apart for the exerciſes of Religion, Churches. But ſo it is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here. In Scripture the word hath diuers acceptations, for ſometimes it ſignified, the aſſembly of the men of the world for their owne buſineſſes; and ſo that tumultuous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:14246:271"/>
of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> was called a Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17. Sometime it ſignified the Aſſembly of the enemies of Gods people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 5. this was the malignant Church. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignified the meeting of a few Chriſtians in a family, for religious priuate duties, ſo there were Churches in godly mens houſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. Sometimes it ſignified a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men in one Citie or Prouince, that did outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the true religion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. 22. and ſo vſually in the writings of Diuines, the company throughout the world ſo profeſſing, is called the viſible Church: and in this ſenſe there may bee hypocrits and ſcandalous Chriſtians in the Church as well as godly men, as the Parable of the Tares and the Draw-net ſhew. But ſo it is not taken in the <hi>Creed,</hi> for beſides that this Church is holy, as theſe wicked are not, and enioyeth remiſſion of ſins which they doe not, beſides this, I ſay, we are ſaid in the <hi>Creed</hi> to beleeue this Church to be, which argues, that in it ſelfe it is inuiſible and knowne to God, and cannot bee diſcerned by outward ſenſes in the eſſentiall things of it. Sometimes by the Church is meant the publike Officers in the Church, that haue power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and cenſure, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. but in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, by the Church in the new Teſtament is ſignified the number of Gods Elect onely, conſidered as they are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by the Goſpell, and doe cleaue vnto Chriſt their head by a true and liuely faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the <hi>Etimologie</hi> of the word. The definition of the Church followeth.</p>
                  <p>The Church here meant in the <hi>Creed,</hi> is a company of men dwelling euery where, effectually called, ordinarily by the voice of Gods Criers, from the miſery and prophaneſſe of the world, to the ſupernaturall dignitie of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being vnited vnto Chriſt as their head by Faith, and among then ſelues by loue as fellow-members.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words the generall nature of the Church is to bee conſidered, and then the ſpeciall difference of the Church from all other companies or profeſſions, or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of men.</p>
                  <p>The generall nature is expreſſed in theſe words. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:14246:272"/>
of men dwelling euery where: where diuers things are to be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a company, not one man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is of men as the materiall cauſe, not of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for none but reaſonable creatures are capable of Gods Image, and ſo none but they can make a Church: and among reaſonable creatures, I exclude Angels, though they had a kinde of calling to that excellent eſtate they are in, yet the Scripture ſpeakes ſo ſparingly of it, that we cannot tell how to define it, and therefore I meddle not with it: and beſides, the Church is here conſidered as it is purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, which Angels were not, neither are they tyed to the miniſtery of the Word, as the Church in her calling is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I adde, dwelling euery where, to note that I define the Church, that is Catholicke, as the <hi>Creed</hi> calls it: which tearms in the moſt euident ſenſe agree to the Church now vnder the Goſpell, ſince the partition wall between <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> was broken downe: and yet in ſome ſenſe it may agree to the Church from the beginining: for euen in the time of the Iewiſh Church, the Nations were not ſimply barred from fellowſhip with the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of three ſorts of people that belonged to the Iewiſh Church, to wit, the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelues and <hi>Proſelites,</hi> that is <hi>Gentiles</hi> that profeſſed the Iewiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were circumciſed, and withall religious or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute men, that were <hi>Gentiles</hi> conuerted to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but were not circumciſed, ſuch as were <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and diuers others.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall nature of the Church, in which it differs from all other companies of men, is expreſt in the other wordes of the definition, and ſo they ſhew vs three things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The efficient cauſe of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> her calling by the voice of Gods Cryer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The tearmes from which, and to which ſhe is called: in the middle words of the definition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me of the Church, which conſiſts in her vnion
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:14246:272"/>
with Chriſt, and communion with her ſelfe among the members of that company: For the firſt, when I ſay, ſhe is called ordinarily by the voice of Gods Cryers, I intimate diuers things thereby:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Preachers of the Goſpell are as publike Criers to call men, to heare what God hath to ſay to them, like thoſe Cryers in <hi>Athens,</hi> of whom I ſpake before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 48. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That I conſider not of the Church as ſhe is elect of God, till ſhee be called, becauſe many of the Elect for a great part of their liues may lie ſcattered about, and hidden in the heapes of the men of this world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the preaching of the Goſpell is the meanes to make men actually of the Church, and members of Chriſt, and ſo to haue right to ſaluation: <hi>The Goſpell is the power of God to ſaluation, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. and 10. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I adde, effectually called, to exclude Hypocrites and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men that enioy the meanes, but obey it not, and to include the worke of the Holy Ghoſt, making the hearts of the Elect to anſwer to Gods call, and obey his voice: for by the Spirit God ſpeakes alſo internally to their hearts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I adde, the Word ordinarily, to ſhew that though God is pleaſed to binde men to the vſe of the meanes, yet he himſelfe is not tied, but can worke without the meanes: and ſo it may giue vs occaſion to informe our ſelues in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers caſes: as firſt, in the caſe of ſuch, as liue in places where the meanes is not, nor can be had. It is poſſible that God extraordinarily may worke conuerſion in ſome men in ſuch places; which was the caſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> liuing in <hi>Caeſarea, Act.</hi> 10. Secondly, in the caſe of Infants, who do belong to the Church by vertue of Gods Couenant, though they liue not to receiue conuerſion by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell; for Chriſt ſaith of Infants, <hi>Theirs is the kingdome of God.</hi> Thirdly, in the caſe of ſuch as liue in Paganiſh and idolatrous places, as in the times of the darkneſſe of Popery, or in the caſe, where men are by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence carried away and brought vp in idolatrous places;
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:14246:273"/>
God may haue a remnant amongſt them, that belong to his election, and are in time truly called; as in the daies of <hi>Elias,</hi> in the kingdome of the ten Tribes vnder the reigne of <hi>Ahab.</hi> Fourthly, in the caſe of ſuch as are borne deafe, or become ſo before they are capable of receiuing the Goſpell, they being borne of godly parents, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church as Infants do: I ſay, God that knowes his owne from eternitie, may euen amongſt them, by the ſupply of the Spirit, make members of the Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt doth not need ſpeciall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to worke withall; ſometimes he may worke that by the eyes of the deafe, which he doth by the eares of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for by their eyes he may powre in an eternall light into their mindes. Laſtly, the caſe of ſuch as are deſtitute of vnderſtanding by nature, or diſeaſe, is very hard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want reaſon, and ſo are incapable of faith: and if we ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt may infuſe an inward light, then it is cleare they ceaſe to be fooles or mad-men: In this caſe therefore we muſt religiouſly and charitably ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and leaue Gods worke to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The termes from which, and to which, the Church is called, follow in theſe words, from the prophaneneſſe of the world, to enioy the ſupernaturall dignitie of the children of God. The terme from which, <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> is from the prophaneneſſe of the world; in which words, three things may be noted. Firſt, that the true members of the Church were in their eſtate of Nature as prophane as the people of the world, liuing in ſin, and being the children of wrath as well as others: which ſhew the exceeding riches of Gods grace, and Chriſts loue to them, that could reſpect them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vile and ſinfull. Secondly, that our firſt parents before the fall, could not properly be ſaid to be the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neither were called from an eſtate of corruption, nor did they then need Chriſt, nor had that faith in Chriſt, being perfect by creation, and ſo not wanting a Sauiour; whereas the Church is properly the Spouſe of Chriſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by theſe words all men in viſible Churches may trie themſelues, for only they that are conuerted from prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:14246:273"/>
are true members of the Church; and ſo Hypocrites are excluded, and open prophane perſons, and ſuch as are only changed in their opinions, and not in their practiſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or the terme to which they are called, is to the ſupernaturall dignity of the ſons of God, which words expreſſe the grace of Adoption, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the ſubſtance of all that felicity we haue from God in Chriſt after calling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. but of the priuiledges of the Church afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The laſt words of the definition deſcribes the forme of the Church, the eſſentiall inward forme, which is that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt by faith: they are really members of the Church, that are vnited to Chriſt, as their head by faith: without this faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; and faith comprehends all that, which eſſentially God requires of vs to iuſtification and adoption, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. I adde their vnion one with another by loue, becauſe brotherly loue is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable fruit of faith, for <hi>faith worketh by loue, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and is ſuch a Characteriſticall ſigne of a true member of the Church, that the Apoſtle ſaith, thereby <hi>we know we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life, becauſe we loue the brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. and the ſame Apoſtle ſeemes to make Loue a kinde of forme of the true Chriſtian, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the definition of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The originall of the Church followes next to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſo I conſider of the Church, as ſhe is the Church, not as theſe men were in their eſtate of Nature, for ſo her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and her mother an <hi>Hittite,</hi> in as much as ſhe was ſinfully borne, ſhe was baſely borne: but that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that I call the Church, were not the Church, when they were in that eſtate of Nature. The Church then as ſhee is the Spouſe of Chriſt, hath many things in her originall that are very glorious, and much to be admired: And that if we conſider her originall, in reſpect of decree, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of her birth, and in reſpect of her preſeruation: Firſt, her Originall in reſpect of decree is wonderfull, becauſe ſhe is vpon record from euerlaſting, the names of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:14246:274"/>
of the Church are particularly written in the booke of life. God made an act for her being and aduancement, before ſhe was, he prouided for her from euerlaſting, and choſe her in his euerlaſting grace and loue; and this is her originall before time. In time ſhee was in ſuch bondage and miſery, that ſhe muſt of neceſſity be redeemed and purchaſed out of that vile condition: and this purchaſe is the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if we conſider either the perſon by whom, or the price by which. The Perſon that redeemed her, was no leſſe than the Son of God; and the price he paid, was his owne bloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Her originall in reſpect of her Birth, is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange and wonderfull: For firſt, ſhe is borne of God, not of the blouds of men, nor of the will of man, but as of God by regeneration, fearfully and wonderfully made. The world neuer heard of two ſtranger things, than the generation of Chriſt, and the regeneration of the Church; of Chriſt, as the Son of God; of the Church, as it were the daughter of God. Secondly, ſhe is borne of immortall ſeed, ſhee is ſo indued with life, that ſhe can neuer die, but liue as long as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. And that ſeed is the word of God preached to her, which makes her all new, God hauing choſen a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men of purpoſe, and ſeparated them by a holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to this Miniſtration, euen to ſow this ſeed of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eternall life in mens mindes. Thirdly, in her birth, by the mightie working of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe is qualified with ſupernaturall gifts, ſuch as no other of the children of men can attaine vnto; ſuch as are faith, and all the gifts of holineſſe &amp; ſauing grace. Fourthly, the originall of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation alſo is as wonderfull: for her preſeruation, ſhe hath from Chriſt her head, that doth that for the Church which any naturall head can doe for the bodie: This company of men can no more ſubſiſt without a head, than the naturall or politicall body can. It was a law of the Creator, that all bodies ſhould liue by their heads, in reſpect of gouernment, nouriſhment, and dependance: Now the Church hath great cauſe to reioyce in her Head: becauſe, firſt, hee is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Head that liues in all ages to gouerne and nouriſh the Church, ſpirituall life being kept afoot in euery age
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:14246:274"/>
from the beginning of the world till now: If the Church had a new Head in euery age, then muſt ſhee die as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as her Head dieth, and be made aliue as often as ſhee hath a new Head: Her Head therefore is alwaies one and the ſame.</p>
