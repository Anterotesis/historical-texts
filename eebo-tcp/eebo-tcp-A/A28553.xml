         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is too well knowne to you,
how for no leſſe then foure
or five yeares, (by the just
hand of God upon me for
my many Sins; and, perhaps, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
for my preſumption upon my power
over my paſſions, and my phancy; which
I have most prefidently expreſſed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
my friends bade me beware, how
I yeelded to them) I have been in a
manner buried alive in melancholy, and
<pb facs="tcp:57664:3"/>
ſpent my dayes <hi>in vanity.</hi> My diſtemper
was ſuch, as did not onely render me
indispoſed, by ſtudy to gather more
knowledge then I had before, (being not
able for whole moneths together, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelfe to take a booke in hand;
and for ſeverall yeares, if I had read any
thing, to tell you what I had read:) But
alſo made me to looſe a very great part
of that which I had already gathered.
And therefore I doubt not, but my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and Country men, what ever
they may think, and ſay too, ſometimes,
againſt mee for <hi>idleneſſe:</hi> yet after a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few ſerious thoughts, doe abundantly
excuſe me. It is true, It was one of thoſe
things, which in my melancholy, my deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſpirit dwelt longeſt upon, that I <hi>had
done God, and my brethren no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
having lived ſo long.</hi> But after a
<pb facs="tcp:57664:3"/>
yeare or two, It pleaſed the Lord (who, I
cannot ſay, did ever <hi>hide himſelfe</hi> in my
trouble, or <hi>deſpiſe</hi> my affliction; but was
ready to <hi>know</hi> me in all my adverſity)
to ſet me in a way, wherein I might ſpend
my time better, and paſſe thorow with
more eaſe, ſome of the reſt of thoſe <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome</hi>
dayes, which he had <hi>appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
for me. He gave me a ſubject to
meditate upon (wherein he dealt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
with my distemper, as well in
the employment, as the ſubject: being
fitter for meditation, then reading)
<hi>The Mirth of a Chriſtian Life,</hi> (in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to thoſe who diſparage it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of melancholy &amp; ſadnes.) VVhich
accordingly I undertooke, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my meditations (ſuch as they were)
to paper. VVhen ſome yeares were paſt:
you may remember, that the laſt winter,
<pb facs="tcp:57664:4"/>
you told me in your letter, that my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſired much to ſee thoſe meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
printed. I reſolved, conſidering the
ſickly condition ſhe was then in, thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
they were never ſo unworthy the publike
view, to ſatisfie her deſire. But before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
had ſet upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the buſines, it thus happened.
Being in a Bookſellers ſhop, and looking
upon a treatiſe of God's Promiſes;
I asked the Bookeſeller, whether he
knew of any Treatiſe of his <hi>Threats</hi>
Being anſwered (contrary to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation)
that he knew of none; I was
the more earneſt to inquire further. And
ſo I did; but could heare of none. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I told my Bookeſeller, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
forthwith to read over the Bible,
and make a collection of them my ſelfe;
and, if it pleaſed God to incourage me in
it, to print them. Now the Lord did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me, and that exceedingly (as I
<pb facs="tcp:57664:4"/>
ſhall ſhew you in my preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;)
ſo that I have finiſhed my worke
<hi>quickly,</hi> and brought you <hi>ſavory
meat,</hi> ſuch as, I hope, you love. You had
had it long ſince, had it not been longer in
the Printers hands, then it was in mine
owne. But I hope it is not too late now. I
had another reaſon, beſides naturall and
civill obligation, why I choſe to dedicate
this booke to your ſelfe. And that was
this, viz. becauſe I conceived the contents
of it more proper for your family, then
for any that I knew; in regard we have
had more mercies then other families, and
as I feare, have abuſed them to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The truth is, a booke of this nature is
very proper for the <hi>whole Nation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there have beene ſo many <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of God in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and in our
owne Land; and yet we have not learned
<pb facs="tcp:57664:5"/>
righteouſneſse. The Lord grant, that as
many as yet <hi>remaine,</hi> may <hi>heare</hi> and
<hi>feare,</hi> and may <hi>henceforth commit no
more ſuch evils,</hi> as they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
But I have held you too long.
And therefore I will conclude, with
this humble requeſt, that as often as you
meet with any faylings in this booke, you
will beare with them in that manner, as
you have been wont to beare with them
in the authour: ſo as never the leſſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ive me leave to ſhew thee,
what courſe I tooke in
Compoſing this Booke. It
was in very little more
then a fortnight's time,
that by the help of God I
read the Bible over: and reduced every
thing that I obſerved, to a certaine head,
in Alphabeticall order. After this, I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
every place of Scripture, by the
Originall, and the moſt noted Tranſlations.
Some few Texts, beſides thoſe which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
my ſelfe, I met with afterwards in
other Bookes. Thoſe bookes I knew not of
before I had done reading the Bible. Which
I much rejoyced for; both becauſe of other
things, which in reading I took in, together
with thoſe that were for this purpoſe: and
becauſe of the abundance of time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which I ſhould have ſpent, in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
quotations; which are uſually heaped
up without choyce, or judgement. It coſt
me not a little pain, to examine only thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:57664:6"/>
Texts, which they had, and I had not: out
of feare, leſt they had been apply'd to a
wrong head, (a thing too ordinary in moſt
Common place bookes.) But before I goe
any further, now I have ſpoken of <hi>paine,</hi>
give me leave to tell thee of (that, which I
tooke abundance of comfort in, and which
I may not conceale) the marvellous encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
which it pleaſed God to afford
me all along in this worke. Whereas ever
ſince my ſickneſſe, I have not been able to
read above a quarter of an houre at a
time, without a great deale of <hi>wearineſſe</hi>
and <hi>paine:</hi> In reading the Scriptures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I read the ſame places ten times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I was, I know not how, ſupplyed with
a conſtant delight in what I did, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to goe further. If at any time I was
weary, (as ſometimes I was quite tired,
through infirmities of body, and want of
ſpirits:) as ſoone as I had but turned aſide,
but a few minutes, I found a ſudden ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of deſire to follow my buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as freſh as ever. Thus it was moſt
commonly, when I was thus weary. and
when it was not ſo, and I had noe appetite
at all to the buſineſſe: If I did but once take
my bible in hand, to try how it would be
then, and read a line, or two; I preſently
<pb facs="tcp:57664:6"/>
recovered my appetite againe; as bodies fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with winde uſe to get a ſtomack by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And theſe things I looke upon as
great encouragements. whereunto I adde
the <hi>health</hi> which I had, all the while I was
doing this thing, better then I had theſe
many yeares; yea though I uſed no exerciſe,
or recreation. But <hi>à diuerticulo,</hi> to ſhew thee
in what manner I have done every thing.</p>
            <p>1 I have produced onely thoſe texts,
wherein mention is made, either of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<hi>inflicted,</hi> or <hi>threatned</hi> for a ſinne,
wherewith <hi>God</hi> puniſheth it; or of an <hi>evill
fruit,</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of it, whereby it puniſheth
it ſelfe. The <hi>Attendants</hi> and <hi>Conſequents</hi>
of it, I meddle not with, except ſuch as are
neceſſary, or ordinary, and whereof there
are ſeverall examples alſo in Scripture.</p>
            <p>2 In the titles of the chapters, when the
chapters ſpeake only of puniſhments <hi>threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened;</hi>
I have written, <hi>Threatened.</hi> VVhen of
puniſhments <hi>Inflicted,</hi> or of fruites and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
<hi>puniſhed,</hi> (or, <hi>have cauſe to fear.</hi>) When
of both; <hi>Threatened,</hi> and <hi>puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 The <hi>ſubject</hi> threatned or puniſhed,
for the moſt part I make the <hi>Sinne;</hi> but
ſometimes the <hi>Sinner</hi> (as <hi>Proud men</hi> &amp;c: viz:)
when the puniſhments mentioned were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
inflicted upon ſuch a <hi>ſinner;</hi> but of
<pb facs="tcp:57664:7"/>
ſome of them, it is not ſo particulary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
that they were inflicted <hi>for that
Sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Sometimes I ſeeme to repeat one
title twice: as in <hi>Oppreſſion, Oathes,</hi> &amp;c.
And <hi>my</hi> reaſon is, Becauſe I find Scriptures
ſpeaking ſometimes in generall againſt
Oppreſſion, and ſometimes but particularly
of only ſuch and ſuch oppreſſion, and I
would not willingly <hi>miſſapply</hi> any threat.</p>
            <p>5 In the Concluſion of many chapters,
after I have ſhewed, what is <hi>expreſſed</hi> in
Scripture, concerning puniſhments; I doe
ſhew you what may be <hi>gathered from</hi> the
Scripture, concerning the <hi>odiouſneſſe,</hi> or
concerning the <hi>danger</hi> of it: either by the
<hi>names</hi> that are given it, or the <hi>manner</hi> that
the Scriptures ſpeake of it. And ſometimes
I ſhew you, what may be conjectured from
the <hi>nature</hi> of the ſinne: or from <hi>compariſon</hi>
of the like things among <hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 Some more notable <hi>threats,</hi> and <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,</hi>
as <hi>Being left to our ſelves</hi> &amp;c. I
have inſerted, although the <hi>cauſe</hi> be not
mentioned: as taking them to be of uſe alſo,
as well as the reſt. not onely becauſe the
greateſt ſort of puniſhments may be the
juſt reward of the leaſt ſinne: but becauſe
reading of ſuch a fearefull puniſhment,
<pb facs="tcp:57664:7"/>
without finding for what ſinne it was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
may make men wary of committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſinne, for feare of committing that.</p>
            <p>7 Some <hi>prophecies</hi> of <hi>ſinnes,</hi> as Apoſtaſie
&amp;c. I have inſerted for <hi>Threats:</hi> becauſe
thoſe ſinnes are puniſhments too, as well as
ſinnes; and are ſo ſpoken of, viz. in a threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
manner: and becauſe there can be no
greater puniſhment, then to be left to the
Commiſſion of them.</p>
            <p>8 In ſetting downe the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I have not followed the order of the
<hi>Bible,</hi> but of the <hi>puniſhments;</hi> placing them
after God's method of mercy, from leſſe to
greater. But in mentioning the ſins, where
there are ſeverall titles under one ſubject,
(as in Miniſters, Parents, &amp;c.) I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the contrary order, the leſſe after the
greater: the more to ſet forth the worth
of that Subject, and the greatnſſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
due to it.</p>
            <p>Having in this manner digeſted my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
I intended ſo to print them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying any thing my ſelfe upon any
place of Scripture: till by the perſwaſion
of a friend, whom I very much eſteemed,
I was induced to the contrary. But I muſt
earneſtly entreat thee, to beare with my
weakneſſe, whenſoever thou diſcovereſt
it. And if upon any ſubject, I have ſuffered
<pb facs="tcp:57664:8"/>
my pen to run on too far (as in the chapters
of Covetouſneſſe. Company-keeping. Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
&amp;c,) beare with that too. And if
thou haſt not the patience to read thorow;
paſſe to the next Chapter, and be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.
And ſo likewiſe doe, when thou
meeteſt with any <hi>criticall obſervations</hi> on the
<hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew:</hi> if thou doſt not like them
or canſt not underſtand them; yet keep the
book ſtill in thy hand, and paſſe on to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things. I ſpeake in this manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know how unwilling men are to
read of <hi>threats,</hi> and <hi>puniſhments:</hi> and how
forward, and ſawcy they are to catch at the
<hi>promiſes.</hi> I ſhall deſire thee likewiſe, when
thou meeteſt with any thing that doth not
ſatisfie thee, or like thee; to ſuſpend thy
judgement, till thou haſt read the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will but wipe off an aſperſion or
two, &amp; then diſmiſſe thee. The firſt is, that
I was too bold, to venture abroad ſo young;
unleſſe I had more learning and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And I confeſſe, this was once my
owne objection to my ſelfe. But I thought
it ſufficently anſwered by replying, It
was not I, that went abroad ſo much, as the
Scriptures; or I, and the Scriptures before
me. The ſecond aſperſion is, that I was
<pb facs="tcp:57664:8"/>
too haſty in printing a thing ſo ſuddenly
attempted, and performed in ſo little time;
as is declared in the former Epiſtle. To
this I anſwer 1 That there was not ſo
much need of longer time; moſt of the book
being Scripture, and not mine owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2 I thought upon the want of a
booke of this nature, and the uſefulneſſe of
it. 3 I underſtood, at every opportunity of
hearing from my friends, their earneſt deſire
of ſeeing what I had done. 4 I thought
that although I had made ſuch haſt, yet I
might boldly ſay, there would be found
but litle ſigne of it. perhaps, thou wilt meet
with ſome overſights in the printing: but
not many materiall; and thoſe I have affixed
to the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 I though upon the<note n="*" place="margin">Cic, lih. de clar. orator.</note> ſaying, <hi>Nihil eſt
inventum ſimul &amp; perfectum,</hi> that never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing was perfect at the firſt, though
there were never ſo much time ſpent about
it. Well, I weigh not to cenſures. So ten
may read me, I will give a hundred leave
to cenſure me. Under a good Conſcience, I
care not what it coſt me to convert a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
My prayer to God is, that he would
incline thy heart to read the judgments of
God written in his book: &amp; when thou haſt
done to humble thy ſelfe under his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:57664:9"/>
hand, that ſo he may exalt the main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

touching this <hi>name,</hi> (according to their

the complaint of our <hi>Saviour</hi> Matt. 15. 6.)
they came at length to make the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment

held it that if a man curſed his father or

not to <hi>ſuffer Death,</hi> (as the Law preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,

To ſay a little more yet, (now that I have
gone <hi>thus farre;</hi> and becauſe that I have
ſaid that allready which neceſſarily <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,</hi>
I ſhould ſay a little more) They
called the name <hi>Jehovah, Shem hamphoraſh,</hi>

all the reſt. The <hi>ſecond</hi> end which I had

was (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, he would do to <hi>them</hi> by

that I might <gap reason="foreign">

but to give him <hi>no more</hi> if he take it. If a
friend, or a ſervant having done ſuch a

for ſatisfaction. If a child take a glittering

which is <hi>more ſtrange</hi> yet) it is ſaid, verſe 3.
of the ſame chapter, that the FEARE <hi>of

apprehend our Saviour, <hi>Aſſoone as he ſaid

they in great feare, where no feare was</hi> Pſal.

largely of God's way of puniſhing his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with <hi>fearfulneſſe:</hi> but I will onely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre</hi>
you to theſe three, which you may
read at your leaſure: viz. <hi>Iſa</hi> 19, 17. <hi>Mic.
17, 17. Zach. 12, 2. 2 Chr.</hi> 14, 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Strange Sottiſhneſſe, and want

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57664:88"/>
Sixthly, <hi>Strange Deluſion:</hi> as 1 By
<hi>Sights.</hi> Thus the <hi>Moabites,</hi> that fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Jehoram,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
For, the <hi>water</hi> (wherewith the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
in which the Iſraelites lay, was fiilled
<hi>without wind</hi> or <hi>raine</hi> 2 Kings 3, 17.) by
reaſon of the Sun ſhining upon it in that
morning, ſeemed to them to be <hi>bloudy;</hi>
(verſ. 22, 23.) which made them to thinke
they had ſlaine one another, and ſo runne
thither with confidence to take the ſpoyle.
But the Iſraelites <hi>roſe up,</hi> and <hi>ſmote the
Moabites, and they fled before them</hi> v. 24.
And thus the <hi>Midianites</hi> were deceived by
the <hi>pitchers with Lamps in them</hi> which <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi>
and his <hi>three hundred men</hi> brake in

7, 21. 2 By <hi>Reports;</hi> thus the <hi>Syrians</hi>
were deceived, at the ſiege of <hi>Samaria</hi>
(when <hi>Joram</hi> was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) For, <hi>the
Lord made the hoſt of the Syrians to heare a
noyſe of Chariots, and a noiſe of horſes, even
the noiſe of a great hoſt: and they ſaid one to
another, Lo, the King of Iſrael hath hired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us the Kings of the Hittites, and the
Kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
Wherefore they aroſe, and fled in the twilight,
and left their tents, and their horſes, and their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57664:88"/>
aſſes, and the camp as it was, and fled for
their life</hi> 2 Kings 7, 6, 7. And likewiſe
the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
(when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi>) for

2 Kings 19, 7.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second way,</hi> wherein <hi>the hand of God is
notoriously ſeen</hi> in the puniſhing of the <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church,</hi> is, When he <hi>produces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall
effects</hi> upon their <hi>Bodies:</hi> ſuch as
1 <hi>Blindneſſe:</hi> So the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,

that they could not <hi>find the doore</hi>
Gen: 19, 11. And ſo the <hi>Syrians,</hi> upon the
prayer of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> at Dothan; (whither they
were ſent by the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him) inſomuch that, promiſing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them to the man whom they ſought, he
led them quite home into <hi>Samaria</hi> 2 King 6,
19: 2 <hi>Diſeaſes:</hi> So the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were
puniſhed with <hi>Boyles,</hi> Ex 9. The <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
with <hi>Emrods</hi> 1 Sam: 5. <hi>Gog,</hi> &amp; his men, have

the firſt borne</hi> in the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> were

<hi>brethren of his Father's houſe that were better
then him ſelfe</hi> 2 Chr: 21, 13.) died of ſuch
a diſeaſe in his bowels, that his bowells fell
out verſe 15. Hitherto may be reduc'd that
<hi>Deep Sleep from the Lord,</hi> which fell upon
thoſe that were with <hi>Saul</hi> 1 Sam: 26, 12.
(inſomuch that <hi>David</hi> took away his
<hi>Speare,</hi> and <hi>his Cruſe of water,</hi> cloſe by his

it) <hi>Sometimes</hi> by the hand of <hi>men;</hi> but in
ſuch a manner, as that the hand of <hi>God</hi> may

               <p>Either, when it is done by <hi>thoſe whom

2 Kings 9, 33.</p>
               <p>Or, when it is done by <hi>thoſe, to whom

Dan: 6, 24.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that I think, for the moſt part,
what Abigail<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 25, 29.</note> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>his</hi> enemies,
may be as truly ſaid to <hi>any</hi> of the Children
of God: of <hi>theirs, The ſoules of thine enemies,
them ſhall he ſling out, as out of the midle of a

               <p>A THIRD way, wherein the <hi>hand of
God,</hi> more <hi>notoriouſly appeares</hi> in puniſhing
the <hi>Enemies of his children,</hi> is, when he <hi>makes

Eccleſ: 5, 6. and likewiſe Acts 12, 15. for
there it is ſaid, that, when <hi>Peter</hi> knocked

<hi>Peter himſelfe,</hi> (whom they knew to be in

which they ſeem to have ſpoken in ſuch a
manner (not uſing many wordes; for they
might have ſaid, <hi>it is an Angel ſent from God
about ſome buſineſſe concerning him</hi>) as if it
were a thing then commonly believ'd, and
knowne by experience, for <hi>God's Children</hi>
to have <hi>Angels</hi> for their <hi>Guardians.</hi> But
(to ſay more yet) <hi>God's Children</hi> have not
only each of them <hi>his Angel</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> had)

an <hi>army</hi> of <hi>Angels:</hi> ſuch as <hi>Jacob</hi> had for his

in his way homewards from <hi>Haran</hi> Gen:
32, 2: And ſuch as ('tis likely) <hi>Eliſha</hi> had for
<hi>his,</hi> when an army of men was ſent by the
King of the Syrians to take him. for when
his Servant began to be afraid of the <hi>many
horſes,</hi> and <hi>Chariots,</hi> which he ſaw of the
Syrians; it is ſaid, that, upon <hi>Eliſha's prayer,
the Lord opened the eyes of the young man</hi> (ſo
it is God muſt <hi>open our eyes</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> before
we can ſee the <hi>helpe</hi> which he hath laid for
us, upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is mighty to ſave)
and he ſaw, and behold the mountaine was full
of horſes and Chariots of fire round about Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha.</hi>
So that for horſes and Chariots <hi>againſt
him,</hi> there are horſes and Chariots <hi>for him,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

One is in <hi>Matthew,</hi> where mention is not

a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and
that he were drowned in the middeſt of the Sea</hi>
Mat. 18. 6. The other is in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where God
calls the <hi>ſlaughter</hi> of their <hi>enemies,</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
(as he does alſo elſwhere, viz: Jer: 46, 10.

<hi>So will I break down the wall that ye have

downe to the ground, ſo that the foundation

ye ſhall bee conſumed in the midſt thereof; and
ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi> So that
they ſhall die ſuddenly, as with the fall of a
wall: or if they died not when the wall fell,
they ſhould not live long after. In the ninth
verſe they are thus threatned; <hi>And my hand
ſhall bee upon the Prophets that ſee vanity, and
divine lies: They ſhall not be in the aſſembly
of my people, neither ſhall they be written in
the writing of the houſe of Iſrael, neither ſhall
they enter into the Land of Iſrael, and ye ſhall
know that I am the Lord God.</hi> For whether
by being <hi>written in the writing of the houſe

to Canaan out of Babylon (as God
ſeemes to have had a <hi>booke</hi> of thoſe who
ſhould <hi>enter</hi> into it, in the time of Moſes

written <hi>afterward by men,</hi> among thoſe
who <hi>did</hi> return again out of <hi>Babylon</hi> (as you

when they came out of Egypt Num: 2.) or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57664:104"/>
whether ſomewhat more then ſo, be meant
in thoſe words, I know not: but it is cleare
by the words following (which it may be

Prophets, who bare the people in hand,
there would be <hi>no captivity,</hi> ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi>

                     <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>
even in his time, <hi>many falſe Prophets were
gone out into the world,</hi> 1 Epiſt 4. 1. (<hi>gone
out,</hi> like Foxes out of their holes to make a
prey of the Soules of men.) and therefore
he bids them not believe <hi>every ſpirit, but try
the ſpirits, whether they are of God,</hi> as it is in
the ſame verſe <hi>Every ſpirit</hi>] For a <hi>ſpirit</hi>
they will all pretend, and a <hi>spirit</hi> is all they
do pretend. A <hi>ſpirit</hi> it is that moves the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
it is an <hi>uncleane ſpirit;</hi> and therefore let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
take heed how they miſcall it, and ſo <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme</hi>
againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after our Saviour had reproved the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57664:105"/>
Phariſees, for ſaying he did <hi>caſt out divells
by the prince of the divells</hi> (wheras he doth
it by the Spirit of God) that he added theſe
wordes, <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner
of ſinne and blaſphemy, it ſhall be forgiven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi>

againſt it, as well to ſay, that <hi>the ſpirit
of the divell</hi> is <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> as to ſay <hi>the
Spirit of God</hi> is <hi>the ſpirit of the divell;</hi> or to
ſay, that what is done by one, is done by the
other. Nay, methink, it brings <hi>more diſgrace</hi>
(or <hi>blaſphemy</hi>) upon the <hi>Spirit:</hi> becauſe all
thoſe wicked actions, which ſuch men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
will be ſaid to proceed from that <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
which they pretended. I am ſure, if <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

<hi>Ruth</hi> a Moabite-woman, was married to
<hi>Boaz</hi> an Iſraelite man<note n="*" place="margin">Ruth 4.</note>, and that with the
Conſent <hi>of the Elders,</hi> and <hi>all the people that

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note>, To which they might adde
alſo this, for a confirmation of their opinion
viz: that it was the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the Iſraelites,
to marry with their <hi>women;</hi> (as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> complaint only of

when it was not ſuffered to be with the <hi>men
Jud:</hi> 21. 16, 18.) and that chiefly (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
upon theſe grounds: 1. Becauſe <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion</hi>
was the maine thing in a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
that offended them, (as you may ſee
<hi>Gen:</hi> 34. 14.) which they could not except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
in <hi>women.</hi> 2 Becauſe if they <hi>married</hi>
only with their <hi>women,</hi> there was no fear of
<hi>building</hi> up <hi>ſtrange</hi> families: for (according

But, notwithſtanding this inſtance of
<hi>Ruth,</hi> and the practiſe of the Jewes, it may
be anſwered that the prohibition was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
1. Becauſe <hi>Ruth</hi> had been <hi>ſanctified,</hi>

c: 1. 4. or rather indeed, by <hi>leaving her

2 Becauſe, there was in this marriage, a
<hi>Myſtery,</hi> * intended by the Authour of the
prohibition himſelfe, (who had power to
diſpenſe:) to ſignify, that, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſhould

&amp; by <hi>ſpirituall marriage,</hi> &amp; <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion.</hi>
Inſomuch that, though the Apoſtle ſay

came,</hi> Rom: 9. 5: yet he might have ſaid the

3 Becauſe it appeares, that, though the
Iſraelites (according to the objection (ſeem
to have looked upon it as a thing <hi>allowed</hi>
for their <hi>men</hi> to marry with <hi>ſtrange women,</hi>
yet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was of a nother mind. For,
aſſoone as he had heard thoſe words (of
the text above mentioned read by the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>)
at the <hi>dedication</hi> of the <hi>new wall,</hi>
preſently he fell to <hi>ſeparating</hi> all the <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſaying: <hi>Ye ſhall not give your Daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Sons nor take their Daughters unto
your Sons, or for your ſelves;</hi> chap: 13. 3. 25,
You ſee, he forbids marriage with their
Daughters <hi>more punctually,</hi> and with <hi>larger
caution;</hi> adding, <hi>or for your ſelves,</hi> for feare
they ſhould take that libertie, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they might think they had. And if any
one ſay. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did thus upon his <hi>owne
diſcretion</hi> only, viz. becauſe he ſaw they had
been by this means <hi>tempted to Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi>
and to <hi>prevent</hi> it for the future: (as
may be conjectured by what he ſaith of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
v. 26. That <hi>his wives had cauſed him
to ſin</hi>) &amp; not that there was any ſuch thing
intended in God's prohibition at firſt, it
may be anſwered, that the contrary is a
great deale plainer from the 27, v. where it
is ſaid, <hi>Shall we then hearken unto you, and
doe all this evill to trangreſſe againſt our God,</hi>

for ever,</hi>] it might be interpreted,
<hi>This prohibition</hi> (of not being <hi>admitted till
the tenth generation</hi>) ſhall be in <hi>force againſt
them for ever.</hi> But becauſe in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (c.
13. 1, where this law is recited) the words,
<hi>for ever,</hi> only are mentioned, it ſeems rather
to be interpreted, <hi>This prohibition,</hi> (viz. ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
of <hi>entering into the Congregation) ſhall
be for ever.</hi> So that theſe words ſhall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>exegeticall,</hi> to expound thoſe next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(according to the opinion of thoſe,
who expound that of a baſtard's <hi>not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till the tenth generation,</hi> (v. 2,) of <hi>not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

he could not forbeare, after he had named
how he would puniſh them, (as I may ſay)
<hi>in the ſame breath,</hi> to <hi>encreaſe</hi> the <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
As if we would ſay, <hi>ſuch a one ſhall not come
againe to my houſe for this twelve month; no,
never.</hi> With this interpetation agrees the
<hi>proverb</hi> (in uſe among the Jewes, in their
ordinary commerce) <hi>Beware of a Proſelyte,</hi>
(i. e. <hi>a Gentile</hi> turned <hi>Jew) even to the tenth
generation.</hi> which puts me in mind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
another argument, of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi>
of <hi>God's anger</hi> for this ſin of the Moabites,
viz: That the puniſhment was without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
even of <hi>turning Proſelyte, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Jewiſh religion.</hi>

by <hi>ſpeaking lyes,</hi> or <hi>lying to</hi> God; and
(I believe) is uſually ſo deſcribed in
the Scriptures; as likewiſe by <hi>flattering:</hi>
as you may ſee Pſ: 78. 36, ſee <hi>Rev:</hi> 2. 2, ch.
3. 9. The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Hypocrites ſpeak
to</hi> God, or promiſe him, one thing; and not
only <hi>doe</hi> afterward, but <hi>meane</hi> another all the
while. <hi>They draw neere unto him, with their

their heart farre from him:</hi> this is
God's complaint concerning the <hi>Jewes</hi> by
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap: 29. 1, and therefore you may
ſee in the next chapter v. 9, he cals them <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

men,</hi> is thus expreſſed by <hi>lying,</hi> as Pſ:
62. 4. <hi>They delight in Lies,</hi> For I ſuppoſe
<hi>David</hi> in that place complaines, not ſo
much of his enemies telling <hi>Saul,</hi> what he
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57664:152"/>

are a good ground for my ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
viz. <hi>They bleſſe with their mouth, but they
curſe inwardly.</hi> Now the proper worke of

they <hi>bind</hi> them ſelves to God by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,

neceſſarily follow. For in that word but
now mentioned, if there <hi>be</hi> not, there <hi>may</hi>
be ſignified, not onely a being yoaked with
a beaſt, as I may ſay, of <hi>another kind,</hi> (which

as if one's face ſtood <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the other's

drawing each one his way, muſt needs be
the <hi>more.</hi> For when one drawes <hi>forward,</hi> the
other muſt either draw backward, with a
great deale of <hi>paine:</hi> or yeeld to be drawne
the ſame way, with a great deale of <hi>danger,</hi>
if the way be <hi>naught.</hi> Now, how much a man
muſt needs be <hi>hindred from good duties,</hi> that
is yoked in this manner, by <hi>marrying a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
perſon,</hi> eſpecially an <hi>Idolater;</hi> every one
may <hi>gueſſe,</hi> (and it hath beene partly ſhewn
in this chapter.) And ſo likewiſe, what <hi>ſtrife,</hi>
and <hi>contention,</hi> he is like to meet with: an
example whereof you may ſee in <hi>Zipporah,</hi>
and <hi>Moſes,</hi> about the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of their
child, Exod. 4. 26. See the <hi>conſequents</hi> of
<hi>Sampſon's marriage</hi> with a <hi>Philiſtin,</hi> Jud. 15.
Secondly, from thoſe words, verſ. 16. of this
chapter, <hi>For yee are the temple of the living
God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them
&amp;c.</hi> may be gathered, what danger there
is of <hi>God's departure</hi> from us. For he will
not dwell in a <hi>Temple,</hi> that is <hi>polluted:</hi> and
it is a thouſand to one, but it <hi>be polluted</hi> this
way. You may remember, in that place of

their mouth, and devoureth their enimies, and if

be killed, ch: 11. 5. <hi>And if any man will
hurt them, &amp;c. And if any man will hurt them</hi>]
twice the ſame words. Why, what? Is it
ſuch a matter to hurt them? It ſeemes, it is;
for elſe it had not been <hi>repeated.</hi> and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
becauſe it ſeemes, the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

If <hi>any man will hurt them</hi>] If he <hi>doe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

               <p>In the NEW TESTAMENT, the

which he had ſo deliberately taken,
and ſo ſolemnly confirmed with thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
ceremonies, as you may ſee verſ. 18,
19. And here give me leave to impart one
conceit, which juſt now came into my mind
upon this occaſion. In Geneſis c. 15. 11. It is
recorded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (at the time that
God confirmed his covenant with him in a
formall manner, with theſe ceremonies) that
<hi>when the fowles came down upon the carcaſſes,
he drove them away.</hi> Now I ſay that this
ſeemes to be a paſſage, which in a ſtory of
ſo ſolemne a buſineſſe, would not have been
related, but with ſome ſpeciall meaning, and
which I conjecture to be this, viz. to ſhew
either <hi>Abraham's faithfulneſſe,</hi> that <hi>he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to keepe God's covenant;</hi> or <hi>his faith,</hi> that
<hi>he doubted not,</hi> but God would <hi>keepe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>
(and ſo it ſhould never come to that
paſſe, as the coming of the fowles would
ſeeme to bode, which was a great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him to <hi>unbeliefe</hi>). As if he had ſaid
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:57664:238"/>
withall by way of <hi>abomination, Abſit, away,
I feare not,</hi> or, <hi>God forbid it ſhould come to
this paſſe, that either a Covenant</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>God's

devoured by the fowles; or that a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
WITH <hi>God ſhould be broken; or that ever
I ſhould come to this paſſe, as to be expoſed to the
fowles for meat, for breaking covenant. No, for
my part, I am</hi> RESOLVED: <hi>and for God's
part, I am</hi> CONFIDENT, <hi>that he is alſo;
that this covenant ſhall be firme and ſure.</hi>
The old Romans, at the performance of

for their ceremonie was to <hi>throw</hi> a <hi>ſtone</hi> at a

<hi>ſure</hi> enough <hi>with</hi> the <hi>Cords</hi> of their owne
<hi>ſins,</hi> of their <hi>own accord, although</hi> (or rather
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:57664:293"/>
indeed <hi>If</hi>) God let them alone. <hi>His own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, and he
ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſins,</hi> Prov:
5. 22. <hi>Wickedneſſe</hi> is the <hi>fire;</hi> and they are the
<hi>briars,</hi> and <hi>thornes,</hi> Iſa. 9. 18. Puniſhment by
God, is but their <hi>own way brought back again
upon their own head.</hi> The Scripture uſeth this
expreſſion for it, 1 Kings 8. 32. as likewiſe
that of <hi>eating the fruit of their own waies:</hi> Pr.
1. 31. <hi>David prayed,</hi> that the <hi>way</hi> of his
enemies <hi>might</hi> be <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ſlippery,</hi> Pſal: 35. 6.
<hi>Jeremy threatned,</hi> that the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>falſe
Prophets ſhould</hi> be ſo, chap: 23. 12. &amp; I make
no doubt, but I may <hi>ſay,</hi> that the way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>ſinner is</hi> ſo. Which if it be, there needs
none to throw him downe: for hee will <hi>fall</hi>
ſoone <hi>himſelfe;</hi> and fall moſt <hi>dangerouſly:</hi> as
a man muſt needs doe in <hi>ſuch waies.</hi> Many
are the places of Scripture which ſpeake to
this purpoſe: eſpecially in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and
the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> You may ſee at your leaſure,
Pſal. 64. 8. 140. 9. 141. 10 *. Prov. 11. 5, 6, 19.
ch: 13. 6, 14. 14. 21. 7. 29. 6.</p>
               <p>I ſay that every <hi>ſinner</hi> will puniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his own courſes: when once God
<hi>leaves</hi> him (or gives him leave) <hi>to take</hi> thoſe
courſes, and ſo to puniſh himſelfe. Now the
main cauſe of God's <hi>leaving him</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is <hi>his</hi> leaving <hi>God</hi> firſt: and refuſing to
hearken to the counſell of his word. So that
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:57664:294"/>
ſtill the <hi>ſinners deſtruction</hi> is from <hi>himſelfe,</hi>
and he is his own greateſt enemy. <hi>They
would none of my Councell: they deſpiſed all my
reproofe. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit
of their own way, and be filled with their owne
deviſes,</hi> Prov: 1 30, 31. If hee will not take
<hi>God's</hi> Counſell, he muſt needs take his <hi>owne;</hi>
and his <hi>own</hi> is never <hi>good.</hi> Such as will not
<hi>follow advice,</hi> though it bee but <hi>man's</hi> advice,
we ſee but few of them <hi>proſper.</hi> See more to
this purpoſe in the Chapter of God's <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               </p>
               <p>Now by <hi>any ſin,</hi> as I told you before, men
do hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves <hi>remotely, &amp; in the end,</hi> by <hi>juſt
deſert:</hi> But there are ſome <hi>ſins,</hi> by which they
are <hi>more immediatly</hi> their own executioners.
And of ſuch <hi>ſins,</hi> and the manner of being
puniſhed by them, mention is made in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
places of this book. And therefore I
will inſtance onely in two or three, that are
more noted, and theſe are 1 <hi>An unruly

his lips are the ſnare of his ſoule,</hi> Prov: 18. 7.
2 <hi>Anger and Envy. For wrath killeth the

5. 2. 3 <hi>Frowardneſſe. The integritie of the

Prov: 1. 32. Of theſe you may ſee more in
their ſeverall Chapters.</p>
               <p>This way of puniſhing men <hi>by themſelves,</hi>
is a way that God uſes very much whether
it be by <hi>giving them up to ſuch ſins,</hi> as are
moſt <hi>hurtfull</hi> to the parties, that commit
them: Or by cauſing them to be wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>intended</hi> for the backs of <hi>others.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that, if you ſee men puniſhed this way
you have very good cauſe to think, that <hi>God</hi>
hath a ſpeciall hand in it; and that he is very
angry As <hi>David</hi> ſaith. <hi>The Lord is known by
