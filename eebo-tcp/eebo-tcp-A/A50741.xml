            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preſent Danger
OF
TANGIER:
OR,
An Account of its being Attempted
By a great Army of the <hi>Moors</hi> by Land,
And under ſome Apprehenſions of
The <hi>FRENCH</hi> at Sea.</head>
            <head>In a LETTER from <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
Dated <date>the 29th of <hi>July</hi> (old ſtile) 1679.</date>
To a Friend in <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE are not a little afflicted to
underſtand by the laſt News
from <hi>England,</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
you labour under, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
occaſioned by Popiſh Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and the Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which we truſt by this time may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and allayed, from thoſe good
Encouragements your Letter gave us
to hope ſo. But in return, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96214:2"/>
to ſend you, but the like Tidings
of more Diſaſters, and that is, of the
great danger the Town and Garriſon of
<hi>Tangier</hi> ſeems to be in at this time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
'tis credibly reported here, under a
Blockade, and in ſome Diſtreſs, for
there are many thouſand <hi>Moors</hi> lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, ſome ſay Fifteen Thouſand,
others more; for indeed, they can
bring down what Multitudes they liſt,
at an hours warning upon them; but
hitherto there have not paſſed many
acts of Hoſtility between them; for
they are now upon a Treaty of Sixty
days; which is ſaid to be politickly
propoſed and held on foot by the Town,
in hopes that they may in that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome Supplies of Proviſion, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
<hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> from <hi>England;</hi> for they
complain lamentably, That they are
very ill furniſht in caſe of a Siege. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Treaty, they converſe freely
with the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſome adventure to
go amongſt them, and return without
damage; but the Sixty days are now
near expiring, and we do not hear of
any good Accommodation that is like
to be concluded, nor any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Succours come to the Garriſon; but
on the contrary, ſince we came here,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96214:2"/>
the <hi>Moors</hi> have been aſſiſted from ſome
Engliſh, (as 'tis confidently related) with
1500 Barrels of Powder, Landed at <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi>
and ſo from thence, clandeſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by Roguery, ſold at very dear
rates, and conveyed to them. Thus 'tis
too often the Cuſtom of our Nation, to
give away their Swords to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and then fight with their Teeth,
and furniſh our Foes with means to Cut
our Throats. What a curſed thing is
this private Self-Intereſt! how many
brave Kingdoms hath it deſtroyed!
Whilſt <hi>every one</hi> is much for himſelf, the
Devil fools <hi>us all.</hi> There are <hi>Men in the
World,</hi> that would ſell their King, their
Countrey, their Religion, their Souls
and all, to <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> or any other
Chapman, for ready <hi>Money.</hi> Let the
Ship I ſail in periſh, provided out of
the Wrack I may get a Pleaſure-Boat
for my ſelf. So a Villain gets an Eſtate,
what cares he how many poor Souls
ſuffer by his Fraud, Treachery, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion?
I cannot think of theſe baſe
Dregs of Mankind, that are Betrayers
of their Countries Safety, Honour,
Wealth, and Reputation, without juſt
Reſentment, and ſome Emotion of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
We all here are upon this news, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96214:3"/>
a great deal of Pain and Trouble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Tangiers</hi> Circumſtances; for
you know of what conſiderable Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
'tis to our <hi>Streights</hi>-Trade; and
ſhould it be loſt, our Merchants might
in effect, take their leave of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi>
eſpecially if it ſhould fall into
ſome peoples Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> French <hi>have now 40 ſail of Gallies lying
at</hi> Gibraltar, <hi>on what deſigne we cannot learn;
which cauſes ſome apprehenſions as if there might be
ſome Correſpondence held by them with the</hi> Moors,
<hi>to the prejudice of the place beforementioned: But
this is only a Suſpition amongſt them who think it
prudence to provide for the worſt. We hope they
may be ſufficiently reliev'd in time, to put them in a
condition able to diſpel all theſe Fears.</hi>
