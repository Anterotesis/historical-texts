         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARKS
Upon a Late
Disingenuous Discourse
WRIT
By one T. D. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OF all Vocations to which
men addict themselves, or
are dedicated, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
esteemed that of the Ministry
to be the most noble and happy
Imployment; as being more peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
directed to those two great Ends,
the advancement of God's Glory, and
the promoting of Man's Salvation. It
hath seemed to me as if they who
have chosen, and are set apart for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60436:4"/>
that Work, did, by the continual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of conversing with their
Maker, enjoy a state like that of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise;
and in this superiour, that
they are not also, as <hi>Adam,</hi> put in <hi>to
dress and keep a Garden;</hi> but are, or
ought to be, exempt from the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of all worldly avocations. Yet, upon
nearer consideration, they likewise
appear to partake of the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities
of Humane condition. For,
although they do not, as others, eat
their Bread, in the sweat of their
brows (which some Divines account
to be, though in the Pulpit, undecent,)
yet the study of their brain is more
than equivalent; and even the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Ground is so far under the
Curse, that no Field runs out more in
Thorns and Thistles, or requires more
pains to disincumber it. Such I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
to be those peevish questions
which have overgrown Christianity;
wherewith men's minds are only rent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60436:4"/>
and intangled, but from whence they
can no more hope for any wholsom
nourishment, than to <hi>gather Grapes
from Thorns,</hi> or <hi>Figgs from Thistles.</hi> And
(if I may so far pursue the Allegory)
this Curse upon Divinity, as that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, seems to have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also from tasting that forbidden
Fruit, of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of
Good and Evil.</hi> For, in general, many
Divines, out of a vain affectation of
Learning, have been tempted into
Enquiries too curious after those
things which the Wisdom of God hath
left impervious to Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
further than they are revealed.
And hence, instead of those allowed
and obvious Truths of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the New Creature, (yet
these too have their proper weeds that
pester them,) there have sprung up
endless Disputes concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
things of God, and which
are agitated by men, for the most
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60436:5"/>
part, with such Virulence and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
as manifest the Subtilty and
Malice of the Serpent that hath sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them. But, more particularly,
that very Knowledge of Good and
Evil, the disquisition of the Causes
from whence, and in what manner
they are derived, hath been so grateful
to the Controversial, Female, Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
that even the Divines have taken
of it as <hi>a Fruit to be desired to make
them Wise,</hi> and given to their people,
and they have both eaten, at the peril
of God's Displeasure and their own
Happiness. Whereas that second
Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> contains the plain
History of Good and Evil, and (not
to mention so many attestations to
it of the Old and New Testament,)
what other Comment needs there, for
what belongs to Good, than that, <hi>Iam.</hi>
1. 17. that it is from God only, <hi>That
every Good Giving, and every Perfect
Gift descendeth?</hi> And, as to Evil, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60436:5"/>
also of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> is sufficient convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>cap. 1. v. 13, 14. Let no man say,
when he is tempted, I was tempted of God;
God cannot be tempted with Evil, neither
tempteth he any man: But every man is
tempted, when he is drawn aside by his
own lusts and enticed.</hi> Or that of the
same Apostle, <hi>cap. 4. v. 1. From whence
come Wars and Fightings among you?</hi> (and
even that <hi>Logomachia,</hi> I fear, with
which this question is vexed,) <hi>Come
they not hence? even from your lusts that
fight in your members.</hi> And there is no
examining Christian but must find
both these Truths evidently witnessed
by his own Conscience.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Theologants of
former and later times, not content
with what is held forth in Scripture,
have attempted to clamber and palm
up higher, by the Philosophy of that
School where each of them hath first
practised, and have drawn God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and Predetermination, upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60436:6"/>
this occasion, into debate; arguing
upon such points as no man, unless
he were <hi>Prior</hi> and precedent to the
First Cause, can have the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to comprehend and judge of: and
most of them do but say and unsay;
and while in words they all deny God
to be the Author of sin, yet in effect,
and by the manner of their reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they affirm it; I therefore, being
both apprehensive of the danger in
such Arguments, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
conscious of mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
shall not presume to interpose
my Opinion in the differences about
this matter, further than to say; That
if men by this fansied <hi>opening of their
Eyes,</hi> have attained to see more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and acknowledge the wickedness
of their own Actions, it resembles the
modesty of our First Parents, discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Nakedness:</hi> But, if men shall
also assert a <hi>Predeterminative Concourse</hi>
of God to our Evil, it seems to have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60436:6"/>
too much of Original Perverseness,
and of that faln shortness of Reason,
whereby they would have found a
Nudity in the Creator, and did impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
reject their fault upon him, for
the <hi>Serpent that He had made,</hi> and the
<hi>Woman that He had given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if any man there be that can
reconcile this Controversie, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more that arise out of it; (for all
the most important Doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
serve on the one side, and all the
fiercest questions of Religion on the
other, depending for Truth and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
upon the success of this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
if he can extinguish all those
Ill Consequences, Dull Distinctions,
and Inconsistent Notions, which have
been levied in this quarrel, and reduce
each Party within the due limits of
Scripture and Saving Knowledge;
such a person indeed deserves all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
And such an one I
thought I had met with, nor yet see
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60436:7"/>
reason, notwithstanding all the late
attempts upon him, to alter my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
in a Book intitled; <hi>The Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileableness
of God's Prescience of the sins of
Men, with the Wisdom and Sincerity of his
Counsels, Exhortations; and whatsoever other
means He uses to prevent them. In a Letter
to the Honourable</hi> Robert Boyl, <hi>Esquire;</hi>
and in a <hi>Postscript to the late Letter of the
Reconcileableness of God's Prescience,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>by</hi> John Howe, <hi>the Author of that Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there was one passage in
the close of his <hi>Letter, p.</hi> 154. which
seem'd, as I thought; to lay open
to censure; where he askt pardon, as
<hi>having hudled it up mostly in the intervals of
a troublesome long Iourney.</hi> It seem'd a
piece too well elaborate to have been
perfected amidst the hurry of the
Road, the noise of Inns, and the <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi>
of the Packet-boat. And how could
he hope, after saying this, in so capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an Age as we live, to escape some
Reflexion? but that at least men
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60436:7"/>
would inquire whether he went by
Stage-coach, or on Horse-back; both
which are professed enemies to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Judgment? (for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
he had not that ancient accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of Horse-litters, wherein,
without any impediment to their
thoughts, men travelled with all the
privacy and equipage of a Closet,)
whether he had not lost his way, or
faln among Thieves, and how he found
himself after his Journey? with all the
questions that men are subject to at
their arrival home, and which even
when ask'd in civility, yet are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
He might, had it not been for
the jogging, have remembred how
unfortunate most Writers have been
in such excuses, and what advantage
ill-natur'd men have taken to misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them. So he that apologiz'd
for using a Forein tongue, was told,
that no man had prohibited him his
Native Language in his own Country.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60436:8"/>
Others, alledging that they had at the
same time a Fit of the Stone, Gout, or
other Distemper, have been taxed, as
lying under no obligation of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Infirmities, but who might
however, have cur'd themselves of
that of Writing. And he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to treat at once of a Serious,
while he was amused with <hi>a more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Importance,</hi> was advertis'd, that
he ought therefore to have so long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
either from the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But, in earnest, this confession
of Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s, is so far from any such
Arrogance, that it rather argues his
modesty. For, if some can even in
Riding name all the contrary motions,
till they have by memory plai'd out a
Game at Chess, (which was first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
as an emblem of <hi>Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
why should it be more difficult,
or less allowable, to one of <hi>Mr. How</hi>'s
abilities, in the interruptions of travel,
to give a <hi>Mate</hi> also to that question?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60436:8"/>
The worst therefore that can be said
of him, in allusion either to his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
or his Journey, is—<hi>at poterat tutior
esse domi.</hi> Yet seeing this was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
fault that I remarked in reading
him over, I would not pass it by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice, lest I might have cause
to suspect my self of a Partiality,
which I desire not that others should
exercise in mine own particular.</p>
            <p>But for the rest, whereas the things
considerable in all Discourses are the
Subject, the End, the Reasoning, the
Method, and the Style; I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that, as far as I understand, I have
met with few manual Treatises, that
do in all these respects equal it. For
the Subject, it appears in the Title,
than which there was none of greater
dignity to be handled, or of greater
use, if rightly explain'd and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
And no less is that of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination,</hi>
which he only treats of
collaterally, and upon which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60436:9"/>
in hope to find him less prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he hath been attaqued, as in the
Flank, with most vigour. His End
was most commendable, being to
make the Paths streight, and remove
those stumbling-blocks which the aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of others had laid in the way to
Heaven; to rectifie mens apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
concerning God, and leave them
without pretence for negligence in
their Duties, or despair of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
much less for despight against
the Creatour. His Arguing then is
plain and solid, for Evidence, rather
than Dispute; nor does he either
throw the Dust of antique Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the eyes of his Readers, to blind
them; or yet raise the Spectres of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authors, or conjure their vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Names, to fright men out of
their senses and understanding; but
declares against all the Prejudice or
Advantage by such proceeding, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Charms, and prohibited Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60436:9"/>
in the Controversie. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
thereafter is direct and coherent,
his Style perspicuous and elegant: So
that it is in short, a Manly discourse,
resembling much, and expressing the
Humane Perfection; in the Harmony
of Language, the Symmetry of Parts,
the Strength of Reason, the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of its End, which is so serious, that
it is no defect in the similitude with
Man, that the Letter contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it suitable to the property of
Laughter.</p>
            <p>All which put together, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it does, and must every where
partake also of Humane Imperfection,
it might have been hoped capable of
that civility which men, and especially
Learned men, but most of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do usually, or should allow, to
one another. That it should not be
made ridiculous, being writ in so good
earnest; nor assaulted, being so inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive;
much less that it should be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60436:10"/>
defaced, mutilated, stabb'd in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, and the Author through it,
which is even in writing a kind of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.
Yet this hath been its misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in a Rencounter with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
and hectoring Discourse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Title, <hi>De Causa Dei:</hi>
Or a <hi>Vindication of the Common Doctrine
of Protestant Divines concerning</hi> Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
<hi>viz. The Interest of God,</hi>
as <hi>the First Cause, in all the Actions, as
such, of Rational Creatures, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
Consequences with which it is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,
by Mr.</hi> John How, <hi>in a late
Letter and Postscript of God's Prescience;</hi>
by <hi>T. D.</hi> By which first Letters, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it appears that he desires to pass
<hi>Incognito,</hi> I will so far observe good
manners, as to interpret them only
<hi>The Discourse,</hi> heartily wishing that
there were some way of finding it
Guilty, without reflecting upon the
Author; which I shall accordingly
indeavour, that I may both preserve
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60436:10"/>
his, whatsoever, former Reputation,
and leave him a door open to Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the future. But <hi>The Discourse</hi>
justifies it self, as if it had been typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by <hi>Paul</hi>'s withstanding <hi>Peter</hi> to
his face, when he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> (so
easy is it to patronize humane Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
under the pretence of the Cause
of God, and Apostolical example)
<hi>T. D.</hi> p. 23. whereas it rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
in the Bravery, though not in
the Occasion, that Exploit of <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 51, 52. for which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
though done in his defence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
him. adding, <hi>They that take the
sword, shall perish by the sword:</hi> And the
taking the Pen hath seldom better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
if handled in the same manner.
I therefore, having had the leisure to
read it over, and thereby the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of a second Caution, how the
unruly Quill is to be managed, have
thought that I could not at present ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a better account of that time to my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60436:11"/>
self or others, than by publishing these
Remarks; that, as Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Letter
may serve for a Pattern of what is to
be imitated, so <hi>The Discourse</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as a Mark (the best use it can be
put to) of what ought to be avoided
in all writing of Controversies, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by Divines, in those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Religion. The nature of this
matter would admit of no better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
than that the Errours observable
should be distinguished under several
Heads, to each of which the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instances are referred. The first
Article that I prefer against the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
is;</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It's Trifling and Cavilling about Words,
when they affect not the Cause.</head>
               <p>First Instance. <hi>Mr. Howe,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to prevent any such idle Practice,
had in the last page of his <hi>Postscript,</hi>
plainly summ'd up the constant sense
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60436:11"/>
both of that and his Letter which he
would abide by. <hi>That God doth not by
an Efficacious Influence universally move
and determine Men to all their Actions, even
those Actions which are most wicked.</hi> Here
was the Subject ready stated, against
which, if any thing, <hi>The Discourse</hi>
ought to have directly apply'd. But,
instead of that <hi>T. D.</hi> p. 1. <hi>It</hi> saith,
<hi>Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>gives us his sense in various
terms, and such as seem repugnant to each
other. One while that which he denies, is
a</hi> Predeterminative Concurrence, <hi>and</hi>
Predeterminative Concourse; <hi>another
while, 'tis</hi> Predetermining Influence,
<hi>and a</hi> Determinative Influence, <hi>and</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
Influence. This is the same
in <hi>T. D.</hi> as if Its <hi>concurrent Wherry-men,</hi>
p. 27. after they had taken in their
Fare, should be long pulling off their
Doublets, and then carry a man to
another Stairs than they were directed.
The one shows that they had but little
heart to their labour; the other, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60436:12"/>
they know not the River, unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they have a design, if they can
find a place convenient to rifle the
Passenger. For Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had expresly
pitch'd upon that one term of Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Influence. But, as for those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repeated by <hi>The Discourse,</hi> they
were such as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> found in the
Controversie, not of his own making,
nor therefore is he accountable for
them: But, however, it was his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
to mention them; and having
done so, to bind himself to a point, to
one Word of the most certain signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as a place where any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
might alwaies be sure to speak
with him. Yet <hi>It,</hi> to find out matter
for Discourse, and to show <hi>Its</hi> great
Reading, tells us, as if that were the
business, what <hi>Strangius</hi> saith, and what
Doctor <hi>Twisse</hi> concerning <hi>Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
and <hi>Concourse;</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> what
<hi>Strangius,</hi> of the Difference between
<hi>Concourse</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> p. 2. and saith
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60436:12"/>
that, <hi>as for those two Phrases,</hi> Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative
Concurrence, <hi>and</hi> Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative
Concourse, <hi>they are in effect,
Contradictie in Adjecto.</hi> And so let them
be, upon condition that not Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>
(as <hi>The Discourse</hi> would have it) but the
first Inventer my be bound to answer
for it. For the truth is, the Brothers
of Dispute do usually so handle their
matter, and refine so far, till they
want at last either words to express
their meaning, or meaning to express
in words. And so it hath faired with
these Imaginers of the <hi>Predeterminative
Concourse</hi> or <hi>Concurrence.</hi> 'Tis very
well that this Scene of Debate lies in
<hi>Oxford</hi> (or <hi>London</hi>) for, upon these
terms, it would be impossible at
<hi>New-Market,</hi> where <hi>Prae</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> run
their heats, to decide any Match with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sending for a Judge to the next
University, and it is less difficult for
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> or for <hi>Con,</hi> and <hi>Non-con,</hi> to
set their Horses together. Yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60436:13"/>
as <hi>the Discourse</hi> affirms, that this
<hi>Predeterminative Concourse</hi> or <hi>Concurrence</hi>
had been words of Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s own
choosing; whereas he on the contrary
rejects them for that of <hi>Efficacious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
the Impropriety however therein
had not been greater, than of that
Phrase which <hi>T. D.</hi> p. 25. uses, and
hath right to, <hi>Simultaneous Concourse,</hi>
which is, if I mistake not, as much as
to say, <hi>Conconcourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same (if greater be the same)
<hi>Trifling and Cavilling about Words that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not the Cause,</hi> it is to say, <hi>T. D.</hi> p. 2.
<hi>As for that latter Phrase,</hi> Influence, <hi>which
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>makes equipollent with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
Concourse <hi>in these words,</hi> Post. p. 29.
I here affect not the Curiosity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
these two Terms, as some
do; <hi>I had rather he should hear</hi> Strangius
<hi>again</hi> than <hi>me, blaming his not</hi> affecting
that Curiosity of Distinction: and then
<hi>It</hi> cites <hi>Strangius de Vol. Dei, lib. 1. c. 11.
p.</hi> 59. assigning the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60436:13"/>
them. This is a trivial litiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about words, where the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
is sufficiently understood (or
rather is intelligible) and, whether it
be said <hi>Influence</hi> or <hi>Concourse</hi> makes no
more to the business, than the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
objected to <hi>Predetermining,</hi> or
<hi>previous Concourse,</hi> which any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader can see to have been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
generally, of a priority of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Influence</hi> on God's part, not in
Time, but in Nature and Causality.
<hi>Strangius,</hi> indeed, writing a large
Treatise concerning that Subject, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
all the Terms more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately:
But Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> it being there
done to his hand, and writing on the
by only two or three pages, had
not the space or the occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon them. And it is an Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> I observe, is
much subject to, that he seldom useth
any notional Terms or Distinctions,
where he can make men comprehend
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60436:14"/>
him better without them: And at that
indeed he hath a singular faculty. His
very saying that he <hi>affected not,</hi> there,
<hi>the</hi> Curiosity to (<hi>distinguish those two
Terms, as some do,</hi> shows it: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that he was not ignorant of them,
and that he also could distinguish
when he saw reason, and in time and
place convenient. <hi>The Discourse</hi> might
with more cause have accused him of
Ambiguity, and raised scruples about
his <hi>Curiosity:</hi> for that is taken in many
several significations. As for example;
sometimes it is used for a commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Exquisiteness in things consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and worth the labour. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
it is described, <hi>Quoties plus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentiae
quam oportebat impendimus rebus,</hi>
vel <hi>Nostris, vel Alienis. Nostris, quam
minima quaeque disquirimus &amp; nullius fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis:
Alienis, quum de rebus caeterorum oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultioribus
non satis cum pudore perscruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
aut interrogamus.</hi> So not <hi>Strangius,</hi>
nor Doctor <hi>Twisse,</hi> but <hi>Cicero.</hi> Which,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60436:14"/>
that I may do equal right to <hi>the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
in translating Latine, is to say,
<hi>That is called Curiosity, when men use an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Diligence in things relating to
themselves or others: To themselves, when
they are busie about every trifle, and what is
of no moment: To others, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a scrutiny, or ask questions beyond
modesty, concerning their private Affairs.</hi>
And I had rather <hi>It</hi> should hear <hi>Cicero</hi>
again, <hi>than me blaming</hi> It for this latter
sort of Curiosity. <hi>Reperiam multos, vel
innumerabiles potius, non tam curiosos, nec
tam molestos quam Vos estis.</hi> That is; <hi>I
could find many, or rather innumerable men,
neither so</hi> Troublesome, <hi>nor so</hi> Curious
<hi>as</hi> You <hi>are.</hi> And <hi>Quintillian</hi> explains
it further. <hi>Est etian quae</hi> Parergia <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur,
supervacua, ut sic dixerim, Operosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas:
Ut a Diligente Curiosus, &amp; a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione
supestitio distat,</hi> i. e. <hi>There is also
that which is called</hi> Parergia, <hi>a superfluous
and laborious Nicety; as a</hi> Curious <hi>man
differs from a Diligent,</hi> or <hi>Superstition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60436:15"/>
from Religion.</hi> But besides all this, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosus</hi>
signifies an Informer: in which
sense, I suppose, both Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> and
<hi>T. D.</hi> would be loath to accept it. Yet
perhaps I may gratifie them in the
Authority or Quotation. <hi>Suet. Aug.</hi>
c. 27. <hi>Nam &amp;</hi> Pinarium, <hi>Equitem Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum,
quum Concionante se, admissa tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
Paganorum, apud Milites, subscribere
quaedam animadvertisset,</hi> Curiosum <hi>&amp; Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatorum
ratus, coram confodi imperavit.</hi>
Which Text, if a little help'd in the
translating, might serve them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
purpose: But however so it is,
that, <hi>taking the Knight to be a Spy and an
Informer, he caused him forthwith to be
slain in his presence.</hi> And lastly in the
Code, <hi>Tit. de Curiosis &amp; Stationariis:
Curiosus</hi> is a Post-master, if Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
be dispos'd at any time to take another
<hi>long troublesome Iourney,</hi> and do not
<hi>disaffect also that Curiosity.</hi> It had been
much more to the purpose to have
learnt these several acceptations of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60436:15"/>
than to have exercised it in
the worst sense, in such needless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,
when a question stated in
other terms was in expectation every
minute to be disputed.</p>
               <p>But to say that in those words: <hi>I
here affect not the</hi> Curiosity <hi>to distinguish
these two Terms of</hi> Concourse <hi>or</hi> Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>as some do,</hi> was to make the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Phrase <hi>Influence</hi> equipollent <hi>with the
former Concourse</hi> is <hi>gratis,</hi> or rather <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiis
dictum,</hi> and ought not to have
been but upon consultation first with
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> to have had his concurrence;
no nor then neither. For should
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> be never so much of opinion,
as he seems otherwise, that they are
<hi>Equipollent,</hi> yet it can never be true
that these words do infer it. As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that I should say, I affect not
<hi>here</hi> the <hi>Curiosity</hi> to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Candor and the Acuteness of
<hi>The Discourse</hi> in this particular, do I
therefore think them <hi>Equipollent,</hi> or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60436:16"/>
that one of them hath not the stronger
ingredience? though indeed there is
little of either.</p>
               <p>Another (for this hath been too
pregnant to say a second) Instance to
the same Head is where <hi>The Discourse,</hi>
p. 26. tells us; <hi>It is an unaccountable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency,
(for to salve his honour, so I will
call it, rather than a slip of Iudgmemt) to
produce Cursing and Swearing for instances
of Actions downright, or for the substance
of them Evil,</hi> &amp;c. This indeed is <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity</hi>
in the highest degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
if (for I must be aware too of
such exactness) there be degrees of
Perfection. And an heavy Charge it is,
which I know not whence it could light
upon Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> but that the Curious
are likewise given for the most part to
be Censorious, where they have no
reason. For Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> Post. p. 33, 34.
examining an Argument used by some
for God's <hi>Predeterminative Concurrence</hi>
to <hi>Wicked Actions,</hi> because there are no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60436:16"/>
Actions of Man on Earth so good,
which have not some mixture of sin in
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (see <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 32.) saith,
<hi>This Argument must be thus conceived.
That if God</hi> concur <hi>by</hi> Determinative
Influence <hi>to the imperfectly good Actions of
Faith, Repentance, Love to himself, Prayer,
therefore to the Acts of</hi> Enmity <hi>against
himself, Cursing, Idolatry, Blasphemy,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And is it not a mighty consequence, if to
Actions that are good</hi> quoad Substantiam,
<hi>therefore to such as are in the Substance of
them Evil? We our selves can in a remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kind concur to the Actions of others.
Because you may afford your self your lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concurrence to Actions imperfectly good,
therefore may you to them that are down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
evil? because to Prayer, therefore to
Cursing and Swearing? and then ruine men
for the Actions you induced them to? You'l
say God may rather, but sure he can much
less do so than you. How could you be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the proposal of this Question?</hi> For
this Argument had been proposed by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60436:17"/>
way of question, and I have on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
set down Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s answer at
length, that it might be evident, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further brangling, how little, I
mean how no, cause there was for this
Animadversion upon him, speaking
expresly of such Cursing and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only as is Evil <hi>Quoad Substantiam.</hi>
For certainly those <hi>Acts of Enmity against
God himself,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> there
enumerates, <hi>Cursing,</hi> and then <hi>Idolatry,
Blasphemy,</hi> &amp;c. are, and were so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by him, and by all but such as
take care to the contrary, as much
Evil in themselves as that <hi>Adultery</hi>
which <hi>The Discourse</hi> it self owns to be
so, p. 72. <hi>because no end or circumstance
can make it good.</hi> So that this ado is
made for Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s not saying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Cursing and Swearing: indeed
a very hainous and notorious omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
even as it would be for a man,
so often as he uses the words <hi>And</hi> or
<hi>The,</hi> not to distinguish or tell his Reader,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60436:17"/>
that he intends <hi>And</hi> in an <hi>Exegetical</hi> sense,
or <hi>The</hi> in an <hi>Emphatical;</hi> or whether in
their ordinary capacity. How <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi>
soever <hi>this Inadvertency</hi> were in
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> it is well <hi>The Discourse</hi> did,
not call our Saviour to <hi>account, Matth.</hi>
5. 34. for forbidding Swearing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms, nor St. <hi>Iames, cap. 5. v.</hi> 12.
for the same as to Swearing, or <hi>c. 3.
v.</hi> 9, 10. because the same Apostle
does not there descant upon Cursing
more distinctly, and add Prophane to
its Character. But had the Discourse
done so, it would have been obvious
to every man, that the Pen deserv'd
the same Brand which is set upon the
Tongue in that Chapter. I wonder
how in this <hi>Lyncean</hi> perspicacity <hi>It</hi>
oversaw a more remarkable errour of
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s about <hi>Actions in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
Evil;</hi> where in the same pages,
33, 34. he writes it <hi>Qoad Substantiam,</hi>
which could not be Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency;
for in that Paragraph he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60436:18"/>
also spells <hi>Conseqence</hi> and <hi>Qestion</hi> in the
like manner, and therefore must by
the same Consequence as that of Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Swearing, have been a slip
of his Judgment. But, had <hi>It</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to be so unmercifully accurate,
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> might perhaps have told <hi>It</hi>
it's own; where p. 27. <hi>It</hi> mentions
that <hi>Evil Act of</hi> Adam<hi>'s eating a Tree</hi>
(for I see we are all mortal) which is
a Phrase of very hard Digestion.
Other proofs of this Head I reserve
till further occasion, two or three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
upon each, being like so many
Witnesses sufficient for <hi>It</hi>'s Conviction.
The second Article follows.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It's Ignorance and Confusion about the
Matter that is in Controversie.</head>
               <p>First Instance. <hi>The Discourse,</hi> p. 3.
saith; <hi>The Ambiguity of Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s
Phrases removed, and the sense of them
being brought to a certainty, I assert the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60436:18"/>
Contradictory to his Proposition: the term</hi>
Efficacious <hi>suiting well enough if Mr.</hi>
Howe <hi>intend by it an Infallibility of the
Event, or the certain Production of those
Actions which God hath and Influence upon.</hi>
Now, for the better understanding of
this, it is fit to observe that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
Proposition is this; <hi>God doth not by an
Effecacious Influence universally move and
determine Men to all their Actions, even
those Actions that are most wicked.</hi> They
that assert the Contradictory, must
therefore affirm that God does: and
much good may it do them. But
<hi>The Discourse</hi> in the words before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
capitulates that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> should
by <hi>Efficacious</hi> intend <hi>Infallibility,</hi> &amp;c. It
might almost as well have said <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
which we shall meet
with, p. 35. hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now it is indeed fit that a Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
should gratifie his Opponent as
far as may consist with Civility and
Safety. But here arises a Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60436:19"/>
Whether a man may give
another leave, that desires it, to speak
Non-sense. I say no. For Non-sense
and Idle words are of the same no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But if he be one that I have no
power over, and whom I can by no
amicable means hinder from speaking
Non-sense, I, after having used all
good indeavours, am excused. But
here the Case is stronger, where one
shall not only take the Liberty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but oblige me too to speak Non-sense.
To this I say, that to the best
of my understanding, I never will, nor
ought to do it in respect to any man.
Yet no less a favour, or favours, doth
<hi>The Discourse</hi> demand of Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> in
requiring that the term <hi>Efficacious</hi> may
be expounded by <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that is, in
effect, the most potent Influence by
no Influence: For what Influence
hath <hi>Infallibility</hi> upon the Actions of
another, or upon any thing? And this,
if it should yet obtain it of Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60436:19"/>
yet would consist as ill with his
own following words, or <hi>Certain
Production;</hi> wherein he more than
implies that <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Production</hi> are all one: whereas
a man may certainly and infallibly
know what he never produces, and
some too, we see, produce what they
never understand. But if <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
shall still opiniatre in this
matter, let <hi>It,</hi> to try how well it
suits, strike <hi>Efficacious,</hi> for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
out of the Question, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
instead of it, <hi>Infallibility</hi> and
<hi>Certain Production,</hi> and then see if
there be any sense in it or Grammar.</p>
               <p>Second Instance. <hi>The Discourse,</hi>
p. 9. pretends to give a Definition
of Predetermination. Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>It</hi> saith, <hi>is thus defin'd; A
Transient Action of God, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
every Creature to Act.</hi> Now it
is generally known, that the two
most perfect Creatures in all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60436:20"/>
are a Demonstration and a
Definition. How good <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
is at the first shall afterwards
be remonstrated. But as to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
it alwaies consists, as being
a Dialectick Animal, of a Body
which is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and a <hi>Difference,</hi>
which is the Soul of the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined;
but this will in neither of
these appear to be Perfect or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.
For the <hi>Genus</hi> here is Action,
and yet a few lines below <hi>It</hi> saith,
that <hi>Predetermination is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of</hi> per Modum Principii, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of a Principle, or Cause
of the Creatures Acting, but Concourse
only</hi> per Modum Actionis. Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
was but even before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Genus</hi> of Action, and now
of Cause: so that <hi>The Discourse</hi>
hath been very liberal indeed of
Body to the Definition, having
given it two rather than fail, though
commonly we account such births
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60436:20"/>
to be Errours of Nature, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous.
Had <hi>the Discourse</hi> interposed
some pages, it might have only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
a default of Memory; but
this inconsistence at one sight, and
before <hi>It</hi>'s Pen could be taken off,
shows that defect not to have been,
as with some persons, recompensed
in Judgment. And then for the
Difference that is assigned in this
Definition, it happens here, as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where there is most Body, that
there is least Soul. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else left to be the Difference,
but, <hi>whereby God excites every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to Act.</hi> If this be all, <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
might indeed very well say,
p. 7. that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> would <hi>be forc'd
to grant Predetermination;</hi> for how
could he possibly avoid it, when the
Antagonist defines it in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
own words? who saith, <hi>Postscript,</hi>
p. 45. <hi>In reference to sinful Actions;
by this Influence God doth not only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60436:21"/>
sustain men who do them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to them their natural faculties
and powers whereby they are done;
but also, as the first Mover, so far</hi>
excites <hi>and actuate those powers, as
that they are apt and habile for any
congenerous Action, to which they
have a natural designation, and
whereto they are not sinfully disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd.</hi>
Whereby <hi>God Excites</hi> the
Creature to Act, saith <hi>The Discourse,</hi>
whereby <hi>God Excites and Actuates
those Powers to,</hi> &amp;c. saith Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
very fully here, and in all other
places to the same sense; so that if
<hi>The Discourse</hi> either understood
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> or <hi>It</hi> self, either Its own
Definition, or the common Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
what place was there left for
arguing, unless to debate for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
sake? Usually when both
parties say the same thing, there is
an end of the discourse, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of the Dispute: There is as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60436:21"/>
far as I see, no doubt to be made
but Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> as he hath, will grant
this Predetermination even without
<hi>being forced,</hi> but yet upon condition,
and it is but reasonable that <hi>The
Discourse</hi> will retract <hi>Its</hi> own fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
words, p. 5. <hi>This Act of God
is called Predetermination, because it
limits the Creature to this Action
rather than to that.</hi> This indeed
will serve <hi>The Discourse</hi> for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
either of Discourse or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with <hi>It</hi> self; being Definition
in effect against Definition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
monstrosity, supplying hereby
two Souls to the two Bodies. But
till It be better agreed with it, and
can come to a clearer understanding
with <hi>It</hi> self, no third person needs
or can be interessed in the Contest
further than as a Spectator of some
strange sight for his money, like
the double Child from <hi>Sussex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Instance.</hi> The Discourse
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60436:22"/>
                  <hi>cites Mr.</hi> Howe, Postscript, <hi>p. 41.
for having there said concerning</hi>
God's exciting Man to act <hi>those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
words that I come last from
mentioning. But those words are
not p. 41. but 45. and the mistake
in the citation is probably any
an errour only of the Printer's.
Though indeed in that page 41.
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>with much perspicuity
declares the same Sense and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which he gives in other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
p. 45. For p. 41. he saith,</hi>
It hath been the care and designment of
the Divine Wisdom so to order the
way of Dispensation towards the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of Creatures, as not only,
not ordinarily to impose upon them
what they could not be patient of, but
so as that their powers and faculties
might be put upon the exercises
whereof they were capable, and to
provide that neither their Passive
capacity should be overcharged, nor
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60436:22"/>
their Active be unimployed. <hi>But the
words repeated and excepted against
are to be found in his p. 45. and
upon them it is that,</hi> The Discourse
<hi>sixes this unreasonable and ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
and censure;</hi> If by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
and Actuating the powers he
means that God reduces them to Act,
he hath taken a large jump from <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi>
to <hi>Twisse: and so goes on
to prove that ill-favour'd and worse
conceiv'd suggestion. It ought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
to have prevented this
usage that Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s Letter, p. 43.
hath said,</hi> That which hath too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
had greatest actual efficacy with
many in asserting Predetermination,
hath been the authority of this or that
man of reputation, and the force of
that Art of imputing a Doctrine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
under a prejudicial doom to
some or other ill-reputed former Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I profess not to be skill'd in the
use of that sort of Weapons. <hi>And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60436:23"/>
therefore, not being himself the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor,
but challenged and defied
by another, he ought to have had
the choice of them. What signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi>
Durandus <hi>here, but to call a
man ill names instead of coming to
the Point? and what Dr.</hi> Twisse, <hi>but
to wear mail, or bring a second
when Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>comes naked and
single? It is not what this or that
man, but what Truth saith that is
to he regarded: what liberty soever</hi>
The Discourse <hi>here takes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
It can by no means be made
true, that Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>by these words,</hi>
God as the first Mover so far excites
and actuates those powers, as that
they are apt and habile for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Action; <hi>professes himself of
Doctor</hi> Twisse<hi>'s opinion, no more
than that he is of</hi> Durandus<hi>'s after
having thus declared his own as
clearly as it is possible for any man's
meaning to be minuted or explain'd.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60436:23"/>
For</hi> Durandus <hi>holds only a meer
Conservation of the Faculty, Doctor</hi>
Twisse <hi>a Predetermination. But
Mr.</hi> Howe, <hi>to avoid</hi> Durandus <hi>on
the one hand, saith,</hi> that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to sinful actions (for of these is
the Question) God doth not only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
men who do them, and continue
to them their natural faculties and
powers (<hi>which was all</hi> Durandus <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to</hi>) but also so far Excites and
actuates those powers as that they
are apt <hi>and</hi> habile for any congeeruous
action, <hi>&amp;c. whereas, if he would
have spoke with Doctor</hi> Twisse, <hi>he
must have said, but also excites and
actuates those, powers</hi> determinately
<hi>to this or that action, which would
have differ'd the whole breadth of
Heaven from Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.
And certainly such an actual
influence as Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>describes,
added to the Natural Faculty, is, if
men look near, very distinguishable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60436:24"/>
from meer</hi> Conservation <hi>of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
on the one, and</hi> Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<hi>on the other side. For a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
conserved, as a Faculty, in</hi>
Actu Primo, <hi>(as men call it) includes
no such hability and present promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in it self to Action, as Mr.</hi>
Howe <hi>proposes; since then it could
never suffer a Privation of it but
what were irrecoverable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
common experience shews Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be sometimes unapt for
Action, and may be supposed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
so, if every moment when
they act they be not rendred apt
by a superadded Influence, which
may habilitate them for Action,
without Determining them to This
or That. So that all the Confusion
herein objected to Mr.</hi> Howe, <hi>is to
be referred to that Head upon
which I have charged it; and the
great</hi> Iump <hi>is no more than what
brain-sick Passengers, being carried
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60436:24"/>
alongst by the Wind and Sea, in
the heaving of their Vessel imagine
of the Trees and Steeples. For he
is still in the same place, but no man
knows whither away</hi> The Discourse
<hi>may be driven, or what part</hi> It <hi>is
bound to, and whether it do not
sail without Steerage, Compass, or
Anchor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fourth Instance of <hi>It</hi>'s Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Confusion about the
matter in Controversie, is <hi>It</hi>'s va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
and that so often and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,
the Terms of the Question.
First of all, <hi>It</hi> told us that <hi>It</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the Contradictory of Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi>'s Proposition; which must
be therefore by undertaking to
prove (as was said formerly) <hi>That
God doth by Efficacious Influence
universally Move and Determine Men
to all their Actions, even those
Actions that are most Wicked.</hi> T. D.
p. 3. yet immediately after having
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60436:25"/>
joyn'd Issue upon this, <hi>It</hi> hath a
second device, p. 4. and <hi>better likes</hi>
Strangius <hi>his state of the Question,
viz. Whether God does Determine or
Predetermine all Creatures to all and
each of their Actions.</hi> And then
Thirdly, p. 5. It tells us more fully
what the Question is, and how <hi>Its</hi>
Predetermination is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
explaining it thus (though
not fully enough) <hi>viz. an Act of
God's by which he limits the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to this Action rather than to
that.</hi> Such an Act <hi>The Discourse</hi>
hath granted at last, and 'twere to
be reasonably expected, that, after
having transformed the Question
thus oft to <hi>Its</hi> own understanding
and convenience, this Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at least to Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Proposal
should be adhered to as far as it goes,
and maintained: For otherwise
what occasion was there, or what
imployment is there left for this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60436:25"/>
Spirit of Contradiction? unless to
rattle through the Air, make vain
Apparitions, or in a calm day on a
sudden to stir up a Tempest. But if
this be <hi>The Discourses</hi> Anti-proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I that intermeddle not as an
Opinionist either way, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
only to comprehend as far as
I can <hi>It</hi>'s meaning, shall for that
purpose put a Case in <hi>It</hi>'s own
terms.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man to meet with some
afflicting calamity which tends to
provoke, among other his Passions,
that of Aversion or Hatred. He
considers this or that man may have
contributed to his calamity: He
considers also that God may have
had an hand in bringing it upon
him: He considers, perhaps, (and
is yet Undetermined, till God at
least Determine him) whether to
put forth one Act of Hatred toward
this man, or another, toward that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60436:26"/>
man, or another, toward God, or
whether only to hate the Evil it
self that afflicts him. (For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be that he should Hate this man
by the same Act of Hatred with
which he Hates another man, nor
can he Hate God by the same Act
whereby he Hates either of them,
or the afflicting Evil that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
him.) At last he is limited
to this rather than another Action,
and apprehending with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
person, 2 <hi>King. 6. 33. Behold
this Evil is from the Lord, what
should</hi> I <hi>wait for the Lord any longer?</hi>
He pours out his Hatred against
God himself. The Question now
is, who limits him to this Action
rather than to another? shall we
say it is God? <hi>The Discourse,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Affirmative, must say it is
God. This is indeed a dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the Case, but a true
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60436:26"/>Nor is it therefore to be wondred,
the Question being so frightful, that
<hi>The Discourse</hi> starts and runs away
from it so often; and after all this,
p. 9. would forget that <hi>Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is an Act by which God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Creature to this Action ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that,</hi> and undertakes to
define it, exclusively to those words,
(for the Definition includes the
whole nature of the thing defined)
no more but <hi>a Transient Action of God
which excites every Creature to Act.</hi>
And yet Fourthly, Considering that
the Cause required no less; after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
breath, and comforting <hi>Its</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<hi>The Discourse</hi> returns again in
part to the Question, telling us in
the bottome of the same page, 9.
<hi>That it is in plain words whether God
does Move men to all their natural
Actions, and so to one rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
And thus now we have a
fourth State of the Question, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60436:27"/>
yet very different from the First;
the Affirmative of which was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to be defended. In short, the
main Controversie is about <hi>Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
but this Fourth Question does
not so much as mention it either in
word or in sense. For the <hi>Determining</hi>
in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Proposition imports
and is so express'd, not only a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
men, but an <hi>Efficacious Moving</hi>
them. (There are many Motions
which may be Ineffectual.) Nor
only a moving them to <hi>This</hi> Action
rather than to <hi>That,</hi> but also to do
<hi>this Wicked</hi> Action (for of such is
the Controversie) <hi>rather</hi> than <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
it.</hi> What kind of practice is
this? It is a worse thing to adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Truth than Mony. The Terms
of the Question are the Standard.
But at this rate no man can know
what is <hi>Meum</hi> or <hi>Tuum,</hi> which is his
own Hypothesis, and which his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
while what he issued in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60436:27"/>
currant sense and weight is return'd
him Clipp'd or Counterfeit. But
the observation of this manner of
dealing hath put me upon another
thought much differing, and which
at first perhaps may seem something
extravagant.</p>
               <p>The Camel is a beast admirably
shap'd for Burthen, but so lumpish
withall, that nothing can be more
inept for feats of Activity. Yet
men have therefore invented how
to make it danse, that, by how
much unnatural the spectacle might
appear more absurd and ridiculous.
Its Keeper leads it upon a Pavement
so throughly warmed, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not able to escape nor abide
it, shifts first one foot, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to relieve it self, and would,
if possible, tread the Air on all four,
the ground being too hot for it to
stand upon. He in the mean time
traverses and trips about it at a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60436:28"/>
cooler distance, striking some vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer
Notes on his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kit,
like a <hi>French</hi> Dansing-Master. But,
knowing that his Scholar is both in
too much pain, and too dull to
learn his measures, he therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
frequent observation accords a
tune to its Figure and Footing,
which comes to the fame account.
So that, after daily repeating the
Lesson in private, they seem both
at last to be agreed upon a new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi>
Saraband. Having thus far
succeeded, he tries next whether
what he taught by torture be not
confirm'd by custom, and if a cool
Hearth may not have the like effect.
The Camel no sooner hears his
Fiddle, but, as if it's ears burned
with the musick, and it's memory
were in it's feet, the Animal bestirs
forthwith it's long legs, and, with
many an Antick Motion, and ill-favour'd
<hi>Coupe,</hi> gratifies the Masters
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60436:28"/>
patience and expectation. When he
finds, upon constant experiment, that
it never fails him, he thenceforward
makes it publick, and, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with the Master of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
shows it, with great satisfaction
to the Vulgar, every <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair
in <hi>Grand-Cairo.</hi> I would not too much
vex the similitude, but was run upon
this by a resemblance it hath with
some, who, not being fram'd at all
for Controversie, and finding the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
too hot for them, do, by their
flinching and shuffling from it, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
a Disputation, till it is grown ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
to them, and they change
ground as often, and have the fame
apprehension of the sound of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Camel of an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And yet the Discourse hath a Fifth
loose Foot to clap on at need, as if
Four had not sufficed to praevaricate
with, p. 11; where <hi>It</hi> exercises <hi>It</hi>'s
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60436:29"/>
uncouth nimbleness in syllogizing: but
never was any thing more ridiculously
aukward. Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had, <hi>Letter</hi> p. 35.
mentioned an argument used by those
who hold the Affirmative of Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
<hi>That it necessarily belongs to
the Original and Fountain-Being to be the
First Cause of whatsoever Being, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that what there is of Positive Being
in any the most Wicked Action; must princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
owe it self to the Determinative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
Influence of this First and Soveraign
Cause, otherwise it would seem that there were
some Being that were neither</hi> Primum, <hi>nor</hi>
a Primo. This was as plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
laid out as possible, but must
for sooth be cast into a Logical Figure,
where the officiousness argues the
fraud, as of those who make false
Plate imbezilling part of the Metal,
and yet make the Owner pay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
for the Fashion. This is the
Discourses Syllogism. <hi>All Positive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are Effects of the First Cause. All sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ull
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60436:29"/>
Actions</hi> (for, It adds, <hi>this is our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation</hi>)
<hi>are Positive Beings;</hi> Ergo, <hi>All
sinfull Actions, as Actions, are Effects of
the First Cause.</hi> So that here, by a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistical
Legerdemain, that term so
essential in their Argument, as cited by
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> the <hi>Determinative Productive
Influence of the First and Soveraign Cause,</hi>
is cleanly conveyed away out of sight;
the Proposition undertaken to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that <hi>God doth by an Efficacious
Influence universally Move and Determine
Men to all their Actions, even those Actions
that are most Wicked;</hi> or, as <hi>It</hi> lately va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<hi>Limits Men to This Action rather than
to That,</hi> is turned out of doors by it's
own foster-father, the keeping of it
being grown it seems too chargeable;
and all now that is inferred is only that
<hi>all sinfull Actions, as Action, are Effects of
the First Cause.</hi> And what is that to the
purpose? If Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> must neither
be allowed the use of his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
nor upon the Ground which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60436:30"/>
they both were agreed on, it appears
that his Challenger, notwithstanding
all <hi>It</hi>'s bravades, had no design, or but
little disposition to meet him. The
whole of this may in a just sense be
granted without prejudice to Mr. <hi>Howe's</hi>
Cause. For it matters not that they
are <hi>Effects,</hi> unless it be also said and
proved that they are <hi>Effects produced by
God's Determinative Influence.</hi> Yet how
much Powder is spent without doing
the least execution! First a Categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
then an Hypothetical Syllogism
fired at him, then forces him to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
which is among Disputants
next to crying quarter, but will not
give it him; runs him through with
three Replies to his Distinction, and
leaves him dead upon the place. While
the Proposition is all this while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht,
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> is out of Gun-shot,
and his Adversary (if one that only
skirmishes with himself, deserves to be
called so) is afraid to take aim, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60436:30"/>
starts meerly at the Report of his own
Musquet. Thus hath <hi>The Discourse</hi>
Five several times altered the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Question; which is my Fourth
Instance of <hi>It</hi>'s Ignorance and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about the matter in Controversie;
unless it ought to be interpreted as an
argument rather of a strong brain, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many times, and suddenly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round, not to have faln down sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Instance to the same Head,
Mr. <hi>Howe, Letter,</hi> p. 36, 37. had said,
<hi>It seems infinitely to detract from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Ever Blessed God, to affirm
that he was not able to make a Creature of
such a Nature, as being continually sustained
by him, and supplied with power every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
suitable to it's Nature, should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of acting, unless what he thus inables
he</hi> determine (<hi>that is, for it can mean no
less thing,</hi> impel) <hi>it to do it also.</hi> To this
<hi>The Discourse</hi> replies p. 15. <hi>If we should
take liberty of judging things by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearanee
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60436:31"/>
at first sight, without giving our
selves the trouble of a strict Disquisition</hi>
(take whether you will, the Liberty or
the Trouble, only talk not so magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially)
<hi>we mght easily be seduced into an
imagination that it does no less infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the Divine Perfection to affirm;
that God was not able to make a Creature of
such a Nature, as that it might continually</hi>
sustain <hi>it self, without a supply of power
every moment from God. For that opinion
seems to tye God to a shorter Tedder</hi> (how
trivial and irreverently spoken!) <hi>than
an ingenious Artificer who can raise an Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
that shall last many years without any
need of his help for reparations.</hi> Compare
now these two together, and mark
what this Reasoning of <hi>The Discourse</hi>
amounts to. Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> conceives (else
it were very hard) that a Creature
may <hi>Act,</hi> being inabled by a continual
supply of power from God every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore quoth <hi>It,</hi> A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may <hi>Be,</hi> without being sustained
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60436:31"/>
or supplied from God any moment. But
this parhaps was only to show how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious.
<hi>It</hi>'s first apprehensions, and
how candid are <hi>It's</hi> first inclinations;
and whether <hi>It</hi> were <hi>easily seduced</hi> It
self, or had a mind to seduce others, <hi>It</hi>
likes this conceit so well that <hi>It</hi> cannot
yet let it go, but subjoyns immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>And this I the rather take notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I find it the sentiment of the most acute</hi>
Suarez, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, whereas others find
their second Thoughts to be the more
judicious, <hi>It's</hi> judging thus <hi>at First
Sight,</hi> seems more accurate then <hi>It</hi>'s
Second <hi>Seeming:</hi> They, <hi>ib. who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
God's immediate operation in every
action of the Creature,</hi> (<hi>which</hi> Mr. Howe
<hi>seems to do in his Answer now under dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion</hi>)
<hi>will doubtless be compelled to deny
that the Creature does depend immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Actual Influence of God.</hi> So <hi>It</hi>
quotes the most acute <hi>Suarez.</hi> Met.
Disp. 20. This is a most exemplary
and Primitive Charity, whereby <hi>The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60436:32"/>
Discourse</hi> hath sold all its own acuteness
to give it to the poor <hi>Suarez;</hi> so that it
hath reduced it self to that desperate
and utmost dulness, as herein to say,
<hi>They who deny what</hi> Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> seems <hi>by
this Answer to do,</hi> that is as much as to
say, They who suppose with Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
that a Creature may act being inabled
by God every moment, without being
impelled, (which he above, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
modestly asserts) will doubtless
be <hi>compell'd to deny</hi> that the Creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
immediately upon the Actual
Influence of God, which is tantamount
in sense, which useth to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to say, It seems to be denied
that the Creature does depend, because
it is affirmed to depend. Ought not
Bills to be put up for men affected
with so peculiar a distemper? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in the whole Common Prayer
find any that is proper for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>Another Instance (for they do so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60436:32"/>
multiply on me in reading, that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to number them, and yet they are
so signal in their kind, that they are
not to be omitted) is p. 96. and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
the vain attempt to reconcile
God's Predetermining by Efficacious
Influence to Wicked Actions with his
Wisdom and Sincerity by the same
<hi>Mediums</hi> that were used by Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
to reconcile his Prescience of them,
yet this is undertaken to be done
from p. 96. for several pages forward,
and with the same confidence which is
alwaies necessary to such as promise
impossibilities. But it is in the mean
time an high contempt of all other
men, and presumption of ones own
Understanding that can imbolden to
such an Argument. Who is there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Adam</hi> gave him his Name, but sees
the difference between having an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon Men's Wicked Actions, and
having no Influence, which Prescience,
as such, cannot signifie him to have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60436:33"/>
hat foreknows? But nevertheless
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath expresly enough assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and explained the Influence God
hath on all Humane Actions.</p>
               <p>For further Instance, see what <hi>The
Discourse</hi> saith, p. 61. and so along,
struggling to bring the immediate
Concourse, which Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> speaks of
and avows, under the same prejudice
with Predetermination, which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
and argues against: For all that
idle indeavour might have been saved
and prevented by a small supplement
of Understanding or Memory. For
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> alwaies distinguishes (and
so might any ordinary capacity for him,
should he have trusted either that or
men's common Ingenuity) between
Concurring, though never so Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
by an Influence which doth
<hi>but Inable</hi> to an Action, and by that
which doth <hi>Determine</hi> to it, or <hi>impell.</hi> If
any man do but carry this about with
him, as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> does thorow his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60436:33"/>
whole troublesome Journey, it is a
certain remedy against all Gauling,
at least by this Argumentation.</p>
               <p>One thing I could not but remark
here, p. 61. of <hi>The Discourse</hi> in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
how jovial <hi>It</hi> is and bucksom,
which is just the humour of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
bloodily cruel, and yet at the
same time full of dissoluteness and
laughter. <hi>I will pause a little with
the Readers leave, and try my skill
what answer I can excogitate for
Mr.</hi> Howe, <hi>which will not be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
friend to us both</hi> (pleasant) <hi>as
we have been hitherto one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I hope shall remain notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this Publick Contest.</hi> Dear
<hi>Damon,</hi> doubtless. But I perceive
not that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath yet had any
Contest with you, nor, if I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, is he likely to have for
the future, but will avoid you for
several reasons. Is this your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
what then and how terrible
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60436:34"/>
is your Malice? The Ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
of Friendship, and which made
some pairs so illustrious, were which
of them should die for the other,
not which should cut the others
throat. The utmost that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
upon such Publick Contests,
or that I think a man is bound to in
Christianity, hath been to pardon
such a Friend, and bid him do his
office. Here is to be seen or play'd
<hi>T. D.</hi> indeed, or <hi>Amity a la Mode.</hi>
But go on, <hi>This Distinction is an
open Friend to us, and to which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon all fit occasions we pay our
respects.</hi> This is prity, and most
softly said, as if it were by the Great
<hi>Mogul</hi> lying upon a silken-bed, and
leaning upon Cushions. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
'tis a new Invention, being the
first time this that ever I heard of a
man that contracted Friendship with
a Distinction; but most wise men,
(and so I think should Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60436:34"/>
have been used to distinguish with
whom they contract it. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
speaking of Determination
and Concurrence, these are the
words; <hi>But that it waits a fitter
time to speak out</hi> Her <hi>mind,</hi> She <hi>could
say that</hi> She <hi>conceives not how</hi> She
<hi>can compel the Will,</hi> &amp;c. (of this
compelling the Will, I shall have
occasion also to speak out my mind
hereafter). What use was to be made
of a <hi>She</hi> in this place, I cannot well
Imagine. At last <hi>The Discourse</hi>
grows perfectly wanton. <hi>If</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Concurence <hi>thinks</hi> Her self
<hi>disobliged to satisfie an inquisitive Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
as to the</hi> Modus <hi>or manner
how</hi> She <hi>joyns with the Creature in
an Action to which Sin does necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
adhere,</hi> &amp;c. What would a man
think of this? A Female! <hi>An Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Concurrence!</hi> What sport
were here prepar'd for that which
is by our Moderns called Wit, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60436:35"/>
is no more than the luxuriant sterility
of Land, nor broken up or manur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
In the mean time, if <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
be really at so much ease, as
<hi>It</hi> would seem by this way of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
'tis but a security of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
like that of Conscience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
guilty persons confirm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves for the present.</p>
               <p>I shall now come to the last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Article. Not that I
want abundance of more, or might
not produce the whole Book in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but because it were time that
I came to some period: And lest
<hi>The Discourse</hi> should think I avoided
<hi>It</hi>'s main strength, I shall there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
It, where <hi>It</hi> pretends to no
less than Demonstration. For never
was there thing so dreadfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred
and armed <hi>Cap-a-pe</hi> in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
Categorical and Hypothetical
Syllogisms, Majors, Minors, Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mems,
Antecedents, Consequents,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60436:35"/>
Distinctions, Definitions, and now
at last <hi>Demonstration,</hi> to pin the
basket: Terms that good Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
as a meer novice is presum'd to be
unacquainted with, and so far from
being able to endure the ratling of
<hi>The Discourses</hi> Armour, that as those
<hi>Roman</hi> Legions once bragg'd, even
the sweaty smell of <hi>It</hi>'s Arm-pits
would be sufficient to rout him. But
some Creatures are as safe by their
weaknesse, as others by their
strength, from being medled with by
a considerable Adversary. I that
cannot boast of any extraordinary
faculty for Disputation, nor yet
confess my self void of common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
am therefore the most
proper perhaps to try the force of
this Demonstration; and whether
<hi>The Discourse</hi> be not therein as
feeble, as it was lately short in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.
<hi>It</hi> p. 25. quotes Mr. <hi>Howe,
Postsc.</hi> p. 28. that he does <hi>really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60436:36"/>
God</hi>'s Immediate Concourse <hi>to
all</hi> Actions <hi>of his Creatures both</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatione
Virtutis &amp; Suppositi, <hi>yet
not</hi> Determinative to Wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
then <hi>The Discourse</hi> proceeds:
<hi>We shall adventure a Demonstration
that it implies a Contradiction for God
to make a Creature that can Act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Predetermination,</hi> i. e. <hi>applying it
to Action and to one rather than to
another Action. And 'tis this, That
such a Creature would be but</hi> Ens Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarium,
<hi>a Second Being, not</hi>
(Causa Secunda, <hi>a Second Cause, or,</hi>
(<hi>which is all one</hi>) <hi>God should be but</hi>
Ens Primum, <hi>not</hi> Causa Prima, <hi>the
First Being, not the First Cause,</hi> which
it proves thus; 1. <hi>If God does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
only by</hi> Simultaneous (an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
term of <hi>The Discourse</hi>'s own
production) <hi>Concourse, and not by</hi>
Predetermination, <hi>or Previous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then God cannot be the Cause of
the Actions of the Creatures, as they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60436:36"/>
proceed from them: But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is absurd, and</hi> It <hi>presumes
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>will not own it.</hi> What
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> may do, being thus hard
put to it, I will not undertake: but
surely there was never any thing
affirm'd with less truth or sense than
<hi>The Discourse</hi> here doth, that <hi>God
should be the Cause of the Actions of
the Creatures, as those Actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from them.</hi> One would think
the Creatures themselves should be
the Causes of the Actions as they
<hi>proceed from them;</hi> (for how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are they Causes at all of those
Actions?) and God the Cause of
those Actions as they <hi>proceed from
him.</hi> Now how they proceed from
him Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath sufficiently
shown his own conception of it, <hi>viz.
as they are done by a sufficient Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which God Immediately affords
to inable the Creature to do them, not
to Determine it thereto.</hi> And is not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60436:37"/>
God to be entitled a <hi>Causa Prima</hi>
as well as <hi>Ens Primum,</hi> in reference
to what is done by his Influence in
the way before expressed? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if God be the Cause of the
Actions of the Creatures, as those
Actions proceed from <hi>Them,</hi> the
Action must be done by his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
alone, and then he should not
be <hi>Causa Prima,</hi> because then there
were no <hi>Causa Secunda.</hi> But this
was only sure <hi>The Discourses</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
the next that follows it-stration.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had, as before cited,
<hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 28. avowed God's Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Concourse to all Actions of his
Creatures, both <hi>Immediations Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
&amp; Suppositi.</hi> Upon which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of his <hi>It</hi> argues thus (with
this prelusory vaunt, p. 26. <hi>He is
twice killed that is killed with his own
Weapon,</hi> so that no less than sudden
Death is to be expected in the case.)
<hi>If there be an Immediate Concourse,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60436:37"/>
then there is a Predetermination or
putting the Creature upon Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it Acts:</hi> or <hi>else the Creature is
the First Mover of it self to Action.</hi>
This is so unimaginably dull an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that really it requires a
proportionable dulness in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or an extraordinary acuteness to
comprehend it, and how it should
be deduced from Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Immediate Concourse.
For the argument so put receives
not the least strength, not any, from
that Concession of Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s, but
rather from his Non-concession, and
that he hath not yielded enough, and
as much as <hi>The Discourse</hi> would
have him, which pretends that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Concourse alone is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to exclude the Creature from
being the First Mover of it's own
Actions. For, whether Immediate
Concourse be granted, or not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the case is all one as to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60436:38"/>
while so much is not granted
whereby <hi>an account may be given how
God and the Creature joyn in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Action rather than another,</hi>
as <hi>The Discourse</hi> would have it, p. 27.
if Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> could have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to be thus Demonstrated
out of this Reason.</p>
               <p>The Illustration of It's <hi>plausible
Consequence,</hi> as 'tis called p. 27. may
perhaps be noted, and shall hereafter
in it's due place, but the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
carries the Bell away, and I
must yet follow it's tinkling. And
thus it goes on p. 27, 28. <hi>An account
how the particular Actions of any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures Will come to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
upon the exclusion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination,
I know none can be
given.</hi> And how is thus proved?
for sure to affirm it is not Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
Why, thus. <hi>Not by Chance:</hi>
(unless this saying so be an Instance
that it may in some cases) no body
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60436:38"/>
dream'd of any such thing but this
was put in, I suppose, only for more
harmony, &amp; to run Division. A good
slight it is, by proving first a thing
which no man denies to make it more
credible that the argument upon
the Subject in Controversie will be
as cogent. For the Question is upon
<hi>It's</hi> Second Member, <hi>Not by the
Creatures Self-determining Power,</hi> and
here <hi>The Discourses</hi> main strength
comes upon trial. <hi>For that, as such,
is indeterminate as to the Acts to
which we conceive it must be some
way or other Determined.</hi> Admirably
good! so it is indeed till the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> conceives, have
Determined it self: and so it will
be too if God be to Determine it,
Indeterminate till he have Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it. But if the Creature do
Determine it self (which if it never
do, how does <hi>The Discourse</hi> call it <hi>a
Self-determining Power?</hi>) then I
hope it is not Indeterminate. So
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60436:39"/>
that the whole stress of the Cause
which was to prove that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(<hi>so Influenced and Actuated by
God Immediately for any congenerous
Action,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath exprest
it) cannot Determine it self, is left
in the lurch, and no Demonstration
hath been given hitherto, but of
that Confusion and Ignorance with
which I have charged <hi>The Discourse</hi>
in this Article, about the matter in
Controversie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>It</hi> argues further, p. 28, 29.
and, with the same Demonstration,
from a second Concession (it were
methinks more ingenuous, to call it
a Declaration or Assertion) of Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi>'s of God's Immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and Predetermination to the
Production of Good Actions, and the
necessity thereof, pretends to infer
the Necessity of God's Immediate
Concourse and Predetermination
likewise to all (that is, even to the
most Wicked) Actions. But this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60436:39"/>
beside the ridiculousness, is so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an undertaking, that any pious
man, should he be superiour in the
contention, would repent of his
Victory; I shall here wave it; but
if <hi>The Discourse</hi> pride it self herein,
I give <hi>It</hi> the Joy as <hi>It</hi> deserveth.</p>
               <p>This Demonstration I had assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the last Instance of this Head;
but I think I may be dispensed with
to add another, it being an Act of
Charity. For there are yet behind
six Aricles more, some of them of a
more criminal and hainous nature
than those two that hitherto I have
insisted upon.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It</hi>'s Falsifications and Fictions
of what <hi>Mr. How</hi> hath not said.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It</hi>'s Injurious Perverting of what
he hath said.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It</hi>'s Odious Insinuations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
what there is no colour to
object against.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It</hi>'s Insolent Boasting and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60436:40"/>
Self-applause upon no occasion.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>It</hi>'s Gross Absurdities, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies,
Self-contradictions, and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
Expressions.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>The Wrath and Virulence of</hi>
It<hi>'s spirit.</hi> And oftentimes it chances
that one and the same Instance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable,
and may be reduced to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of these Heads. But therefore,
as oft as I can impute any thing
which might receive an higher ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
to <hi>It's</hi> Ignorance, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or Dulness (which it is lest in
any man's self-determining power to
remedy) I rather chuse to state it
upon this more innocent account.
And that hath been the Cause
which hath swell'd this Head beyond
equality: my intention, being to be
briefer on those that follow. I say
therefore, that it is out of Charity
that I here attribute <hi>It's</hi> Indifference
between the <hi>Modus</hi> of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and God's supposed Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60436:40"/>
to Wicked Actions to
<hi>It's</hi> stupidity rather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Article, or make a new one for
it on purpose. The thing is thus.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> Letter, p. 47, 48, 49, 50.
had, taking notice of an Argument
which some use from God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for his Predetermination,
said, among other things, very pious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>This supposed Indetermination of
the Humane Will, in reference espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to Wicked Actions, is far from
being culpable of inferring that God
cannot therefore foreknow them,</hi> &amp;c.
And after, upon consideration what
others had endeavoured towards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
or perplexing this matter,
modestly adds, <hi>For my own part, I
can more easily be satisfied to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the</hi> Modus <hi>or</hi> Medium <hi>of his
Knowledge, while</hi> I <hi>am sure of the
thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It cannot therefore be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful
a thing to suppose God's
Foreknowledge of the most Contingent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60436:41"/>
Future Actions well to consist with our
Ignorance how he foreknows them, as
that we should think it necessary to
overturn and mingle Heaven and
Earth rather than admit it.</hi> But
<hi>The Discourse,</hi> p. 32, 33. signifies,
and then by quoting some of these
words would confirm it, that we
need not be more sollicitous, and
are no more concerned to satisfie
our selves of the <hi>Modus</hi> of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
to sinful Actions, so as
to separate them from the sinfulness
of them, (for to hold the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is with <hi>It</hi> Demonstration) than
about the <hi>Modus</hi> of God's Prescience
of them. Which must argue (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else) a palpable shortness of
discourse to think there is no odds
betwixt a thing so plainly reveal'd
in the Word of God as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is, and so agreeable to all
rational apprehension, and a Notion
so altogether unrevealed as this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60436:41"/>
Predetermination yet appears,
and so contrary if not to the whole
scope and design of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet to all common understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and genuine sense of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But whensoever there shall be
so clear proof made that there is
such a thing as <hi>The Discourses</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination,
as may soon be
brought of Prescience, when it shall
be as duly stated among the Divine
Attributes, then, and not till then
ought men to practise the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
resignation of their reasoning
about it, as Mr. <hi>How</hi> hath laudably
done in that of Prescience: but in
the mean time it may be handled
not as <hi>Causa Dei,</hi> but <hi>Causa Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
it is lawful to plead against it,
and not to pay mens belief, but to
afford their Charity to its abetters.</p>
               <p>There was one called <hi>Antipheron,</hi>
whose name therefore seems rather
to have been given him by the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60436:42"/>
people from a natural defect they
observed in him than by his God-fathers:
He had a peculiar shortness
of sight, but which turned him to
account, and saved him the expence
of sending to <hi>Malamocco</hi> or <hi>Lambeth</hi>
to the Glass-house. He needed not
so much as contemplate himself in
<hi>Polyphemus</hi> his mirrour, the water.
He carried his Looking-glass alwaies
with him, the next Air supplied all,
and serv'd him not only to breath,
but to see his face in, without any
danger of staining or breaking it.
A great convenience thus to be able
every minute to blow himself a new
Looking-glass. But how happy
were it, if, what the shortness of his
sight, the dulness of mens minds
could have the same effect, to object
to them continually their own
Image, and make it unnecessary for
others to represent them. Then might
<hi>The Discourse</hi> also have excused me
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60436:42"/>
from this labour, and upon reflexion
with it self, have discern'd it's own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitness
and ignorance to manage this
or any other Controversie.</p>
               <p>For want of such an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
on <hi>It</hi>'s own defects, <hi>It</hi>'s natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
undistinctness seems to perceive
faults in others, and to find a mote in
their eye, neglects the Beam in <hi>It</hi>'s
own. <hi>It</hi> overlooks so gross a practice
as in it's p. 47. to translate out of
<hi>Strangius</hi> into <hi>English</hi> Doctor <hi>Twisse</hi>'s
Argumentation about the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of God of future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
undertaking still to demonstrate,
p. 46. (that is the word) that this
Foreknowledge depends upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Decree, while in the mean time
<hi>It</hi> never gives us, though the Book
was in <hi>It</hi>'s hand, <hi>Strangius</hi> his full and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate
answer to it in the same place,
lest any man should know of it; but,
to conceal it's own disability for any
reply to it, challenges Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60436:43"/>
answer Doctor <hi>Twisse</hi>'s irrefragable
Argument over again. But p. 16.
in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> It can find two <hi>unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
faults in a man of Learning and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Anticipation, For, he having
<hi>Letter,</hi> p. 36, 37. said, <hi>unless he Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
(that is to say, for it can mean no less
thing,</hi> Impel,) that is the word accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>the Creatuue to do it;</hi> this is made so
hainous, that I thought at first it had
been the Anticipation of the Revenue,
but, when all comes to all, I see it is
nothing but the explaining a word of
less obvious import by another more
obvious: and nothing is more usual
in <hi>The Discourse</hi> it self, and among men
of Learning. And <hi>The Discourse</hi> it self
adds here in the same minute <hi>Impelling,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Compelling (for that is Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s
sense of the term, as will appear ere long)</hi>
which is methinks as early, and a more
perverse Anticipation than Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> is
unpardonable for, by how much <hi>It</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60436:43"/>
does by these last words own that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
unless it signifie Compel, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
but affirms that in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
sense it is Compel, as will appear ere
long, which is moreover false, and
therefore I will be so subtile as to take
out my pardon in time for calling this
Anticipation; for indeed that which
neither is, nor ever can appear, <hi>ere
long or short</hi> (as for Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> to
mean Compel) cannot be Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated.</p>
               <p>But the second unpardonable fault
of Mr. <hi>Howe's</hi> is his <hi>immodest begging the
Question:</hi> And wherein? <hi>I may well
call it so</hi> (quoth <hi>The Discourse) because he
knows we neither can nor will grant his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
without ruining our Hypothesis.</hi> This
is all the proof assigned of his begging
the Question. I do indeed confess
that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> was much to blame in
urging an Argument to the ruine of
their precious Hypothesis; but I think
it falls not under that Predicament of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60436:44"/>
begging, though this does of robbing
the Question: and however his crime
is more excusable, because, in common
probability, Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> having writ
his Letter and Postscript before <hi>The
Discourse</hi> replied to him, might be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that it was <hi>It's</hi> dear Hypothesis.
For my part I take the very first Title
of the Book <hi>de Causa Dei,</hi> to be more
notoriously guilty both of Anticipation
and Begging the Question, than that
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> could have any thing upon
either account herein justly imputed or
objected to him.</p>
               <p>The third Artice of which I shall
Catalogue some, it being endless to
enumerate, all the Instances.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It's many strange Falsifications &amp; Fictions of
what Mr. Howe hath not said, and then
discoursing of them as if they were said.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for a first Instance. In it's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
p. 10. Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>is accused of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60436:44"/>
having</hi> denyed God's Immediate Concurrence
to all Actions, <hi>because</hi> Letter <hi>p. 36. he
saies (not, as</hi> The Discourse <hi>cites it,</hi> it
sufficiently salves, <hi>but</hi>) it may well be
thought sufficiently to salve the rights (and
priviledges, <hi>omitted</hi>) of the first Cause
that no Action can be done but by a power
derived from it, which, in reference to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Actions, intelligent Creatures may use
or not use as they please. <hi>Is any thing
said here that implies any denial of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Concurrence? Why may not
that Power derived be Immediate
to the Action? Is any thing said to
the contrary, or which accords not well
with what is pretended to be said</hi> ex
opposito? <hi>But, to make this Accusation
good, It conceals another passage in
the very same Paragraph.</hi> Besides that
it seems infinitely to detract from the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Ever Blessed God, to affirm he
was not able to make a Creature of such a
nature, as, being continually sustained by
him, and supplied with power every moment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60436:45"/>
suitable to its nature, should be capable of
Acting, unless whatsoever he thus Inables
he Determine it to do also. <hi>So that the
charge is founded meerly upon Mr.</hi>
Howe<hi>'s not having used the express
word Immediate Concurrence in that
sentence, and in concealing disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
what he had expressed, and what
fully includes Immediate Concurrence
in the sense that he afterwards asserts
and explains it,</hi> Postsc. <hi>p. 28. to be
both</hi> Immediatione Virtutis, <hi>and</hi> Suppositi <hi>to</hi>
all Actions, though not Determinative to
Wicked Actions. <hi>Although it would be
something ridiculous to say, that</hi> The
Discourse <hi>read one part of this with</hi>
It's <hi>eyes shut, and the other part with</hi>
It's <hi>eyes open; yet 'tis more false that
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>did there, or any where else
deny God's Immediate Concurrence;
and 'tis the best excuse of which this
(otherwise Forgery) is capable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second Instance. It feigns in the
same p. 10. that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath <hi>Postsc.</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60436:45"/>
P. 39. affirm'd <hi>Predetermination to all
Actions.</hi> It were strange if he should,
but pretended to be proved by these
his words, <hi>The Active Providence of God
about all the Actions of Men, consists not
meerly in giving them the natural powers,
whereby they can work of themselves,</hi> but <hi>in a
real Influence upon those powers.</hi> This is
(to speak the most softly, and indeed
more softly than the thing will admit)
an unking Interpretation, after what
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath been quoted to say in
my former Instance: but especially, if
<hi>The Discourse</hi> can or would be pleased
to consider (after <hi>It</hi>'s invidious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
generality in citing <hi>Letter,</hi> from
p. 32, to 50. and the <hi>Postscript,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
assigning one word) that Mr.
<hi>Howe's</hi> asserting here of God's real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon mens natural powers
does not at all imply that Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which he there all along op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
For can there be no Influence
but such as is Determining? He hath
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60436:46"/>
shown there both may be and is. How
often is there such Influence by the
operation of Common Grace as doth
not Determine?</p>
               <p>Third Instance. In the same p. 10.
Because Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 32.
said, <hi>Some Actions of the Creatures are in
themselves most malignantly wicked,</hi> and
<hi>Letter,</hi> p. 46. <hi>Intrinsecally Evil;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>It,</hi> falsly enough, reproaches him
to have by these words <hi>denied that
all Actions have in them a Natural Goodness:</hi>
Whereas Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> here speaks of
Actions as they are Morally Evil or
Wicked, that is, as specified by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to an undue Object. Is not such
a specifying Direction <hi>Intrinsecal?</hi> Is
not the specification of every thing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
to it? And so are not such
Actions truly said to be Evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
which so specified can by no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be made good. But <hi>Postsc.</hi>
p. 36. (which is produced to argue him
of Inconsistence) he owns that <hi>there is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60436:46"/>
not any Action so sinful, but hath some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
good as the substract matter thereof,</hi>
abstractly and physically considered,
(and yet so they can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by God or Man, but concreted
with their Individuating Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
nor doth the Affirming the one,
infer the Denial of the other. If it did,
<hi>The Discourse</hi> it self hath done the same
thing, p. 72. <hi>Thus some Actions are said
to be in themselves Evil, when they are
Evil in regard of their</hi> Object, &amp;c. <hi>Thus the
Hatred of God and Adultery are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Evil,</hi> &amp;c. But I suppose 'twould
judge it hard dealing to say that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>It</hi> denies (though it be an hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to affirm) that natural good which
is the substrate matter thereof, and
which alwaies at a dead lift <hi>It,</hi> hath
recourse to.</p>
               <p>Fourth Instance. From Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
having <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 33. said, <hi>Nothing is more
apparently a simple and most strictly natural
impossibility, than not to do an Action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60436:47"/>
the Agent is Determined by an Infinite
Power.</hi> It <hi>Epist.</hi> p. 11. hath the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
grosness to charge Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
with there affirming that Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
forces the Will; as if nothing
could make a thing naturally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to a man but force: he cannot
make a new Sun: but what force
hinders him? This is indeed Force,
or rather Fraud; for otherwise it is
impossible to deduce it. But whether
of them be used against a chosen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
makes it seems no scruple in a
Conscience diverted with Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Another Instance. <hi>It</hi> calumniates
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> p. 87. to have <hi>asserted the
Positivity of Sin,</hi> and there calls it, <hi>the
foundation of his Hypothesis,</hi> proceeding
with great pains to disprove it <hi>borrows
one Argument,</hi> to lead him with, <hi>from
the most Learned</hi> Dr. Barlow, <hi>the now
renowned Bishop of</hi> Lincoln, urges the
<hi>Minor,</hi> then the <hi>Major,</hi> and draws up a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60436:47"/>
whole Process, as if it were in the
Spiritual Court, against him, and
<hi>T. D.</hi> were become his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
There is none in <hi>England,</hi>
nor especially Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but would reverence the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that Excellent Person in
all points of Learning or Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
But <hi>The Discourse</hi> is too
bold to make use of his Power
without his Commission, in a Case
where Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath not said
one word to affirm such Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>A further Instance. With the
same Truth that is Falshood <hi>It</hi> feigns,
and that often, that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> by God's
having Irresistible Influence upon the
Will means <hi>God's Forcing of the Will unto
the most Wicked Actions.</hi> As for example,
p. 39. from Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s, p. 40. <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly,
that is in his sense Forcibly.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> there objects to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
their holding such an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60436:48"/>
Determination of the Will, but
Forcing of it no where. Yet at what
expence of Learning, and with how
much loss of Ink and Ingenuity does
<hi>The Discourse</hi> argue that the Will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be forc'd! which Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
denied that Irresistible Influence
must of necessity disown for it's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absurdity, had he thought his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
guilty of it. But he appears
to have been far from imagining it of
them, nor could any but <hi>The Discourse</hi>
have imputed it to him as his sense,
that God does by Force whatsoever he
does Irresistibly. What Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is there, or how can <hi>The Discourse</hi>
justifie such a Falsification but by
Custom?</p>
               <p>If that shall be a sufficient Plea, It
will never want Instances further to
warrant the Practice. As in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
(Forgery I may not call it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to do with such exactness, but) Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> having been upon the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60436:48"/>
Argument of the Will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that perish, had Letter p. 12.
said, <hi>The Resolve of the Divine Will in
this matter, was not concerning the Event,</hi>
what he shall do (i. e. abstractly and
singly, as these next following words
shew) <hi>but concerning his Duty what he
should, and concerning the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Duty and his Happiness.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
what does mean <hi>The Discourse?</hi>
p. 116. It refers to those words of his,
p. 112. and recites a further passage of
his <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 115, 116. to argue them
of repugnancy these to the former, but
to that purpose conceals Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
last Clause, <hi>but concerning his</hi> Duty
<hi>what he should, and concerning the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<hi>between his Duty and his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi>
which being taken in, as it ought,
there could have been no pretence of
Inconsistency. And it adds that
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s <hi>Answer Letter.</hi> p. 116. <hi>that
Imperfection is no way imputable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will meerly for not Effecting every
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60436:49"/>
thing whereto it may have a Real Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is no Answer to the Objection:</hi> upon
this strange pretence, that, <hi>a Real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of Will is no Will,</hi> as if it were a
thing impossible that Propension
should be either Habitual or Actual.</p>
               <p>So also for continual Instance. <hi>The
Discourse</hi> p. 118, 119. feigns a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to have been proposed by
Mr. <hi>Howe, Whether it be fitting for God
efficaciously to overpower all men into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the overtures he makes to them
in Common:</hi> and then <hi>It</hi> creates also an
Answer for him; <hi>It is not fit for God to
overpower men without making any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to them at all;</hi> and, to make a song
of three parts, judicially decides: <hi>the
Answer is not fitted to the Question.</hi> I must
confess that upon some former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
I doubted of the Rectitude of
It's Judgment, but I was not wary
enough to suspect a Falshood, which
must be so notorious, as that there
should be no such Question or Answer.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60436:49"/>
But in good truth none there is that I
can find of Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s mark. The
Question no where in Terms, but the
Answer neither in terms nor sense, nor
any thing like it. So that <hi>The Discourse</hi>
is not to be allowed in any Court ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Competent Judge, or a Legal
Witness, but may deserve to be tryed
for this as a Criminal before any Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick-tribunal.
Nor needs there any
other Evidence against it for Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
than those very words of Mr.
<hi>Howe,</hi> that <hi>It</hi> there hath cited. <hi>Grace
sometimes shows it self in preventing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in working so heroically as none
have beforehand [in the neglect of it's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
method] any reason to expect.</hi> Letter
p. 138. Now look back upon the
supposititious Answer, <hi>to whom God
makes no overtures at all;</hi> Then compare
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s words <hi>in the neglect of it's
ordinary methods:</hi> And now let any man
judge of the Honesty of such an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.
For can they be said to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60436:50"/>
God's ordinary methods to whom
he makes no overtures at all? Nor is
the second scheme of It's Question and
Answer which immediately follows
any whit better, but guilty of as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Forgery as the first, and so ill
contriv'd, that it neither agrees with
the former, nor with the Book,
though pretending to be a true Copy.</p>
               <p>And an Instance it is of the same
Fraud to feign, p. 119, 120. that
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> in his <hi>Letter</hi> hath, abstractly
from the more fit course that God hath
taken, <hi>determin'd the unfitness of God's
giving grace and salvation to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath said therein
amounts only to assert the course which
is not taken to be less fit, and that God
doth from the perfect rectitude of his
own nature, take that course which
was to be taken most wisely, and do
that which was most congruous and
fit to be done, <hi>Letter</hi> p. 149. What can
better become us than to judge so of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60436:50"/>
the waies that God hath pitched upon,
and wherein we have God's own
choice to precede and be a guide to our
judgment?</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this Article with
<hi>It</hi>'s quotation, p. 44. out of Dr. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Comment on <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 13. p. 101.
as if that Learned Divine had affirmed
the disputed Predetermination by
those words. <hi>Many who grant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
deny Preordination, (viz.</hi> quoth <hi>The
Discourse,</hi> the Decree whereof Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
is the execution, so I
understand him) <hi>lest they should make
God the Author of sin;</hi> and <hi>It</hi> forsooth
understands him so, but I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any obligation to better and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
judgments. For what one word
is there here that can imply that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to be executed by the way
of Predetermination? It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> be not secure while
yet living, when those that are at rest
cannot escape so notorious a practice.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60436:51"/>
This is the same as to cut off a dead
man's hand to subscribe with it to
a Forgery. There needed no less
it seems than Doctor <hi>Manton's</hi> good

to give a better odour to those

this exercise, whether Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s gloss
upon</hi> Act. 4. 28. <hi>doth not corrupt the Text.</hi>
If they had known they would not
have crucified the Lord of Glory.)
That is, God foreseeing wicked hands would
be prompt and ready for this tragick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
his soveraign Power, and wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
concurred with his Foreknowledge, so only
and not with less latitude, to define or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the bounds and limits of that malignity
than to let it proceed unto this execution.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60436:52"/>
What common sense or ordinary inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
could have found less in these
words than that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> doth therein
at least profess the Foreknowledge and
the Decree to have been <hi>sunul &amp; seniel,</hi>
which is far from affirming the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be antecedent? But
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had moreover, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before these words cited, said; <hi>It
was a thing which God's Hand and Counsel
had determined</hi> before <hi>to be done.</hi> But this
<hi>The Discourse</hi> conceals, lest <hi>It</hi> self should
be detected of such a wilful perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the better to make Doctor
<hi>Twisse</hi>'s censure (which otherwise had
been nothing to the business) take
place upon Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> p. 46. <hi>Those Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
dictates of the foreseen Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Humane will before God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
are not the Dictates of Divines Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
but Dreaming.</hi> There was not
any colour in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s words for
any such imputation; though I doubt
not that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> believes God's
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60436:52"/>
Decree in this case to be but suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that Agency which he every
where supposes him to have in
things of that nature.</p>
               <p>A Second Instance of the same
dealing is upon Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 28. of God's Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Concourse to all Actions of
his Creatures. For p. 55. thence <hi>It</hi>
pretends that it follows, and that
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> implies that <hi>God affords
men a leading Concurrence to Actions
downright Evil.</hi> And yet Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
had but <hi>Postsc</hi> p. 29. explain'd and
limited that concession, saying, <hi>The
Concourse or Influence, which I deny
not to be Immediate to any Actions, I
only deny to be Determinative as to
those which are Wicked.</hi> Agreeably
to what he saith also <hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 45.
n. 9. But that limitation <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
takes not any notice of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
not to understand a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between inducing men to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60436:53"/>
Actions which God will reward, and
to those for which he will ruine
them. And upon this presumption
it falls into the usual fit of boasting
vain-gloriously over Mr. <hi>Howe.</hi> For
where Perversion may go for Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
Insolence may also pass for
Reason.</p>
               <p>I cannot but observe also how in
pursuit of this Subject, because
Mr. <hi>Howe Postsc.</hi> p. 35. cited <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 9.
with <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 9. to <hi>shew</hi> the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
and how much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it was to the Nature of God to
induce men by Determinative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
to Imperfectly good Actions
which yet lead to Salvation and
Blessedness, taen to such as are
downright Evil, and tend to their
ruine: <hi>It</hi> hereupon p. 58. frames a
Chain of Syllogistical Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all of <hi>It</hi>'s own devising, which
yet <hi>It</hi> hath the face to father upon
Mr. <hi>Howe.</hi> I call it the rather a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60436:53"/>
                  <hi>Chain,</hi> because I remember to have
read of one who had so singular a
faculty of linking one Lye artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
upon another, that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him at <hi>Rome</hi> by a new Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
<hi>Catena:</hi> and the dexterity of
<hi>The Discourse,</hi> in almost as sinister
a quality, might pretend to the
same denomination. The <hi>Samoiedes</hi>
wear Guts about their necks, but
swallow them at last down their
throats. The same natural <hi>Links</hi>
serving them first for ornament, and
then for nutriment: and were <hi>The
Discourse</hi> obliged to eat <hi>It</hi>'s own
words, and feed upon <hi>It</hi>'s own
Chain of Syllogisms, 'twere a diet,
though slender and unclean, yet fit
enough for a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> There is
nothing can be more savage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
than to personate Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
here arguing, <hi>If it be unlawful for
Man to destroy Life, then it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God.</hi> And then, as if it were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60436:54"/>
a formed Dispute, and wherein Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> maintain'd the Affirmative, It
denies the Antecedent, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and the Connexion of <hi>It</hi>'s
own (not, as is pretended Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s)
Enthymeme, and laboriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to disprove the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thorow the several members.
Let but any man have recourse to
that place of the <hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 35. and
consider whether there be any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
thence to suppose that Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> intended there, or gave any
occasion for such arguing; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the Blasphemies or Heresies
that ever were invented, might not
be imputed to him with as much
reason. I find my self so concern'd
hereat (not in behalf of Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>
but of all common morality among
mankind) that I think fit to repress
my self, and rather leave the Crime
to any Readers, or to <hi>The Discourses</hi>
own Censure; for, notwithstanding
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60436:54"/>
this and all <hi>It</hi>'s other Errours, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>It</hi> yet to have some intervals
both of Understanding and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>But a most undecent thing it
was for <hi>It</hi> to trifle in a matter so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and it had been far more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
to have given a clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>It's</hi> own Belief in this
point, than to have forged argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for others, create shadows for
<hi>It</hi> self to sport with, and to act in
one personage the Cause, the Judge,
the Witness, the Plaintiff, and the
Defendant. After all those To and
Fro<hi>'s,</hi> Up and Downs of so many
tedious pages that <hi>It</hi> obliges us to, if
we will go along with it thorow this
particular, might I not in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
crave leave to be solemnly
and soberly answered upon two or
three Questions arising upon this
debate for my own better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
First, whether It do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienciously
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60436:55"/>
believe that God doth
punish men for doing Actions which
in such and such circumstances he
hath forbidden them to do? Next,
whether it be not manifest that
according to It's opinion God must
Determine men to those Actions in
those circumstances, that is in the
same circumstances wherein they are
done? And lastly, whether that
Determining Influence can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?
If It once affirm all these,
as I see no tolerable evasion indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd,
but that It holds them all
<hi>pro confesso,</hi> how can It with all It's
Logick and Metaphysicks extricate
It self from maintaining that absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
that God ruines men for what
he hath induc'd them to, that is not
simply to destroy life (as It vainly
strives to shift off the business) but
to destroy it upon such terms? And
then how frivolous will all those
Answers, p. 55. and so forward appear
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60436:55"/>
to Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s argument mention'd
on a former occasion, <hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 33. 34.
<hi>We our selves can in a remoter kind
concur to the Actions of others: Yet
it doth not follow that because we may
afford our Leading Concurrence to
Actions imperfectly good, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may afford them to afford to
those that are downright Evil; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to Prayer, therefore to Cursing
and Swearing, and then ruine men
for the Actions me have induced them
to: You'l say, God may rather, but
sure he can much less do so than you.</hi>
Now <hi>The Discourse</hi> calls this (and
would blame it upon that account, as
comparing God and the Creature)
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s argument <hi>a Pari:</hi> But it
is methinks <hi>a Fortiori,</hi> and therefore
more reverent. If a well-natur'd
man would not do so, it is much
more disagreeable to God's Nature.</p>
               <p>In all these things Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> (and
'tis that makes me like him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60436:56"/>
declares his own sense plainly
however, while the other never
speaks out, unless to give ill words,
and seems to search not for the
Truth, but meerly for Contention.</p>
               <p>The last Evidence of this Article
shall be where <hi>It</hi> p. 111. takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to say Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> p. 106. <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
his dislike of the common distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of</hi> Voluntas Beneplaciti &amp; Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
<hi>in this present Case [viz.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
how God Wills the Salvation
of all, and yet only of some] <hi>under
which such as coined, and those that
have much used it, have only rather
(I doubt not) concealed a good meaning,
than expressed an ill one.</hi> Thus far
it quotes Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> but there stops
and saith, <hi>the rest is not worth the
trouble of transcribing;</hi> but I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suspect the more that that it
worth it, and out of some cunning
fetch omitted, and shall the rather
take that trouble upon me. <hi>It seems,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60436:56"/>
I <hi>confess, by it's more obvious aspect,
too much to countenance that ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
slander, which prophane and
atheistical dispositions would fasten
upon God and the course of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
toward men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as though
he only intended to seem willing of
what He really was not; That there
was an appearance to which nothing
did</hi> subesse. <hi>And then why is the
latter call'd</hi> Voluntas, <hi>unless the
meaning be, he did only Will the Sign,
which is false and impious?</hi> &amp;c. But
upon the former quotation out of
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> wherein he only excepts
against the Distinction <hi>in the present
Case,</hi> and signifies that a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was intended by it; <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> p. 116. represents him as
meaning the same thing with Dr.
<hi>Twisse</hi> (who also notes the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the latter member <hi>Voluntas
Signi,</hi> as improperly called a Will,
and only signifying Man's Duty)
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60436:57"/>
and <hi>blaming himself yet in blaming
him:</hi> When Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had in plain
words approved the meaning of the
Distinction. The gentlest imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
a man can frame to himself
hereof, is that <hi>It's</hi> own brain was
perverted before Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Article is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It's Odious Insinuations concerning
what It hath no colour to object or
except against.</head>
               <p>Of this I shall give three Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in one Paragraph. <hi>T. D.</hi> p. 103,
104. where <hi>It</hi> pretends first to be
<hi>at a strange loss for an Antecedent to a
Relative</hi> in Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Letter, p. 67.
<hi>Neither yet was it necessary that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
care should be taken they should
actually reach all, and be applied to
every individual person.</hi> The loss is
indeed a strange one, and I condole
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60436:57"/>
it. For <hi>It</hi> hath herein suffered great
damage of Eye-sight, Understanding,
Memory and Ingenuity, very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
disasters, and with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to be repaired. Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
immediate words in the foregoing
period were <hi>that the Divine Edicts
should be of an Vniversal tenour as
they are, the matter of them being of
Vniversal concernment, and equally
suitable to the common case of all men.</hi>
Now add to these words as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in that place, <hi>Neither yet was it
necessary they should actually reach all,</hi>
and then say whether any man else
would not have seen that the <hi>They</hi>
here was Relative to the <hi>Divine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts:</hi>
beside that the whole Tract
of the foregoing Argument leads
and refers continually to them. But
then, when after a long loss <hi>It</hi> hath,
casting about even to <hi>Postsc.</hi> p. 35.
and 40. <hi>out of love to Mr.</hi> Howe<hi>'s
person and the Truth,</hi> hit it at last to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60436:58"/>
be the Divine Edicts <hi>of which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>meant it,</hi> yet then <hi>It</hi>
suggests from those words of his,
<hi>Neither yet was it necessary</hi> (that is
to the purpose Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, the Vindicating of God's
Wisdom and Sincerity, as any sober
Reader will easily see) as if they
were thought not at all necessary.
If this be candour, what is black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
It is as much as to say, that,
unless it be necessary for the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of God's Wisdom and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to provide that every man
should have a Bible and read it, it
is no way necessary for man's sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The Second Instance in the same
Paragraph is to quote Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
p. 69. <hi>And thus how easily and
even</hi> naturally (<hi>by Messengers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from Nation to Nation, some to
communicate, others to enquire after
the tidings of the Gospel) would the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60436:58"/>
Gospel soon have spread it self through
the World?</hi> and hereupon to suggest
as if Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> thought <hi>the seeds of
the Gospel were in men by nature.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Understanding and Wilful Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
be the same thing, no man
could have avoided the sense of the
word <hi>Naturally</hi> here, to be, easily,
and of course. But if that term had
been intended in the strict sense
(though the mollifying of it by that
particle, <hi>even,</hi> shows it was not)
how could the Inquiry after a thing
new, and said to be of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
be Natural, although the
thing it self were not?</p>
               <p>And the Third is; Whereas Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> had, <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 75, 76, 77. enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated
many Instances of God's
Clemency and Bounty to Men in
general, and added that, <hi>they might
by these understand God to have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
propensions towards them;
and that though they have offended
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60436:59"/>
him, he is not their implacable enemy,
and might by his Goodness be led to
Repentance,</hi> that hereupon <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
p. 104. having nothing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
against any particular of what
is there said, brings in Mr. <hi>Iohn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
to have writ somewhat of the
like import in his <hi>Pagans Debt and
Dowry;</hi> and the like quotations it
cites afterwards from Mr. <hi>Hoard,</hi>
which is all for spight, but nothing
to the purpose. Could <hi>It</hi> have laid
down an <hi>Antithesis</hi> to any thing
that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> here said, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it would have gone that way
to work, and not have used this
<hi>Pagan</hi> invention of baiting Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
in the skins of others; or daubing
him over with pitch to serve for
Torch-light, and put out the light
of the Gospel. But 'tis more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<hi>It</hi> would have proceeded both
waies; for <hi>It</hi>'s Zeal for the Truth
seems not greater than <hi>It</hi>'s Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60436:59"/>
against Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> whencesoever
it arises. But <hi>It</hi> durst not adventure
to say that Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath made
Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi>'s ill use of this
notion. Had there been any such
thing, <hi>The Discourse</hi> seems not in
humour to have past it over, and
that calumnious figure of <hi>Meliora
Spero,</hi> hoping the best of him, but
suggesting the worst, would have
been changed to a plain accusation.
If <hi>It</hi> would have dealt fairly, here
was the proper place to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, and have told us distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>It's</hi> own opinion in so weighty a
matter. Does it know what God
(though most unobliged) might do
to furnish such with what might be
sufficient, if they seriously desired
such mercy at his hands? Will <hi>It</hi>
think <hi>It</hi> self bound to tear <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.
out of <hi>It's</hi> Bible, because <hi>Iohn
Goodwin</hi> hath cited it? Or, will <hi>It</hi>
adventure to be the Heathens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60436:60"/>
at the day of Judgment, that
they have no more considered the
tendency of the Divine Goodness?</p>
               <p>These indeed would have been
worthy Atchievements, and proper
to one of so great enterprize; but to
throw upon Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> an undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
obloquy of other mens names
in this manner, how base a thing,
was it? considering besides how
<hi>It</hi>'s own name (though hitherto stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
concealed,) might in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude
of humane affairs, serve
men hereafter for a more infamous
quotation.</p>
               <p>I shall add no more than p. 108.
It's citing Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Letter, p. 89,
90. <hi>That which God's declarations
do amount to is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that, if they
which finally perish, neglect to attend
to those external discoveries of the
Word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they are not to expect he
should overpower them by a strong
hand, and save them against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continual
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60436:60"/>
disinclination of their own Wills,</hi>
upon which <hi>It</hi> saith, <hi>I am not able to
make sense of the last words, for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not what overcoming by a strong hand
(in a sinner's case) God can make use of
that leaves the Will under disinclination to
Satvation.</hi> What reason or occasion
do Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s words give for making
this puzzle? Could it not understand
that some men are so unreasonable as
to expect Salvation, while yet at the
same time they are disaffected to the
means of it? And that some, because
they dislike the ordinary means, please
themselves with an hope that God
will at last cast use some extraordinary,
to overcome that disaffection?</p>
               <p>The Sixth Article.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It's most unseemly and insolent boastings and
self-applauses upon no occasion.</head>
               <p>Yet therefore the more frequent,
as his <hi>killing Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>with his own
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60436:61"/>
weapon,</hi> p. 26. in <hi>It</hi>'s Argument
about Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s two Concessions, the
vanity whereof as to the first I have
before noted: And now as to what
he brags of against the second as a
<hi>Triumphant Evidence,</hi> I shall no less
shew <hi>It</hi>'s impertinency. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is <hi>It</hi>'s own, p. 30. <hi>If it be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
of the Power to Individual
Actions that makes an Excitation of them,
to one rather than to another, necessary.</hi> Stay
here: <hi>It</hi> takes this for granted, and as
it is in it self destitute of strength, so
<hi>It</hi> leaves it very unkindly without any
proof or assistance to shift as well as
it can. Whereas <hi>It</hi> knows that 'tis said
on the opposite part, <hi>That it is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
meerly (which the Self-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
power of the Will can remove) but
aversion to good Actions (which gracious
Habits do lessen, but not remove) that makes
God's holy Determining Influence necessary.</hi>
Now let it go on, <hi>and the possibility of
Action contained in the Powers that makes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60436:61"/>
the reducing of that possibility to Action no
less necessary to good Actions:</hi> If there be
any sense in this, it is very recondite,
and would require a spirit that can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
hidden treasure; Can Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Action make Action necessary?
It must be as false as it is true, that an
Argument can be drawn from Power
to Act, affirmatively. Indeed, should
it have said, where there is only a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of Action, that possibility must
be reduced to Action, before there
can be any Action, it were true, but
then it is one of these things that are
<hi>Nimus vera,</hi> and which it is ridiculous to
put into any proposition, much more
where it is to no purpose. As here it
is manifestly to none; for we are still
left as uncertain, as if no such thing
had been said, what it is that must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that possibility to Action. But
that it should be added <hi>no less necessary
to good Actions,</hi> is beyond the power of
Witchcraft to understand what it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60436:62"/>
should mean here. Doth it pretend to
be discoursing with any one that
thought Determination to good
Actions less necessary? I thought it's
present part was to oppose one that
said it was more necessary. And yet
this most insignificant Scheme of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is shut up with a <hi>Quod erat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrandum,</hi>
and with the Phantastry
of claiming to it evidence equal to
what the Apostles words carry, <hi>Rom,</hi>
11. 36. For it was to those words that
My. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Letter, p. 62. gave those
<hi>lofty Epithets</hi> of <hi>Triumphant Evidence,</hi>
which <hi>The Discourse</hi> cavils at, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
with no mind to restore them,
to adorn the street-pageantry of this
pitiful Argument.</p>
               <p>Another Instance may be <hi>It's</hi> Jovial
rant, p. 37. <hi>What is now become of Mr.</hi>
Howe<hi>'s thin Sophistry, and collusive Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity?</hi>
&amp;c. It is necessary to read up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion from It's p. 32. l. 12.
at least to p. 37. l. 14. for it is too
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60436:62"/>
long to insert here such a parcel of
stuff, but there you may have it. <hi>It</hi>'s
business here is to defend the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminers
Opinion against the charge
of God's necessitating men to sin, and
of attempting to alleviate it by God's
being above Law, but Man under it.
Let me conjure any Reader by the
most potent charms of perswasion, by
all that is ridiculous in <hi>It</hi>'s whole
Book, or in mine, but to peruse at
leisure how miserably those points are
there along managed. <hi>It</hi> owns at
first that it is <hi>an hard Province to answer
to all the Objections,</hi> then softens it, as
fire mollifies clay, and at last, after
having confessed and begged, comes
off with that glorious exaltation over
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s thin Sophistry. It were
needless to exemplifie all the like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
where it arrogates Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it self beyond what any friend,
and vilifies Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> below what any
other enemy would offer at both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undeserved.</p>

               <head>It's very gross Absurdities, Self-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and Inconsistencies, to which may

a little reflecting on God and Religion.</head>
               <p>As first p. 18. <hi>It</hi> discourses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the security of good Angels
by God's determining Influence, which
no man that I know will quarrel for,
and by which I doubt not it supposes
their Immutability, but p. 20. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Man, <hi>It</hi> saith, that <hi>God made him
Mutable</hi> (and <hi>how could he do otherwise,
unless he should have made him a God?</hi>)
what then, doth it conceive that the
good Angels are Gods? Such like
was <hi>It</hi>'s absurdity, p. 27. of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Predetermination, because
God's Immediate Concourse could
not determine <hi>Adam</hi>'s Will. Than
which, what can be more notorious?
the Controversie being, Whether God
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60436:63"/>
doth determine Men to Wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but <hi>It</hi>'s Argument to this Effect;
That, if God do not determine Men
to such Wicked Actions by Concourse,
he doth it, as elsewhere <hi>it</hi> calls it, by
Precourse. Whereas it should have
known the thing denied by Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
to be, that God doth by Efficacious
Influence determine to them at all.
And so <hi>It</hi>'s Argumentation there sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
only that if God do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to them, he doth determine
to them.</p>
               <p>A third Instance is where p. 40.
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> having <hi>Letter</hi> p. 17. 47. said
that the <hi>Argument from the pretended Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilty
of God's foreknowing Sinful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if he did not determine the Agent to
them, will not infer, that if he determine
not to them, he cannot foreknow them, but
only that we are left ignorant of the way.
It</hi> collects thence p. 41. (and <hi>thinks
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>hath much overshot himself</hi>)
<hi>that he universally denies our knowledge of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60436:64"/>
the way how God foretells future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
Whereas Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> Letter p. 35.
stated their Argument in express
words, <hi>that it were otherwise impossible
God should foreknow the Sinful Actions of
men,</hi> and here 47. only saith, <hi>the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
infers so much and no more,</hi> as to
<hi>Wicked Actions,</hi> yet <hi>It</hi> makes this an
universal denial as to all Actions:
Hereby it is easie to judge, which of
the two is the better Archer, or came
nearer the mark, which shot home,
and which over.</p>
               <p>That for a Fourth is what you
please for to call it, p. 70. but a pretty
innocent thing of the like nature <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
Imports,</hi> It saith, <hi>A Relation of
the Action of the Agent to some resistance,</hi>
which is pleasant, by how much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to imagine how that which
cannot be resisted imports that which
is resisted.</p>
               <p>But this p. 76. is a most refined ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
while in the same place <hi>It</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60436:64"/>
taunts Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> for <hi>gratifying his own
unscholastick homour.</hi> Something <hi>is said
to be Impossible respectively, as if a man
will fly that he should have wings.</hi> But
this among duller men hath hitherto
been thought an instance of what
is quite contrary, to wit, of Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Necessity. And if <hi>It</hi> should find
<hi>It</hi> self hereafter obliged to fly from <hi>It</hi>'s
adversary, I suppose that <hi>It</hi> would
think a pair of wings to be pertinent
and highly convenient, if not necessary.</p>
               <p>I have before upon occasion, and in
passing, noted how he undertakes to
prove that there are no Actions of free
Agents Evil in themselves, when never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
it had p. 72. affirmed the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of God and Adultery to be in
themselves Evil.</p>
               <p>Such is that too elsewhere touched,
p. 63. where it cites Mr. <hi>Howe, Postsc.</hi>
p. 36. intimating that some Actions
are Evil <hi>quoad Substantiam,</hi> that is,
morally Evil or Wicked; and <hi>It</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60436:65"/>
would have it to be a Contradiction to
own that any such have natural good
in them. How wisely? As if it were
not possible for the same Action to be
morally Evil, and naturally Good. Or
did <hi>It</hi> never hear of the Substance of
an Act in the moral sense? And doth
not a forbidden Action use to be called
Evil in the Substance of it? When,
if the Action be not forbidden, but
commanded, and only the undue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or end forbidden, as in <hi>It</hi>'s own
Instance of Alms-giving for vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it is said to be Good, <hi>quoad Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantian?</hi>
It is to be wondred that
it summoned not here it's <hi>Logick</hi> to
prove that an Action hath no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
but that would have spoiled
It's Learned Note that follows, where
Mr. <hi>Howe, Postsc.</hi> p. 36. to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Is there any Action so sinful, that
hath not not some natural Good as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
matter thereof?</hi> Answers, <hi>True,
and what, shall it therefore be inferr'd, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60436:65"/>
God must by a Determinative Influence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
every such Action whatsoever reason
there be against it? One might better argue
thence the necessity of his producing every
hour a new World, in which there would be
a great deal more of Positive Entity, and
natural Goodness.</hi> It hereupon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
p. 65. to prove that there is
<hi>as much Entity and natural Goodness in a
sinful Action, as there would be in Myriads
of Worlds, should God create every hour a
new World;</hi> and saith, that <hi>to deny this
were unworthy a Philosopher:</hi> and <hi>It</hi>'s
proof is, If <hi>Substantia non recipit magis
&amp; minut,</hi> or if <hi>Ens &amp; bonum sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibile,</hi>
then <hi>an Action hath as much
Entity as a World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how much doth <hi>It</hi> reflect upon
God and that Religious sense which
we ought to cherish of him, p. 27.
when it makes God to have determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s Will to the choice
of eating the fruit that was forbidden
him? This seem'd so horrid at first,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60436:66"/>
that <hi>It</hi> self startles a little at it, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
in a Parenthesis (<hi>suppose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prohibition past upon it</hi>) and yet,
because <hi>It's</hi> cause required no less, and
appetite gathers with eating, it takes
courage afterward to assert God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Will to the
Act of eating, which was not till after
the Prohibition: and to <hi>Illustrate</hi> (as it
pretends) so black a thing, it parallels
God's moving him to that Act rather
than to another, <hi>with a Writing-Master's
directing his Scholars hand.</hi> If the Cause
be not to be defended upon better
terms than so, what Christian but
would rather wish he had never
known Writing-Master, than to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
such an Opinion; and that
God should make an innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in this manner to do a sorbidden
Act, for which so dreadful a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was to insue upon him and his
posterity?</p>
               <p>No less pregnant with impious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60436:66"/>
is it to assert p. 29, 30. the
equal necessity of Predetermining
Influence to Wicked Actions as to
Good; and that dangerous Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
p. 19. that God's promises
convey no right to them to whom
they are made, For, <hi>'tis a ruled
case,</hi> it says, <hi>in the Schools, that
God cannot properly be said a Debter
to his Creatures;</hi> and then adds of
<hi>It</hi>'s own, <hi>no not when he hath passed
a Promise to them,</hi> and pursues this
so far as to say, <hi>if he should</hi> (to
<hi>suppose an Impossibility</hi>) which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what follows had been
therefore better omitted, <hi>break his
word, he would be but</hi> Mendax, non
Injustus, and puts it too in <hi>English,</hi>
a Lyer, not Unjust. What dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
have some men to speak
at this rate, or what dangerous
points do they run themselves upon,
and their Readers? I remember
there is a Picture before that <hi>Ruler
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60436:67"/>
of the Case his</hi> Book with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>bene scripsisti de me Dive
Thomas.</hi> But let God be True and
<hi>Iust</hi> to his word, and every man
(that saith otherwise) a Lyer.</p>
               <p>For the last I shall only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a few lines of it's idle Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
p. 35. in which I know
not whether the malice against
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> or irreverence towards
our Saviour do predominate thorow
the whole absurdity. <hi>We might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
observe upon his Rhetorical Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of his Argument, that he
seems to be no ill-willer to Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation:
for if the natural notions
of God's Goodness should be infinitely
dearer to us than our senses, I see not
why the notion of God's sincerity that
he means as he speaks, should not
challenge a share in our Indearments,
and so why hoc: est corpus meum,
should not assure us that the bread is
transubstantiated, though our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>

in Deed:</hi> Whereas, what is it that
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath denied, but <hi>that

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:60436:68"/>I Should now therefore have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
were there not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet in <hi>It's</hi> Prefatory Epistle so
fordid, that I reserved it for behind,
as the most proper place it could
be applied to. Nor shall I therein
only have marshall'd it according to
It's dignity, but do hope moreover,
as the Head of the Viper is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick

out a Remedy against the Book in
the Preface; wherein it shows so
peculiar a malice and despight to
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> and insinuates the same
to the Reader, as requires a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Preservative. And, had I not
already been at the pains of the
foregoing Remarks, here was, I see,
a more compendious occasion, but
sufficient to have administred me
the same observations. For all the
other faults that I have objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the bulk of <hi>The Discourse</hi>
might as easily have been discovered
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60436:69"/>
in <hi>It</hi>'s Preface, as a good Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
can by the Moles in the face
assign all those that are upon any
other part of the body: But among
them all <hi>It</hi>'s superlative Dulness is
here especially the more manifest
(as usually happens in such cases)
by how much <hi>It</hi> endeavours most at
Acuteness and Elegancy; so palpable,
that even <hi>It</hi> self could not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insensible of it: but p. 3, 4. feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
confesses both in <hi>Latine</hi> and
<hi>English,</hi> that in reading Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>'s
Letter and Postscript, <hi>Obstupuit ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruntque
Comae;</hi> and a double <hi>Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
under which <hi>It</hi> laboured:
This doubtless it was, like the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affections
derived from the Head to
the Nerves, which propagated that
horrid stupidity that I have already
noted thorow <hi>It</hi>'s whole Treatise.
But that Quality is here so exalted,
Nature it seems, having given <hi>It</hi>
that Torpor for a Defence) that in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60436:69"/>
touching it thus lightly, I perceive a
numness to strike up thorow my Pen
into my Faculties, and shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
point at some particulars, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than adventure to handle them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> had in passing, <hi>Postsc.</hi>
p. 22. glanced upon an improper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundance
of words used by a former
Adversary. <hi>The Divine Independent
Will of God;</hi> as he might with good
reason take notice of it, being as
much sense as to have said the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Dependent Will of Man. But
hereupon <hi>The Discourse</hi> p. 9. having
for revenge turn'd over his whole
Letter and Postscript to find out the
like absurdities, highly gratulates
<hi>It</hi> self in three Instances, but all of
them curtaild from the coherence
to make for the purpose. One <hi>Letter</hi>
p. 42. <hi>In which sense how manifest
it is that the perfect</hi> (all this omitted)
<hi>Rectitude of God's own holy gracious
Nature (is an eternal Law to him</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60436:70"/>
omitted.) The second; <hi>Letter</hi>
p. 59. <hi>God satisfies himself in himself,
and takes highest complacency in the
perfect Goodness, Congruity, and</hi> (all
this omitted) <hi>Rectitude of his own
most holy Will and Way;</hi> and for
these Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> is arraigned upon a
Crime, by a Greek word of Law
called <hi>Pleonasme.</hi> The third is <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Malignantly Wicked</hi> (which <hi>The
Discourse</hi> saith is the same as <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wicked</hi>) Postscript p. 22. and 32.
as <hi>It</hi> quotes, but is in <hi>Letter;</hi> 32. and
here, <hi>It</hi> leaves out also the word
<hi>most,</hi> which would have spoiled the
exception taken against it; for
what Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> there saith is, <hi>even
those Actions that are in themselves</hi>
most <hi>malignantly wicked.</hi> Are there
not some Actions, some Men, more
malignantly wicked than others?
Or will <hi>The Discourse</hi> apply <hi>It</hi>'s old
end of <hi>Latine</hi> here—aliquando bonus
dormitat Homerus to <hi>Paulus,</hi> Rom.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60436:70"/>
7. 13. <hi>sin, exceedingly sinful?</hi> It was
time therefore in all reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this exercise with saying; <hi>But
these are childish Criminations, unfit
to be bandied from hand to hand by
sober persons;</hi> owning <hi>It</hi> self at once
to have been guilty herein of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate,
Inept, and Unmanly
kind of procedure.</p>
               <p>Neither can I pass by unregarded
that new Invention of rearing up
Pillars to mens Infamy; but which
have sometimes, and may now also,
turned to the disgrace of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.
<hi>It</hi> cuts out p. 10, 11. several
Lines here and there, out of the
whole <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Postscript,</hi> to post
them up in Columns, and Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
upon them as a common notorious
Self-contradicter: Whereas, if any
man will take the pains to restore
those sentences to their first situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and coherence, (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done) there will not be found
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60436:71"/>
the least Inconsistency in them: But
if this Practice be allowable, there
is not any Chapter in the Bible out
of which <hi>It</hi> may not with the same
integrity extract either Blasphemy
or Nonsense; though I am far from
suspecting <hi>The Discourse</hi> of such an
undertaking. For indeed It assigns
the True Reason, (and fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
over the <hi>Portico) non est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii
mei hosce nudos dissolvere,</hi> and
as faithfully translates it; I <hi>have not
the wit to untie these knots,</hi> which is
now the third publick Confession of
of <hi>It's</hi> stupidity, in the Preface. Yet
will I not do <hi>It</hi> the affront to ascribe
it either to <hi>It</hi>'s Modesty, Ingenuity,
or Self-Conviction; for <hi>It</hi> intended
them doubtless all to the contrary.
Only the same Dulness, that first
occasioned <hi>It's</hi> errours and mistakes,
did likewise lead <hi>It</hi> to these omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
expressions, and like those
that discern not the Back from the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60436:71"/>
Edge, to wound <hi>It</hi> self in cutting
at the Adversary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's</hi> Dulness therefore, or as it is
expressed p. 8. <hi>the consciousness of</hi>
It<hi>'s own disabilities,</hi> being so oft at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
under <hi>It</hi>'s own hand, and to
which, if necessary, <hi>It</hi> might have
another Thousand Witnesses, I shall
not further pall my Reader on this
Subject, but return rather from this
digression to my first design of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating
that in the Preface, which
hath all the marks upon it of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
except the Wit wherewith that
vice is more usually accompanied.
Of that the very Title is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>De Causa Dei,</hi> or <hi>a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Common Doctrine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60436:72"/>
thought that <hi>T. D.</hi> should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Defender of the Faith, or
that the Cause of God were so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn,
as to be reduced to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of such a Champion. It seems
much rather to be the Fallacy of <hi>Non
Causa pro Causa,</hi> and usurped only
the better to prepossess against Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> such, Readers as would be
amused by the Frontispiece. The
Cause of God! Turn I beseech you
It's whole Book over, and show me
any thing of that <hi>Decorum</hi> with
which that should have been man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged.
What is there to be found
of that Gravity, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Piety or Charity requisite to
so glorious a pretence? (Graces
wherewith God usually assists those
that undertake his quarrel, and with
which Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> on all occasions
appears to be abundantly supplied.)
But a perpetual eructation there is of
humane Passions, a vain ostentation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60436:72"/>
of mistaken Learning, and a causeless
Picking of Controversie.</p>
               <p>To that Title, under which Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> is so injuriously proscribed, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
forsooth an Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,

Emphasis, praises the Author, and
then the Book; but no otherwise

of them again with further Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny.</p>
               <p>Nay, even Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wholly escape <hi>It</hi>'s Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which I do not object as if any
thing could be well said of him that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60436:73"/>
is not due to his merit. But there
are a kind of Sorcerers that praise
where they intend to do most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
And the Occasion, the Place,
the Manner, the Person that gives
the Commendation make alwaies a
difference, and cause a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in that matter. Nor is it less
here. For, Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> having taken
the Pen on this Subject, as <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
also observes, upon that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Gentleman's command, the
officious mentioning of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>
p. 1. seems as if <hi>It</hi> had a mind too
to try his mettle; or at least would
reproach him for having imployed
one so unfit for the service, and that
was to be so shamefully (or rather
shamelesly) treated for his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>But the summe of all <hi>It</hi>'s Malice,
whereby <hi>It</hi> endeavours to outlaw
Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> not only from Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s
patronage, but from all Protestant
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60436:73"/>
protection, is to represent him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Popish Vizard. As p. 2. <hi>Old
Popish Arguments drest up</hi> A-la-mode.
<hi>An averment of the Old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Calumny. An</hi> Affidavit <hi>of a
Pontificial Accusation. Trampling</hi>
p. 4. <hi>on the Venerable Dust, which was
sometimes animated by truly heroick
souls, and bore the names of</hi> Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Calvin, Beza, Penkins, Pemble,
Twisse, Davenant, Ames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then
p. 12. still objects to him the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Durandus,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>
had in his <hi>Postscript</hi> so fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
himself against it, that his first
Accuser hath let it fall out of perfect
ingenuity. Draws <hi>a parallel between
his and the Papists Arguments against
Predetermination.</hi> And p. 13. erects
another pair of Columns to that
purpose, betwixt which Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> is
to look out as thorow a Pillary. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this
p. 14. saith, <hi>the point under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between</hi> It <hi>and Mr.</hi> Howe, <hi>is a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60436:74"/>
stated Controversie between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Protestants. Gives It self a
little pleasure mixed with disdain,
that</hi> because there was no Smith to
be found throughout all the Land
of <hi>Israel,</hi> he was fain to go down
to the <hi>Philistines</hi> to sharpen his Ax
and his Mattock, 1 <hi>Sam. 13. 19, 20.
Imitates</hi> Bradwardins <hi>Piety, therefore
intituling It's Book</hi> de Causa Dei, <hi>the
Cause of God being that which</hi> It <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to secure from the impetuous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of its' Adversaries, among which</hi>
It <hi>is heartily sory Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>should be
numbred as to this instance.</hi> This kind
of proceeding does argue rather the
strength of Malice, than of the
Cause. For although we live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a rationall jealousie alwaies of
Popery, yet whatsoever is said by
any Author of that perswasion, is
not forthwith therefore to be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morously
rejected. Have not there
constantly been among them, men
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60436:74"/>
fit to be owned for Holy Life, Good
Sense, Great Learning? And in many
points we agree with them, and shall
in all, whensoever Our Eyes shall be
shut, or Theirs shall be opened. <hi>The
Discourse</hi> had indeed done something
to the purpose, could <hi>It</hi> have shown
the Doctrine of Predetermination to
be one of those Discriminating Causes
upon which we have made a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from that Church, that it is an
Article of Faith in which our Creeds
differ, and that it were a fit Test to
be imposed upon them in order to
their more speedy Conviction.</p>
               <p>Which last, if <hi>It</hi> can bring about
for them, so that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
upon Renouncing this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
imputed to them, (instead of
the Transubstantiation, (which Mr.
<hi>Howe</hi> too escaped so narrowly.) I
presume they would, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Popery, take it for an high
obligation. For indeed, whereas <hi>The
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60436:75"/>
Discourse</hi> affirms this of Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to be <hi>a stated Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
betwixt the Papists and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;</hi>
the Papists against, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
for it; there is not through
<hi>It</hi>'s whole Book a more notorious
Falshood. For this Debate arose first
among the Papists, some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one, others of the contrary
Opinion; so that the Controversie
was stated betwixt themselves. But
that which is now <hi>T. D</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> was first the
<hi>Dominican</hi> Doctrine; and I wonder
therefore the less if <hi>It</hi> continue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Dominican</hi> Spirit. Since, and
from that original, the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath indeed been also diffused
among the Protestasts, and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have differ'd about it with one
another; but it was never taken, in
holding it either way, to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Character. The Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
Concourse is not to be found
in any Confession of the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60436:75"/>
Churches; But this matter
hath been left entire to euery man's
best Judgment, and one Party is as
much Papist in it as the others What
two men of equal Capacity can argue
against Predetermination, but they
must have the same Apprehensions in
some measure, in matters so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
and it ought not to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to eithers prejudice, no more than
for two to speak the same words in
discoursing of one subject. <hi>Charron,</hi>
whose Wisdom, p. 1. <hi>Bradwardine,</hi>
whose Piety, p. 14. and especially,
<hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> whose Chalk, p. 15. <hi>T. D.</hi>
makes use of, were none of the best
Protestants: And yet I am far from
taxing <hi>It</hi> therefore of Popery, <hi>or giving
my self a little pleasure mixed with disdain,</hi>
that it was fain to go down to them
to sharpen <hi>It</hi>'s Howe or <hi>It</hi>'s Mattock.
Let It rather solace <hi>It</hi> self in that
Lordly posture of mind; nor will I
envy <hi>It;</hi> especially, seeing to take
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60436:76"/>
that satisfaction in a thing which. <hi>It</hi>
makes so Criminous, is the only Joy
of which I think the Evil Spirits are
capable.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>It</hi>'s saying, p. 2. <hi>that
Mr.</hi> Howe <hi>a vers the Old Popish Calumny,
that by the Protestant Doctrine God is made
the Author of Sin.</hi> And p. 4. <hi>that he
tramples upon the venerable dust,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of</hi>
Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza, Perkins,
Pemble, Davenant, Twisse, Ames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it proceeds from the same malice,
and may therefore receive the same
answer: For I have shown, first, that
this Predetermination is not the stated
Doctrine of Protestants, nor hath
there yet any General Council of
them been held, where <hi>T. D.</hi> hath
presided: but if there should at any
time hereafter, <hi>It</hi> is so unhappy and
singular in expressing <hi>It</hi>'s sense, in this
matter, that I much fear lest the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Votes should affix the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Greek</hi> name to <hi>It's</hi> Religion.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60436:76"/>
And as to those Worthies whom <hi>It</hi>
cites by rote, <hi>It</hi> draws them indeed
within the reach of both Old and
New Calumny, by pretending they
were of <hi>It</hi>'s Opinion; whereas one
may safely affirm at adventure, that
they were all of them too well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
to have ever thought or spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after <hi>It's</hi> manner. What it may
have extorted from them by Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,
I know not; but they had
not the happiness to have read <hi>It</hi>'s <hi>De
Causa Dei</hi> in their life-time: Nor do I
think that Death corrupts mens Minds
as their Bodies. Of these, whom <hi>The
Discourse</hi> enumerates, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi>
have been reproachfully charged by
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Romanists, as
making God the Author of Sin, but
yet there is not to be found in all their
works an assertion of God's Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
Concurrence. How far some of
the rest of them have taken scope on
this subject, I have no obligation here
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60436:77"/>
more than <hi>The Discourse,</hi> to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize:
neither did Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> name
any man, as being the fairer way by
much, arguing only against the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But seeing <hi>T. D.</hi> hath made
bold with Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> I will ask
no better: For that truly venerable,
dust, which <hi>It</hi> hath stirred will flie in
<hi>T. D.</hi> eyes; if I be not mistaken. <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
de Predestinatione &amp; Reprobatione,</hi>
it is thus, <hi>Deus, Agens ex Deoreto Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinationis,
operatur haec priora (scil.
Fidem, Sanctitatem, Perseverantiam) per
Influxum Gratiae Efficacis, As ex Decreto
Reprobationis nihil agit quo Deterior ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiatur
Reprobatus—</hi> That is, for it is
well worth the translating: <hi>God,
acting according to his Decree of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
works these things in the first place,</hi>
(to wit, <hi>Faith, Holiness, and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
by the Influence of Efficacious Graces;
but, according to his Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he acts nothing by which the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
should be made worse.</hi> Methinks,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60436:77"/>
as <hi>T. D.</hi> will have the Bishop to be of
<hi>It's,</hi> so, in all reason, It should be
also of the Bishop's Opinion, and if
<hi>It</hi> intends no more, as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> no
less than is here said, I cannot see
why there might not be an end of <hi>The
Discourse,</hi> and of this Controversie.</p>
               <p>But however, I hope that I may
have done a good work, if upon sight
of these unexpected Remarques, Mr.
<hi>Howe,</hi> though fitted doubtless for a
much better and fuller Reply, would
deliberate before he makes this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
so considerable as to blot Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
on <hi>It</hi>'s occasion. Let <hi>It,</hi> in the
mean time, venditate all <hi>It</hi>'s Street<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adages,
<hi>It</hi>'s odd ends of <hi>Latine, It</hi>'s bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
shreds of Poets, and <hi>It</hi>'s musty
lumber of Schoolmen. Let <hi>It</hi> enjoy
the ingenuity of having unprovoked
fallen upon a person, <hi>whose parts</hi> It
<hi>acknowledged,</hi> for whom <hi>It had such an
Affection,</hi> with whom <hi>It had so many
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60436:78"/>
years Academical Society,</hi> and so <hi>long
friendship:</hi> but whom <hi>It</hi> now <hi>must num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
among God's Adversaries.</hi> Let <hi>It</hi>
value <hi>It</hi> self upon these things: for
all these considerations do heighten
the Price of an Assassinate. But may
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> still continue his Sobriety,
Simplicity, and Equality of Temper:
glorifying God rather in the exercise
of Practical Christian Vertues, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the honour of a speculative
Question. But if he had a mind to
be Vindictive, there is no way to
despight the Adversary more sensibly,
than, as clamorous women, by giving
them no answer. Till men grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a better humour, and learn to
treat of Divinity more civilly, they
are unfit for conversation.</p>
               <p>Another, I see, who is now his
Third Aggressor, hath already as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
him, though less barbarously,
in <hi>a Letter to a Friend,</hi> &amp;c. Yet even
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60436:78"/>
he introduces his Book with <hi>Iob 13. 7.
Wilt thou speak wickedly for God, and
talk deceitfully for him?</hi> What shall
Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> do in this Case? Is the
Bible therefore to be turned into a
Libel? and shall he <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
to find out a Text equally cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
He need not go far, were he
of that mind, to retaliate. How easie
were the parallel betwixt <hi>Iob</hi>'s
three Friends (to whom those
words were spoken) and three such
comfortable Gentlemen! And why
may not Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> nick them as well
out of <hi>Iob,</hi> c. 12. <hi>v. 3, 4. But I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
as well as you; I am not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to you; yea who knoweth not such
things as these? I am as one mocked of
his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
he answereth him. The just upright man
is laughed to scorn.</hi> Or, if he would be
yet severer, the same, <hi>chap. 13. v.</hi> 4, 5.
will hit them home. <hi>But ye are For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

of Lyes; ye are all Physicians of no
value. O that you would altogether hold
your peace, and it should be your Wisdom.</hi>
And then at last, to determine the
whole Dispute, He might conclude
with <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 7. The Lord <hi>said to</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz
<hi>the</hi> Temanite, <hi>My wrath is
kindled against thee, and against thy two
Friends; for ye have not spoken of me the
thing that is right as my servant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi>
After all which, what more seasonable,
in order to Reconciliation, than the
<hi>verse</hi> following? <hi>Go to my servant</hi> Job,
<hi>unto offer up for your selves a burnt offering,
and my servant</hi> Job <hi>shall pray for you (for
him will I accept;) lest I deal with you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your folly, in that you have not spoken
of me the thing that is right, as my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
Job <hi>hath.</hi> But the Word of God
is not so to be turned into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praach
of Man, though the Allusion
may seem never so happy; nor have
I instanced thus far, otherwise than
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60436:80"/>
to show the frivolousness, though too
usual of that Practice.</p>
               <p>But therefore I would advise Mr.
<hi>Howe,</hi> though not to that excusable
sullenness and silence, with which
some have chastised the World for
having used them unworthily; nor to
that tacite contempt of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
in which he were hitherto justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable;
yet, that, having made a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Attempt, of which several good
men are it seems not capable, he would,
for peace sake, either wholly surcease
this contest, or forbear at least till
they have all done. For it is more
easie to deal with them all than single;
and, were they once imbodied, come
to a consistence among themselves, or
had agreed who should speak for
them, they had right to his Answer.
But until then, Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> is no more
obliged in whatsoever is called Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Reason, or Conscience, than if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60436:81"/>
every hair of <hi>T. D.</hi> that stands an end,
should demand particular satisfaction.
It is the same for a Divine, as he, to
turn Common Disputant, as for an
Architect to saw Timber, or cleave
Loggs, which, though he may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do for health or exercise, yet to
be constant at it, were to debase and
neglect his Vocation. Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> hath
work enough cut out of a nobler na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in his <hi>Living Temple,</hi> in which,
like that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there is <hi>neither
Hammer, nor Axe, nor any Tool of Iron
to be heard,</hi> 1 King. 6. 8. nothing that
can offend, all to edifie. And this I
heartily wish that he may accomplish:
But therefore, as he hath not hitherto
sought, so that he would avoid all
Contention; lest, as <hi>David,</hi> for having
been a man of blood, was forbid to
build the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 8. so
he, as being a man of Controversie.</p>
               <p>As for my self, I expect in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60436:81"/>
Age, that some or other will
Sue me for having Trespassed thus far
on Theological Ground: But I have
this for my plea, that I stepped over
on no other Reason than (which any
man legally may do) to hinder one
Divine from offering violence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And, if I should be molested on
that account, I doubt not but some of
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Clergy will be ready
therefore to give me the like As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
