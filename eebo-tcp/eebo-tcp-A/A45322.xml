            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in all the renewed facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, lyes ſo cloſe in the boſome, that it can only be gueſſed at by ſuch uncertaine emanations of words, and actions, as flow from it to the eares, and eyes of others: The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular graces and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love, Feare, Hope, Joy, godly Sorrow, Zeale, and the reſt breake forth apparently in ſuch ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and effects as may win a certainty of beliefe from the beholders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed are eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the view of others: all theſe may bee read in the face: but, if the heart it ſelf could be ſeen, and that curiouſly diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yet even thus could not holineſſe be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Beſide the cloſeneſſe, every man is apt to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his judgement of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, by a falſe rule of his own, whereby it comes to paſſe that it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly miſ-taken.

I well ſee, O God, it is no Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox to ſay that thy Saints reigne with thee here on earth; though not for a thouſand yeers, yet during the time of their ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here below; not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecular ſplendor and magnificence, not in bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and ſenſuall contentments: Yet in true ſpirituall delectation, in the joys of the holy Ghoſt unſpeakeable, and full of glory.

O then, with what unſpeakable joy, and jubilation, doſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine thy happineſſe?
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:43559:196"/>
How canſt thou containe thy ſelfe any longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe bounds of my fleſh, when thou fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thy ſelfe thus initiated into glory? Art thou in heaven and know'ſt it not? Know'ſt thou not that hee who is within the entry, or behinde the ſcreen, is as trulie within the houſe, as he that walkes in the Hall, or ſits in the parlour? And canſt thou pretend to bee within the verge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not rejoyce? What is that makes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but joy and felicity? thy very thought cannot ſeparate theſe two, no more than it can ſever the Sun and light: For both theſe are equally the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals and fountaines of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43559:196"/>
light and joy; from whence they both flow, and in which both are complete; there is no light which is not derived from the Sun; no true joy but from heaven: as therefore the nearer to the body of the Sun, the more light and heat, ſo the nearer to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the more exceſſe of joy. And certainly, O my ſoul, there is nothing but infidelity, can keepe thee from an exuberance of joy, and delight in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of heaven.</p>
               <p>Can the wearie Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler after he hath meaſured many tedious miles, and paſſed many dangers both by ſea and land, and felt the harſh entertainements of a ſtranger, chuſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43559:197"/>
to draw near in his returne to a rich, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant home? Can the Ward, after an hard pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillage chuſe but rejoyce that the day is comming wherein he ſhall freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all his Lordly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and roialties? Can a <hi>Joſeph</hi> chuſe but finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inwardly joyed, when out of the dungeon he ſhall be called up, not to liberty only, but to honour; and ſhall be arraied with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of fine Linnen; and graced with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> ring, and chain; and ſet in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chariot, and in the next chair to the throne of Egypt? And canſt thou apprehend thy ſelfe now approaching to the glorie of the heaven of heavens, a
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:43559:197"/>
place and ſtate of ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite contentment and happineſſe, and not be extaſied with joy? There, there ſhalt thou, O my ſoule, enjoy a perfect reſt from all thy toiles, cares, fears; there ſhalt thou find a true vitall life, free from all the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of thy miſerable pilgrimage; free from the dangers of either ſins, or temptations; free from all anxiety and diſtraction; free from all ſorrow, pain, perturbation; free from all the poſſibility of change, or death: A life wherein there is nothing but pure and perfect pleaſure; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but perpetuall melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Angels and Saints, ſinging ſweet Allelujahs
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:43559:198"/>
to their God; A life which the moſt glorious Deitie both gives, and is: A life wherein thou haſt the full fruition of the ever-bleſſed God-head, the continuall ſociety of the celeſtial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the bliſſefull preſence of the glorified humanitie of thy dear Saviour: A life wherein thou haſt ever conſort with the glorious companie of the Apoſtles, the goodly fellowſhip of the Patriarks, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the noble Army of Martyrs and Confeſſors, the Celeſtiall ſynod of all the holy fathers, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Doctors of the Church; Shortly, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Aſſembly of all the faithfull Profeſſors of the Name of the Lord Jeſus,

that having finiſhed their courſe, ſit now ſhining in their promiſed glory: See there that yet-unapproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light, that divine mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the heavenly King; See that reſplendent Crown of righteouſneſſe, which decks the heads of every of thoſe Saints, and is readie to be ſet on thine, when thou haſt happilie overcome thoſe ſpirituall powers, wherewith thou art ſtill conflicting; See the joyfull triumphs of theſe exſulting victors; See the meaſures of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different, yet all full, and the leaſt unmeaſurable; Laſtly, ſee all this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not limited to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, nor yet millions of years, but commeaſured by

no leſs than eternity. And now, my ſoul, if thou have received the infallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of thy God, [in that having beleeved,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> thou art ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">14.</note> untill the full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of thy purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed poſſeſſion] if, through his infinite mercy, thou bee now upon the entring into that bleſſed place and ſtate of immortality,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.6.</note> forbear (if thou canſt) to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thy ſelf with the joy of the holy Ghoſt, to bee enlarged towards thy God with a joy unſpeakable and glorious: See if thou canſt now breath forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but praiſes to thy God, and ſongs of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:43559:199"/>

All the few daies therefore of my appointed time will I wait at the threſhold of grace untill my changing come; with a trembling joy, with a longing patience, with a comfortable hope. Onely, Lord, I know there is ſomething to be done, ere I can enter; I muſt die, ere I can be capable to enjoy that bleſſed life with thee: one ſtroke of thine Angell muſt bee endured in my paſſage into thy Paradiſe; And lo, here I am before thee ready to embrace the condition; Even, when thou pleaſeſt, let me bleed once to bee ever happy. Thou haſt, after a weary

walk through this roaring wilderneſs, vouchſafed to call up thy ſervant to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and from thence aloof off, to ſhew me the land of Promiſe, a land that flowes with milk and honey; Do thou but ſay, Die thou on this Hill, with this proſpect in mine eye, and do thou merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take my ſoul from mee, who gaveſt it to me; and diſpoſe of it where thou wilt in that Region of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
