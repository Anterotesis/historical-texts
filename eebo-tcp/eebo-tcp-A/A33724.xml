            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Christian READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS a dangerous thing to stumble in <hi>Sion,</hi> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offence at the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Redemption by Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot comprehend it by our own Reason: We are commanded to believe it, without consulting flesh and blood about it, but humbly wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that anointing from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One, that teaches us of all things, and is truth, and no lie, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 20, 27.</hi> Such blindness is hapned to us since the Fall, that we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the deep things of God, 'till we are spiritually enlightned; yet how many are there, in this disputing Age, who leaning too much to their own
<pb facs="tcp:48581:4"/>
Understanding, decry all Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Illumination, as mere Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm, counting Faith it self a blind irrational thing, a bare act of the Will, to which the Understanding contributes nothing, as if Believers had no real knowledge, or inward evidence of the things they believe? Therefore to stop the mouths of Gain-sayers, who discover their deplorable Ignorance of the Mystery of Faith by their frequent Mutterings, artificial Reasonings, and Sophistical Cavills against it; I shall plainly declare what I believe to be true in this Case, <hi>viz.</hi> That Supernatural Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I affirm as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a saving knowledge of God in Christ, is a divine Light let down from Heaven into the Soul, by which the mysterious Truths of the Gospel are made manifest to the eye of our Understanding; as by the light of the Sun, things bodily, are made
<pb facs="tcp:48581:4"/>
manifest to the eye of our Body (so says <hi>Paul Baines</hi> on the <hi>Ephesians)</hi> This Supernatural Light, is called the Spirit of Wisdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the knowledge of Christ, <hi>Eph. 1. 17, 18.</hi> given to the Saints to instruct them in all Gospel Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: We may know this spiritual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, to be a true heavenly Light, because it agrees in all things with the Word of God, the same Spirit of God shining in our hearts, that shines in the Word: Should any pretend by a supposed inward Light, to be wise above what is written, and to know what is not revealed in the Scripture, this were Enthusiasm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; therefore <hi>to the Law, and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because they have no light in them,</hi> Isa. <hi>8. 20.</hi> We must <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every spirit, but try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they are of God,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48581:5"/>
               <hi>because many false prophets are gone out into the world: hereby we know the Spirit of God, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God, 1</hi> Iohn <hi>4. 1, 2.</hi> They who thus confess Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> do from their hearts own and acknowledge both the Person and Doctrine of Christ to be Divine, being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded of the Truth of the Gospel, and brought under the power of it, not by the wisdom of man, or by the strength of human reason, but by the inward demonstration of the Spirit, enlightning the mind, and leaving it under the evidence of things not seen, nor understood by humane reason, but plainly discerned by this higher light of Faith; can such a Faith be the effect of blindness? Can such a Faith be Enthusiasm? A Faith grounded upon the Word of God,
<pb facs="tcp:48581:5"/>
and acting from the highest Wisdom, the surest Knowledge, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivable light that man can walk by; if this be a blind belief, then there is nothing reasonable in the whole world; if this be a delusion, where are we? What can we trust in, if not in that which we so know, and are upon infallible grounds perswaded is truth, and no lye? That which renders Believers suspected by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, is because they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that light to the hearts of others, by which they themselves do see. 'Tis true, all have not Faith; and 'tis as true, that some have Faith; pray, whence should such a Persuasion come? How should such a Faith be wrought in any?—I must come either from our selves, from the Devil, or from God.</p>
            <p>From our selves it cannot come; because Gospel-Truths are above our. Reason, contrary to our Lusts, and
<pb facs="tcp:48581:6"/>
to all the Inclinations of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in fallen man, who cannot by his own power dispose himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel.</p>
            <p>From the Devil it cannot be, as any delusion of his; we call not that a delusion which is above man's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but that which is quite beside the Word of God, or contrary to it; and no man in his right wits can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Devil either able or willing to instruct men in the Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gospel-Truths, which are as contrary to him, as they are to a natural man; 'tis his interest to suppress them, and he doth his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>to blind the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto them, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>4. 4.</hi> Is not the whole Bible from one end to the other, written against the Devil, representing him as an adversary, a hater, and destroyer of
<pb facs="tcp:48581:6"/>
mankind, laying open his devices and stratagems against us; exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to resist him, to trample him under our feet, to figbt against him where-ever we meet him in any temptation; and can we think that Satan is so divided against himself, as to promote the knowledge of that among men, which is so much to his disadvantage?—Whence I infer, If Faith be not of our selves, nor from the Devil, it must be from God, and God owns it to be his work, his Operation, his Gift; therefore let men have a care they don't blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme this work of the Holy-Ghost in the hearts of the Saints, setting up their own natural reason in the room and place of supernatural Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which the Mysteries of the Gospel can never be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>

            <head>THE Incomprehensibleness OF Imputed Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Rom. IX. 32, 33,</bibl>
               <q>For they stumbled at that stumbling stone; as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone, and rock of offence: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him, shall not be ashamed.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apostle speaks at large in this Chapter of the Rejection of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> In the close of the Chapter he shews why so few <hi>Iews</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48581:8"/>
by the Gospel, to whom it was first Preached, and how the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came to be called. The <hi>Iews</hi> took offence at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, could not tell what to make of the Righteousness of Faith, they were all for the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Works; but God rejects both them and their Works, and calls the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who lived in Profaneness and Idolatry; they followed not after Righteousness of one sort or other; they knew neither Law nor Gospel; did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of preparation to further their calling; but God, of his mere good pleasure, sends the Gospel among them, and makes the Preaching of it an effectual means of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Faith in Christ. Christ in his Doctrine of Justification by Faith, and not by Works, was a Stumbling stone to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48581:8"/>
               <hi>Iews,</hi> as he is to many now-a-days upon the very same account; 'tis what is foretold in Scripture, and what we must expect: <hi>This Child is set for the fall of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,</hi> Luke 2. 34. So 1 Pet. 2. 7, 8. 1 Cor. 1. 23. The Apostles Preaching this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were a savour of Death to many that heard them, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished under their Ministry by Unbelief; so now, some will take offence at this Doctrine; but be it a savour of Life or Death, we must Preach it.</p>
            <p>I shall now shew you from this Text, whence it is, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by Faith in Christ, through the Imputation of his Righteousness, is such a stumbling stone, and rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48581:9"/>
The main reason, I conceive, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Because the way of a Sinner's Salvation by Faith in Christ, is a Mystery far above the reach of man's understanding; no wonder then, that so many boggle at it, count it foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and set themselves to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.</p>
            <p>I shall couch what I have to say, under these Three General Heads; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Mysteries of Faith are not comprehensible by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the way of a Sinner's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Faith in Christ, is above a natural man's understanding. This some count Enthusiasm, and cannot bear it, but truth is truth, and must be Preached, whether men will bear it or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why hath God laid the way of a sinner's Salvation so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48581:9"/>
high, that no humane understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can reach it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though the way of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Salvation by Christ be above the capacity of a natural man to reach and take in, yet God can give us a true discerning of it. Of these in order.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>The first General Head;</hi> viz.</head>
               <p n="1">1. That the way of a sinner's Salvation by Christ is above man's understanding: Therefore called the <hi>Wisdom of God in a mystery; hidden wisdom;</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. 10. And though this secret of the Lord be now outwardly revealed in the letter of the Word, yet 'tis understood by none, but such as are spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26, 27. To some it is given <hi>to know these mysteries,</hi> to others not,

They are <hi>under a special anointing,</hi> 1 John 2. 27. But for others, they understand not what God is doing in the Gospel; 'tis so great a Mystery, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels admire it; <hi>seen of Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. They never saw such a sight before; they now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to look into these things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. are wonderfully taken with this rare method of man's Salvation; and do observe with great delight, how this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Grace is carried on in the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Second General Head;</hi> viz.</head>
               <p n="2">2. Why hath God laid the way of a sinner's Salvation so high, that no human understanding can reach it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48581:10"/>
There are Three Reasons of this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because nothing that falls under man's understanding could save him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because nothing doth tend more to the Glory of God's rich Grace, than to fetch the Mystery of man's Salvation out of the depths of Infinite Wisdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because nothing keeps man in a closer dependance upon God, than this. Of these in order.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>The <hi>First</hi> Reason why God hath laid it so high; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Because nothing that falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man's understanding, could save him: The case of fallen man was so desperate, that nothing less than Infinite Wisdom could find out a way to save him; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man must eternally perish,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48581:11"/>
or God must put forth himself to the utmost, and go beyond the reason of man to find out a way to save him.</p>
                  <p>There are four ways of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a human understanding prompts us to, some to one, and some to another, but all in vain, we are grosly mistaken in every one of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some think to be saved by the Covenant of Works, do rely simply upon that, in a direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Covenant of Grace. The <hi>Iews</hi> contended with Christ and his Apostles about this. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such, in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> There is that Legal spirit in fallen man, that he still inclines to the Law of Works, he foolishly thinks to be saved by that Law which hath already condemned him: It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48581:11"/>
great Infatuation in Fallen Man, that he should still desire to be under the Law, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded him under Wrath: and vet he hopes for Mercy from that Law, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew what it was to shew mercy: Because it was once the way of Salvation for man in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, therefore he thinks there may be some hope still; Alas! this is like the cry of a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, upon whom Sentence of Death is already passed, his Cry signifies nothing, he must away to Execution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Works alone won't ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify, man will try what the Works of the Law, and the Grace of the Gospel put together will do; he joins Christ and the Law, hopes that way to save himself, partly by Grace, and partly by Works; so did the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48581:12"/>
and so do some now-a-days, mingling the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants strangely together, that way may be made for their good Works to help forward their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.<hi>—But if you be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, Christ shall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Gal. 5. 2. <hi>If it be of works, 'tis no more grace,</hi> Rom. 11. 6. It must be either all Works, or all Grace; there is no mingling them in point of Justification; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be under both Covenants at once. <hi>We are justified freely by his grace</hi> (says <hi>Paul),</hi> Rom. 3. 24. We should eye nothing in our selves, but only the free Grace of God in our Justification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they cannot be justified by the Works of the Law, nor by joining the Works of the Law and Christ together, then they will see what may be done by joining the Works of the Gospel
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48581:12"/>
and Christ together; their own inherent Evangelical Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Christ's Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, must go hand in hand in the business of Justification. There are a sort of <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> who seek to widen the straight gate of Faith, and have almost quite pulled it off the hinges, to make room for their own Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteousness, to join with Faith in helping forward our Justification; what course they take to contrive this, I will tell you (not in my own words, to avoid offence, but) in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of a late Eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, now with God, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> who, in his Book, entitled, <hi>The Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, through the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteousness of Christ;</hi> speaking there of the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Covenant, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48581:13"/>
ill use is made of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 144. expresses himself in these very words. <hi>viz. After they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the specious name of a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a</hi> Causa sine quâ non <hi>unto Faith, they immediately take all other Graces, and Works of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience into the same state with it, and the same use in Justification; and after this seeming Gold hath been cast for a while into the fire of Disputation, there comes out the Calf of a personal Inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereby men are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> vertute foederis Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici; <hi>for as for the Righteousness of Christ to be imputed to us, it is gone into Heaven, and they know not what is become of it.—</hi>So far the Doctor. This is a true Account of that new Scheme of Divinity that is so much contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48581:13"/>
Is it not sufficient to say, That God hath called us to Faith and Repentance in order to Salvation; hath appointed faith, including a serious purpose of turning unto God, as absolutely necessary unto Life, according to the Order of the Covenant of Grace? Let us not trouble our heads, whether Faith be a Condition or no, but earnestly beg of God to give us Faith, to bring our hearts to an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon Christ for all that is promised in the New Covenant. It is easily proved, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is promised to believing, is absolutely promised; nay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of Faith, that it may be of Grace; God promises no more in the New Covenant, than what he intends freely to give; though he gives one thing first in order to another, yet he freely gives all: To say they don't mean by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48581:14"/>
Condition, any Motive, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cause inclining God to give us Life, is, in effect, to say they mean nothing by it; and therefore since it is a word of so dubious a signification, liable to misconstruction, apt to lead us into a conceit of some Self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness as required unto our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, the safest way is to lay that word aside altogether, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting our selves with Scripture-Terms and Expressions, with sound wholsome words that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no body's ears.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Since neither of the three ways above-mentioned do take, some, wearied with these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, (and I must tell you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Disputes about things su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perrational, will sooner perplex the minds of men, than satisfy them); I say, some, finding no security in the forementioned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48581:14"/>
ways of Justification, that the Reason of Man suggests to him, they cast them all off; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no better, they fly to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Love and Goodness of God towards his Creature Man, think to come in for a share of that to relieve them in their extremity; and now they think they have hit it, are in a right way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having cast themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the general Goodness and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God.—I grant <hi>God is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil,</hi> Luke 6. 35. his Benignity, or the riches of his Goodness, should much affect us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. There is such a thing as <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifies a proper peculiar love in God to Mankind, more than all the Works of his Hands; yet this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48581:15"/>
Love to man is but a general Love, and must not be mistaken for special Grace; 'tis the <hi>Sun that rises on the evil, and on the good; the Rain that falls on the just, and on the unjust,</hi> Mat. 5. 45. It doth not argue any special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest thou hast in God more than others; you cannot from thence infer, that you shall be saved, unless all men be saved; for that Love you lay claim to, belongs to all men as well as you. Yet Sinners, to keep off all Terrors of Conscience as well as they can, will sooth themselves up with hopes from God's general Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Love to Man; God is merciful and gracious, and they doubt not but all will go well with them at last, though no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be made for their Sins; they don't think of that, but look upon God as if he were all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48581:15"/>
they quite forget his Justice; when that comes into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, then presently they sink again, they see their Plea will not hold; and die at last, either under a judicial hardness, or in horrible tormenting Despair. These are the false ways of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which for a time Sinners may fancy to themselves; but there being nothing of true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith in all this, they are at last miserably disappointed, and die in their Sins, which will be sure to sink them into Hell.</p>
                  <p>Since man is nonplust, can't reach it, is out in all his thoughts about the right way of a Sinner's Salvation; let us hear what God says. <hi>He that believeth, shall be saved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>Whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> John 3.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48581:16"/>
16. 'Tis well for us that <hi>God's thoughts are above ours,</hi> Isa. 55. 9. That what is impossible with Man, is possible with God; when we have done thinking and contriving how to save our selves, let us in a holy despair of our selves, refer the matter to God, whose Understanding is infinite, he can find out a way for our escape, when we can find none; while we are searching for Reasons why God should save us, we shall have a thousand Reasons rise up in our minds why God should not save us; there is nothing more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional for a convinced Sinner, to whom Christ is not yet revealed, than utter Despair; the Law leads to it; and (in that case) not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, does argue the greatest igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or higest contempt of the Law imaginable: should Fallen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48581:16"/>
Man, (without the Light of the Gospel directing him to Christ) set himself to find out a way for his deliverance, the Law of God would rise up against him, and contradict every thought and imagination of his heart, and bid him let that alone for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is out of his power, as hath been shewed: nothing that falls under Man's understanding can save him. This is the first reason of the second general Head, <hi>viz.</hi> Why God hath laid the way of a Sinner's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation so high, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing that falls under man's understanding can save him.</p>

                  <p>Because nothing does tend more to the Exaltation and glory of God's rich Grace, than to fetch the mystery of man's Salvation out of the depths of Infinite Wisdom, that it might be the more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and more highly prized by us; such an unexpected discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was very astonishing, no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings more welcome than what the Gospel brings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Wherein God shews the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ,</hi> Eph. 2. 7. Not according to our Works (as men are apt to think) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpose and grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Man cannot say when he hears the Gospel, that he thought before-hand, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48581:17"/>
God would take this way; no, he is amazed at it, astonished at it; what manner of love is this? Here is a new thing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Earth; <hi>It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God to conceal a thing, Prov.</hi> 25. 2. God never advised with Angels, or Men, about the way of a Sinner's Salvation, but from Eternity contrived it in his own breast. <hi>Who hath been his Counsellor? Rom.</hi> 11. 34. This secret of the Lord is now revealed unto us in the Gospel. <hi>O how great is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh.</hi>

Salvation wrapped up in such a Mystery, that none but God can reveal unto him. Since this great undertaking of God to save Sinners, is a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of that nature, of that high concernment to us, and also quite beyond our skill, and above our knowledge to conceive a right of; how should we humbly wait upon God for further light, that he would open the eyes of our Understanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle prays, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>To whom should we go? thou hast the words of eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6. 68. <hi>q. d.</hi> None can teach us the way of Life, but Thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; O lead us in it, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us not to depart out of it.

               <head>3. <hi>The Third General Head,</hi> viz.</head>
               <p>Though the way of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Salvation by Christ be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Capacity of a natural Man to reach, and take in; yet God can give us a true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of it, and full sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction about about it; inclining our hearts readily to comply with it, and acquiesce in it; and this discerning God gives the Saints by his Spirit, not in the Light of Humane Reason, but in the Light of a Divine Faith, grounded upon the Word of God: Faith sees things as they are in God; <hi>in lumine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis prima,</hi> in the Light of the first Verity, which is God himself; all Gospel-truths are copied out from that Divine Original, and revealed to us in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48581:19"/>
the Scriptures: so much truth as we have in us, so much of the Image of God we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and no more: an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Mind ascends upwards, by that which is revealed; to God himself, the first Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of all truth, and sees suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds for our faith and hope in him; God lets things into the Soul at another Door than Reason does, which admits nothing but what first passes thorow our Senses; Faith having to do with things Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, consults not with Flesh and Blood about them, but takes them in by a higher Light, God shining in our hearts, and giving us that evidence of things not seen nor apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Light of Humane Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48581:20"/>
It may here be queried; Since the way of a Sinner's Salvation by faith in Christ is so myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, so much above the reach of a mere Humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot be discerned but in the light of Faith, and that Faith being not of our selves, but the Gift of God;</p>
               <p>The Query is,—Whether Man, without offering violence to the Principles of his Nature, as a Reasonable Creature, be capable of such a Faith, that lifts him up above his Reason, and carries him out to those things which a Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding conceives not? This is the Quere which I am to say something in answer to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God compels none to believe; yet he makes things so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48581:20"/>
clear to his Saints, that they cannot but believe. Though God gives Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. yet he forces it upon none; Faith is voluntary: A Mind spiritually enlightned, sees sufficient grounds of faith in Christ himself, and therefore out of choice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment relies upon him only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all other confidences as vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith is either Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Divine; We are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally capable of both, but with this difference: We may bring our selves to a Humame Faith, but not to a Divine Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> we may bring our selves to a Humane Faith, about things we see, hear and understand; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and common Charity doth this: there is no man but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves something; I am not now
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48581:21"/>
speaking of a natural Faculty of believing in a humane way; all men as men, have this;—but I am speaking of a Divine Faith, proper only to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; a faith in God and Christ about those things that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend our Reason. I say, no man can bring himself to such a Faith; he hath no natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or Principle in him, that leads him to such a Faith, it is the work <hi>of</hi> God, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>in</hi> God. I grant Man as a Rational Creature is passively capable of a Divine Faith, none else are, but Reasonabe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and yet, I must tell you, nothing doth more oppose Faith than Reason doth; you must know, that this natural Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that is in man for Faith, doth arise from the necessary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48581:21"/>
subjection of his Mind to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Power of God; they who would resist his Will, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his Power, else his Power would be no Power, far from Omnipotency, if it could be resisted by a Creature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must needs have a passive Obediential Capacity or Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of any higher Principle that God shall think fit to create in him, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, but must receive any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light that God shall let in upon him, and set up by his Almighty Spirit as a standing Supernatural Principle to guide and direct him in all his ways: As it was in the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> so 'tis in the second Creation, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands light to shine out of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48581:22"/>
darkness, else there would be no possibility of a Sinner's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; for upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he now goes, and the present Light he walks by, 'tis impossile to convert him; but by putting higher Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a higher Light into him, he may be converted; this God can do, and none else, who calls things that are not, as though they were, and gives them a being; he puts a new Supernatural Light into the heart of a man, and then sets Christ before him; and by this Light, by this new Eye, or Principle of Faith, he sees that in Christ he never saw before; and willingly receives him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Objections of Flesh and Blood to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48581:22"/>
Though Faith be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet Faith hath its Reasons and Grounds too, but such as are not of our finding out: God shews them to us in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, what good grounds we have for our Faith in him, from his Veracity and Truth, from his Goodness and Mercy, his Power and All-sufficiency, his Ability to save to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Though Faith be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet it is not against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; nay, allowing the first Principles of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a God of Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Power, Goodness, and Wisdom, which may be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in some measure, even by the Light of Nature, it ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally follows, that Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can do all things; that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48581:23"/>
Wisdom understands that which finite creatures cannot reach, nor see any reason for; so that though the deep things of God, spoken of in Scripture, be above our Reason, yet still there is reason sufficient, why we should believe 'em:—As for instance; That God should become man, is above Reason, but not against it: That God should assume the pure and perfect Nature of man, and give it an Existence in the Divine Person of his Son; this is a great honour to man, and in the consequence of it, doth much set forth the Glory of God, both of his Justice and Mercy. God made man at first after his own Image, to shew how near a-kin man was to God; what a likeness and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48581:23"/>
there was between them: Now if God will veil himfelf, and appear in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Image of himself, to man, that there may be a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Society and Fellowship between them, this is great condescention in God, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much love to us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the children of men. If God will draw in the bright beams of his essential Glory, because it is too great a light, too strong and dazling for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortal eye to look upon, that we may have free access unto him, behold his face, and live; shall this offend us? The more God lets us into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the nearer he takes us to himself, the more should we rejoice, that we are admitted into his Presence, and suffered
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48581:24"/>
to stand before so great a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which shines out upon us here, as we are able to bear it. If there were not some distance between God and our Faith, in this state of absence, we should be quite swallowed up of his Glory; we can now bear the Conceptions of our Faith which is as much as we can do. Though we cannot yet bear the Vision of the things themselves, we shall be more strengthned, more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized in all our faculties, in our bodies and souls, when that day comes. Now we have as much of God, as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this dispensation of Faith under which we live; we shall see more hereafter, face to face.—Thus much for that <hi>Query.</hi> Let us now more particularly consider what there is in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48581:24"/>
Doctrine of Faith, that poses natural men, that they take such offence at, is such a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block in their way, that they cannot get over: They stumble at many things in the Gospel, but more especially at the Doctrine of Justification by Faith alone; 'tis said, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. <hi>They stumbled at</hi> that <hi>stumbling stone;</hi> more especially at <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I have already told you, Faith is not attainable by our own power; we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade our selves, nor bring over our own minds to close in with Gospel-Truths; and what is not in our power, we are apt to think absolutely impossible; and shall think so, till Faith comes; Faith when it comes, makes us sensible of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48581:25"/>
of God in working it, and keeps us ever after in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependance upon God for all that he hath promised: Nothing is more unintelligible to a natural man, than this, That he who believes in Christ, shall be saved; and therefore he counts the Doctrine of Faith, foolishness, and rejects the whole Gospel; or else the Devil runs him into Presumption, persuades him <hi>that</hi> is Faith; a false Faith doth the Devil as much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as down-right Infidelity; Faith in Christ is a strange Doctrine to natural men, <hi>Acts</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. Therefore they take offence at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Iustification of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by Imputed Righteousness:—</hi>Here they stumble again;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48581:25"/>
they cannot see how the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of another, should become theirs by God's act of Imputation, supported (in the equity of it) by Christ's perfect obedience for us; why should it seem strange, if that which Christ out of mere love intended for us, be graciously imputed to us, for our use and benefit? Certainly the best and only Plea for Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the sight of God, is this,—That Christ is our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness. The truth is, 'tis the greatness of God's Grace that puzzles them; they except against that, which makes most for them, if they rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered their own case; for there can be no justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a sinner any other way, according to Law, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring personal perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 'tis impossible; the soul
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48581:26"/>
that sins must dye; but the soul that sins, may live, says the Gospel, if he believe in Christ, with a serious purpose of turning to God, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his sins; which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Believer doth, and must do: The <hi>Iustification</hi> of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the sight of God, is a strange Paradox; it sounds ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, a great deal higher than the pardon of a sinner; it implies the perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a sinner; imputed to him, upon full Satisfaction given to Divine Justice for all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; the Righteousness of the Law calls for it; Christ first deals with the offended Justice of God, prevents the threatned Vengeance, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for the Grace and Mercy of God to flow down upon us: The Righteousness
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48581:26"/>
upon the account of which a sinner is justified, must needs be an imputed Righteousness, derived from another; for he hath it not in himself, he could not be a sinner if he had; but all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God, therefore all who are saved, must go out of themselves to Christ for Righteousness, without which we can never be justified; we are justified from sin, not in it, much less by it: If our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication were not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perfect Righteousness, it would look rather like a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of sin, than of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from sin: Our great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is, to understand by what Righteousness we are justified: A sinner hath no Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in himself, and we shall never be persuaded that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48581:27"/>
without Works, will be imputed to us, till God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades us, but shall still go about to establish our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, till Faith hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed us: What is this Faith? What is this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ to me? says a sinner: He is equally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of both, till Faith comes; then the dispute is at an end, the man is of another mind now; he doth immediately fall in with his own Faith. What is the reason that carnal men do oppose the Gospel? 'Tis because they don't believe it; when they do, the case is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; they are of the same mind with Christ, can set to their seal, That his Word is true, and that every man is a lyar, who says otherwise: When we know experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48581:27"/>
what it is to believe in Christ with all our hearts, we shall be fully satisfied in the Doctrine of Faith, how strange soever it seemed to us before.—Let us not go about to prove the fundamental Points of the Gospel by Principles of Human Reason: Faith fetches all from the Word; whether there be reason, or no reason for it; Faith will believe it, relying with a holy security of mind upon God's Word, let what will be against it in Reason, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or common experience and observation of all mankind; so did <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> Faith is a great Mystery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. above all human wisdom, by the light of reason we cannot know Christ, till he give us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, 1 Joh. 5. 20. Faith is much opposed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48581:28"/>
the world, and our own hearts; but we resist all in Faith, when we continue to believe, holding fast our confidence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all objections to the contrary: <hi>This is our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, even our Faith;</hi> that it stands its ground still; nay, when objections come up near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us, get into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to the great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soul, yet Faith, well acted, overcomes all Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conscience, and says tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, <hi>The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</hi> Psal. 27. 1. Rom. 8. 38, 39. Hope grounded upon Faith, is a <hi>sure anchor of the soul,</hi> Heb. 6. 19. Col. 1. 4, 5. Faith is all the evidence we have for our Salvation; we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48581:28"/>
stand by Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. We hold by no other tenure: 'Tis hard for Believers themselves to act Faith, because of that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Unbelief that is in them, and therefore it must needs be much harder for Unbelievers to receive their first Faith; God by his Almighty Power lets it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, and keeps it there: Faith is not such a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending knowledge as we have of those things that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to man's understanding; it is above that, neither do we ever attain to it, till we are persuaded of that which we cannot by reason conceive or understand, because it <hi>passeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 18. <hi>Calvin</hi> shewing the <note place="margin">Inst. l. 3. c. 2. Sect. 14.</note> difference between Reason and Faith, expresses it thus: <hi>Persuasum habet quod non</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48581:29"/>
                  <hi>capit; i. e.</hi> the mind of a man is by Faith persuaded of the truth of that which by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it cannot conceive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and <hi>Calvin</hi> was no Enthusiast. The knowledge of Faith standeth rather in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, than in any clear, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, logical demonstration of the thing it self. Faith is more than knowledge; <hi>i. e.</hi> more sure and certain; things that are not made evident by their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet are made sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Faith, <hi>which begets confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> Eph. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>This certainty doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep us from doubting, but rather supports us under it: We are flesh as well as spirit: Faith may be shaken by Temptations, but it always opposes them, and at last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them: Thus it is when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48581:29"/>
the work of Faith <hi>is fulfilled with power,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 11. when the Truths of the Gospel, which we hear and are enlightned in the knowledg of, are sealed by the <hi>Spirit to our hearts,</hi> Eph. 1. 13. Faith comes by hearing; we must hear what we are to believe, before we can believe it; and besides hearing, there must be an inward conception of the meaning of those words, we take in the sense of them, and then the sealing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit follows, setling and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in the belief of those Truths: We must make use of Reason to find out what is revealed in Scripture; but 'tis Faith only that assures us of the truth of that: When we are satisfied that God hath so said in Scripture, let us then yield the Obedience of Faith,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48581:30"/>
without any further disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reasoning about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things themselves.</p>
               <p>The Fundamental Principles of Christian Religion, as they are plainly laid down in the Scripture, will admit of no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute; they are peremptory Conclusions, proved by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press word of God, not by any Principles of Reason; here is nothing to be denied, nothing to be distinguished upon; we must take them as they are laid down in the Word, yielding the obedience of Faith to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimony: I grant we are to explain obscure, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, metaphorical Texts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Analogy of Faith, and according to the letter of plainer Scriptures.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There may seem to be a Contradiction, but no man who professeth himself to be a Christian, can say there is; for this would overthrow the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the whole Bible; we must not raise a Civil War in the Scriptures, setting one Text against another: I don't believe that <hi>Iames</hi> contradicts <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Paul, Iames;</hi> there is a sense in which they do agree, though we may not presently find it out; let us not rashly cry out, a Contradiction, but consider how to reconcile these two Scriptures, to make out the truth of both; that <hi>Abram</hi> was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48581:31"/>
not justified by Works in <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense, and <hi>Abram</hi> was justified by Works in <hi>Iames</hi>'s sense; that was, and was not, is not <hi>circa idem. Paul</hi> speaks of one thing, and <hi>Iames</hi> of another, therefore no Contradiction; were they two to speak toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would agree, and justify one another's words: 'Tis a safe rule, never to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture into a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to it self; while we think the Scripture contradicts it self, we shall be under a temptation to make it good, by all the Sophistry imaginable: we are not in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Scripture to it self, while we suppose a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction possible, this is to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting; ends in blaspheming,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48581:31"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45. They are hard put to it to maintain their own Opinions, who can do it no otherwise, than by setting the Scripture at variance with it self, to make good their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we may differ in our Interpretation, but let us not so much as suppose that the Scripture can differ from it self, but humbly wait upon God, till we can better recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile one Text with another; we shall find, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gospel Truths will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen themselves to our Faith more and more, we shall by degrees come to that unity of Faith, and knowledge spoken of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>Faith seems unreasonable to all men 'till it be acted, then it goes forth in its own light,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48581:32"/>
carries its own Evidence along with it, 'tis persuaded of the truth of the Word, and such a present persuasion, admits of no contrary impression; if any Objections be suddenly started by the Flesh, they are as suddenly answered by the Spirit of Faith; Faith will hear nothing against its own present act, but on it goes, quenching all the fiery Darts of the Wicked that fly thick about it; the supposed strength of reason, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the real strength of Faith.</p>
                  <p>To set one or two single Texts against the general scope, and express words of the whole Gospel, is so bold an attempt, that I wonder any should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48581:32"/>
There is a Justification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, and there is a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Works; believe both to be true, without any contradiction, and let that end the difference: To set <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> against <hi>Paul,</hi> one Preacher against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what will this end in? We may preach up the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Abram</hi>'s Person by Faith without Works, and not contradict <hi>Iames</hi>'s, who speaks of the Justification of <hi>Abram</hi>'s Faith by his Works;—we had need be well satisfied in the truth of that Faith upon which the Justification of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the sight of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
                  <p>You see how difficult a matter it is to submit to the judgment of Faith; Reason will be rising
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48581:33"/>
up against it, putting many Objections; If God do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to deny our selves, and to adhere to his Word, we shall be run down presently; we are more for disputing, than belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; whereas Faith (if the letter of the Text be plain) will admit of no dispute; but believes the Record that God hath given of his Son, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that every tittle of the Word should be fulfilled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: As Humane things require understanding, so Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things require faith; <hi>We believe, and are sure;</hi> Joh. <hi>6.</hi> 69. not we know, and are sure; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing settles the mind in a firm persuasion of the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but Faith, therefore Faith is absolutely necessary in all who desire to be saved.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48581:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men may eternally perish without Faith; but when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is awakened, and comes to be concerned about a Future State, there is no securing our Souls into Eternity but by Faith in Christ; and this Faith stands not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God, nothing less can work it in you.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if any Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth should now strike upon your Understandings, and find no entrance, but seem dark and unintelligible, you should lift up your voice for Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and beg of God that he would not suffer the sound of that Truth to pass thorough your Ears, and out of you Memories, before he hath given you some insight into it, and made you willing to receive it by faith;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48581:34"/>
he can do it, and will do it, if we wait upon upon him for teaching; did we hear the Word under a Conviction of this, That 'tis utterly impossible to believe the Mystery of the Gospel, unless it be given to us, we should look up more earnestly to the Father of Lights for this great and rare gift of Faith.</p>
                  <p>After all that hath been said, if any should stumble at the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, and take offence at it, this doth but verify the Text.<hi>—Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone, and rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whosoever believeth on him, shall not be ashamed.</hi>
