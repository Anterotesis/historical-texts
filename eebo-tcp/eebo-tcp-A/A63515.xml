            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Desire thou shouldst understand that the Author of the following Verses against Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twenty Years since conceived that <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> against him, and that <hi>Hatred</hi> of his <hi>Illogical</hi> and <hi>Atheistical Genius</hi> which he has here Exprest, and that he Avers that it is both the <hi>Effect</hi> of the DARKNESSE of this Mans <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Encrease</hi> of it, that he holds that there cannot be <hi>an Idea of an Infinite Being.</hi> I cannot think of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his wicked Conceits, but what has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb facs="tcp:64852:3"/>
confuted by one or other of his Learned Adversaries; but I have not observed that this hath been taken notice of by any one except <hi>Des Cartes</hi>; wherefore I shall desire the Ingenious Reader to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his utmost <hi>Intention</hi> on these Words, which the Author of these Verses delivered in a Discourse to a great Auditory about seven years since: But my hardest Task is yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi> to Prove, as to a stubborn Atheist, that there is a GOD. Many men declare that they have in their minds the <hi>Idea</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, that is to say, of a Being Absolutely Infinite: I say many men declare that they have the <hi>Idea</hi> of this Being, therefore certainly there is such a Being. How, may some say? This is a fine Argument indeed; It is so, because Many Men think it is so. Why may not that which you call an <hi>Idea</hi> of GOD, be nothing else but a meer Conceit or Figment of the Mind. To this we answer, that we undertake to <hi>Demonstrate</hi> that it is not a meer Conceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we apprehend under these <hi>Terms,</hi> A Being Absolutely Infinite. If it were a meer Conceit, an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> or Empty Notion, then this Proposition would be True: Some meer Conceit or Figment of the Mind is That which the Mind may Apprehend under these Terms, A Being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that we Prove to be False, thus; That which 'tis possible for the Mind to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<pb facs="tcp:64852:3"/>
and to know for certain that 'tis nothing else but what it works or frames to it self, is not That which the Mind may Apprehend under these Terms, A Being Absolutely Infinite:</p>
            <p>Every meer Conceit, <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> or Figment of the Mind is that which 'tis possible for the Mind to comprehend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore No meer Conceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is That which the Mind may Apprehend under these Terms, A Being Absolutely Infinite. By these Words 'tis possible <hi>for the Mind to comprehend,</hi> I mean, As to the Utmost Extent of its Natural Capacity: not but that it may be Impossible for the Mind by reason of some <hi>Accidental</hi> Defect to <hi>Comprehend</hi> its own Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Absolutely Infinite plainly implies All Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Perfection that we can Understand, and That which Infinitely Transcends our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. We know nothing more cettainly than this, that Our <hi>Holy One</hi> is Incomprehensible: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, sayes that Incomparable Divine St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I shall demonstrate to <hi>All Christians</hi> that there is an <hi>Idea,</hi> or Notion of God in the Minds of All men: And by this it will appear that 'tis very Indiscreet (not to say Wicked) for any Christian to slight this Argument for the Conviction of the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Atheism. I do not wonder to see it slighted by that <hi>Monster,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or by his
<pb facs="tcp:64852:4"/>
Friend <hi>Gassendus,</hi> who has such Abominable Gross Conceits of the Deity, that 'twould look like a kind of Prophaneness to mention them in <hi>English</hi> before such a Promiscuous Auditory. But this I shall say in scorn of those <hi>Ugly things</hi> which this <hi>New Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and <hi>New Divine</hi> has written in opposition to <hi>Des Cartes</hi>; that it is not strange that he who writes the Life of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> sayes of <hi>Hobbes,</hi> that he was <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendo charissimus,</hi> But let these men, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their rare <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> Prate what they please, we know &amp; are assur'd that these words were dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to St. <hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Which shew the work of the Law written in their hearts.</hi> He speaks of the <hi>Gentiles, which have not the Law, that is,</hi> (says the truly Learned, and Pious Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi>) <hi>which have not that Revelation of Gods Will and Law which the Iews had.</hi> By the <hi>work of the Law</hi> we understand <hi>That which the Law Requires to be done,</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reduces to these Two Heads, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> What can be more evident than this, that in the <hi>work of the Law written in the Hearts of Men</hi> there is implied an Idea, or Notion of God? sith the <hi>Principal</hi> work of the Law is, To Love God, which <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and his Followers declare to be Written in their Hearts by that celebrated Saying of theirs <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Follow God.</hi> What a shame is it for any Christian not
<pb facs="tcp:64852:4"/>
to Reflect upon the Brightness of his own Soul, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by this Splendid Notion of the Deity, so as to despise All the Glories of this perishing World! <hi>But, alas, the</hi> Perverseness <hi>of our Wills</hi> averts <hi>our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding from reflecting on its own Light. Shine upon us, we beseech thee,</hi> O Father of Lights, <hi>in the Face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the</hi> Brightness of thy Glory, <hi>that in thy Light we may see Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here I shall mind you of those Two Sacred Arguments to Demonstrate the Deity, which the Psalmist uses in</hi> Ps. 19. <hi>to wit, the Light of the Visible World, and the Purity of the Law of</hi> GOD, <hi>that Spiritual Light that proceeds from the</hi> Sun of Righteousness, <hi>the Sun of the Invisible world, Psal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apostle sayes expresly, Rom. 1.20. <hi>The Invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead. And as for the Law of God, the</hi> Holy Scriptures, <hi>whosoever reads them with All Diligence, and compares what he Reads with what he</hi> Sees <hi>in the World, and what he often</hi> Feels <hi>in his own Soul, he will certainly cry out with the Blessed Psalmist,</hi> Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; verily he is a God that Judgeth in the Earth.</p>
            <p>And now I shall mention another of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s wicked Conceits, that thou maist more clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Iustice</hi> of that vehement <hi>Indignation</hi> I have against him. In his late <hi>Pamphlet</hi> entiuled <hi>An Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb facs="tcp:64852:5"/>
Narrative concerning Heresie,</hi> p. 11. He shews that he would fain have this Doctrine go for a piece of POPERY, <hi>viz.</hi> That a mans Will and Purpose to commit Sin, does not proceed from God, but origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from himself or from the Devil. Unhappy man, who endeavours so plainly and openly to stain the Glory of the HOLY ONE! and to <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us</hi> to Sin, the <hi>Only Absolute</hi> EVIL! For he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Rationally conclude that Sin deserves our utmost Hatred, who has a Conceit that it Proceeds from GOD. The <hi>Spring</hi> and Original of all Sin is <hi>SELF-WILL,</hi> Sin being an <hi>Aversion</hi> from GOD, whilst the Will of the Creature Affects It self, and not the Will of the Creator, as the <hi>Prime Motive</hi> in its Tendency or Inclination. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may call this <hi>Non-sense,</hi> or what he pleases; but he shall quickly Know that 'tis a Truth of the greatest Importance. I grant that He has a very Elegant Style both in <hi>English</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> Prose and Verse: But his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and other Books of his are so full of <hi>Madness</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> that 'tis impossible they should be so <hi>Taking</hi> as they are, but that the <hi>Practices</hi> of so Many even of them that have Named the Name of CHRIST, are so Agreeable to His <hi>Notions.</hi> But the time draws on apace when He &amp; his Followers shall Know that the LORD <hi>our God</hi> will not be Mocked, and that he will Hear the Voice of his Church, crying unto him, <hi>Arise, O God, plead thine own Cause, remember how the Foolish man Reproacheth thee daily.</hi>
