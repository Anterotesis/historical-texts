            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the Chapter before us, we have our Apostle, from other Grounds, arguing the same Point, with Christians, at Corinth.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Not as if the whole Church of Corinth did disbeleeve the Resurrection: But onely, Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them (<hi>How say, Some amongst you, that there is no Resurrection</hi>?<note place="margin">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56322:6"/>
as of Our Resurrection, pursuant of it.</p>
            <p>Which, it seems, they did either directly Deny; or did otherwise Elude, by putting some Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sense up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis much, I confess, that Any, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them selves Christians, should be found to Deny so Important an Article of the Christian Faith, as is that of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But it will appear lesse Strange, in those who, from Gentilism, (not from Judaism,) were lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Christian Faith; (which was then but New, in comparison of what now it is:)</p>
            <p>If we consider; That, in our own days, (when Christianity hath been planted, and spread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, for more than Sixteen Hundred years;) we find those, who, (retaining to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the name of Christians,) do yet leave no stone unturned, to Undermine, and (as much as in them lies) to Overthrow, the most Fundamental Points of Christianity; even the Divinity of Christ; and his Satisfaction to Gods Justice for the sins of Men: (on which Hindge, the whole Doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity depends.)</p>
            <p>Others; who turne the whole Christian Worship, into a kind of Pageantry, and ridiculous Gesticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: such as are many Fopperies of the Romish Church; (more Absurd than those of the more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Heathens.) Setting to Sale, both Heaven and Purgatory, for summes of Money: And Bartering, not onely for Pardon of sins, but for Leave to sin: (as if, of them, it had been said, <hi>My House shall be called, an House of Prayer</hi>;<note place="margin">

               <hi>but yee have made it a Den of Theeves.</hi>) And fill their Legends with such Ridiculous Stories, as would tempt a modest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, rather to reject the Trueths of Christ, than to admit such Fooleries. And, in the mean time, make no scruple of Murders, and Massacres; of Treasons, and Rebellions; of Assassinating Princes, subverting Governments, and turning the World upside down; to propagate their Devises: Which, we can hardly have so much Charity as to think, that themselves do seriously Beleeve.</p>
            <p>Others; who make but Rallery of the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things in Christianity; of Heaven, and Hell, and the Day of Judgement; of the Souls Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; of the very Being, and Providence of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">

            <p>But we need not wonder, That the Devil should have Impudence and Wiles inough, to turn himself into as many Disguises for the Interest of Hell; as a Jesuite for that of Rome.</p>
            <p>'Tis, therefore, the less strange, that <hi>Some,</hi> of these <hi>New</hi> Christians, should (at <hi>Corinth</hi>) Doubt of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, of these Christians who so Doubted, we are next to consider, What Method St. Paul useth, to convince them of it.</p>
            <p>He doth not deal with them as with meere Scepticks, (that would admit of Nothing:) Nor,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56322:7"/>
as with Heathens, (who owned nothing of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nothing of the Jewish or Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:) Nor as with Jews, (who, though they admitted the Jewish, denied the Christian:) But, as with Christians. And therefore takes for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such Concessions of this kind, as they did, or ought to, admitt of; And argues from thence; That they ought to admit of this also.</p>

To wit, That the Apostles Argument and Discourse, (both in this verse, and the whole Chapter,) extends only to prove the Resurrection of the Righteous; not that of the Wicked. 'Tis, <hi>of Christ the First-fruits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23.</note> 
               <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards those that are Christs:</hi> (of those who are not Christ's, he says nothing.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>ver.</hi> 43.</note> it is raised a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body; (which cannot be understood of the Bodies of Wicked men)</p>
            <p>And it is agreed, for ought I find, by all Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors, (and, amongst the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st, by Grotius and Dr. Hammond,) That, this whole Discourse, is not at all to be understood, of the Resurrection of the Wicked; But, of the Glorious Resurrection of the Righteous onely. And, That, in those Words, <hi>As in Adam all Dy, so in Christ shall All be made Alive,</hi> the word <hi>All</hi> is not of the same extent in both Clauses: But extends, in the first clause,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</note> to All that appertain to Adam; that is, to All Mankind: in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter clause, to All that are Christs; that is, to All the Faithfull. (For 'tis those onely that are <hi>made Alive</hi> by Christ: That of the Wicked being an <hi>Eternal Death:</hi> As our Saviour himself distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, Joh, 5.<note place="margin">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56322:12"/>
the Resurrection of <hi>Damnation.)</hi> And, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel is thus to be understood; As All that are in Adam, do Dy in Him; so All that are in Christ, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stified, sanctified, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.)</p>
            <p>And this Grotius parallels with that of Rom. 5.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.</note> 
               <hi>As by the Offence of One,</hi> (that is of Adam,) <hi>Judgement came upon All men to condemnation: so by the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of One,</hi> (that is, of Christ,) <hi>the Free-gift came upon All-men, for Justification of Life.</hi> Where, by <hi>All-men</hi> in the first clause, Grotius understands <hi>All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; by <hi>All-men</hi> in the second clause, <hi>All Beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Making this the adequate sense of both places; As <hi>all that are in Adam,</hi> that is, all the Race of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, do by Adam come to <hi>Dy</hi>; So <hi>all that are in Christ,</hi> are <hi>Justified</hi> by Christ, and by Christ <hi>Raised</hi> to a <hi>Life of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what must we then say? That the Wicked are not also to be Raised? Or, that St. Paul did not Know it?</p>
            <p>No: we must s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That the Wicked shall be also Raised by Christ; himself tells us expressely, Joh. 5.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And, That St. Paul Knew it so to be; himself as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, in his Discourse to Felix, Act. 24.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14.</note> (not as his Own Faith onely, but that of the Fathers also.) <hi>So worship I the God of my fathers; Beleeving all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets; And have hope toward God (which themselves also allow) that there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead,</hi>

               <hi>both of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56322:12"/>
the Just and Vnjust.</hi> Than which nothing can be more express.</p>
            <p>For though the Wicked, by reason of their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Unbelief, do not injoy the Benefits of Christs Redemption to the <hi>Resurrection of Life:</hi> Yet are they subject to Christs Dominion (as the Judge of the World,) and shall be raised by his Power to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Damnation.</hi> Which though it be not the business of this place before us, is proved by divers others.</p>
            <p>But why then (you will ask) doth St. Paul say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it in this place, where he speaks so copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Resurrection?</p>
            <p>To which I make this Answer. We are to take notice of St. Paul as a Close Disputant. It was his manner of arguing (here and elsewhere,) to keep himself close to the point in question: Both as to the Conclusion he was to prove; and as to the Topicks from whence he fetched his Arguments.</p>
            <p>Now the matter in question, with these Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was not, What should become of those that were out of Christ, and not to expect Benefit by him: (and therefore, of that, he saies nothing.) But, What are the Benefits, which they that are in Christ, receive from him. Amongst which, that of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> was the main; and, of which they doubted. To this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he applies his Arguments, (not to the other,) sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting such as were most proper for this Conclusion. (Waving the other; but, not Denying it.)</p>
            <p>In like manner as, in our Creed; We profess to Beleeve <hi>the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>; without mentioning that of <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> or the State of the <hi>Wicked</hi> after this Life. Yet this we Beleeve also: According to what our Saviour tells us,

            </p>
            <p>Now as for the Persons, with whom he doth here dispute; and the Arguments suted to those Persons; (for This Branch, as well as the Former:) We are to consider, that they were Christian Gentiles. Who had before learned the Heathen Philosophy, but did now imbrace the Christian Religion, and Acknowledged most of the Doctrines thereof. Onely this they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of (as not consistent with their Philosophy,) That the Dead should Rise again.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Arguments he makes use of, are drawn from Principles of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there be no Resurrection, then is not Christ Risen:</hi> (Which yet is a matter of Fact,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13, 16.</note> so notorious and fully testified, that you Christians cannot doubt it.)</p>
            <p>And, <hi>If Christ be not Risen; our Preaching is vain, and your Faith is vain</hi>; And,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>those that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished</hi>; And, <hi>we are found false witnesses of God, who have testified that he raised up Christ.</hi> (Which Consequents were things unworthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by any who professed themselves Christians.)</p>
            <p>And, <hi>If in this life onely we have hope</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>we are of all men most miserable.</hi> (We Apostles, and you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; who, upon this account, are exposed to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Miseries in this Life; and do therefore most egregiously play the fools, if in another life there be not a Compensation.)</p>
            <p>All which Arguments, though to one who is not a Christian they would be very Insignificant, are very Cogent to one that is.</p>
            <p>And good Reason the Apostle had to argue at this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56322:14"/>
rate. Not onely, as being the part of a good Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, to take advantage of the True Concessions of those with whom he disputes; as good foundations of a concl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sive Argument: But especially, Because these are the True Topicks in Disputes of this nature.</p>
            <p>For, the Truthes of Religion being of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wo sorts; some discoverable by Natural Light; Others by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation onely: Those of the later sort are not to be proved Conclusively, without admitting that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which alone we can come to know them.</p>
            <p>Thus; That there is a God that made the World; and, That this God is to be Obeyed and Worshiped; and, This in such Manner as himself would have it; Are things which may be argued from Natural Light.</p>
            <p>And, that of the Souls Immortality also; at lest with a great deal of Probability; if not with so much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to convince a wilful Sceptick; who therefore Sees not (not for want of Light, but) because he shuttes his Eyes.</p>
            <p>But, the Doctrine of the Trinity; of Salvation by Faith in Christ; and the Resurrection of the Body; Are purely matters of Faith; and their Certainty depends onely on Divine Testimony.</p>
            <p>That God is <hi>Able</hi> to raise the Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that there is no Inconsistence in the thing; may be discoursed from Natural Light.</p>
            <p>But, That he <hi>Will</hi> do it; and, in what manner; we can no otherwise know than as He hath Declared to us: (either by himself immediately; or, by such as, we have good reason to beleeve, are sent by him.)</p>
            <p>Thus Christ, arguing the same point with the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces: <hi>Yee err</hi> (saith he) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures; nor,</hi>

And, had they well understood the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; they might thence have learned, that it <hi>must be so.</hi>

            <p>And, in this Chapter, he argues it yet further:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note> As having, here, greater Concessions (from Christians) than from the Jews.</p>
            <p>As to the Possibility; he argues <hi>(ab Esse ad Posse) Christ is Risen</hi>; therefore, the thing is <hi>Possible.</hi>

            <p>First, that this Method of the Apostles arguing, may be a good Direction for Us in like cases. When we are preaching to Christian Auditories (such as this;) it is not prudence to quit the Principles of Christianity, and divert to those of Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light onely: As if we were Preaching to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, not to Christians.</p>
            <p>Much of our Religion, depends on Revelation: And, though not Repugnant to Reason, is yet much Above it; and not discoverable by it, without the Scriptures, where those Revelations are recorded.</p>
            <p>We do but too much gratify men of Atheistical and Unchristian Principles, when (to comply with their Cavills,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.21.</note>) instead of <hi>Holding fast what is good</hi>; we let go our Hold, and dispute our Principles: As if we were now Planting Christianity amongst Heathens; and not, Edifying a Christian Church.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that, in Building, great care is to be taken,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.48, 49.</note> that the <hi>Foundations be well lay'd</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

the Building cannot be Firm.</p>
            <p>But there is a time, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

            <p>If they demand New Miracles, and New Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of what hath been sufficiently Revealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed already: Our Savior tells us (in the Parable of Lazarus and the Rich Glutton,) <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets</hi>;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now, if the Miracles and Revelations, in the time Moses and the Prophets, were sufficient for those who lived in the days of Christ; (notwithstanding that they lived not in Moses days:) much more may those also of Christ and his Apostles, suffice for those that live in Our days. And, if a sufficient Evidence, (such as would be enough for a Sober person, that is Willing to be Taught,) prevail not with them: neither would they be perswaded, though they should be gratifyed in what they now demand.</p>

all Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (before that) he proves to the Sadduces, the Doctrine of the Resurrection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24, 26.</note> from that of God to Moses, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob</hi>; and that <hi>they did therefore Erre, because they Knew not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</hi> Which he would not have sayd, had not the Doctrine of the Resurrection been taught in <hi>the scriptures</hi> that then were; that is, those <hi>of the Old Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Socinians, without allowing that Christ is God indeed; if at lest they will but allow, That he is a <hi>Good Man,</hi> and a <hi>Wise man,</hi> (one who did understand the Consequence of an Argument, and did not designe purposely to impose upon us;) must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That the Doctrine of the Resurrection was taught in the Scriptures of the Old Testament; (for sure it is, that Christ thought so:) and That the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses made to the Fathers, were not onely Promises of Temporal things, but of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>They may as well say, That the Threatning to Adam, <hi>In the day that thou Eatest thereof thou shalt Dy the Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17:</note> was meant onely of a Temporal Death; (and then surely God would not Punish, beyond what he Threatned;) Contrary to which, St. Jude tells us, that those Before Christ, (as well as since,) <hi>do suffer the vengeance of Eternal Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jud.</hi> 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Third and last thing which I here observe, is this, That the Rewards and Punishments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, do concern us, not onely as to our Personal capacities; but, as to our Relative and Politick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities also, As we are Incorporated into Kingdomes, Cities, Families, and other Societies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, to receive according to the things done in the Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note> 
               <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56322:18"/>
Good or Bad.</hi> Whatsoever is done in the Body; in whatsoever Capacity.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected, That Kingdomes, and Cities, and Bodies Politick, shal not, in that Capacity, rise againe: And therefore cannot, in that capacity, be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or Rewarded. And, consequently, God being equally obliged to punish the sins of Societies, as of single Persons; he is obliged, in this World, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the sins of Societies (and to reward their good acts;) since that, hereafter, it cannot be done.</p>
            <p>But this Argument, I take to have more in it of Witt and Rhetorick, than of Logick, or sound Divinity: and would do better in a Poem or Panegyrick, than in a Sermon.</p>
            <p>For, by the same reason, we may as well say That the sins of Father and Child; of Master, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; of Husband, and Wife; must be Allways Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Life, (and in this onely;) Because that, <hi>in the Resurrection, they do neither Marry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30.</note> 
               <hi>nor are Given in Marriage.</hi> For Oeconomical Relations shall then cease, as well as Political.</p>
            <p>If it be said, That, these Relations, are but Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between single Persons, (not Societies;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sins thereof may, in those Persons, be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
            <p>I say, that this doth not alter the case at all. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that this is not Universal; (For a Father may have many Children, and may sin against his whole Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>to the Third and Fourth Generation</hi>; and a Lord or Master may have many Servants,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5.</note> and may Sin against his whole Family; and a man may be Servant to a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as well as to a single Person:)</p>
            <p>Beside this, (I say,) If this Exception were cogent; we might thence as well conclude, That <hi>Kings</hi> because single Persons) may, hereafter, be punished for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56322:19"/>
their Subjects, (and that Eternally;) but the <hi>States</hi> (in an Aristocrary) are punishable onely in this World, (and but with Temporal Punishments,) because These are a Collective Body.</p>
            <p>And it would hence follow likewise, That the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Villanies</hi> of Societies, are at lest one degree below that of the Papists <hi>Venial sins.</hi> For, I presume, the Jesuites themselves will not say, that their whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie; shall, in that capacity, be punished in Hell, not yet in Purgatory, for the greatest Villanies by them committed, as a Socie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. But, Venial Sins, they acknowledge to be punished, at lest in Purgatory, though not in Hell.</p>
            <p>And, by this means also, the greatest number of Sins, and those the most Hainous, would, as to another World, remain Unpunished, (and good Actions, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded.) For much the greater number of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the most considerable, are those of persons in their Relative Capacities; (as Parents, Children; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Servants; Husbands, VVives; Friends, Enemies; Neighbours, Strangers; Pastors, People; Princes, Subjects; Societies, and Combinations; Not of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Persons onely, in a meer Personal Independent Capacity.</p>
            <p>I adde also; That, on this account, No sins of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties could ever be Pardoned. For it not Societies, but single Persons, that <hi>are Regenerate and do Beleeve in Christ</hi>; without which, there is no Remission.</p>
            <p>VVe say therefore; That (as Societies are but made up of single Persons, so) the Acts of Societies, and of persons Related (in such Relative capacities,) whether Sinfull, or Virtuous; are indeed and in Gods account, the Acts of Particular Persons (in such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Societies:) And are, in those Persons, punished and rewarded, according to their deserts;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56322:19"/>
both in this World, and in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Cities (of Sodome and Gomorrha with those about them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 7.</note>) are sayd to <hi>suffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire</hi>; when indeed it is the Persons of those Cities that so suffer.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that, in this World, God doth many times punish the Sins of men, in a way sutable to those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities wherein they are committed: (the Sins of a Father, by loss of Children, or by a disobedient Child, or unhappy Children; the Sins of a Prince, by loss of his Dominions, or Rebellion of his Subjects; the sins of a Nation, by a common Calamity, wherein the Innocent do many times Suffer with the Guilty:) God by this means, pointing out the Sin in the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Punishment.</p>
            <p>But he doth not Allwayes do so: (the Sins of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, may be sometimes punished by the hand of the Magistrate; and the sins of a Prince, by the hand of a Traitor, whom he had not offended:) much less is he Obliged so to do.</p>
            <p>And when he doth so: He doth not Therefore do it because he cannot otherwise reach them: Nor is this the adequate Punishment of those sins; but onely a part of it. The greatest part of their punishment, even for these sins, being that of another VVorld.</p>
            <p>And though the Sins of men combined in societies, are, in the Judgement of Men, accounted as one Joint Act; (wherein the Innocent are oft involved with the Guilty, and suffer accordingly:<note place="margin">

            <l>BEgin we, first of all, with God on high:</l>
            <l>(Men as we are!) By no means passe him by.</l>
            <l>His Presence fills all places, far and near.</l>
            <l>Where ever Men Assemble, Hee is there.</l>
            <l>The Sea is full of Him: and Havens Wide.</l>
            <l>And all Mankind His Influence abide;</l>
            <l>Need his Assistance; All, in Every thing.</l>
            <l>His Progeny Wee are: from Him we Spring.</l>
            <l>Hee's Kind to Man: affording Seasons good.</l>
            <l>He stirs them up to Labour: gives them Food.</l>
            <l>He tells the Husband-man, When Earth is made</l>
            <l>Fit for the Plough; when, fitter for the Spade.</l>
            <l>He points out proper Seasons: How to know,</l>
            <l>What time, to Plant; What time is fit to Sow;</l>
            <l>And, what for every Seed. 'Tis He sett fast</l>
            <l>His Signes in Heav'n; His Stars in order plac't.</l>
            <l>And, by the Stars, He measures out the Year:</l>
            <l>Pointing, by them, what proper Seasons are</l>
            <l>For every mans Affairs: that All things may</l>
            <l>In Steady Course proceed, without decay.</l>
            <l>That, with His Favour, He would us Befriend:</l>
            <l>With Him we first Begin; with Him we End.</l>
            <l>O Thou, so highly Wonderfull! O Thou,</l>
            <l>The great Support of Man! to Thee I bow.</l>
            <l>And humbly make address. While I repeat</l>
            <l>(By Thy good leave) the Stars in order sett;</l>
            <l>Vouchsafe me Thine Assistance all along;</l>
            <l>With thy successefull Ayd, direct my Song.</l>
