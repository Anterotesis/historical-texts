            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

uermore affecteth nouelty, in a new forme of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeeres triumph, prepared for that honourable and worthy brother of Drapery, Sir <hi>Iohn Iolles,</hi> Knight and Alderman, on the day of his entrance into ſo high a dignitie.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday,</hi> being the 30. of <hi>October,</hi> 1615. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to auncient and moſt honourable cuſtome, the L.

He being both a Draper and Stapler, and theſe two profeſſions (in former times) appertaining to the Brethren of <hi>Londons</hi> Drapery, trading only in wools and woollen cloth, the then chiefe riches of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: both theſe myſteries meeting together ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently in one man, I did account it as a ſinne in me to ſunder them, and therefore made vſe of that Creaſt or Cognizaunce of the Golden Fliece, giuen by aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heraldrie to them both, and remaining ſtill in firme force with the Draper, as their Eſcutchion of Armes maketh manifeſt.</p>
            <p>In a goodly <hi>Argoe,</hi> ſhaped ſo neere as Art could yeeld it, to that of ſuch auncient and honourable fame, as conuaied <hi>Iaſon</hi> and his valiant <hi>Argonautes</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> to fetch away the Golden fleece from <hi>Cholchos;</hi> we make vſe of that memorable hiſtorie, as fit both for the time and occaſion. Therein aloft ſitteth <hi>Medea,</hi> whoſe loue to <hi>Iaſon,</hi> was his beſt meanes for obtaining
<pb facs="tcp:13311:3"/>
the Golden fleece: And therefore, as ſtill witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the fiery zeale of her affection towards him, ſhe ſitteth playing with his loue-lockes, and wantoning with him in all pleaſing daliance, to compaſſe the more ſettled aſſurance of his conſtancy: His noble Companions, as <hi>Hercules, Telamon, Orpheus, Caſtor, Pollux, Calais</hi> and <hi>Zethes</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Boreas,</hi> are ſeated about him in their ſeuerall degrees, attired in faire guilt Armours, bearing triumphall Launces, wreathed about with Lawrell, Shields honoured with the Impreſſe of the Golden fleece, and their heads circled with Lawrell, according to the manner of all famous Conquerors. This <hi>Argoe</hi> is rowed by diuers comely Eunuches, which continually attended on <hi>Medea,</hi> and ſhe fauouring them but to paſſe vnder the fleece of Golde, had all their garments immediatly ſprinkled ouer with golde, euen as if it had ſhowred downe in droppes vpon them, and ſo they rowe on in <hi>Iaſons</hi> triumph.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus borrowed the helpe of this well knowne ſtorie, to honour the day of our <hi>London Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> we doe Poetically inferre, that <hi>Neptune</hi> hauing declared himſelfe kinde in their comming hither, and <hi>Thameſis</hi> ſhewen her ſelfe as gracious, in paſſing ouer her watry boſome, To make his triumph more maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, they lend the aſſiſtance of their Sea Chariot, wherein they vſe to ſport themſelues on their watry regiment, it being ſhaped like to a Whale, or the huge Leuiathan of the Sea. Therein is placed the ſhadow of Sir <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwine,</hi> to grace this dayes honour, both by water and land, and by him are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eight royall Vertues, bearing the Enſignes of

Armes of eight honourable Drapers and Staplers, with beautiful ſhields, that declare each mans name, <hi>vz.
