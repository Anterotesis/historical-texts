            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOu were pleased, some

to tell me, You had a
mind to read how far I
could give you satisfaction in a <hi>few
Points</hi> you had raised to your self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Norman Conquest;</hi> and
that within a little while I should have
a <hi>Paper</hi> from you wherein they should
be contained: You were not long,
Sir, in justly acquitting your self of
your promise to me; I did receive the
<hi>Furniture</hi> of these ensuing <hi>Arguments,</hi>
by the <hi>four Questions</hi> you sent me, and
hope there is nothing to be found in
them, but unbyassed and venerable

Truth, which surely none will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
to hear. I have endeavoured
to pay all possible Respect to You, and
to Justice; and, as far as my Abilities

impartially offered my Thoughts upon
them, and now beg your candour in

            <p>AS you have stated the Question,
Sir, and desire to know what is
my Opinion of it; with submission to
others, better informed, and who
are more able to maintain the Truth of
those Principles I proceed upon, than
my self, I shall return you this modest
Answer, as my Sence and Judgment
in the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:54688:8"/>
in the Affirmative, for these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
constraining Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>William</hi> laid a far greater
stress upon his Claim and Titles to
this Kingdom, than ever he did upon
his great and mighty <hi>Conquest,</hi> will be
very plain and evident, if you please
but to consider with me these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. In that before his Conquest, when
the <hi>People</hi> had chosen <hi>Harold,</hi> the Son
of Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> for their King, after
the Death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor,
and had put aside <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> by
right of Blood and Inheritance entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Crown: This
Norman Duke made his
loud Complaints of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done him, in not <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
him, for he was<note n="*" place="margin">

<hi>Richard 1.
Richard 2. Emma.
Robert. Edward.
William.</hi>
               </note> Cosen
German to the Confessor,
who died<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Edward</hi> married <hi>Edith,</hi> the Daughter of E. <hi>Godwin;</hi> but whether upon a vow of Chastity, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impotency of Nature, or upon any hatred to her Father, or suspicion against her self (for all these Causes are alledged by several Writers of those Times) he forbore all private Familiarities with her.</note> without Issue;
and therefore pretended
that the Right truly devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon him. But, it
seems, as ill luck would have
it, this Duke they knew to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:54688:9"/>
be a Bastard, and neither the Saxon
Law, nor the Norman Custom, could
help him in such a Case, and so that
Title did him but little good. Well,
what therefore was to be his next
Work? Why,</p>
            <p>2. Truly his Pretence was then,
That the Confessor had designed him
for his Successor,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. Paris. 1.</hi> Antiq Brit. Eccles. 96.</note> and by his last Will
had bequeathed this Kingdom to him;
And this was confirmed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Nobility, and principally
of <hi>Harold</hi> himself: and hereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how <hi>Harold</hi> had trickt him,
and set the Crown on his own Head,
he sends over several Ambassadors,
with Commission to require him to
remember the Oath he had formerly
made to the said <hi>William</hi> in the time of
his Extremity, when he was his Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in <hi>Normandy;</hi> Which was, That he,
the said <hi>Harold,</hi> should assist him in the
obtaining of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> if
ever <hi>Edward</hi> died without Issue.</p>
            <p>3. And receiving but unkind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
from <hi>Harold,</hi>

to his Demands, which thus the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian

               <q>That

up the Inheritance of any Realm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the general consentand
allowance<note n="*" place="margin">That is, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Wittenagemot, Mycel Synod, or Parliament.</note> of the Senate

unreasonable Request of
the Duke now to require
him to renounce the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in which he was so well setled
to the good liking and content of
his People.</q> This Norman Duke, not
to be his own Judg, refers himself to
the Pope (then <hi>Alexander</hi> the second)
to decide the Matter, and so resolved
that the infallible Chair should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
who had the Justest Title to the
Crown and Kingdom, <hi>Harold</hi> or Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And the good old Gentleman

of the Clergie, Nobility,</hi>

               <hi>the Nobility, in
fine, promised to serve him,
and the Clergie and People to
aid him with Mony, according
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:54688:10"/>
to their several Abilities, and such offers
as they made, were forthwith set down
in writing by a Secretary there present.</hi>
So that being thus supplied, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with several other of his Friends,
he makes for <hi>England;</hi> and was no
sooner arrived at a place in <hi>Sussex,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Pevenessey,</hi> (now <hi>Pemsey</hi>) and got
well on Land, but, by his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he declared upon what Occasions
he thus entred the Realm; and so
preparing to give <hi>Harold</hi> Battle, he
hereby seemed as if he would have all
the World to know, his Quarrel was
more Personal than National. But
this I will speak more particularly and
largely to, when I come to mention
some of the Charters he made after he
was established King.</p>
            <p>And as Perjury seldom or never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes
unpunished; so here was a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Instance of the Divine Justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Harold</hi> for his breach of Oath and
Covenant to the Duke; for in the
Battle of <hi>Hastings</hi> he met with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, losing both his Crown and his
Life at once, and leaving <hi>William</hi> to
finish the day with Victory, over those
that were yet resolved to dispute the
Cause with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:54688:11"/>
And now being rid of his stubborn
Enemy, and in the heat of the Chase
got to <hi>London,</hi> he possessed himself of
that Kingdom which he pretended was
his own by Right before from the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
we have already mentioned. Yet
however it was in no such haughty
and insulting way, as many boast of,
and would gladly have their unwary
Readers to believe, upon their bare
Credit and Testimony; but he chose
the more grateful and complying Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of a Courtier, and setled himself
in it by a kind of mutual Agreement,
and express compact, as now I hope
will be clearly demonstrated by what I
shall offer to you after this his (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
absolute) Conquest. For,</p>
            <p>1. Tho' he was victorious over his
great Adversary <hi>Harold,</hi> yet if he had
been an absolute Conqueror, (as hath
been of late so vigorously asserted by
our Modern Writers) what urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
was there for him, or how did
it stand him in such mighty stead, still
to keep himself armed with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Titles, that so he might have the
more colourable pretence of Right and
Justice on his side, in laying a legal
Claim to this Imperial Crown? For,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:54688:11"/>
me-thinks, if he had a full possession
upon such a forcible entry, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
this had been a stronger Title
than any thing else he could have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged:
for how could, or durst, a
vanquished, enslaved Nation, dispute
with him, when he rode triumphing
on their Backs, and had lashed them
into an entire submission of vassalage?
But,</p>
            <p>2. Let us see the manner of this
first King <hi>William</hi>'s Coronation; and
whether or no he did not take an Oath
at the same time, which was, in sence
and substance (if not just in the
words themselves) the very same with
that which the Ancient Saxon Kings
used likewise to take upon their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronations.

will not suffer themselves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run

            <p>Now, that these were only his
<hi>Norwegian</hi> Laws, sure none can, or
ought to believe, after they have
throughly examined these plain
Truths, which I shall here offer to
their fair perusal.</p>
            <p>1. If they please to consider what

            <p>Why, truly, the Title was plainly
this; <hi>These are the Laws

<hi>the King in all things; together
with those Laws which we have added for
the profit of the English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here was no abolishing of
the Old Saxon Laws that he found,
when he came to govern this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor any setting up of new ones
in their stead: No, so far was he from
any such Designs of introducing new

            <p>The King hereupon, to keep the
People in a greater observance of
their Duty,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Monast. de Litchfield. Co. 8. <hi>Rep. in Pref.</hi>
               </note> and withal, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Oath he had taken at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
caused <hi>twelve of the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and wise Men, in every Shire

before himself, to deal sincerely and
uprightly, without turning either, <hi>ad

and to declare and lay open
the Constitutions of their Laws and

or in any sort varying from the Truth.

were for introducing the

Compatriotae qui Leges edixerant,

him that they might still retain <hi>Leges

and themselves were born and

that the Title of <hi>Conqueror,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of <hi>Victor,</hi> was assumed by

originally signifying, as it does in

            <p>And now we are come to the great
<hi>Epocha</hi> of Time, when the Stile of our
Kings altered. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in
the beginning of his Reign, in several
Records, writ himself, <hi>Edwardus Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Edwardi Filii Edwardi,</hi> that is,
<hi>Edward,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the First.
But this distinction not being well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of, and having considered,
that before the Conquest there had
been two King <hi>Edwards,</hi> he in all
Fines, and in general Records, writ
himself, <hi>Edwardus Rex Angliae,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>tertius post Conquestum,</hi> which was done
in the second Year of his Reign, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no

Hen.</hi> 6. and so to succeeding Kings
downwards.</p>
            <p>And, Sir, to give you a further
proof, that King <hi>William</hi> did not Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
and <hi>Abolish</hi> all the <hi>English Laws,</hi>
nor change, as is so much affirmed,
the whole Frame and Constitution
of the Government, be pleased to

but also the ancient and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

And these two, and divers other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawyers then lived in the Abby
of <hi>Abingdon, Quorum collationi nemo
sapiens</hi> (says the Author) <hi>refragabatur,
quibus rem Ecclesia publicam tuentibus
ejus oblocutores elingues fiebant.</hi> You
must know, that in those days, every
Monk here in <hi>England,</hi> that would,
might remain so secular, that he
might get Mony for himself, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
or receive by descent to his
own use. And therefore it was fit
enough for practising Lawyers to live
in Monasteries. But what had those
<hi>praeteritorum memoria eventorum</hi> (that
is, Reports, and adjudged Cases of
the Saxon Times) availed in their
skill, if the former Laws had not
continued? More obvious Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to this purpose, are had out of
<note n="n" place="margin">Videsis Cok. Praefax. ad Relat. 3. &amp; 8. &amp; si placet Not. ad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesc. <hi>p.</hi> 7, &amp; 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury, Ingulphus,</hi>
and others, and we here omit them.
But also, indeed, it was not to be
reputed a <hi>Conquest,</hi> or an Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by right of War, (which might
have destroyed the former Laws) so
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:54688:26"/>
much as a violent recovering of the
Kingdom out of the hands of Rebels,
which withstood the Duke's pretence
of a lawful Title, claimed by the
<hi>Confessor</hi>'s adoption, or designation
of him for his Successor; his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Blood on the Mother's side,
not a little also aiding such a pretence
to a Crown. For the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Emme,</hi> was Sister to <hi>Richard</hi> the
Second, Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to
whom, <hi>William</hi> was Grand-child and
Heir. But these were only specious
Titles, and perhaps examined curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
neither of them were at that
time enough. And howsoever his
Conscience so moved him at his death,
that he profest he had got<note n="*" place="margin">Historia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohensis.</note> 
                  <hi>England</hi>

also by express Declaration in some
of his Patents, he before pretended
his Right from the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Gift.

driven to put all upon the Fortune of

of the sufficiency and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Gift made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
got the Crown, as if he had
been a lawful Successor to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,</hi>
and not an <hi>Universal Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi>
All this is plain out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and justified infallibly by that of
the Titles of many common Persons
made to their Possessions in <hi>England,</hi>
after his Kingdom setled, upon the
possession of themselves or their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
in time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings,
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:54688:27"/>
especially of the <hi>Confessor.</hi> But this
was always in case, where they by
whose possession the Title was made,
had not incurr'd Forfeiture by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
Many such Titles are clearly
allowed in the Book of <hi>Dooms-day,</hi>
written in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time:
One especially is noted by the most
learned <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Norfolk.</hi> That,
as I remember, is touched in <hi>Dooms-day</hi>
also, but enough others are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
there which agree with it. How
could such Titles have held, if he had
made an <hi>absolute Conquest</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
wherein an <hi>Universal Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of all had been to the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
and no Title could have been
derived, but only from or under him?
More might be brought to clear this,
but we add here only the judicious
Assertion of a great<note n="s" place="margin">

of his nearness of Blood, which could
not but aid his other pretended Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
let it not seem meerly vain, in
regard of his being a Bastard. There
was good pretence for the help of
that defect also. For, although the
Laws of this Kingdom, and, I think
of all other Civil States at this day,
exclude Bastards (without a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Legitimation) from Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
yet by the old Laws used by
his Ancestors and Country-men, that
is, by those of <hi>Norway,</hi> a Prince's

or free, was equally inheritable as
any other born in Wedlock; which
was, I believe no small Reason, why
he stood at first so much for the Laws

be so, as the Laws of <hi>Norway</hi> allow.
And when he had inherited his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he made, doubtless, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
but that his Blood was as good
in regard of all other Inheritances,
that might by any colour be derived
through it. And therefore <hi>William</hi>

so excluded or neglected, that their

says, That <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror
was called a Bastard, because he was

                  <hi>France,</hi> would
have made him wholy legitimate);
I doubt he had but little or no ground
to justify it. Had he been so legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
it is not likely he should have
been stiled so commonly and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<hi>Bastardus;</hi> which Name, even
in his<note n="d" place="margin">Apud <hi>Cambden</hi> in Richmondia.</note> own Charters he sometimes
used with <hi>cognomenta;</hi> as also the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards
of the old <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>
were wont to do; although of

of dishonour; and the <hi>actio injuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
or an Action upon the Case lies
where-ever it be falsly objected, as
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:54688:29"/>
some will<note n="e" place="margin">Videsis Pont. Heute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum de liberis Natural. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> have it. But these
things prove enough, that this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
seized the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
not as <hi>conquered,</hi> but by pretence of
Gift or Adoption, aided and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by nearness of Blood; and so the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws formerly in force could
not but continue: And such of them as
are now abrogated, were not at all
abrogated by his <hi>Conquest,</hi> but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Parliaments or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Time, and of his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
or else by non-usage or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Custom.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Surely then none can believe, that
<hi>William</hi> claimed <hi>only</hi> by the Sword,
and made an <hi>absolute Conquest;</hi> or
that he <hi>abolish'd</hi> all the old Saxon
<hi>Laws,</hi> and constituted a new Frame
and Systeme of Government, entirely
for the Interest of his <hi>Normans,</hi> and
to the slavery and ruin of the whole
<hi>English;</hi> nor can any one, me-thinks,
after this, categorically attest that there
were no <hi>English Men</hi> in the Common
Council of the whole Kingdom; or
that the <hi>English</hi> had neither Estates nor
Fortunes left; and that therefore it
were of no great matter and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to them, by what Law, Right,
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:54688:29"/>
or Property, other Men held their
Estates.</p>
            <p>But not to dwell upon the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Learned Man, we will

who with like Confidence, and not
unlike Injustice, (as <hi>Rollo</hi> did <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
the seventh in Descent, from
whom was this Duke) invaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
pretending a Donation of the

King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as he alledged, by his last Will

what we allow to the Courage, we
must take from the Wisdom of the
<hi>English;</hi> that being subdued, they
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:54688:30"/>
continued <hi>nescia vinci,</hi> vexing the
Conqueror, after they had submitted
to him, by such continual Revolts,
as suffered him not to sheath his
Sword all his Reign; or if he did,
urged him to continue still so suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of their Loyalty, that he was
forced always to keep his hand upon
the Hilt, ready to draw it forth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not leasure to intend what was
before established, much less to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
what he before intended: So
that they put upon him a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of being a Tyrant, to make
good his being a King: Yet such was
the moderation of his mind, that he
chose rather to bind them stricter to
him by the old Laws, than to gall
them with any New, guarding his
Prerogative within that Citadel of
the <hi>Burrough Law</hi> (as they called it)
from whence, as often as they began
to mutiny, he battered them with
their own Ordnance, and so made
them Parties to their own wrong;
and however some that designed to
preoccupate the Grace of Servitude,
gave him the ungrateful Title of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi>
which he esteemed the greatest
misfortune his good Fortune had
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:54688:30"/>
brought upon him) thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
his <hi>Power</hi> to be as <hi>boundless</hi> as
his <hi>Will;</hi> which they took to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Limitation or Contradiction;
yet we find he suffered himself to be
<hi>so far conquered</hi> by them, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of giving to, he took the Law
from them, and contentedly bound
himself up by those, which they called
<hi>St. Edward's Laws;</hi> which being an
abbreviation of the great Tripple
Code of <hi>Danique, Merke,</hi> and <hi>West-Sexe
Laws,</hi> was such a form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination,
as he himself could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to introduce a better; and if
any thing <hi>look'd</hi> like <hi>Absolute,</hi> 'twas
his disarming them, when he found
them thus <hi>Law-bound</hi> hand and
foot.</p>
            </q>
            <p>From this Authority, Sir, I think,
it is very plain and obvious, That
<list>
                  <item>I. Here was no <hi>Absolute Conquest.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. That neither were all the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Laws <hi>cancelled</hi> and <hi>abolished,</hi> by
the <hi>coming in</hi> of this <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="l" facs="tcp:54688:31"/>
I. That here was no <hi>Absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;</hi>
because,</p>
            <p>1. Tho' here was an <hi>invading Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
yet it was <hi>upon pretence of
a Donation of the Soveraignty from
Edward the Confessor,</hi> confirmed
by his last Will, and that <hi>in the
presence of most of the English No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
And so it was only an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get his own upon the
Claim of an alledged <hi>just Title;</hi>
which shewed he had, at least,
more reason to demand, than <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi>
who, at best, was an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to detain the Crown: And
so the Quarrel to be more Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
than National.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Conquest</hi> could <hi>not be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi>
for tho' he was, by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
success over <hi>Harold,</hi> possessor
of the <hi>English</hi> Throne; yet saith
my Author, The Nation <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
nescia vinci;</hi> so that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was <hi>Tyrannical</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,</hi>
they were continually
vexing him with their Revolts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="li" facs="tcp:54688:31"/>
3. This <hi>Conquest</hi> could not be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi>
because then the <hi>English</hi>
must have been <hi>perfect Slaves</hi> and
Vassals to his <hi>uncontroulable Beck;</hi>
but (alas!) here Sir <hi>Winston</hi>
tells you, the <hi>Norman Conqueror</hi>
could find them no such easy
Beasts of Burthen, their Necks
would not bear the Yokes of his
Severity; for they were several
times up in Arms against him,
and that <hi>after they had submitted
to him:</hi> so that at most this could
be but a submission upon terms.</p>
            <p>4. He was so far from being in love
with the gawdy name of <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
that when some, that <hi>design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to preoccupate the Grace of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
gave him that ungrateful
Title, he esteemed it the greatest
misfortune his good Fortune had
brought upon him.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Conquest</hi> surely could not
be <hi>absolute,</hi> for then it would
have been very idle and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for any one to say, what
Sir <hi>Winston,</hi> no doubt, but upon
good and mature consideration,
hath thought fit to say of him,
that <hi>if any thing look'd like abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;</hi>
               <pb n="lii" facs="tcp:54688:32"/>
and hereby you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take notice, that he seems to
wonder how any Man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make him an <hi>absolute
Conqueror,</hi> when he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find so much as <hi>any thing to
look like it.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>II. I shall observe to you, that neither
were all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws <hi>cancelled</hi>
and <hi>abolished</hi> by the <hi>coming in</hi> of
this <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If King <hi>William</hi> might have done
<hi>despotically</hi> whatsoever he had a
mind to, then what necessity was
there for <hi>such a moderation of his Mind,</hi>
as the Author hints to
us?</p>
            <p>2. Because he found the People
were not to be <hi>galled with any New,
he chose rather</hi> (but it was a choice
upon Necessity) <hi>to bind them
stricter to him by the Old Laws;</hi>
that is, in plain down-right
English, they would not yield to
him, nor to his Government, unless
he resolved to circumscribe his
ruling of them, within the bounds
of the good <hi>Old Laws,</hi> in which
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:54688:32"/>
they were born and bred; and
make his <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi>
come over and buckle to them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>He suffered himself to be so far
conquered by them,</hi> as to let them
have their <hi>Old Laws;</hi> and it
was with a kind of good satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too: For,</p>
            <p>4. The Book tells you, <hi>He conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
bound himself up by those
which they called St. Edward</hi>'s
<hi>Laws:</hi> And was there not, do
ye think, very good Reason for
his so doing? when thereby,</p>
            <p>5. He understood at length, that it
was a <hi>guarding his Prerogative,</hi> to
keep <hi>within that Cittadel of the
Burrough Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And lastly, We cannot rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
think he would, after he had
thereby throughly looked into
them, <hi>cancel</hi> and <hi>abolish</hi> them;
since those <hi>Laws</hi> were such, as,
it is said, <hi>he himself could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to introduce a better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope, Sir, all these Deductions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
naturally from the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without any force or strain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sence; and what I have said,
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:54688:33"/>
may be sufficient to convince you, that
King <hi>William</hi> still kept to the <hi>Saxon
Laws,</hi> and did not change the whole
<hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>
as, you say, is very stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously,
and with heat, asserted by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of our Modern Authors.</p>
            <p>I shall yet make bold with your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Sir, and shew you what <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius

Point, and so conclude my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="lv" facs="tcp:54688:33"/>
1. That this King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Father,
<hi>William</hi> the First, was so far from
<hi>cancelling</hi> and <hi>abolishing</hi> K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
<hi>Laws,</hi> that he made them
to be the Common <hi>standing Laws</hi>
of the Land, to be equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
observed as well by the
<hi>Normans</hi> as the <hi>English,</hi> for he
says, <hi>omnibus cam in commune red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit;</hi>
unless you will understand
the word <hi>Omnibus</hi> to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Universal, and so only to
include the <hi>Normans:</hi> And if
so, then it follows likewise, That
instead of the <hi>Normans</hi> giving
to the <hi>English</hi> their <hi>Laws,</hi> the
<hi>English Laws</hi> were imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And whereas there were, 'tis
confest, some <hi>Additional Laws</hi>
made in his Time, yet you may
plainly observe hence, that they
were grounded upon, and but a
better Improvement and Melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s <hi>Laws;</hi>
and they were for the Sake, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,</hi>
and Advantage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
as you will find hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:54688:34"/>
3. <hi>Henry</hi> the First, Son to this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
William,</hi>
took away <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
malas consuetudines &amp; injustas
exactiones,</hi> &amp;c. by which <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had been sorely oppressed,
under his Brother <hi>William Rufus,</hi>
and restored the <hi>English</hi> to their
<hi>former Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi>
and he renewed and confirmed
the Ancient <hi>Saxon Laws,</hi> as his
Father had done before him, as
it is well noted in the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the History of <hi>Bede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bede <hi>Histor.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 30. <hi>fol.</hi> 347.</note>

virorum Regni Angliae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But if there had been <hi>no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
but the <hi>Normans;</hi> if the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had all the Estates of the
<hi>English</hi> given them; if there
were none but <hi>Normans</hi> in the
<hi>Common Councils</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
how is it possible to be
supposed, by any that will allow
themselves the free use of their
Reason, that <hi>Henry</hi> the First
would ever make such a Grant;
or, if he did, that the <hi>Normans</hi>
would ever submit to it; or
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:54688:34"/>
(what is much more unlikely)
give their consent to <hi>out</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all their new-gotten

and <hi>Slaves</hi> under the <hi>English,</hi> or
else <hi>vertere solum,</hi> return to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
from whence they came.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which I
cannot but mention, and that is, The
inconsiderateness of those Men, who
so mightily cry up the <hi>absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First</hi> over the
<hi>English,</hi> as if they were utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                  <note place="margin">The Anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author against Mr. <hi>Petyr.</hi> p. 43.</note> That the
<hi>English</hi> had neither <hi>Estates</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough it be confessed, that this
first <hi>William</hi> obtained the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Crown</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> yet I think
I have clearly made it out to you, Sir,
that it was by <hi>a Reception upon Terms,</hi>
and not by <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Conquest;</hi> and
it is no less obvious, that the <hi>Laws</hi> in
general, which were, after such his
<hi>Acquisition,</hi> ratified and confirmed,
and which continued in full force and
power, were the old <hi>Saxon Laws;</hi>
and though it cannot be denied, but
that he did introduce some <hi>new Laws</hi>
of his own, yet those, <hi>quas constitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
you have heard, were made, <hi>ad
utilitatem Anglorum,</hi> for the Benefit
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:54688:35"/>
and Advantage of the <hi>English,</hi> without
the least mention either of the <hi>French</hi>
or <hi>Normans.</hi> And observable too it is,
that those Laws were made <hi>per Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
Concilium totius Regni. Apud
Lambard. inter Leges Guliel. primi,
fol. 170. de Statut.</hi> 55.</p>
            <p>1. And if so, Sir, me-thinks this
seems as one strong Argument, that
the <hi>English</hi> could not have all their
<hi>Estates</hi> &amp; <hi>Fortunes</hi> violently ravished
from them; nor the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
at their <hi>coming in,</hi> could not
<hi>absolutely</hi> sweep away all the Stakes,
because the good <hi>Old Law</hi> was still

as I have made that plain it had, but
that their <hi>Native Rights</hi> were easily

of the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But in the next place, Sir, I
make no question but that I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you, that the <hi>English,</hi> at least
those who lived in Peace <hi>before,</hi> and
at his <hi>coming</hi> to the possession of the
<hi>English</hi> Throne, did quietly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
enjoy their Inheritances; and their
Titles and Claims to them from their
<hi>Saxon Ancestors,</hi> were held good and
allowed; which, to be sure, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could have done, had this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
received such an <hi>universal Change</hi>
and <hi>Revolution,</hi> as so many of our
late Learned Authors would needs have
us firmly to believe.</p>

<q>Though he hath had the Name of

such only, whose demerit made them

<hi>English Man,</hi> demands, before the
King, his <hi>right,</hi> in open Court, tells
him it did, <hi>de jure,</hi> belong to him,
upon this Reason of Law, for that he
never had took up Arms against the
King, either before his coming in, or

               <p>
                  <hi>Edwin</hi> of <hi>Sharborn,</hi> and several
others that were ejected out of their
Estates and Possessions, went to the
<hi>Conqueror,</hi> and told him, that they
never either before, or in, or after
the <hi>Conquest,</hi> were against him the
said King, either by their Advice, or
any other Aid, but kept themselves
peaceably and quietly. And this
they were ready to make out, which
way soever the King pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
Whereupon the said King
ordered an Inquisition to be made
throughout all <hi>England,</hi> whether it
were so or no; which was plainly
proved: Therefore he presently
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:54688:38"/>
commanded, that all those who so kept
themselves peaceably in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
as these had done, should be
repossessed of all their Estates and
Inheritances as fully, amply, and
quietly, as ever they had or held them
before his <hi>Conquest.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>This is a Case so full to the Point,
and so plain to every common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in its self, that it would be
frivolous to make any deductions
from it. I shall presume to repeat to
you the words of a great and Learned
Judg in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, and give you his judicious
Assertion of this Argument, (tho' it
be cited before in that of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>)
because it was agreed on as a main po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Rule of Law; and they are
these;</p>

               <q>The

            </p>
            <p>What shall we think after all this?
That notwithstanding, the <hi>English</hi> who
had not been in Arms against <hi>William,</hi>
had <hi>no Estates</hi> or <hi>Fortunes</hi> left, but <hi>all</hi>
was divided between the <hi>King</hi> and his

to be this high and mighty <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi>

            <p>But again, let me give you, Sir, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

From this <hi>great Record,</hi> Sir, I
think it is clear and evident;</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Leofric</hi> was Earl of <hi>Chester</hi>
in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the
<hi>Confessor,</hi> and that he dying
without Issue, the Earldom of
<hi>Chester,</hi> and the Right of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowson
of the Priory of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
tempore Willielmi Conquestoris
Angliae,</hi> descended to <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl
of <hi>Chester, ut Consanguineo &amp; Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redi
ipsius Leofrict,</hi> as being the
Son of <hi>Erminelde,</hi> Sister of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric;</hi>
and that from that <hi>Hugh,</hi>
descended <hi>Richard</hi> his Son and
Heir; and from <hi>Richard</hi> descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Ranulf,</hi> as <hi>consanguineus &amp;
haeres,</hi> that is the Son of <hi>Maud,</hi>
Sister of <hi>Hugh;</hi> and from that
<hi>Ranulph</hi> another <hi>Ranulph</hi> his Son
and Heir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Now if <hi>William,</hi> when he came
in, made an <hi>absolute Conquest,</hi>
this Title had been impossible to
have been maintained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:54688:41"/>
3. It appears further, That the Plea
of the Prior was allowed; for the
Record saith, <hi>Praedictus Prior
sine die.</hi> And the Advowson
aforesaid, <hi>simul cum Comitatu
Cestriae &amp; Huntingdon, &amp; aliis
diversis Maneriis, Terris &amp; Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis,
cum pertinentiis, &amp;c.</hi> did
descend. And it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Judgment being given
upon solemn Debate and Tryal,
neither the Judges, nor the King's
Counsel, so many hundred Years
ago, as in the Age of <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second, knew any thing of
this new received Notion of an
<hi>absolute Conquest.</hi> And again,</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis yet further observable, that
the Charter of <hi>Leofric,</hi> and the
Title of the Prior had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>per diversos alios Reges,</hi>
who must certainly have greater
knowledg of the Nature of
<hi>William</hi> the First his <hi>Conquest</hi>
or <hi>Government,</hi> than any Man
can pretend to in our Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:54688:41"/>
But further, Sir, <hi>I</hi> will make bold
with your Patience, and give you some
few Instances, of the very many that
I could, out of <hi>Dooms-day</hi> Book,
to satisfy you, that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>Now 'tis evident from this Charter;</p>

            <q>
               <p>Of all the <hi>celebrated Cities</hi> in
the World, this of <hi>London</hi> is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi>
of <hi>England;</hi> a <hi>City</hi> of a
very extensive Fame in its self, but
much more honourable by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Treasure and Commodities
which she exporteth. Happy is she
in the temperature of her Climate,
in the soundness of her Doctrine,
strength of her Forts, agreeableness
of her Situation; in the Credit and
Reputation of her Citizens; the
unblemish'd Chastity of the Female
Sex; innocently pleasant, even in
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:54688:46"/>
her Recreations, and honoured with
a numerous Train of Nobility.</p>
               <p>The Grandeur of this City chiefly
consists in the Properness and Valour
of her Men; in the bravery of her
Armour, the multitude of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants:
so that in the fatal Wars
in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Reign, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
on a Muster, 20000 Horse,
and 60000 Foot, all armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are
known and esteemed beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Persons, wheresoever they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
for their gentile Deportment,
their good Apparel, their Table, and
Discourse.</p>
            </q>
            <p>So that we see from hence, that in
the Reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was
<hi>Nephew</hi> to King <hi>William the First,</hi>
(from whose Death, to King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s
Reign, there were not fifty Years)
the <hi>City of London</hi> was very great
and powerful; but had the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Citizens</hi> been <hi>all</hi> destroyed, and
had all their <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi>
been (as is so positively affirmed)
<hi>taken away</hi> from them by <hi>William
the First,</hi> it had been impossible, in
so short a Time, for them to have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:54688:47"/>
again to that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Fame</hi> and
<hi>Renown</hi> through all this part of the
World, as the <hi>Historian,</hi> who was an
<hi>Eye-Witness</hi> of it, so credibly assures
us.</p>
            <p>My next design is to shew you, That
from the <hi>General Direction</hi> of the
<hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Charters</hi> in King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
the First</hi> his Time, it is plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable,
that <hi>William,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

            <p>By these <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Charters,</hi> Sir,
(though many more of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might easily be given) I think,
with submission, my <hi>Argument</hi> is
firmly maintained; and the <hi>plain
English</hi> of them all is, no more than
this, That in <hi>William the first</hi>'s Time
there were <hi>English Barons</hi> as well as
<hi>French Barons,</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> and
<hi>Wiltshire;</hi> in <hi>York-shire</hi> and <hi>Carlisle;</hi>
in <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> and in <hi>Sussex:</hi> and
the <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
is equally given to them both,
without any <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
mentioned, otherwise, than
that the <hi>French</hi> Barons had the <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
of the <hi>English</hi> in those <hi>Writs</hi>
and <hi>Charters:</hi>

Sir, I think by these two Branches,
you may plainly see, King <hi>William</hi>
when he came in, was so far from <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
taking</hi> away the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions</hi>
of the <hi>English,</hi> and sharing
them among his <hi>Normans;</hi> that he

the good and <hi>ancient Laws</hi> of
<hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> which were
their best security of all they enjoyed
before his entrance; and not only so,
but by freeing them from all <hi>unjust
Taxes</hi> and <hi>Exactions,</hi> excepting only
their <hi>free Service,</hi> which <hi>of right</hi> was
owing to him, and which they were
to do, as it was agreed on by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and granted by him to them by
<hi>hereditary Right</hi> for ever, and that <hi>by
the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the whole
Kingdom;</hi> and this was done too
<hi>wholly</hi> for the <hi>sake</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of the
<hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall trouble you, Sir, with one

the Confessor,</hi> as I have already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
you, and being crowned
King, the whole <hi>English Nation</hi> in
three months time quietly submitted to
him; which the <hi>Historian</hi> observes to
be by <hi>Divine Providence:</hi> And they
much relyed upon the <hi>force</hi> of that
<hi>Solemn Dath</hi> he took; and great
cause they had for their doing so;
for,</p>
            <p>Remarkable is it, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Reign, he made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to keep it; and this the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
plainly proves: for so <hi>far</hi> was he
from <hi>pretending</hi> to be a <hi>Conqueror,</hi>
or from exercising <hi>absolute Power</hi>
and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over the <hi>English,</hi>
that you see he denied to none right
Judgment who required it of him; he
<hi>condemned none</hi> but those who deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it by the <hi>condemnation</hi> of the
<hi>Law;</hi> he strictly commanded his great
Men, to whom he had <hi>given</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi>
of those who had been <hi>bold</hi> in
<hi>Arms against</hi> him, under King <hi>Harold,</hi>
               <pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:54688:54"/>
that they should behave themselves
with <hi>all</hi> due <hi>moderation</hi> and <hi>temper;</hi>
and he <hi>invited</hi> them to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi>
by his <hi>Example:</hi> He charged them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to have God before their Eyes,
by whose Arms they had so far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
That they should, nay ought,
not too much to oppress those they
had got the better of, who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
with them, lest those whom they
had justly subdued, should by such
their Oppressions be forced to rebel
again; he strictly forbad them all Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
that they should restrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from all Cruelties and Rapines;
<hi>That as the People should be kept in
Peace by his Arms; so their Arms should
submit to, and be governed by the
Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did he only give this admirable
Advice,<note place="margin">Apud Lambar. LL. Wil. prim. <hi>fol.</hi> 170. <hi>c.</hi> 55.</note> but he prudently governed
himself, and set easy Boundaries to
those Services, Taxes, &amp; Aids, <hi>quod de jure
facere debent,</hi> which were due to him
by the Law; he absolutely denied all
Pardons and Grace to Robbers, and
all disturbers of the Publick Peace,
and wicked Persons: He commanded
all the Roads to be free and open for
<pb n="xciii" facs="tcp:54688:54"/>
Travellers, and that no Injuries should
be done them; so that the <hi>beginning</hi>
of his <hi>Reign</hi> was, as it were, <hi>a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Age;</hi> and his Clemency, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acts of Goodness, still shone
brighter to the happiness of his Subjects,
which was confirmed towards the
Loyal and Dutiful, by his steady and
commendable perseverance.</p>
            <p>Where, in all this, is there any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to <hi>absolute Conquest</hi> and despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<hi>Dominion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to conclude; I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

as ancient as any thing can be remembred

by 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The conservancy
of the Government being not safely to be
lodged any where, but with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self. Offences of this Kind not
pardonable by the King, because it is not
in his Power to change it. This is Our
Government, and thus it is established,
and for Ages, and immemorial Time hath
thus continued; a long succession of Kings
have recognized it to be such.</p>

This too perhaps will be granted,
Sir, in some sence, that for a long Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

hath been so; but the main
<hi>pinch</hi> and <hi>stress</hi> of your <hi>Question,</hi> as
I apprehend it, is this, Whether after
<hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> had setled
himself as well as he could on the
<hi>English Throne,</hi> he did admit any of
the <hi>English</hi> to sit in the <hi>Great Council</hi>
of the Nation, and to Advise and
Consult, <hi>de arduis &amp; Vrgentibus nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis
Regni?</hi> And I hope this I shall
make plain and evident to you, That
the <hi>Grand Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was
in substance the same that it was <hi>before</hi>
the <hi>coming in</hi> of this <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and
that there were <hi>English Men</hi> Members
of it in the Time of the <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not to be denied, but that the
<hi>same Courts,</hi> that were in the <hi>Saxon
Time</hi> for administration of Justice,
continued after <hi>William the first</hi> was
made King, and the Footsteps of them
remain yet to this day: I shall mention
a few, and so come to the main Point

            <p>1. The first shall be taken out of the
<hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lambard. <hi>fol.</hi> 158.</note> which tells
us, That <hi>this William,</hi> in the
fourth Year of his Reign at
<hi>London, Consilio Baronum suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
by the Advice of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
caused a General Meeting,
or Assembly, to be summoned,
<hi>Per universos Angliae Comitatus,
omnes Nobiles, Sapientes, &amp; sud
Lege eruditos, ut eorum Leges &amp;
consuetudines audiret; i.e.</hi> 
               <q>of all
the Nobility, wise Men, and
such as were skilled in the Laws,
through all the Counties of
<hi>England,</hi> to hear what their
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:54688:59"/>
Laws and Customs were.</q> And
after this was done, at the <hi>request</hi>
of the <hi>English Community,</hi> he
did <hi>consent</hi> that they should be
<hi>confirmed;</hi> and so they were <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi>
and <hi>kept</hi> throughout all his
Kingdom. The words are, <hi>Ad

            </p>
            <p>From this Testimony, I think it will

            <p>1. That the <hi>Barones sui</hi> here of

the <hi>English,</hi> and only sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
his <hi>Norman</hi> Barons, upon
those <hi>Authorities</hi> and Reasons, I

That there were equally <hi>Barones
Francigeni &amp; Angli nostri,</hi> in his
Time, (as you may see in my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

            <p>
               <pb n="civ" facs="tcp:54688:60"/>
2. That the King having, by the
Counsel of these his Barons, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
all the Nobility, wise
Men, and those that were <hi>skilled</hi>
in the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi>
throughout <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Counties</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>3. And to prove that this <hi>general

2. Besides the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>St. Edward</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
it may reasonably be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
That the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>bringing
the Bishops and Abbots under the
Tenure of Barony,</hi> was <hi>first</hi> made
in this <hi>Parliament.</hi> And that</p>
            <p>3. Likewise, the <hi>great Case</hi> between
the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and
this same Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
was here <hi>judicially</hi> determined.
And,</p>
            <p>4. If there were no <hi>English Men</hi>
in this <hi>great Council,</hi> how then
came it to pass that the Bishop of
<hi>York</hi> and <hi>London</hi> were <hi>there,</hi>
who certainly were <hi>Bishops</hi> in
the <hi>Saxon Times?</hi> And it may
also seem not improbable, that
there was <hi>then</hi> an <hi>universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
among them, that these two
Bishops should be intrusted to
write down for them the <hi>English
Laws.</hi>

more, to close withal, which is,
<pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:54688:62"/>
That at <hi>this Parliament,</hi> when

            <p>IV. I think, by the <hi>general direction</hi>
of the <hi>Writs</hi> of this King, as also
by that of his <hi>Charters,</hi> (some
of which I have given you in
my <hi>Argument</hi> to your <hi>third</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and therefore shall refer
you back to them) it is plainly
demonstrable, that <hi>William</hi> had
<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:54688:64"/>
as well <hi>English Barons</hi> as <hi>French</hi>
Barons; and that <hi>his</hi> Barons
were always a <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>great
Council,</hi> will hardly, I suppose,
be denied by any. And that <hi>one
Law</hi> of his, which may be called
the <hi>First</hi> MAGNA CHARTA
in the <hi>Norman</hi> Times, by which
the King reserved to himself
<hi>from the Free Men of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
nothing but their free Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
due to him according to
Law; in the conclusion saith,
That <hi>they,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L L. Guilielm. c. 55.</note> to wit, the <hi>English,</hi>
shall <hi>hold</hi> and enjoy their <hi>Estates</hi>
well, and in peace, free from all
unjust Exactions and Tallage;
and this <hi>ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by
the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the
<hi>whole Kingdom,</hi> which cannot be
restrained to the <hi>Norman Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
only. So that herein is asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>English</hi>
Free-men, and of the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

            <p>These, I think, are uncontroverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proofs and Evidences.

they will certainly rest satisfied in
these great and powerful Authorities,

I think these have sufficiently made

and that it was a <hi>great mistake</hi>
in any to affirm, That the <hi>King</hi>
and his <hi>Normans</hi> divided and
<hi>shared</hi> them all among them. As
likewise,</item>
                  <item>4. In the fourth place, It has been

            <p>Now, Sir, as a corroborating Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
to explain and enforce what
I already have said, I shall conclude
my Discourse at present with a very
<hi>memorable</hi> and <hi>studied Speech</hi> of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of great Learning and Abilities in
his Time, collected out of a large
<hi>Original Manuscript</hi> (which I have
seen) of Sir <hi>Roger Owen,</hi> a very
<hi>great Antiquary,</hi> that lived in the Time
of <hi>King Iames;</hi> and one, who, as
appears by that Book; was a Man not
<pb n="cxiv" facs="tcp:54688:66"/>
only of wonderful Knowledg, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Observation in the Records
and Histories of his own Nation, but
also in those of Foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>This was a Speech of the <hi>then</hi> Lord
<hi>Whitlock,</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1650. upon the
<hi>House</hi>'s long and smart Debate touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Act for putting all the Books of</hi>
Law, <hi>and the Process and Proceedings
in Courts of Iustice into the English
Tongue:</hi> In which <hi>Debate</hi> some spake
in <hi>derogation</hi> and <hi>dishonour</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi>
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For some vindication whereof, and
for satisfying some Mistakes, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his Opinion in the House to this
effect.</p>
            <p>It is now <hi>newly printed,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s

AFFAIRS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is here truly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Speaker;</p>
               <p>THe Question upon which your
present Debate ariseth, is of no
small moment, nor is it easily or spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to be determined; for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
no less than a <hi>total Alteration</hi>
of the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of our <hi>Law,</hi> which have been
established and continued for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years.</p>
               <p>I should not have troubled you
with any of my weak Discourse, but
that I apprehend some Mistakes and
<hi>dishonour</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if
passed by without any Answer, may
be of ill consequence; and having
attended to hear them answered by
others, who are not pleased to do
it;</p>
               <p>I held my self the more engaged,
in the <hi>duty</hi> of my <hi>Profession,</hi> to offer
to your Judgment (to which I shall
always submit) what I have met
with, and do suppose not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
for the rectifying of some
Mistakes which are amongst us.</p>

A worthy Gentleman was pleased
to affirm, with much confidence, (as
he brought it in upon this Debate)
That the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced</hi>
by <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi>
as (among other Arguments, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted)
might appear by their being
<hi>written</hi> in the <hi>French Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his first Assertion, that our
<hi>Laws</hi> were <hi>introduced</hi> by <hi>William</hi>
the <hi>Conqueror</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> I shall
acknowledg, that he hath several
both <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>Domestick</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
whom he may follow therein;
The <hi>Forreign</hi> Authors are, <hi>Iovius,
AEmilius, Bodine, Hottoman, Dyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,
Volateran, Berault, Berkley,
Choppinus, Vspargensis, Malines,</hi> and
<hi>Polidore,</hi> who affirm this erroneous
piece of Doctrine; but the less to
be regarded from them, because they
were <hi>strangers</hi> to our <hi>Laws,</hi> and
took up upon <hi>trust</hi> what they <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>
in this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of our</hi> own Country-men, <hi>they
have</hi> Paris, Malmesbury, Matthew
Westminster, Fox, Cosins, Twyne,
Heyward, Milles, Fulbeck, Cowell,
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:54688:67"/>
Ridley, Brown, Speed, Martyn, <hi>and
some others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All of them affirm, That the <hi>Laws</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>introduced</hi> by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
the Conqueror:</hi> But their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
are refuted by Sir <hi>Roger Owen</hi> in
his <hi>Manuscript;</hi> who saith, That <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Wendover,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi>
were the <hi>first Monks</hi> that <hi>hatched</hi> these
<hi>addle Eggs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall endeavour to shew you,
That the <hi>Original</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> is
<hi>not</hi> from the <hi>French;</hi> that they were
<hi>not introduced</hi> by <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror</hi>
out of <hi>Normandy:</hi> And I
shall humbly offer to you my <hi>Answer</hi>
to some of their <hi>Arguments,</hi> who are
of a contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polydore,</hi> Hist. Angl. <hi>l.</hi> 9. affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That <hi>William the Conqueror</hi>
first appointed <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Iustices</hi>
of the <hi>Peace,</hi> erected <hi>Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

brought in <hi>Trials</hi> by <hi>twelve</hi> Men,
and several other <hi>Particulars</hi> of our
<hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> their name <hi>Scire
Reeve,</hi> shews them to be of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Institution. And our Histories
mention the <hi>division</hi> of <hi>Shires</hi> by
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:54688:68"/>
King <hi>Alphred;</hi> but in truth, it was
much more ancient.</p>
               <p>And it is apparent by our <hi>Books</hi>
and <hi>Records,</hi> some whereof are in
the <hi>Hustings</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> that the same things were
in use here long before the Time of
King <hi>Will. I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Roger Owen</hi> shews at large,
That <hi>Livery of Seisin,</hi> Licenses, or
Fines for Alienation, Daughters to
inherit, <hi>Trials by Iuries,</hi> Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Utlaries, Coroners, disposing
of Lands by Will, Escheats, Gaols,
Writs, Wrecks, Warranties, Catalla
Fellonum, and many other parts of
our <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Forms</hi> of our
<hi>Parliaments</hi> themselves, were here
in being <hi>before</hi> the Time of <hi>Duke
William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agreeing hereunto are many of
our <hi>Historians,</hi> and learned <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is objected, That in the
<hi>Grand Custumary</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
the <hi>Laws</hi> are almost <hi>all</hi> the same
with ours of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> of
their <hi>Parliaments</hi> the same with
ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:54688:68"/>
That the <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Preface</hi> to
that <hi>Book,</hi> saith, It contains only the
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> which were
made by the Princes of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
by the <hi>Councel</hi> of their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
Earls, Barons,</hi> and other <hi>Wise
Men;</hi> which shews the <hi>forms</hi> of
their <hi>Parliaments</hi> to be the <hi>same</hi>
with <hi>ours,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> in that
<hi>Book</hi> to be the <hi>proper Laws</hi> of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> and ours to be the same;
therefore they argue, that our <hi>Laws</hi>
were <hi>introduced</hi> from thence by
<hi>William the Conqueror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will be fully answered, if
that <hi>Grand Custumary</hi> of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
was composed in our King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.
his Time, (as good Authors hold it
was) then it cannot be, That our
<hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Parliaments</hi> could be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived</hi>
from <hi>thence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Learned Men say, That this
<hi>Custumary</hi> was a <hi>meer Translation</hi> of
our <hi>Law-Book, Glanvill;</hi> as the
Book of <hi>Regia Majestas</hi> of the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is; and the like
of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:54688:69"/>
They farther add, That the first
establishing of the <hi>Custumary</hi> of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> was in <hi>Hen. 1.</hi> his Time;
and afterwards again, about the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
of <hi>Edw. 2.</hi> his Time.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Laws</hi> in the <hi>Custumary</hi>
were <hi>introduced</hi> there from <hi>England,</hi>
it will then be granted, that the <hi>Laws</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>not introduced</hi> here
by <hi>William the Conqueror:</hi> But I
think it very clear, that their <hi>Laws</hi>
were brought to them out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and then you will all agree to
the conclusion.</p>
               <p>Our King <hi>Hen. 1.</hi> conquered <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
from his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> and
was a <hi>Learned</hi> King, as his Name
<hi>Beauclerke</hi> testifies; whom <hi>Ivo</hi> calls,
an <hi>especial Establisher of Iustice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querius</hi>
relates, That this King <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi>
the <hi>English Laws</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herewith do agree <hi>Gulielmus Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Armoricus, Rutclurius,</hi> and other
<hi>French</hi> Writers; who mention also,
That the <hi>Laws</hi> in the <hi>Custumary</hi> of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> are the <hi>same</hi> with the
<hi>Laws</hi> collected by our <hi>English King
Edward the Confessor,</hi> who was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:54688:69"/>
An additional Testimony hereof,
is out of <hi>William de Alenso Revile,</hi>
who, in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumary,</hi>
saith, That all the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>Normandy</hi> came from the <hi>English
Laws</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Custumary,</hi> there is a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Nampes,</hi> or <hi>Distresses,</hi> and
decreed, That one should not bring
his <hi>Action</hi> upon any <hi>Seisure;</hi> but
from the Time of the <hi>Coronation</hi> of
King <hi>Richard;</hi> and this must be our
King <hi>Richard the first,</hi> because no
King of <hi>France</hi> was in that Time of
that Name; and the words <hi>Nampes</hi>
and <hi>Withernams,</hi> were <hi>Saxon</hi>
words, taken out of the <hi>English
Laws,</hi> signifying a <hi>Pawn,</hi> or <hi>Distress,</hi>
and in the same sence are used in the
<hi>Custumary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which puts it further out of
scruple, is, That there are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> themselves of
the <hi>Saxon Laws,</hi> made in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Councils</hi> held by them
here; which are in the Language
and Character of those Times; and
contain in them many of those things
which are in the <hi>Norman Custumary.</hi>

It is no improbable Opinion, That
there was a <hi>former Establishment</hi> of
our <hi>Laws</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> before the
Time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. and that it was by
<hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> who (as all
<hi>Writers</hi> of our <hi>History</hi> agree) was a
great <hi>Collector</hi> and <hi>Compiler</hi> of our
<hi>English Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He <hi>lived</hi> a long time with his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Duke William</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
who was <hi>willing</hi> to please the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,</hi>
in hopes to be <hi>appointed</hi> by
him to be his <hi>Suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>essor;</hi> wherein
the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Expectation did <hi>not fail</hi>
him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Confessor</hi> having no <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
and finding <hi>Normandy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>setled Government,</hi> and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Laws,</hi> advised with his Kinsman,
<hi>Duke William,</hi> to receive from him
the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which he had
<hi>collected,</hi> and to <hi>establish</hi> them in
<hi>Normandy;</hi> which <hi>Duke William</hi>
and his <hi>Lords</hi> readily accepted, for
the <hi>good</hi> of their <hi>People;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>obliged</hi> the <hi>Confessor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another proof hereof is, That
<hi>such Laws</hi> as the <hi>Normans</hi> had <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the Time of <hi>Duke William,</hi>
                  <pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:54688:71"/>
were <hi>different</hi> from <hi>those</hi> in the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumary,</hi>
and from the <hi>English
Laws.</hi>
               </p>

The <hi>meaner</hi> People were <hi>as Slaves,</hi>
and the like: and the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Theft</hi>
by <hi>Ordeil,</hi> which then was <hi>not</hi> in

               <p>
                  <hi>Wigorniensis</hi> reports, That the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
who came in with Queen <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Etheired,</hi> were so
hated of the <hi>English,</hi> for their <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
and <hi>false Iudgment,</hi> that in the
Time of King <hi>Canutus,</hi> they were,
for this cause, <hi>banished;</hi> and it is the
<hi>less</hi> probable, that <hi>they</hi> being so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi>
themselves, should <hi>introduce</hi> so
<hi>just Laws</hi> as <hi>ours</hi> are.</p>
               <p>Between the <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
by <hi>Rolio,</hi> and the <hi>Invasion</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> by <hi>Duke William,</hi> there
were not above 160 Years; that of
<hi>Normandy</hi> was about <hi>Anno</hi> 912. that
of <hi>England <hi>Anno</hi>
                  </hi> 1060.</p>
               <p>It is not then <hi>consonant</hi> to <hi>Reason,</hi>
that those <hi>Normans, Pagans,</hi> a
rough <hi>Martial</hi> People, <hi>descended</hi>
                  <pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:54688:72"/>
from so many <hi>Barbarous Nations,</hi>
should, in the time of 150 Years,
establish such <hi>excellent Laws</hi> among
<hi>themselves,</hi> and so <hi>different</hi> from
the <hi>French Laws,</hi> among whom
<hi>they</hi> were, and all parts in the World
except <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>such Laws</hi> which were not
only fit for their <hi>Dukedom</hi> and <hi>small
Territory,</hi> but fit also for <hi>this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
which in those days was the
<hi>second</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> for <hi>Antiquity</hi> and
<hi>Worth,</hi> by <hi>confession</hi> of <hi>most Forreign
Historians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we will give <hi>credit</hi> to their <hi>own
Authors,</hi> this Point will be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evinced by them. These words
are in the <hi>Proem</hi> of the <hi>Custumary,</hi>
which is entituled <hi>Descriptio Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manniae.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The same is witnessed by <hi>Chronica
Chronicorum,</hi> That <hi>St. Edward,</hi> King
of <hi>England,</hi> gave the <hi>Laws</hi> to the
<hi>Normans,</hi> when he was long har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:54688:72"/>
And that he made both the <hi>Laws
of England</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> appears
sufficiently by the conformity of
them, for which he cites several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as of <hi>Appeals,</hi> and the
<hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>England, ad probandum
aliquid per credentiam duodecim ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum

               <p>
                  <hi>Polydore</hi> forgetting himself what
he wrote in another place, saith, of
King <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> that when
a Doubt was made upon the Proposal
of <hi>Marriage</hi> of his <hi>Daughter</hi> to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> that thereby <hi>England</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The King answered, <hi>No;</hi> and
that <hi>England,</hi> as the Greater, will
draw it to <hi>Scotland</hi> being the less,
and <hi>incorporate</hi> it to the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> as (saith the <hi>Historian</hi>)
it did <hi>Normandy,</hi> though the <hi>owner</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Roger Owen,</hi> in his <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi>

               <p>Some of them (and not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
mention the <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>some

<hi>some Norman Customs,</hi> effectual for
the <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>Peace.</hi>

               <p>There is yet behind the <hi>great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>
most insisted on, and often
urged by the Gentlemen of another
Opinion, which is the <hi>Title</hi> of
<hi>William,</hi> who is called the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;</hi>
from whence they conclude,
That by his <hi>Conquest</hi> he <hi>changed</hi> the

               </p>
               <p>To this is answered, That <hi>a posse

The Register of St. <hi>Albans, Matth.

them in his Forreign Wars, and the
Check given to him by the <hi>Kentish</hi>

               <p>

these <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Edward the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
are the same in part which are

               <p>One of the worthy Gentlemen,
from whom I differ in Opinion, was
pleased to say, That if <hi>William the
Conqueror</hi> did not <hi>introduce</hi> the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> into <hi>England,</hi>
yet he conceives <hi>our Laws</hi> to be
<hi>brought</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> hither, in the
time of some <hi>other</hi> of our <hi>Kings,</hi>
who had large Territories in <hi>France,</hi>
and brought in <hi>their Laws</hi> hither; else
he wonders how <hi>our Laws</hi> should
be in <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I shall endeavour to satisfy his
Wonder therein by and by; but,
first, with your leave, I shall offer to
you some <hi>Probabilities</hi> out of the
<hi>History,</hi> That the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
were by some of those Kings <hi>carried</hi>
into <hi>France,</hi> rather than the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>France brought</hi> hither.</p>
               <p>This is expresly affirmed by <hi>Paulus
Iovius,</hi> who writes, That when the
<hi>English</hi> Kings reigned in a <hi>great part</hi>
                  <pb n="cxxxvi" facs="tcp:54688:78"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> they <hi>taught</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
their <hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> Historian,
writes, That the <hi>Normans,</hi> in their
Manners, and <hi>Customs,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi>
followed the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in another place than before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
relates, That in our King <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.
Time, the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the <hi>Chief Men</hi> of all the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and delivered in
his Oration to them, the many <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
that the <hi>English</hi> afforded them,
especially in that the <hi>English</hi> gave to
them their <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Chronicle of <hi>Eltham, H.</hi> 5.
sent to <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> not only
Divines, but <hi>English</hi> Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
by the agreement at <hi>Troys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there is much more probability
that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were
<hi>introduced</hi> into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
than that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
or any other part of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="cxxxvii" facs="tcp:54688:78"/>
were <hi>introduced</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Normans</hi> had been <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> as they were
not; but their <hi>Duke</hi> was only a
<hi>Conqueror</hi> of <hi>Harold,</hi> and received
as <hi>Hereditary</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> yet
is it <hi>not</hi> probable they would have
<hi>changed</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> and have <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi>
theirs; because they did not
use to do so upon other <hi>Conquests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Normans conquered</hi> the Isles
of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey,</hi> yet <hi>altered
not</hi> their <hi>Laws,</hi> which in their local
Customs are like unto ours.</p>
               <p>The like they did in <hi>Sicily, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and <hi>Apulia,</hi> where they were
<hi>Conquerors;</hi> yet the <hi>Ancient Laws</hi>
of those Countries were continued.</p>
               <p>I hope, Mr. Speaker, I have, by
this time given some satisfaction to
the Worthy Gentlemen who differed
from me, that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
were <hi>not imposed</hi> upon us by the
<hi>Conqueror,</hi> nor <hi>brought</hi> over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> or
any <hi>other part</hi> of <hi>Fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I must now come to indeavour also
to satisfy the Wonder; If they were
<hi>not brought</hi> out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> or
some <hi>other part</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> how come
they then to be <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>French</hi>
Language!</p>
               <p>Sir, It is to me an Argument, That
because they are <hi>written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi>
therefore they were <hi>not brought</hi> in
by Duke <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman;</hi> for
the <hi>French</hi> Tongue was not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Duke <hi>William,</hi> and the
<hi>Normans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had not been then in Duke
<hi>William</hi>'s Time, past four <hi>descents</hi> in
that part of <hi>France;</hi> and it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that they, in so short a Time,
should lose their <hi>Native Tongue,</hi> and
take up, and use the Language of
another Countrey, which was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi>
by them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> came from <hi>Sweden,
Gothland, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi>
between whose Languages, and with
the <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> their Neighbours,
there is a great affinity; but between
these Languag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the <hi>French,</hi>
there is none at al.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxxxix" facs="tcp:54688:79"/>
                  <hi>Vlphilus</hi> holds, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Tongue came from the <hi>Goths. Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandus</hi>
saith, The <hi>Goth</hi>'s Tongue
came from the <hi>Dutch.</hi> All agree,
That between those Languages and
the <hi>French</hi> there is no affinity.</p>
               <p>It is so improbable, that Duke
<hi>William</hi> should cause our <hi>Laws</hi> to
be in <hi>French,</hi> that when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
them, (as <hi>Ingulphus</hi> testifies)
he commanded that they should be
used in the same Language they were
<hi>written</hi> (in <hi>English</hi>) to his Justices,
and gives the Reason, Lest by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
we should happen to break
them.</p>
               <p>But it hath been further objected,
If Duke <hi>William</hi> did <hi>not</hi> cause our
<hi>Laws</hi> to be <hi>written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> what
then should be the Reason, that the
<hi>Grand Custumary</hi> of his <hi>Norman
Laws</hi> were <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue?</p>
               <p>The Reason thereof is given, That
the <hi>Normans,</hi> being a Rough and
Martial People, had few Clerks
<pb n="cxl" facs="tcp:54688:80"/>
amongst them, but made use of those
<hi>French,</hi> amongst whom they then
lived, and whose Language they
then began to be acquainted with,
and to understand.</p>
               <p>But when they were in <hi>England,</hi>
they had not so much use of those
Clerks, and that Language, but more
of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And probably it might be, that
the <hi>Confessor</hi> had been so long in
<hi>France,</hi> that he was more Master of
that Language than the <hi>Normans,</hi>
and that the <hi>Normans</hi> understood
that Language better than the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
and thereupon the <hi>Custumary</hi>
was <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>But it doth not therefore follow
that Duke <hi>William</hi> must cause the
<hi>English Laws</hi> to be <hi>written</hi> in the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue: but it is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he might cause them to be
continued in their <hi>Native Idiom,</hi>
which was much <hi>nearer</hi> in affinity to
his own <hi>Northern</hi> Language than the
<hi>French</hi> was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxli" facs="tcp:54688:80"/>
That the <hi>French</hi> Tongue was <hi>not
introduced,</hi> as to our <hi>Laws</hi> and
other things, by Duke <hi>William</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> appears, in that the <hi>French</hi>
was in great use with us here, both
before, and some-time after his Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beda</hi> affirms, That in <hi>Anno</hi> 640,
it was the <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to
send their <hi>Daughters</hi> into the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> to be brought up
there; and that <hi>Ethelbert, Ethelwulf,

brought up by <hi>French</hi> Teachers,
used the <hi>French</hi> Hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxlii" facs="tcp:54688:81"/>
And he notes many <hi>Charters</hi> of
<hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi> written in the
<hi>French</hi> Hand, and some <hi>Saxon</hi> mixt
with it, as in the Book of <hi>Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Edward the Confesso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> by
reason of his long being in <hi>France,</hi>
was turned into the <hi>French</hi> Fashion,
and all <hi>England</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>William the first</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our <hi>Laws</hi> to be <hi>written</hi> in
the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, because most
Men understood it, and that there
be many of his <hi>Patents</hi> in the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Tongue.</p>
               <p>I suppose we may be satisfied,
that <hi>William the first</hi> did <hi>not</hi> cause
our <hi>Laws</hi> to be <hi>written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi>
though the <hi>French</hi> Language was
much in use here before his Time.</p>
               <p>And if he did <hi>not introduce</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Language into <hi>England,</hi> the
Argument falls, That because they
are <hi>written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> therefore
he <hi>brought</hi> them in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxliii" facs="tcp:54688:81"/>
But, Sir, I shall offer you some
Conjectures, how it came that our
<hi>Laws</hi> were <hi>Written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> which
I suppose might be begun in the Time
of our K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. who was a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
born, and had large Territories
and Relations in <hi>France,</hi> and with
<hi>French-men,</hi> of whom great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
came into <hi>England;</hi> and they
and the <hi>English</hi> matched, and lived
together, both here, and in some
parts of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it came to pass, (as <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Cambrensis</hi> notes) that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Tongue was in great use in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
and in other parts of <hi>France,</hi>
where the <hi>English-men</hi> were resident
and conversant; the like was, when
the <hi>French-men</hi> were so conversant
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mathew Westminster</hi> writes, That
he was in hazard of losing his Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because he understood not the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue: and that in King
<hi>Hen.</hi> 2. and King <hi>Stephen's</hi> Time,
who had large Dominions in
<hi>France;</hi> their Native Country, and
<pb n="cxliv" facs="tcp:54688:82"/>
the Number of <hi>French,</hi> and of
Matches with them, was so great,
that one could hardly know who was
<hi>French,</hi> and who <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gervasius Tilsberiensis</hi> observes the
same: And <hi>Brackland</hi> writes, That in
<hi>Rich.</hi> 1. Time, preaching in <hi>England,</hi>
was in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue. Probably
Pleading might be so likewise; and
in King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Time, <hi>French</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as the <hi>Mother</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>There are scarce any Deeds of our
Kings in <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. his
Time, the most are in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and
<hi>Ed.</hi> 2. their Time.</p>
               <p>That <hi>our Laws</hi> were <hi>pleaded</hi> and
<hi>written</hi> in <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. his
Time, appears by the <hi>Stat.</hi> 36. <hi>Edw.</hi>
3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. which recites the <hi>Mischief</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> being in <hi>French;</hi> and
enacts, That the <hi>Law</hi> shall <hi>thereafter</hi>
be <hi>pleaded</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>enrolled</hi> in
<hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one ground of the mistaken
Opinion of <hi>Lambard, Polydore;
Speed,</hi> and others, That Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
brought in hither both the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws</hi> and Language; which I
<pb n="cxlv" facs="tcp:54688:82"/>
apprehend to be fully answered, and
the contrary manifested by what I
have said before on this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polydore</hi>'s Mistake may appear the
more, when he asserts, that by the
<hi>Stat.</hi> 36. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Matters are to be
<hi>enrolled</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the express Words, that they
are to be <hi>enrolled</hi> in <hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of our <hi>Law-Books</hi> were
<hi>written</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi>
Invasion, as appears by the <hi>Ancient
Rolls</hi> of <hi>Mannors,</hi> and <hi>Court Barons,</hi>
and our Old Authors, <hi>Glanvill, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,
Tilsbury, Hengham, Fleta,</hi> the
<hi>Register,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Entries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Records at <hi>Westminster</hi> and
the <hi>Tower,</hi> and other Records yet
extant, are in <hi>Latin;</hi> and many Books
of our <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> were transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into <hi>English,</hi> about <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. his
Time.</p>
               <p>Most of our Statutes, from <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.
his Time, till about the middle of
<hi>Hen.</hi> 7. his Reign, are <hi>enrolled</hi> in
<pb n="cxlvi" facs="tcp:54688:83"/>
                  <hi>French,</hi> notwithstanding this <hi>Stat.</hi>
36. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. except the <hi>Stat.</hi> 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2.
&amp; some others in <hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 5. and <hi>H.</hi> 6. used to
write their Letters in <hi>French;</hi> and
some of our <hi>Pleadings</hi> are in
<hi>French,</hi> and in the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> to
our Time.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, our <hi>Law</hi> is, <hi>Lex non
Scripta,</hi> I mean our <hi>Common Law,</hi>
and our <hi>Statutes, Records,</hi> and
<hi>Books,</hi> which are <hi>written</hi> in <hi>French,</hi>
are no <hi>Argument</hi> that therefore the
<hi>Original</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> is from <hi>France:</hi>
but they were in being <hi>before</hi> any of
the <hi>French</hi> Language was in our
<hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortescue</hi> writes, That the <hi>English</hi>
kept their Accounts in <hi>French,</hi> yet
doubtless they had Accounts here,
and Revenues <hi>before</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was in use here.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> saith, That the
<hi>Conqueror</hi> taught the <hi>English</hi> the
<hi>Norman</hi> Terms of <hi>Hawking, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="cxlvii" facs="tcp:54688:83"/>
and <hi>Gaming,</hi> &amp;c. yet no doubt
but that these Recreations were in
use with us before his Time.</p>
               <p>And tho' Duke <hi>William</hi> or any
other of our Kings before, or after
his Time, did bring in the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue amongst us, yet that is <hi>no
Argument,</hi> that he or they did <hi>change,</hi>
or <hi>introduce</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
were here <hi>long before</hi>
those Times; and some of them,
when the <hi>French</hi> Tongue was so
much in use here, were <hi>translated,
written,</hi> and <hi>pleaded,</hi> and <hi>recorded,</hi>
in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, yet remained
the <hi>same Law</hi> still.</p>
               <p>And from the great use of the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue here, it was, That
the <hi>Reporters</hi> of our <hi>Law-Cases</hi>
and Judgments, which were in those
Times, did write their Reports in
<hi>French,</hi> which was the pure <hi>French</hi>
in that Time, tho' mixt with some
words of Art.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> were taken,
many of them, from the <hi>Saxon</hi>
                  <pb n="cxlviii" facs="tcp:54688:84"/>
Tongue, and may be seen by them
yet used; and the <hi>Reporters</hi> of later
Times, and our <hi>Students</hi> at this
day use to take their <hi>Notes</hi> in
<hi>French,</hi> following the <hi>Old Reports</hi>
which they had studied, and the <hi>Old
French,</hi> which, as in other Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
by time came to be varied.</p>
               <p>I shall not deny, but that some
<hi>Monks</hi> in elder Times, and some
<hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> might have a Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for their private Honour and
Profit, to keep up a <hi>Mystery,</hi> to
have as much as they could of our
<hi>Laws,</hi> to be in a kind of <hi>Mystery</hi>
to the <hi>Uulgar,</hi> to be the less under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by them: But the <hi>Councellors</hi>
at <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> can have no
advantage by it; but perhaps it
would be found, that the <hi>Law,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>English,</hi> and generally more
understood, yet not sufficiently, would
occasion the more Suits.</p>
               <p>And possibly there might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the like nature as to the
<hi>Court Hand;</hi> yet if the more <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Hands</hi> were used in our <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings,</hi>
                  <pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:54688:84"/>
they would be the more
subject to <hi>change;</hi> as the <hi>English,</hi>
and other Languages are, but not
the <hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely the <hi>French</hi> Tongue used in
our <hi>Reports</hi> and <hi>Law-Books,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
not to be so enviously decried.
as it is by <hi>Polydore, Aliot, Daniel,
Hottoman, Cowell,</hi> and other Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> if I have been
tedious, I humbly ask your pardon,
and have the more hopes to obtain
it from so many worthy <hi>English Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
when that which I have
said, was chiefly in vindication of
their own <hi>Native Laws,</hi> unto which
I hold my self the <hi>more obliged</hi> by the
<hi>Duty</hi> of my <hi>Profession;</hi> and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it an <hi>honour</hi> to me to be a
<hi>Lawyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Debate, and Matter of
the Act now before you, I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
no Opinion against it, nor do
I think it reasonable, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="cl" facs="tcp:54688:85"/>
should, by an Implicit Faith, depend
upon the knowledg of others, in
that which concerns them most of
all.</p>
               <p>It was the <hi>Romish</hi> Policy, to keep
them in <hi>Ignorance</hi> of Matters pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>Souls</hi> Health; let them
not be in <hi>Ignorance</hi> of Matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to their <hi>Bodies, Estates,</hi> and
all their <hi>worldly</hi> Comfort.</p>
               <p>It is not unreasonable, that the
<hi>Law</hi> should be in the Language
which may <hi>best</hi> be <hi>understood</hi> by
those, whose <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> are
<hi>subject</hi> to it, and are to be <hi>governed
by</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> read all the <hi>Laws</hi> openly
before the <hi>People</hi> in their <hi>Mother</hi>
Tongue: God directed him to write
it, and to expound it to the <hi>People</hi>
in their own <hi>Native</hi> Language, that
what concerned their <hi>Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and <hi>Estates,</hi> might be made
<hi>known</hi> unto them in their most <hi>perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations

               <p>The <hi>Laws</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> were

should be in <hi>English;</hi> and in

<hi>French</hi> and <hi>English;</hi> yet then the

were to <hi>proclaim</hi> them in

               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude with a Complaint
of what I have met with abroad,
from some <hi>Military</hi> Persons; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Scoffs</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> against
our <hi>Law,</hi> and Threats to take it

of those Weapons, which at one time or

them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Solid Arguments, strong Reasons

Confutation of any Error, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of different Judgments:
When the <hi>Emperor</hi> took a Bishop in

               <p>So may I say to those <hi>Gentlemen</hi>

740 Years agoe, <hi>infeoffed</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Middleton,</hi> of the

I give you this <hi>Charter,</hi> Sir, as a <hi>further Proof</hi> and
<hi>Evidence</hi> for me, in these <hi>Particulars,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>1. You may observe by these words, <hi>Consanguinitatis
haereditate Anglorum Basileus,</hi> that here King <hi>William</hi> made
an <hi>absolute disclaimer</hi> of <hi>Conquest,</hi> in the second Year of
his <hi>Reign,</hi> and only insisted on, (what he knew full well
was his <hi>surer hold,</hi>) his <hi>claim</hi> by <hi>Hereditary Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And this is so much the <hi>more considerable,</hi> as it was
done in his <hi>Great Council</hi> of Arch-bishops, Bishops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
Earls, &amp; <hi>Vniversorum</hi> procerum <hi>suorum,</hi> a word of

Right <hi>cannot be</hi> denied <hi>by any Man to the</hi> Lords.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>And that he</hi> confirmed <hi>(as the</hi> Custom <hi>of</hi> succeeding

yet these, and many more, are the direct Consequences
of those that endeavour to maintain and justify these

43.</note> But that the
<hi>English</hi> were <hi>neither</hi> to have <hi>Estates</hi> nor <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi>
left them: and therefore it could be

            <p>The Commons granted to the King,
That (<hi>pur la grant Affiance, Affection, and
Assurance</hi>) for the great Trust,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 16 R. 2. N. 8.</note> Affection,
and Assurance they had in the Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King, in his most excellent Knowledg, and
his most sage Discretion; and also for the great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they had for his Crown and the Kingdom (<hi>&amp; les
drots dicels</hi>) and the Rights thereof, (<hi>s' accorderant &amp;
assenterent</hi>) they agreed and assented, in <hi>full Parliament,</hi>
That the <hi>King,</hi> by <hi>good deliberation,</hi> and <hi>Assent</hi> of the
<hi>Lords</hi> of his <hi>Wise Council,</hi> might take the whole Matter,
touching the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Provisors,</hi> to him; and that he
should have <hi>full Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>modify</hi> the said
<hi>Statute</hi> against the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi>
               <pb n="clxiii" facs="tcp:54688:91"/>
by the <hi>Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Assent</hi> aforesaid, in such
manner as he should think best, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> of
his <hi>Crown,</hi> and of the <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi>
and to put the same in execution when done.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>(au proschein Parlement)</hi> at the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all the Matter aforesaid should be fully shewn <hi>(as
ditz Communes)</hi> to the said Commons; and the Reason
thereof is memorable, <hi>viz. (au sin quils purront alors
par bon avisement agreer, si Dieu plest, a y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the <hi>Commons</hi> then might, upon <hi>good advice,</hi> agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
if it should so please God.</p>
            <p>From all which it evidently appears;</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>no Law</hi> could be made in <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>'s
Time, or in <hi>any</hi> of his <hi>Progenitors,</hi> Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(which cannot but take in <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Assent</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That <hi>none</hi> of those <hi>Kings</hi> could <hi>abrogate</hi> or <hi>make
void</hi> such <hi>Laws,</hi> when <hi>made,</hi> without the <hi>like assent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That though the <hi>General Phrase, viz.</hi> That King
<hi>Richard</hi> should <hi>be</hi> and <hi>stand</hi> as <hi>free</hi> in his <hi>Regality, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>Dignity Royal</hi> in <hi>his</hi> Time, as <hi>any</hi> of his <hi>Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
were in <hi>Theirs;</hi> and that the <hi>King says,</hi> That the
<hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Requests</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> seemed <hi>honest</hi> and
<hi>reasonable</hi> to him, and therefore he gave his <hi>Royal Assent</hi>
to <hi>that Law:</hi> Yet <hi>neither</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> nor the <hi>Lords,</hi> could
ever believe, that it was <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>reasonable;</hi> or that it
was <hi>any part</hi> of the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi>
to <hi>change</hi> the <hi>whole Frame</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>English
Government,</hi> by <hi>altering</hi> and <hi>making Laws</hi> at <hi>Will;</hi> by
<hi>taking away</hi> the <hi>Subjects Possessions,</hi> and bestowing them
upon whomsoever he pleased; by destroying the <hi>ancient
Course</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and, in a word, by <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
all things <hi>topsy turvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="clxiv" facs="tcp:54688:92"/>
And thus we have the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Authority</hi> that can be <hi>given,</hi> against the <hi>Absurdity,</hi> as
well as <hi>falseness,</hi> of King <hi>William</hi>'s <hi>Absolute Conquest, viz.</hi>
a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all, I shall make bold to borrow the
words of that great Assertor of the Protestant Cause, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
