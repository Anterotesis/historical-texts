            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ILE tell you that we are here in a very deplorable condition, the miſery is ſo great that it is incredible: There dye many People every day, ſmall and great, with hunger and neceſſity. There is nothing heard Day and Night in the ſtreets but the groans of the Poor which cry out for hunger, and that they have eaten no Bread theſe three days, and are forced to ſeek in the filth thrown in the ſtreets ſuch naſty things as the Dogs will hardly eat. They go to the Butchers to fetch buckets of blood of Beeves and Sheep, which they boyl in Water without Salt, and when tis thickned they eat it for want of Bread, and what is more ſurpriſing, is, when any Horſe dies and the Skinner carries the Carcaſs to the place appointed for it, the poor People run after the Carrian more eagerly (without compariſon) than the Dogs, to take every one a piece to eat: and eight days ſince there dyed a Horſe, belonging to a Neighbour of of mine, of Rottenneſs and the Farcye: as ſoon as he was skinn'd he was taken away in the Court, ſo that he could not reſerve any for his Dogs.</p>
            <p>This paſſeth the thought and the imagination to ſee that a Kingdom (ſo abounding and rich as <hi>France</hi> was very lately, where you would ſay God was pleaſed to ſhed abroade his moſt precious Bleſſings, is now in ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a condition. It is viſible, that there appears an extraordinary Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, and that ſince he hath withdrawn his Light from amongſt us, for our Chaſtiſement he hath withdrawn his moſt precious favours. Its feared that in Summer there will happen ſome dangerous Sickneſs by the bad ſuſtenance and ſo many naſty things which the greateſt number of the People eat to ſuſtain their hunger and their life.</p>
            <p>And as if a bloody War were not enough, and a troubleſome one too, which occaſions great diſtractions every where, tis to be feared that it will draw after it the two other Plagues upon us for the crimes and the great number of ſins we have committed, which have provoked Heaven againſt Mortals; inſomuch that our cries and groans do not reach him to have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on us: and I muſt avow that we have deſerved it and condemn our ſelves in his holy Preſence: I aſſure you (my dear Couſin) that I live here a languiſhing life deprived of all ſpiritual food, and as for what is neceſſary for this Corporal life. We liv'd better heretofore for 400 Livers than we can now for 1000; which throws daily a great many People into extream want and neceſſity, and to ſell all they have to live and get Bread.</p>
